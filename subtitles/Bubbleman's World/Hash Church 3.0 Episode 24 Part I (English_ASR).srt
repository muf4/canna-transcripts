church and I'm looking forward to

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,000
talking a little bit about your website

24
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,840
and kind of talking about how you

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,040
started it and how it all kind of came

26
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,759
to be and just really uh much respect

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,960
for for what you've done you know it

28
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,438
seemed like a lot of the

29
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,919
websites I don't want to say fell off

30
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:18,039
but kind of fell off when cannabis

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,439
became more integraded into Twitter

32
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,439
Instagram Facebook and still they like

33
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:25,359
to play and shut down accounts but you

34
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,199
really pushed through with the chemistry

35
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,879
and kind of brought this group of people

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,000
that were still willing to stay together

37
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,920
I just didn't see it on IC mag I just

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,560
didn't see it on some of the other

39
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,560
websites that just some of the hardcore

40
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,640
stayed but to me the websites really

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,118
crumbled compared to what they once

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,239
were yeah absolutely um and you know

43
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:47,759
none of them had a focus on the Canabis

44
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,478
processing and that was you know those

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,438
two things between social media current

46
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,039
social media platforms being a terrible

47
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:55,839
repository for information you know

48
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,960
unsearchable you you got all this

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,560
information in the comments that you'll

50
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,599
never find again which that pushed me

51
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,079
right back into the forum mindset and I

52
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,438
started you know investigating all the

53
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,199
different cannabis forums and I realized

54
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:10,199
there's a huge gap there's no cannabis

55
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,598
processing form you know icy mag because

56
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,479
I came up up under Greywolf so I knew

57
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,439
all about IC mag but it's got one

58
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,679
subcategory for processing and that's it

59
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,479
there's no you know there's no

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,599
organization there there's no detailed

61
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,439
you know like like what we have on

62
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,919
future 4200 right now so I just saw a

63
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:27,479
giant hole and realized it was something

64
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,799
that we needed to do well it's

65
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,359
interesting that you would say that

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,040
because I remember

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,200
on overgrow back in the late 90s early

68
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,039
2000s I got on there it was breeder

69
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,639
Steve that was like come on to overgrow

70
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,000
you know I'm in the Shark Tank and I was

71
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,359
kind of like the Shark Tank what's the

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,959
Shark Tank little did I know that's

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,879
where all the trolls hung out and that

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,039
was like where people got into it but I

75
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,719
ended up into the main main room um and

76
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,878
I can't even remember what the main room

77
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,479
was uh welcome Dr Mark just talking

78
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,479
about overgrow right now and thank you

79
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,719
for introducing uh Dustin and bringing

80
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,399
him on to the show today I really

81
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,719
appreciate that

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,680
um but yeah overgrow overgrow just had

83
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:08,039
like a photo gallery and that's where

84
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,319
bog and Gypsy and myself and highgrade

85
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,479
and some other kind of key early people

86
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,878
were just posting these you know what we

87
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,039
did back then was we went and bought two

88
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:21,000
and $3,000 digital cameras uh they were

89
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,959
Sony cyers shots they were like 2.2

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,680
megapixels this was like

91
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,280
1999 and it was the beginning of digital

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,120
photography it was the beginning of

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,438
being able to actually take a pretty

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,640
decent shot it's funny to think that 2.2

95
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:37,280
megapixels was a big thing I definitely

96
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:40,518
paid over $2,000 for that camera just in

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,360
order to show hash porn and so that's

98
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,840
how I started my company on overgrow and

99
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,480
I would post all these pictures and this

100
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,920
one Forum in in the in on overgrow this

101
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,759
one folder that we all were posting in

102
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:57,479
was where everyone was and So eventually

103
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,199
shebang who started the website

104
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,598
contacted me and say Hey listen I want

105
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,280
to get you

106
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,560
a hash room and it was certainly it's

107
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,959
just like you were saying like

108
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,719
unsearchable one simple room not really

109
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,920
focusing on processing but keep in mind

110
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,560
this was really the beginning days to

111
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,439
where we would get to with your website

112
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,439
eventually and it was just like it was

113
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,439
kind of a LoveHate relationship I had

114
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,959
with it because I went from going into

115
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,439
this one room that had like 30,000

116
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:28,918
people in it into a room that nobody

117
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:31,240
knew existed and I it was up to me to

118
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,560
build up that room and bring other hash

119
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,439
makers it took years but then at the

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,959
same time all that great information how

121
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,560
are you going to search it how are you

122
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,918
going to like organize the information

123
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,319
and the data I mean honestly it's very

124
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:47,639
much like hash church for that matter

125
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:49,959
because hash church is unsearchable

126
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,079
there's gems on hash church and if ever

127
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:53,758
there's people that you know maybe have

128
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,038
no lives and just want to sit around and

129
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,879
watch 10,000 hours of hash Church boy is

130
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:01,439
there a value in picking out the Nuggets

131
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,959
that have been said on this show maybe

132
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,639
we'll learn a little bit about that

133
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,959
today from uh some of the things you

134
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,759
share about uh you know future 4200 how

135
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,799
it kind of came to be and uh you know

136
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,080
where it's where it's at

137
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,918
today yeah absolutely I just wanted to

138
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,719
give a shout out to Dr Mark thank you

139
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,240
for bringing me here and thank you for

140
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,880
all your contributions on the Forum and

141
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,160
everything you've done for for cannabis

142
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,439
so appreciate you yeah you know I'm not

143
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,439
on there enough because I realized the

144
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,800
other day as I was trying to scroll

145
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,000
through and catch up that so behind and

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,160
it moves a million miles an hour and

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,800
it's just it's so cool I mean yeah

148
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,120
there's a lot of tongue and cheek you

149
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,199
know kind of back and forth but I mean I

150
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,319
think when you weigh through there's

151
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,560
quite a bit of useful information and I

152
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,960
think again you feel an unmet need

153
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,360
that's out there which is and I think

154
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,519
hash church is different though Mark

155
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:02,160
it's kind like I think of hash church is

156
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:06,318
kind of like again reporting back in

157
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,280
between weeks of future 4200 which is

158
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,120
constantly happening you know it's kind

159
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:14,038
of like to me it's like 4200 is part of

160
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,079
the natural Continuum that there there's

161
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:19,719
this dialogue and dialogue is constantly

162
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:22,279
happening and it was just like so

163
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,400
fortunate that again that I actually

164
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:27,598
found a couple conversations there

165
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,560
because I think in my own education in

166
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:31,159
my own

167
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,959
self-exploration in trying to find out

168
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,960
what are the best methods and processes

169
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,000
you you know if you ever close your mind

170
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,519
to learning you you're you're missing

171
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,038
the ticket you know so just because I

172
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,318
have all those plaques on the the wall

173
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:46,918
there that doesn't mean that I know

174
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,039
everything and you know I go there all

175
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:51,839
the time and learn new stuff and you

176
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,360
know you think that oh my God what is

177
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,478
this guy doing on his phone it's mostly

178
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,360
42 hour learning learning catch it up

179
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:02,758
just catch it up dude I got plaques I

180
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,759
got my

181
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:07,879
plaqu yeah I mean so there's a whole we

182
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,199
got a whole lot of bases to cover here I

183
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,120
I completely agree with you we have this

184
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,840
it's there's this issue with the

185
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,560
internet right where people can act like

186
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,719
idiots with very little repercussion

187
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,199
and you know I thought we had this

188
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,879
figured out at the beginning but as a a

189
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,319
forum moderator administrator it's

190
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,280
impossible it's impossible to make

191
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,120
everybody happy so we've taken as hands

192
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:31,918
off an approach as possible possible and

193
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,399
it has its pros and has its cons right

194
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,038
like I spend a lot of time on other

195
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,359
technical forums like whether it be

196
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,719
carpentry or or working on my tractors

197
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,560
or in permaculture Yad ya and a lot more

198
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,479
of them or a lot of them are are a lot

199
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,680
more civil than than our Forum but our

200
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,158
form gets a lot more done a lot quicker

201
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,038
um so it it there's this give and take

202
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:53,719
and you're right this this form of

203
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:56,000
communication that we're in right now on

204
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,000
hash Church definitely works well as a

205
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,639
summary also we're looking at each other

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,158
face to face so we're much more polite

207
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,120
nobody's calling each other names

208
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:07,079
nobody's being a troll and that's a

209
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,038
that's a huge important thing um and you

210
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,800
know there's all these different sites

211
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,959
to the internet and I don't think you

212
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,000
can have platform that does it all it's

213
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,560
just not it doesn't work that way so

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,720
you're right being able to summarize

215
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,759
after a week of of nonsense with little

216
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,919
gyms in there that's that's golden um so

217
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,800
a and to talk about the formation a

218
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:29,839
little bit it it came out a necessity

219
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,360
like I said I I wasn't able to search

220
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,199
Instagram and and that came up because I

221
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,639
was working a consult job and the

222
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
customer asked me a question that I

223
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,000
didn't quite know but I knew that I had

224
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,440
read like a week or two previous on

225
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,519
Instagram I said give me a sec let me

226
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,120
see if I can find that little gem you

227
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,560
know 10 15 minutes later I gave up I was

228
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,879
like this impossible you can't search

229
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,319
this at all and I had the thought wow we

230
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,480
I wish there was a cannabis processing

231
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,800
Forum couple weeks looking like I said

232
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,800
there wasn't anything and I didn't have

233
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,439
the technical skills to start a forum so

234
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,399
I just kind of let the idea slide I said

235
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,560
well that would be great someday if

236
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,399
somebody did that about two weeks later

237
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:04,159
I was work in a booth with Cascade

238
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,919
Botanicals um sidco cat invited me she's

239
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,078
one of the original skunk Farmers I had

240
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:11,278
worked with her and JD and Joe Oaks at

241
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:13,799
farmold um Joe actually brought me on

242
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,679
board there I was working that Booth

243
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:19,399
with Cascade Katherine was there and her

244
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,559
son sidco was there and at the end of

245
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,440
the day he said hey man you should start

246
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,799
a forum for cannabis processing and we

247
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,720
hadn't talked or anything I said wow man

248
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,919
if that wasn't meant to be you know I

249
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,240
explained this whole story to him and I

250
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,439
said look don't have the technical

251
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,278
skills but I have a bunch of ideas on

252
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,519
how if you do the technical side we can

253
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,240
get this populated immediately and you

254
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,759
know how you said it took you a couple

255
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,399
years to get your new room rolling I

256
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,000
leveraged the power of Instagram to jump

257
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:51,000
start the form because we hit the ground

258
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,120
running um we did a couple giveaways I I

259
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,120
was in the process

260
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,360
of downloading every single piece of

261
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,720
scientific literature I could find on

262
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,360
cannabis using Li gen scub uh and then I

263
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,879
would format the titles and then I'd

264
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,159
categorize it and I called it the data

265
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,679
dump and I used the data dump as

266
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,639
incentive for people to come to the

267
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,319
Forum I put up a post I said look if you

268
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,879
repost this if you tag a couple of your

269
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,040
friends I'll give you the link to the

270
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,559
data dump with all of this information

271
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,919
and it just hyperlink people over to the

272
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,879
Forum and that's where we initially

273
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,679
stored it so right off the bat you know

274
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:27,320
we had multiple thousand members just

275
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:30,319
hit the ground running and I at the same

276
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,278
time I shared two different large scale

277
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,920
techniques that I had developed one of

278
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:38,200
them was bucket Tech it was you know if

279
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:40,319
you got a shed and a and a bunch of mid

280
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,800
to lowquality cannabis can you extract

281
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,760
the cannaboids for cheap and safe in

282
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:48,278
your backyard and you know at scale and

283
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,958
yeah you definitely can with ethanol and

284
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:51,919
buckets and a washing machine and uh so

285
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:54,119
we had the full write up SOP on that and

286
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,479
then at the same time i' had also

287
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:01,240
developed a technique for remediation of

288
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,120
michol from uh distillate and it was the

289
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,480
timing was such that California changed

290
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,159
its laws and all of a sudden all of the

291
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,039
distillate had to be pesticide free it

292
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,439
was an overnight decision so you had all

293
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,679
these companies with millions of dollars

294
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,160
of inventory laying around I convinced

295
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,479
one of them to let me come in they paid

296
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:19,078
for all the testing we figured it out

297
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,278
and my deal with them was reciprocos on

298
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,439
uh the IP I said look you can take the

299
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:23,879
IP do whatever you want I'm going to

300
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,320
take the IP and do whatever we want we

301
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:27,000
can't hold each other back we can't tell

302
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,800
each other what to do that's the deal

303
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,639
and they were stoked I gave them like

304
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,000
three days Head Start so they were able

305
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,639
to remediate all their stuff and sell it

306
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,480
into a market that was void of disate

307
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,399
and on my end I wrote it all up into an

308
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,879
so and it was the third uh you know

309
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,240
prize for coming to Future 4200 is this

310
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,240
is where the pesticide remediation sop

311
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,480
will be hosted for free forever so that

312
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,519
we can make more clean you know quality

313
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,320
products in you know throughout because

314
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,600
that kind of my underlying goal is what

315
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,120
year was that DUS like what what I'm

316
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,800
just trying to place that on the

317
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,399
calendar when was that you know I should

318
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,199
write these things things down but 2017

319
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,839
2018 I think

320
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,480
2017 yeah maybe 17 18 somewhere around

321
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,639
there okay so it was right when that

322
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,039
California red kicked in right yes

323
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:12,360
whenever that is yes so there's a hard

324
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,000
set date in the sand right there

325
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,159
whenever they changed that I'm sure you

326
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,120
could look that up right so immediately

327
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:22,159
you just had this huge audience because

328
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,278
there was this need oh my God I got to

329
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,000
remediate my distill how do I do that I

330
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:29,958
need an sop bam they go to Google they

331
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,759
find your thing and

332
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:35,919
they they know that here's a

333
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:38,439
resource when I have issues around

334
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:43,559
whatever that I can kind of constantly

335
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:46,760
go back to yep so that's a great story

336
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,759
man how's it going

337
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,199
Mike what's up Dustin good to see you

338
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:58,240
again yeah you too you

339
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:59,479
too hey Mike how are you good yeah no as

340
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,278
Dustin kind of mentioned there was a

341
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,800
couple states that were coming online

342
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:08,679
with and the requirements to test

343
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,679
pesticides and you know back when back

344
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:13,599
in many of the states were medical they

345
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:16,078
would test for the cannabinoids and some

346
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,920
some analytical labs would offered a

347
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:21,198
test for the terpenoids but very little

348
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:23,919
regulatory requirements were required by

349
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:26,838
the medical States so there was a kind

350
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:29,399
of unregulated industry right

351
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,279
and well the timing was such that some

352
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,679
of these Labs were now getting the mass

353
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,759
spectrometers that had the sensitivity

354
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,039
and the library to say oh my god look

355
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,000
what's in here there's a whole bunch of

356
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:43,559
crap in here and we could do Mass speec

357
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,519
matches in our library that we

358
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:48,679
unequivocally know here's this compound

359
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:52,159
here's this compound and here's this

360
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:54,958
compound so it was kind of like uh you

361
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,958
know both both things the regulation but

362
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,638
also the sophistication of the

363
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,518
analytical instrumentation and the

364
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,919
testing Labs allow these things to be

365
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,839
found and

366
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:10,039
Quantified and and so again going back

367
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:13,519
to to um you know the usefulness of 4200

368
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:15,439
as a for it's like well if you need to

369
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,159
understand about those techniques

370
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,040
sensitivity those techniques what kind

371
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:22,759
of techniques are out there I mean if

372
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:26,480
you know nothing about the field you can

373
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:29,320
do a deep dive on that form and get all

374
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,159
kinds of information right Dustin oh

375
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,600
yeah absolutely and it's like my fir

376
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,600
people

377
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,440
how on your your you know professional

378
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,639
training on the form go read through as

379
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,600
much of that as you can get through and

380
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:44,000
you have a huge jump start uh to you

381
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,560
know if you if you don't know anything

382
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,039
to I'm going to be I got a job making

383
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:53,159
hash in two weeks what do I do uh that

384
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:56,360
that's a great free resource for

385
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:58,838
you man isn't that a funny accurate

386
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,320
statement I I got a job making hash next

387
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,800
week and I don't know what to do it's

388
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,800
like well why the [ __ ] apply for the job

389
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:08,000
if you don't know what you're and it's

390
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,439
crazy to think yeah but you know I I

391
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,440
didn't know how to make pizza when I got

392
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,839
my first pizza making job right like

393
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,040
that most a lot of people don't know

394
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,839
what they're doing when they get their

395
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:18,519
job that that's that's kind of life

396
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,040
right so and and in a normal World you'd

397
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,959
be able to go and sweep the floor for a

398
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:23,838
buck an hour and Learn by experience you

399
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,479
know as an apprentice or whatever but in

400
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,920
the real world when a hash yeah and

401
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,440
that's how it should be that that's you

402
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,719
know

403
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,839
look the industry the industry has been

404
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,000
plucked clean I mean let's bit be real

405
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,000
the good on have already paid for

406
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,078
they're taken away so people are going

407
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,839
to fake the funk people are going to lie

408
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:44,799
what they they have to do but they do

409
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,560
this in everyday jobs all the time you

410
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,719
know early on I didn't know what I was

411
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,399
doing and I had to figure out things

412
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,600
there was no rule books on how to you

413
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,958
know run a dispensary or any of that so

414
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,720
you know we just grabbed it by the seat

415
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:59,278
of the pants so you know now there's

416
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,440
rules as we used to as we say before we

417
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,360
were building a plane while flying it

418
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,720
now you've got runways you've got

419
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,000
engines you can take off you can do all

420
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,920
these different things so plan it before

421
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,240
you start it and try to do as best as

422
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,879
you can but you know a lot of these

423
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,360
businesses and jobs are new so you know

424
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,679
getting in there and fitting in and

425
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,159
trying to figure it out is is a real

426
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:24,078
world so you know Dustin's not wrong no

427
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,278
I definitely agree at the same time I

428
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,318
got to say and shout out to all my techs

429
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:30,679
that we've trained over the last year at

430
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:33,078
embark these guys came in with very

431
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:36,120
little knowledge most of them and uh

432
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:38,239
they have learned to how you know if you

433
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,318
teach people the right way and the the

434
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,399
correct Sops and the the right Pathways

435
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:45,879
to the results that you're looking for

436
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,559
it's incredible how fast people can uh

437
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,439
can really kind of you know and I'm

438
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:52,039
talking mostly solventless right now but

439
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,759
I'm sure it will be the same when uh

440
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:56,078
when Mike starts training people on his

441
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,440
side of the lab so yeah it's uh it's

442
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,479
pretty awesome shout out to the new hash

443
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,079
makers that are coming on I definitely

444
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,078
remember the days where I knew nothing

445
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:07,119
thank God I got lucky and got to stand

446
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:10,119
on the shoulders of some pretty amazing

447
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,519
Giants Well people prefer people that

448
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,798
have little to no experience because

449
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:16,558
those who have experience will want to

450
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:19,519
do things their own way whereas those

451
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,558
that have Sops they will follow them to

452
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:24,000
a te which is what you need and have to

453
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:25,759
do so you know we all we're all about

454
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,480
breaking the rules but know the rules

455
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,038
before you break the rules is all I'm

456
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,839
saying you got to strike a certain

457
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:34,160
balance you know you have to be able to

458
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,439
do something unique and something

459
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,200
expressive that you could put your own

460
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,960
individual creativity into but you're

461
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,640
you're absolutely right you're probably

462
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,319
going to have to follow a set of Sops

463
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,240
that you may not think is the best way

464
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,200
of doing things but regulation and the

465
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,599
rest of your company requires you to do

466
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,798
it and it it becomes really terrible

467
00:17:54,599 --> 00:18:00,240
when you have belligerent employees that

468
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:02,599
think that they know how to to do it and

469
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,240
end up either uh wasting a whole bunch

470
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,319
of product or

471
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,720
contaminating a whole bunch of stuff and

472
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:12,798
then you have to go see that's why you

473
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,519
don't do that yeah that's the worst

474
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:18,319
yeah hey I want to welcome everyone else

down so la let me ask you guys a

507
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,759
question because I've never been there

508
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,640
but I did watch the movie um The Money

509
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,879
Tree I don't know if any of you have

510
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,679
ever seen the money tree but it's an

511
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,840
incredible movie and Buddy says he says

512
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,960
what's la like and he says oh la is like

513
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,359
a big submarine sandwich when you're

514
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,960
really really hungry uh and you start

515
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,719
eating it you're just starving but then

516
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,079
you realize there's like a big piece of

517
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,519
[ __ ] in the middle of the sandwich but

518
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,399
you're so hungry you just eat around it

519
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,279
is is that what La is

520
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,480
like yeah pretty much I've I've lived in

521
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,240
La you know I've also lived in the good

522
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,000
spots with Todd back when he was in

523
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,120
belir and stuff like that so I'm kind of

524
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,400
biased and having the nice places to

525
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,678
stay but I've been to there's lots of

526
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,080
shitty places around but you know it's

527
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,159
it's like Pockets you know it's like

528
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:33,879
anywhere elseu

529
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:36,679
are is surrounded by the bio with the

530
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,600
side and the ocean other there's more

531
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:42,320
[ __ ] than sandwich for sure oh [ __ ] for

532
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,918
sure I kind of

533
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,439
take all the neighborhoods in New York

534
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,080
City like East New York like the far

535
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,360
reaching corners of the Bronx and you

536
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,199
just put them in the middle of the city

537
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,479
that's kind of the deal with with with

538
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,279
LA and you can't cross the city without

539
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,240
going through those neighborhoods so it

540
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:04,240
will never ever really change without

541
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,038
that changing as well so then like the

542
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,880
nicer areas the nicer areas in which

543
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,079
atan was talking about I guess there's

544
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,799
more bread there because if you have

545
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:16,278
more bread in a [ __ ] sandwich you you

546
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:18,599
eat less [ __ ] is that how it works lots

547
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:20,480
of condiments lots of in the Bronx so

548
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:22,558
don't get me wrong

549
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,240
there yeah but you're talking about

550
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,798
Universal City Hollywood Beverly Hills

551
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,240
you're talking about some of the most

552
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:31,519
affluent

553
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,720
of the United States where they have

554
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,720
more

555
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,879
bread might even have a little cheese

556
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:42,640
over there you got a little Dough Spread

557
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,640
that [ __ ] a little

558
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,200
thin yeah so yeah it's pretty much [ __ ]

559
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,278
good to avoid San Francisco is also [ __ ]

560
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,200
there's Maps that'll tell you how much

561
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:55,079
[ __ ] and where it is to avoid it like

562
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,798
literally so it's gotten weird down

563
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:00,558
there but there's great places too don't

564
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:02,558
get me wrong it's just you know it's

565
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,599
it's it's it's a megalopolis so you've

566
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,399
got The Good the Bad and the Ugly and

567
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:08,678
you know there's more bad and ugly than

568
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,840
there are

569
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,000
good well I'm just going to hang out up

570
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:16,158
here in BC for a little while longer I

571
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,240
guess and uh enjoy my interactions

572
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,559
through the internet uh until uh well it

573
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,919
sounds like people are starting to make

574
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,278
trips it sounds like stuff is uh maybe

575
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,960
we'll be able to hug people here June

576
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:29,119
21st they said was some date that uh

577
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,720
they're going to make make some

578
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:34,319
Proclamation on whether or not Americans

579
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,000
can go back to Canada right is that

580
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,480
right June 21st has anyone else heard

581
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,880
that it's like in New York the juneth

582
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,919
where you uh you get the uh the Sun

583
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,559
Lines perfectly up with the Avenue so

584
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:48,000
you can get this incredible shot all the

585
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:51,558
way down or

586
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,519
view that's what's up

587
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:55,678
hinge so they'll let me come back to

588
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,278
Canada as long as I uh identify as

589
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,038
vaccinated right I think the way it goes

590
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:01,880
is I don't think we're doing that are we

591
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:05,440
you can't come

592
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:08,200
backy Canada curently requires a two we

593
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,960
quarantine that's five grand in a in a

594
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,159
hotel but I I believe that the they're

595
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,919
discussing it and if both sides of the

596
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,559
Border are starting to show her immunity

597
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,440
they they'll start looking at opening up

598
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:23,519
the border the big issue is is obviously

599
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,440
both countries want to minimize the risk

600
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:30,440
of variant transmission so what we

601
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,000
don't can we only can we only quarantine

602
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,080
in like $300 a night hotels is that what

603
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,759
they're saying

604
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,839
baller yeah I think it's the 14 day

605
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:44,038
minimum they test you on the first day

606
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:47,079
and test you on the 10th day but I I

607
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:49,558
believe if if there's a certain Target

608
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,960
if 70% of the population has their first

609
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:54,960
shot then they're going to probably

610
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,480
allow vaccinated people to cross the

611
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,200
border but it's you know as with any

612
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,599
anything there's many great plagues

613
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,840
throughout history were spread due to

614
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,000
travel but as long as you're you know

615
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,079
traveling in a Safe and Smart fashion

616
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,839
and not traveling when you're sick you

617
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,798
know there's minimal there's ways to

618
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,000
minimize that

619
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:17,480
risk and what I just got to show them my

620
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,480
little piece of

621
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,960
paper hopefully probably yeah probably

622
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,159
we'll see let's hope

623
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,880
not let's hope not although that little

624
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,520
piece of paper looks pretty easy to

625

California on June 15th but uh OSHA has

643
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,760
made us aware that even though the state

644
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,360
is opening up there will be no new

645
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:20,038
information for employees until July

646

650
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:31,798
think the 30th is the day they're going

651
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,439
to get rid of all covid restrictions on

652
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:34,960
the 30th of this month although they

653
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,840
said they're going to maintain the state

654
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,840
of emergency which gives the governor a

655
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:42,000
whole bunch of like extra Constitutional

656
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:44,839
Powers which is strange but currently

657
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,839
they lifted The Mask mandate um and

658
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:49,079
there's no more restrictions now some of

659
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,519
the denser populated like Seattle people

660
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,798
are still wearing masks and most of the

661
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:53,519
businesses are requiring masks where I

662
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:55,798
live out in rural Washington on the

663
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,440
coast no mask no restrictions life is

664
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:59,798
back to normal not that it ever really

665
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,440
left normal but it's actually like fully

666
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:05,720
normal the only thing I really want

667
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,640
people to do here is Hash so no masks

668
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,278
but hash you got to do hash man you

669
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,960
can't be coming on to Hash church not

670
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:14,278
doing hash so come

671
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,640
on we got our pipes here's a pipe

672
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:19,759
actually I think I might hit this little

673
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,799
crazy Ewok one this is fun right that is

674
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,599
nice little slurper yeah good good good

675
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:26,759
little slurper you know I've got my OG

676
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:29,439
slurper from JP and you can really see

677
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:32,158
the difference yeah in the length this

678
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,320
one really is much more like that uh

679
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,039
what do you call it there Mike the

680
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,759
rising film evaporator Style ah yeah

681
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:39,720
that's my first thought that the path

682
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,480
there is getting long get yeah that's

683
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,159
what they based it on for sure that

684
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,038
seems to be where they're going with it

685
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:47,480
you know let's create a longer thinner

686
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,398
tube not a wider shorter tube they need

687
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,319
a they need a vacuum jacket that little

688
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:52,319
part right there that'd be

689
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:57,759
sweet get it all jacketed up yeah so you

690
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,320
get your little marbles in there there's

691
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,798
three of them in

692
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:04,480
there and hit a little six-star looks

693
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:06,918
like Johnny be's torching up I was going

694
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,240
to ask Dustin just about uh some of the

695
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:14,000
controversy we hear about Delta 8 what's

696
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:16,120
going on on on that whole thread 42 man

697
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,798
it's pretty big pretty big and pretty

698
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:21,879
controversial topic and I just want

699
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,079
throw that out there for discussion okay

700
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,799
yeah I knew this when was coming I've

701
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:26,558
been thinking about it a lot and and

702
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,960
trying to follow along you know like I

703
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,879
think a lot of people assume that

704
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,600
I I'm like fully aware of everything

705
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,919
that goes on in the Forum impossible no

706
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:40,240
person that's impossible like I have a

707
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:43,360
light like I I okay so Delta eight

708
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,440
um we'll just start bunch of people are

709
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:47,558
making yeah let's start with let's start

710
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,720
with kind of how why people started talk

711
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:50,519
making it right okay we're gonna start

712
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,839
at the

713
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,640
beginning back in the day we were

714
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:56,319
running the short path making disl it it

715
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,480
was coming out orange yellow most of our

716
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,398
short paths were like cheap Chinese

717
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,919
glass you got on Amazon cuz nobody was

718
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:03,678
making it we were just piecing together

719
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,720
chemistry sets people were throwing all

720
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,080
sorts of crazy ideas out there one of

721
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,679
them which uh this is how Photon no

722
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:13,879
broke into the scene he said look if you

723
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,320
take um you know he sold this as an sop

724
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,240
but it's fully open now if you take an

725
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,759
activated bleaching clay which is just

726
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,440
like clay that's been acid washed or

727
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,079
certain types of silica like filter

728
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,840
Sands um all of these various Medias you

729
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,359
can throw them into the boiling flask

730
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:31,000
and the diso that comes out that would

731
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:33,119
be basically water clear not wrong is

732
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,200
great fantastic and this is before you

733
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,079
know we talked earlier about testing and

734
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,798
the ubiquity of testing and and the uh

735
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,199
how advanced these Labs were this is way

736
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:42,720
before any of that this is when the labs

737
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,919
were yeah testing canav oid content of

738
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:50,278
flowers May the test canabo content of

739
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:52,919
your your uh extracts in Washington is a

740
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,079
little better than other states but so

741
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,559
you throw these things in there makes

742
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,759
water clear but one thing we didn't know

743
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:58,119
because without the testing and when

744
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,038
you're just making a bunch of carts to

745
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:01,798
send off wherever you're not testing

746
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,798
every single bit what was happening is

747
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:05,558
you greatly reducing your Delta 9

748
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:07,679
content and you were also greatly

749
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:09,079
increasing bunch of other random Peaks

750
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,159
all over you're making like a dirty mess

751
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:15,158
of this lit um one of those Peaks we've

752
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,559
now realized 8 and this is something

753
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,240
that's been known for a long time but

754
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,599
the labs just finally caught up to what

755
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,278
you know these scientists had back in

756
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:26,240
the and 70s so we were making Delta

757
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:29,079
8 on accident making really nice looking

758
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,519
cards move forward quite a few years

759
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:33,720
we've refined the technique through

760
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,519
analytics back in we got really high

761
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,839
quality

762
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:41,278
da to get that last little Delta 9 out

763
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:43,359
and there's a bunch of really shady ways

764
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,159
you can make Delta 8 and and doing it

765
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,759
that way leaves the possibility of

766
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,840
having all sorts of nasties left in your

767
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:51,640
diset uh anywhere from like the the the

768
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:54,158
reagent that you used or the Catalyst

769
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,038
that you used is something dangerous or

770
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,200
radioactive or super toxic like and you

771
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,640
might have left that in there or it

772
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,120
could have also caused all sorts of

773
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,038
weird side reactions like we converted

774
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,759
the Delta KN into God knows what one of

775
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,599
those canabo that in the literature says

776
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:10,240
it killed the rats immediately like who

777
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:13,319
knows there there's all these weird [ __ ]

778
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,000
that could happen but that didn't stop

779
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:18,079
anybody and for years they did that and

780
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
sold it and as far as we know nobody

781
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,839
like died there's no chronic outbreak of

782
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,640
everybody died from this batch of disl

783
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,678
um now that doesn't mean that it's safe

784
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,360
who knows if those people are going to

785
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,960
get cancer and die in 30 years or not

786
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,558
you know we don't know about smoking

787
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,840
vape pens either like those might give

788
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,720
you cancer and kill you in 30 years too

789
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:39,480
point

790
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:41,440
is when a member ion trap said

791
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,640
everything out there is got dangerous

792
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,600
side compound cyclohexanes all these

793
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,799
different toxic things my testing has

794
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,678
showed this this and this and except for

795
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:52,359
this one lab I found this one random pen

796
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:54,080
that's safe and it's clean and all the

797
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:55,798
ones I tested in y y and everybody's

798
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,359
like wow this is crazy bunch of people

799
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:59,558
jumped on it bunch of people were like

800
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,519
well maybe that's a little

801
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:05,200
weird roll back a couple years a lab

802
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,638
that got involved with us um

803
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,278
KCA they have been active on the forum

804
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:11,398
for a long time they're out in Kentucky

805
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,880
they've been always upfront about

806
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:15,319
everything they're doing they they

807
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,240
sponsor competitions within us they talk

808
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:19,759
they they improve their procedures based

809
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,839
on what we say they hopped in and said

810
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,240
well that's that's interesting we want

811
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,839
to test a bunch of different samples we

812
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,599
want to see if that that's the case and

813
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:30,158
then it at the at the same time when

814
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:32,038
they start they crowdsource this big

815
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,240
funding or this big testing campaign and

816
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:35,158
they run through it and they get all

817
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,720
these random samples from all over the

818
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:39,639
place it comes out that ion trap is a

819
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,440
member of that company or works for that

820
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:42,798
company that was the one clean one and a

821
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,240
bunch of other people start asking

822
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,519
questions and it starts getting it turns

823
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,599
into this thousand long comment thread

824
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:51,919
of he said she said what's going on here

825
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:55,038
who's the scammer KCA comes back and

826
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,320
finds none of any of that in multiple

827
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,038
different you know all of them none of

828
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,918
them had those pu in it and they run

829
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:04,240
another round and same thing so

830
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,639
it it turns out that people are actually

831
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,599
aren't making super dangerous Delta 8

832
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:11,240
Delta 8 while still most of it is hot

833
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:12,319
with Delta 9 because it's a very

834
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,759
difficult process to get that last

835
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,519
little Delta 9

836
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,319
out we have yet to find a random sample

837
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,519
that has any of these super toxic

838
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:25,398
compounds now you can take like a

839
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:30,759
Palladium conversion um no that's CBN um

840
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:32,158
PTSA uh a fairly toxic acid um if you

841
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:34,200
left a bunch of that in there it would

842
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,240
be no bueno it' be pretty easy to

843
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,759
identify but people are not doing that

844
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:43,519
so you know we are seeing

845
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:45,879
pretty decent like uh woot grade

846
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,359
chemistry here on this Delta eight thing

847
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,120
um it's it's unfortunate that what's

848
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:52,599
happening on the regulatory side because

849
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:55,000
of the implication that it could be

850
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:56,678
unsafe or you know whatever it is that

851
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,359
our federal government has up its ass

852
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:03,038
about canabo is coming through on on d8

853
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:05,398
and not only does that ruin the

854
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,158
potential for d8 for its truly medicinal

855
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:10,439
value which is that it's strongly

856
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:14,399
anti-emetic it it's almost absolutely

857
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,519
anti-emetic um and uh that's super

858
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,879
important for children that are getting

859
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:20,480
chemotherapy right some the way that

860
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,600
people die when they're getting chemo a

861
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,399
lot of time is that they're not able to

862
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:26,879
feed themselves they're not able to hold

863
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:29,398
down nutrients and and with delta8 you

864
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,720
can completely eliminate that problem

865
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:32,719
and then the second problem with the

866
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,919
regulation that's coming about from this

867
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,720
fear campaign basically is that it

868
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:38,639
starts to affect all the other canabo

869
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,360
that have medicinal benefits we're

870
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:43,359
looking at now are we going to still be

871
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:46,319
able to make CBN because of the interim

872
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:47,439
d8 that perhaps gets made or our

873
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:49,119
conversion is going to be you know

874
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,639
they're synthetic chemistry of cannabis

875
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:55,719
and you can't do it anymore it's like so

876
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:58,678
this d8 thing is is a wild ride for

877
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,720
sure it just killed a bill alone in

878
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:04,038
Texas because they added Delta 8 to the

879
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,360
hemp Bill and I've Got Friends in Texas

880
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:07,440
who have been working on it and that

881
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,918
sank that one quicker than anything it

882
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,398
was the fastest torpedo so the

883
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:15,918
individual cannaboid um firing and

884
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:17,918
misfiring is going to be a problem it's

885
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,440
going to be a cannaboid whack-a-mole

886
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,480
situation until legalization in

887
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,918
compounds don't you think doctor scal

888
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,000
down yeah I mean I personally I don't

889
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:30,519
have a problem with the molecule itself

890
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,838
the molecules canono so it's safe

891
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:34,239
meaning that humans can take a lot of it

892
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:37,960
it's not going to shut down your

893
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:40,559
breathing you can't OD by taking Delta

894
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,119
eight but I guess you know whether those

895
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:46,279
results are real or not what it does

896
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,159
call for is production under some type

897
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,359
of regulated environment because it's no

898
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:55,079
longer an extract it's no longer well

899
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:58,000
it's kind of like hash or I no it's not

900
00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:01,039
like extracted anymore it's basically

901
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,199
the the the product of a chemical

902
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:06,480
reaction and a product of a chemical

903
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:08,279
reaction yeah as Dustin points out could

904
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,920
depending on how you run that chemical

905
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,400
reaction could have lot of different lot

906
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,680
of different products there uh Marcus

907
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,599
can you let me share my screen so we can

908
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,919
go through some literature I pulled up

909
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,119
here so we can talk about this

910
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,559
absolutely can I can I share my screen

911
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:27,160
so I do I hit the share screen thing I

912
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:29,719
think that's about that's it yeah that's

913
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,920
it okay all right okay let's see let's

914
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:33,598
do

915
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:37,559
screen and then select which which on

916
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,960
your P yeah youit okay all right okay

917
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:41,759
all right so what we're going to do is

918
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,079
we're going to go back to the michul and

919
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,240
literature you know this is great Dustin

920
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,760
because this is exactly what I had as a

921
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:53,118
as a PhD chemist I mean I had not

922
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,040
learned cannaboid chemistry academically

923
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,920
or in my graduate work or my postdoc

924
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:02,039
work I had to go and totally self

925
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,440
immerse myself into this literature and

926
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,358
here we find a paper from Rafi from uh

927
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,559
oh this is beautiful I think the title

928
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,880
of this paper is

929
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,039
hashish he's got like I think he's got

930
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,160
like four there's a series of like four

931
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:19,559
of these were just the chemistry of

932
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:21,199
hashish and look this is from 1966 I'll

933
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,920
bet you half of our viewing audience

934
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,838
wasn't even born yet right so so so look

935
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,559
at what look at what he describes here

936
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:30,559
so he describes

937
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,759
here this is like the first time that

938
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,759
I'm seeing this in the literature where

939
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:39,560
he shows the conversion of CBD right

940
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,240
here over into uh well here's Delta 8

941
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:44,000
he's got an arrow going to Delta eight

942
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:46,759
but he also has an arrow going to Delta

943
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,079
9 and so I think he recognized right

944
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:53,119
away is that you can use acid catalyzed

945
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,960
cyclisation chemistry to psych and

946
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,720
here's even something cooler for me look

947
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,800
what he did after he psychoed it he Hy

948
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:03,480
rated it and made hexahydro canabidol

949
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,200
this I think is one of the first reports

950
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,760
of hexa hydr canaban all here and you

951
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:11,919
can see it gives a both a mixture of

952
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,160
both up and down so this is from 1966

953
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,800
this is from earlier in the year later

954
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,440
that year when his when his article

955
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,119
published in the Journal of the American

956
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:24,599
Chemical Society he entitled it uh

957
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,640
concerning the isomerization of Delta 1

958
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,359
to

959
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:31,799
delta6 uh that's the old nomenclature

960
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:34,838
that would be Delta 9 to Delta 8 these

961
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:38,119
days by our by our nomenclature and what

962
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:41,599
you see here is that yes he does have a

963
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:45,480
procedure that uses things like sulfonic

964
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:49,440
acids to basically isomerize this which

965
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:52,838
is Delta 9 into Delta 8 because Delta 8

966
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,880
is more thermodynamically favored but

967
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:57,639
it's very interesting here because what

968
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,200
you also see is you can see

969
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:04,679
isomerization of other cannabinoids in

970
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:08,919
this case um this here is CBC and CBC

971
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:12,799
can isomerize over into this uh very

972
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:16,200
peculiar what's called isot THC and so

973
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,359
where ISO THC rears its ugly head this

974
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:22,239
is a a paper for much later so this is

975
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:25,400
from um this is called the chemical

976
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:30,399
aspects of of CBD I know this paper by

977
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:31,880
Heart by hanou and um and mulam and in

978
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,838
this paper he

979
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,519
describes what happens when you take CBD

980
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:41,000
and you treat it with acid yes you can

981
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:43,480
and mostly make uh Delta 8

982
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,280
THC uh but under certain acidic

983
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,760
conditions you can make other compounds

984
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:53,079
including this isomer of THC which is

985
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:55,800
called isot THC and in fact this uh

986
00:38:53,079 --> 00:39:00,440
group of Italians uh last year published

987
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:03,920
this wonderful uh paper on the uh

988
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,679
conversion canabidol of via acid

989
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,680
catalyzed intermolecular calization to

990
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:11,759
THC isomers and so what you could see

991
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:15,960
here is that yes they they talk about

992
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:19,200
you know conversion to to Delta 9 and

993
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:22,519
Delta 8 but they also show these two

994
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:25,559
other ISO isomers right which are are

995
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:28,519
formed in in in the reaction depending

996
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:30,159
on the condition so so depending on the

997
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:32,639
conditions that you use there's two

998
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:36,719
double bonds and there's two hydroxy

999
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:39,960
groups uh one pathway pathway a leads to

1000
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:43,480
these ISO products and pathway B leads

1001
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,240
to the normal uh products that you find

1002
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,920
in the plant which are the THC

1003
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:51,519
configured materials realizing that

1004
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,358
Delta 9 is first made and then under

1005
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:55,400
further acidic conditions you just see

1006
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,598
isomerization to the more

1007
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,639
thermodynamically favored this this is

1008
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,280
where the plant ends and the plant is

1009
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:05,519
able to do this chemistry because it's

1010
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,440
in a chyro enzymatic environment where

1011
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,079
these molecules are being made and

1012
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,960
expressed not in a in in a reaction

1013
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,839
flask but this gives you an idea so you

1014
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:20,199
start with CBD and again I think Dustin

1015
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:22,719
you pointed out because of the uh glut

1016
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:25,159
of CBD isolate on the market and the

1017
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:28,759
promise that this was going to be some

1018
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:32,480
big opportunity uh people can now take

1019
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:35,520
CBD and convert it into THC and put it

1020
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,679
into products that get people really

1021
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,119
high uh because they have THC isomer in

1022
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:42,239
it but what you could see here if you

1023
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,358
look at this table is that you get a

1024
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:47,118
plethora of different products in this

1025
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:49,559
reaction and even if you take their best

1026
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,920
result here their best result here is

1027
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:56,719
right here

1028
00:40:51,920 --> 00:41:00,599
93% um Delta 8 THC well my question is

1029
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:03,719
what what the other 7% in fact they

1030
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,359
they're quantifying the iso THC isomer

1031
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:10,759
so it's not the iso THC isomers in this

1032
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:12,880
case there's just 7% other stuff so you

1033
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,520
have to assume that in that case they're

1034
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,880
actually doing some kind of

1035
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:20,559
chromatography to clean it out to turn

1036
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:24,400
that 93 into something like 98 or

1037
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:26,880
99% plus so you only have a very limited

1038
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,160
amount of what the unknown material is

1039
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:35,280
at so if people can

1040
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:38,358
make Delta a a canabo that

1041
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,119
pure using that that as another as

1042
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:44,000
Marcus would say another arrow in the

1043
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,039
quiver of being another canabo that we

1044
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,679
can make but look at the reaction

1045
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:51,639
conditions here they're using a LS acid

1046
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:55,358
called TMS triflate that's

1047
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:58,078
trimethyl triflate oh man that's not

1048
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:00,679
only a really nasty Lis acid that you

1049
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,560
can't use at larger scale that's

1050
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:05,838
something that's prohibitively expensive

1051
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:07,920
and you would never use this in a

1052
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,639
commercial process you would try to get

1053
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,159
away with some cheap acid like sulfuric

1054
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:15,358
or some acid that you can just throw

1055
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:18,118
away and not have to recover but you

1056
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:22,239
would and D chloromethane A chlorinated

1057
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:24,358
solvent at minus10 no [ __ ] way right

1058
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:27,199
so when when you look at that you could

1059
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:30,239
find a process by which you can make a

1060
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,519
pure canono but the wonderful thing

1061
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:35,639
about this for for researchers like

1062
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:37,599
myself is that they're forced to publish

1063
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:39,838
in peer-reviewed literature where they

1064
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,318
have to show their data and let me just

1065
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:46,279
show you one one quick thing so y all Lo

1066
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:48,039
know that I love NMR NMR is nuclear

1067
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,040
magnetic resonance and what you're

1068
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:53,318
looking at right here is the proton

1069
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:56,679
Spectrum for

1070
00:42:53,318 --> 00:43:00,279
purified um Delta 9 THC so this is

1071
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:02,759
what's great about 4200 and hash church

1072
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,400
and the literature is that you know as

1073
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,520
cannaboid scientists we do have a

1074
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,119
crystal

1075
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:11,159
ball and it's called the literature and

1076
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,960
we could look into the literature and

1077
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:17,558
find things like this so this is great

1078
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,400
for me because I can look at my Spectra

1079
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:22,160
and I could compare it to this like a

1080
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,760
fingerprint and see like how clean

1081
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:26,759
something is or how unclean something is

1082
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,559
and what I want to show you here is that

1083
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,280
so this is the proton spectrum and this

1084
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:36,400
peak right here this one right here at

1085
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:39,319
about 6.3 corresponds to the vinic

1086
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,200
proton that's right here when you

1087
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:47,880
isomerize Delta 9 over into Delta 8 that

1088
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:51,279
proton shifts about uh okay here it is

1089
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:54,880
right here it shifts from 6.3 it was

1090
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:59,680
over here to about

1091
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:02,480
5.5.4 so I can use NMR as a diagnostic

1092
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:05,440
tool to say do I have Delta 8 do I have

1093
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,358
Delta 9 just like you can use just like

1094
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,679
you can use hlc but what's even more

1095
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:12,598
important is like when you look at hlc

1096
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,039
especially if you have the sensitivity

1097
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:17,760
of like a mass spectrometer you could

1098
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:19,400
find all of these Trace compounds and I

1099
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,440
want to just point out one more paper

1100
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,358
from michul because I love this paper uh

1101
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,760
in this paper what he was doing was he

1102
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:31,199
was actually using a a petric oxidation

1103
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:35,800
to make CBN you know a lot of people are

1104
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:38,399
interested in CBN he was using a diano

1105
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,480
dichloro quinone which is a really nasty

1106
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:45,920
oxidant reagent to basically convert

1107
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:49,039
Delta 9 THC into CBN but um I love what

1108
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:52,240
he says about the reaction and and you

1109
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:55,039
could just picture rafy saying this

1110
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:56,679
because he's such a such a humble guy

1111
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,440
where is it I'm looking for the quote

1112
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:02,078
exactly L but um he basically says that

1113
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,318
well you can't you can't use this method

1114
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,920
because it's a really it's a really

1115
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,159
toxic method and the reason why I wanted

1116
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,200
to point that out is because again what

1117
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,679
you'll see on 4200 and you'll see on

1118
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:15,159
other forums is that oh there's a

1119
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:16,919
literature method to make this there's a

1120
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:19,239
literature method to make this what they

1121
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:23,039
don't realize is that these literature

1122
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:27,399
methods are not production

1123
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:30,599
processes to make Pharmaceutical typ

1124
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:33,440
compounds for human ingestion these are

1125
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:36,599
to make little amounts of milligrams of

1126
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,280
stuff to put it into testing in mice and

1127
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:42,200
other other types of pharmaceutical type

1128
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,480
testing before it's actually developed

1129
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:46,919
and I think the good thing about 4200

1130
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,240
when I see it is that there are a lot of

1131
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,159
people who are chiming in and I could

1132
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:54,558
tell just from Iron

1133
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:56,358
traps what he's what he's posting is

1134
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,400
well the guy is really knowledgeable

1135
00:45:56,358 --> 00:46:01,519
he's in been in canabo science for a

1136
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,240
long time so I like having a dialogue

1137
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:06,960
with someone like that but yeah does he

1138
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,759
have a dog in the fight you start

1139
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,119
reading through that thread and you're

1140
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:14,920
like well there is a clean compliant way

1141
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,400
in fact Dustin am I right that's the

1142
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,720
title of the

1143
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,480
thread the title of the thread is a

1144
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:24,159
clean compliant way to make Delta eight

1145
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,639
so the guy kind of has a dog in a fight

1146
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:29,279
I don't have a dog in this fight so but

1147
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:32,799
you know I do agree with him that it's

1148
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:35,200
bogus that people who are flying below

1149
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,240
regulation who aren't regulated in this

1150
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:40,838
industry are basically selling a

1151
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:44,919
chemical reaction product that's no

1152
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:46,838
longer a canabo extract and whose safety

1153
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,079
could you know whether those things are

1154
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:51,440
in there and not Dustin I think the

1155
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:55,039
discussion that we're having right now

1156
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:58,000
is more important to make sure that you

1157
00:46:55,039 --> 00:47:00,239
don't just say Okay Delta a sucks Delta

1158
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,239
8 has to be regulated like Delta 9

1159
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,199
unfortunately now if they knock it off

1160
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:06,719
the controlled dangerous substance act I

1161
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:09,838
mean that's one of the biggest problems

1162
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:12,159
with Delta 8 is it's mentioned by name

1163
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:15,159
in the control dangerous substance act

1164
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:18,759
under code 7370 as a Tetra hydroc

1165
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:20,879
canaban and the [ __ ] story it it that

1166
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:24,440
that puts it outside the provisions of

1167
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:27,599
the farm bill in in my non-legal sense

1168
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,119
but you know well

1169
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,640
the government really just put its foot

1170
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,160
in it I'm gonna get a drink of water

1171
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:36,159
I'll be right

1172
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:38,879
back um on that whole deal by P on one

1173
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:41,159
hand they passed off regulation of hemp

1174
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,039
over and that set this precedent and

1175
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:46,679
then within that says and all analogues

1176
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:49,239
of uh within the hemp bill says that of

1177
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:53,159
CBD and if since I can get to d8 from

1178
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:55,679
CBD that's why it it's been allowed and

1179
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:59,279
spread so wide because there is a legal

1180
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:01,759
discrepancy in in Delta a up until now

1181
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,599
that states are giving specific

1182
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,000
exclusions to da um but not not the

1183
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:08,800
federal government though the states are

1184
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,760
making these decisions which is within

1185
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:15,720
the rights of of of a state for sure I

1186
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,839
isn't it true that that uh people have

1187
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:21,159
been

1188
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:25,358
extracting uh THC and CBD from uh more

1189
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:28,879
hempy type products but then they either

1190
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:32,880
separate the THC or they concentrate it

1191
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,720
so that instead of being 3% it's more

1192
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,838
like you know three or four or five or

1193
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:40,039
10 or

1194
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:43,119
20

1195
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:45,960
andal under the Farm

1196
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,039
Act no that's absolutely that's illegal

1197
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:52,240
so this this distillate before

1198
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:55,880
remediated had about 4% by weight perc

1199
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:58,439
THC in it now it has no measurable

1200
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,318
amount of THC in it because it's gone

1201
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,480
through a process called remediation

1202
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:05,880
which is a non-chromatographic process

1203
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:10,000
where they used heat to basically

1204
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:11,838
convert the THC over to CBN and at some

1205
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,920
point you know it's so funny not I

1206
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:17,880
wouldn't say it's funny but everyone was

1207
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,960
like oh man CBN man like like there's

1208
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,079
there there's actually genu genuine

1209
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,798
interest in CBN because CBN does have a

1210
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:26,760
lot of interesting properties everyone

1211
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:29,280
always thinks it's the sleep can avonoid

1212
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,280
but I could only find there's like one

1213
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,200
study in the literature and it's like 20

1214
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:38,240
years old uh yeah so that's Crystal and

1215
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:41,879
CBN so so most of the conventional

1216
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:44,399
knowledge Sam was that CBN was just some

1217
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:48,559
dark tar stuff but no it's the white

1218
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,559
crystal and solid as you know

1219
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:56,879
first absolutely right right and and the

1220
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:59,159
uh other thing I yeah so he's showing so

1221
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,280
who's making that that isolate right

1222
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:04,199
there

1223
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,720
Dustin you're

1224
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:08,399
muted uh we make this one at Future

1225
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:11,358
compounds which is our kind of

1226
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,358
compounding lab in

1227
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:19,838
Vegas that's CBN is you you held up

1228
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:23,639
several tubes one was dark colored which

1229
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:28,318
one was that this is this is the CBN

1230
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:29,519
distl um and so this one okay get it yep

1231
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:32,440
so this is like right after the

1232
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:34,679
conversion it's still a diset it has not

1233
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,440
been washed yet either we do several

1234
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:39,199
liquid to liquid separations throughout

1235
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,280
the process to you know add or extract

1236
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:44,078
various you know the Rea what's the

1237
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,359
percentage at that point of CBN Purity

1238
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,359
in the

1239
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:52,039
distillate I don't know I couldn't tell

1240
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:56,318
you it's only teared I'm not involved

1241
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:59,400
white stuff is easy to say 98 99% pure I

1242
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:02,440
mean 99 plus yeah white and crystalin

1243
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:07,358
like that do you have

1244
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:11,039
CBC not in B currently um or

1245
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:15,598
cbca definitely not not yet so Sam are

1246
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:19,519
is CBC also a white solid yes you can if

1247
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:21,519
you get it cbca I believe was I don't

1248
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,400
remember with

1249
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:26,880
CBC

1250
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:29,400
okay yeah I don't think there is CBC I

1251
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,880
it out there is

1252
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:35,480
there I don't think anything

1253
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,720
possible he's not wrong have the

1254
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,119
genetics caught up yet genetics or

1255
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:42,598
synthesis that's how you're going to get

1256
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:45,280
it right right I mean the cheap way is

1257
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:48,119
with genetics once you've got a variety

1258
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,960
that produces CBD if you don't have a

1259
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:54,000
THC problem with it then uh it just gets

1260
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:57,159
mass produced mass produced mass

1261
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,239
produced until you know the bubble

1262
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:01,239
pops right well I thought we were

1263
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:03,399
talking about this at last hash Church

1264
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:07,879
there is some tech that talked about

1265
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:12,280
conversion of CBD to

1266
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:15,000
CBC no Mark I think it's CBG over to

1267
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:20,240
CBC

1268
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:24,079
uh uh okay um well you know me I'm just

1269
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:28,399
a simple pla guy but chemistry I leave

1270
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,400
smarter folks like you folks

1271
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,519
yeah well I mean it's not necessarily uh

1272
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:38,039
smarter but you

1273
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:40,358
know it's it's a little more detailed I

1274
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:41,960
mean the cool thing is again so Dustin

1275
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:44,199
was this some of the literature that you

1276
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,480
kind of started with here the michul

1277
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:50,000
stuff or where did you when you started

1278
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:53,079
your your Deep dive where did you begin

1279
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,039
oh just in general yeah uh go well so

1280
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:56,920
first Google Scholar and then of course

1281
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,480
if you spend any time over there you're

1282
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,838
going to come up with a bunch of mhom

1283
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:05,559
and then um I also purchased a book I

1284
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:08,880
was at a bookstore in Seattle and it is

1285
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:12,760
the um it's an annals of the New York

1286
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:14,798
Academy of Sciences volume 191 issue1 uh

1287
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:18,359
marijuana chemistry pharmacology and

1288
00:53:14,798 --> 00:53:21,440
patterns of social use uh December 1971

1289
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:22,679
and it was there in it was the last time

1290
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,240
that they were going to meet and talk

1291
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:26,919
about uh cannabis they were all shutting

1292
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:28,439
down all of their cannabis research

1293
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,798
because the government was no longer you

1294
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,079
know that's when everything changed and

1295
00:53:29,798 --> 00:53:33,358
they weren't allowed to do you know

1296
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:34,839
research anymore and so it was like just

1297
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:36,078
a dump of everything they had and we're

1298
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:37,519
like look we're we're getting rid of

1299
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,880
this we're moving on to other things so

1300
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,920
here's everything that we know and what

1301
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,720
some of the things that I found really

1302
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,000
interesting in there was they had they

1303
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,558
had made every single different kind of

1304
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,559
canabo they could theoretically come up

1305
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:48,000
with right they were throwing random

1306
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,680
[ __ ] at it oh here's all these new ones

1307
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,280
we isolated it down and then they were

1308
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:54,519
taking that and feeding it to like dogs

1309
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,680
and uh feeding it injecting it smoking

1310
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:58,318
them in a little box dogs and rats and

1311
00:53:56,679 --> 00:54:00,159
monkeys and all sorts of stuff and some

1312
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:03,960
of the canabo that they listed in this

1313
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:05,598
book are wild and just killed killed the

1314
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,318
animals dead no problem like oh they're

1315
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,280
dead you can definitely overdose on that

1316
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:12,920
one so that and at that time we were

1317
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,599
doing pretty large scale like this

1318
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,400
bucket Tech backyard ethanol and then

1319
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:21,240
doing a crew you know to crude and then

1320
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,960
distillation and we just started getting

1321
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:25,598
bons you know throw the bleaching clay

1322
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,639
into the boiling flask and it right

1323
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,519
there when I read that I was like oh

1324
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:29,960
[ __ ] what if I'm making something that's

1325
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:32,679
going to kill all these dumb

1326
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:35,519
monkeys like uh that's not going to be

1327
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:37,719
good so I I went make it makes sense

1328
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,159
because again when you treat these

1329
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:43,318
things with acid I mean THC in the Delta

1330
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:45,798
9 configuration is only metastable and

1331
00:54:43,318 --> 00:54:47,159
and converting over to Delta 8 you know

1332
00:54:45,798 --> 00:54:50,239
people were always under this

1333
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:53,199
misconception that delta8 is made in the

1334
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:55,879
plant it's not made in a plant the

1335
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:58,679
biosynthetic pathway ends at Delta 9

1336
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:01,519
configur cannaboids and any conversion

1337
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:03,960
over to Delta 8 is just adventitious

1338
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:06,358
from humans [ __ ] with it right so

1339
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:09,000
it's kind of like you you get to the

1340
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:11,798
point where well okay so what that means

1341
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,239
is over the Millennia and humans using

1342
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:18,159
cannabis people have consumed Delta 8

1343
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:20,558
Delta 8 is a minor canabo that's part of

1344
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:23,279
that Gish yeah it's a degradation

1345
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:28,680
component but so are all those

1346
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:33,559
hydroxy um uh canabo that El soy keeps

1347
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:33,558
finding on his moldy weed you know

1348
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:39,519
so um so all those degradation

1349
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,559
components are they really GNA you know

1350
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,358
get you if you look at it actually it's

1351
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:45,839
interesting so if you look at those

1352
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,960
those elol Hydrox lated intermediates

1353
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:50,519
they're all

1354
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:53,720
hydroxylated which by the way is a a h

1355
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:57,000
of biological degradation oxidation

1356
00:55:53,719 --> 00:56:00,279
they're all hydroxy in and around

1357
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,400
that cyclohexane ring right because it's

1358
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:06,839
trying to turn turn The Thing into

1359
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,079
biofood or whatever but ultimately all

1360
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:09,759
those things are going to thermally

1361
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:13,480
eliminate to give

1362
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,960
CBN so so like you could smoke

1363
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,838
University of Mississippi's moldy weed

1364
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,760
with those hydroxy things but what

1365
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:22,480
you're going to get when you inhale that

1366
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,079
is CBN because at nail temperature those

1367
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,119
things are all going to thermally

1368
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:31,359
dehydrate and make CBN so there's I

1369
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:34,480
always I always said that CBN got me

1370
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:36,719
loaded but it didn't get me high yeah

1371
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,440
there you go right exactly loaded but

1372
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:41,798
not high that's a good way to describe

1373
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:44,358
it but like Sam when those guys were

1374
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:46,960
discovering these new canabo and saying

1375
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:50,279
oh look at all these it's funny that

1376
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,679
those are only found on the canabo or on

1377
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,160
the Cannabis that they grow down at the

1378
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:57,399
University of Mississippi so and that

1379
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:58,960
just changed right um that just opened

1380
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,920
up they just gave out multiple more

1381
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,720
licenses did Dr Sue get one they did I I

1382
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,400
I don't know I hadn't been following

1383
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:09,480
that close enough maybe 18 it changed

1384
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,440
like a week ago um the guy was on Joe

1385
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,440
the the founder of maps was on Joe Rogan

1386
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,000
and he was talking about it as well uh

1387
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,200
he got his license that they applied for

1388
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,358
in like 2001 Dr Sue is is one of those

1389
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:25,118
that that is top of the

1390
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:26,838
list fantastic yeah I mean I think um I

1391
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,798
think it was Sue who kind of blew the

1392
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:32,558
whistle on the fact that a lot of that

1393
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:35,038
cannabis was mold she sued them she

1394
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:37,200
she it caused a lot of controversy

1395
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:38,960
because you know uh people thought oh

1396
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:41,639
government weed must be fine but as we

1397
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,280
know because I tested it back in what

1398
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:48,639
09

1399
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:51,359
2010 my point more my my point more more

1400
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:54,400
eloquently made is that even when the

1401
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:57,558
stuff goes moldy those compounds are

1402
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,838
just fine and safe for humans

1403
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:02,200
stable yeah who was the guy who got the

1404
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:04,119
can of joints every day or whatever was

1405
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:07,118
his

1406
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:09,160
name was patient one but currently uh

1407
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,640
there's one

1408
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:14,440
patient out of Florida right so I mean

1409
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:17,000
there's people who smoke that weed like

1410
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:19,039
it's no tomorrow right and and dude he

1411
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,960
was loving it we we had a whole

1412
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:24,200
conversation with him and it actually

1413
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:26,519
made me think a lot because of course

1414
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:27,919
you know this is back when Todd was on

1415
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:29,280
the show we're all like dude we got to

1416
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,000
get you better weed we're going to

1417
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,680
figure this out like you need better

1418
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,400
weed and he was like listen guys this

1419
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:38,440
weed is perfect for me like it's just I

1420
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,160
I really quite enjoy it and we were all

1421
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,880
just

1422
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:46,879
like I I had a similar discussion with

1423
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:50,960
Robert Randall when he was still alive

1424
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:53,680
and uh I said well you know if marijuana

1425
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,838
has all this great you know benefits for

1426
00:58:53,679 --> 00:59:00,919
gloma for you then

1427
00:58:56,838 --> 00:59:02,880
uh wouldn't hashish be even better and

1428
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,159
he he actually looked at me straight in

1429
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,519
the face and says hashish doesn't have

1430
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:10,879
medical benefit and uh I was quite

1431
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:13,440
shocked and quite surprised and didn't

1432
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:16,280
really want to argue with him but uh

1433
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,880
yeah that was his personal belief you

1434
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,960
got to understand they have to sort of

1435
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,039
be Representatives since they received

1436
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,599
medicine they can't necessarily go out

1437
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:27,000
and uh [ __ ] on it completely you know

1438
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:29,318
what I'm saying I think no I mean Robert

1439
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
he's the one who stepped no no no Robert

1440
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:32,440
I'm just talking in Irvin Spence because

1441
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,920
I've had multiple

1442
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,559
conversations specifically I'm not

1443
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,440
talking Robert Robert rest in peace but

1444
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:42,640
uh although we we do uh work with Alice

1445
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,400
uh she's been assisting US veterans in

1446
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:49,038
all of our different filings and uh

1447
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:50,920
keeping us up to dat so you know uh yeah

1448
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:54,280
his the 20th anniversary of his death

1449
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,920
just uh passed on the second so rest in

1450
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:59,720
peace Robert [ __ ] [ __ ] really hit the

1451
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:03,400
fan okay so he got it and I think eight

1452
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:06,159
or 10 or whatever other compassionate uh

1453
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:09,000
programs were available for cannabis uh

1454
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:11,519
from the government but then he showed

1455
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,760
the AIDS Community how to apply and

1456
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:16,119
there were like 1,000 applications and

1457
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,200
the Government Federal Government

1458
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:20,760
stopped the compassionate program

1459
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:23,798
altogether but it grandmothered those

1460
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:26,480
eight or whatever it was into the

1461
01:00:23,798 --> 01:00:29,400
program for life

1462
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,400
and now it's down to

1463
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:40,240
one hey Mark um that link I just posted

1464
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:44,399
into the chat is um mesom 68 uh chloral

1465
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:48,759
dehydr or dehydron of cannaboids total

1466
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:51,079
synthesis of canb chrom so it's he did

1467
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,400
he did CBC and it looks like I think he

1468
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:57,119
starts it from THC and then he goes from

1469
01:00:53,400 --> 01:01:01,440
THC to CBN and then from CBN to CBC I

1470
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:03,079
believe yeah his his his um I I I've

1471
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,079
read every one of his papers I'll have

1472
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:07,680
to admit um I've read several of his

1473
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:09,720
papers several times sometimes I go back

1474
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:13,519
and I read them again just read them

1475
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:15,439
again um I I read his paper so much I

1476
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:18,440
could hear him

1477
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:21,079
speaking as he's as he's writing these

1478
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:23,280
things and it's just the connection that

1479
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:26,798
we have with the chemical literature

1480
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:29,400
which is just fantastic and and I think

1481
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:33,199
like what I always sensed from hash

1482
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:35,519
Church like in the early days when when

1483
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:36,838
uh Horatio said hey Mark you gotta come

1484
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:39,759
on

1485
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:42,639
because because Tony was talking

1486
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,920
[ __ ] and he wanted me to set Tony

1487
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:46,879
straight you know he's like ah Tony's

1488
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:49,680
talking T beans man will you come on

1489
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,240
hash church and get get this guy

1490
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:56,038
grounded on S so yeah I always knew that

1491
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:58,919
there was so much kind of like interest

1492
01:01:56,039 --> 01:02:02,520
kind of hunger from the community that

1493
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:05,119
wanted to know all of this stuff like

1494
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:08,239
that michuan did back in the 60s and

1495
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:11,400
then Adams did back in the 30s man I

1496
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:13,759
mean it is just really to me just

1497
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,599
fascinating because I think they knew

1498
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,799
the importance of the chemistry that

1499
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,480
they were doing I think the thing that

1500
01:02:17,798 --> 01:02:23,838
really made Adams's chemistry just kind

1501
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:27,400
of go away was was World War II right I

1502
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:31,400
mean he published like 1 papers in less

1503
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:34,079
than three years between 1939 and 1941

1504
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,720
then the World War II happened and they

1505
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,519
just kind of forgot about it but you

1506
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:41,879
know mulam I think in his movie talks

1507
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:45,480
about this he tried to write offer NIH

1508
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:47,599
funding in the early 60s to study the

1509
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:51,240
chemistry of the Cannabis plan and the

1510
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:53,278
NIH was like go blow then after he

1511
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:56,639
reported Delta 9

1512
01:02:53,278 --> 01:03:00,199
isolated they came over and smuggled the

1513
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:02,639
10 GRS that he had made back back to

1514
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:05,159
Bethesda and did all kinds of secret

1515
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:08,078
government work in the NIH on it where

1516
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:10,920
they came up with Axel Rod's patent you

1517
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:13,599
know on on neuro protection and and and

1518
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:17,200
so like there's this whole secret agenda

1519
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:19,160
that the government had on cannabis

1520
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:21,358
while they were locking up hippies

1521
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:23,719
because Richard Nixon thought that

1522
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:27,199
smoking weed was the end of the United

1523
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:30,239
States you know so you

1524
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:33,239
it even goes back further than that back

1525
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:35,639
to the original reer Madness [ __ ]

1526
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:37,000
but um man where we are today think

1527
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:39,519
about where we are today I mean even in

1528
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,798
my lifetime I was born in 62 I know

1529
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:45,400
Sam's got me beat by about 10 years but

1530
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:49,559
you know we even go back just even half

1531
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:52,039
a century to where we are now to where

1532
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:54,880
people are doing research to where I I'm

1533
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:56,240
reading I just read this paper about

1534
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,440
MDMA

1535
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:03,679
to treat PTSD I mean it's just it's

1536
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,880
[ __ ] amazing right where we are today

1537
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:08,078
in the use of yeah

1538
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:11,760
psychedelics and

1539
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:14,400
canono um and just a great great place

1540
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,200
where we are right

1541
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:19,760
now thanks to people like Marcus for

1542
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:23,439
putting hash church and you for putting

1543
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:26,960
4200 together to educate the community

1544
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:30,000
because a rising Tide Rises all Bo

1545
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:31,880
I like to share the information I I like

1546
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,159
I like all the different discussions

1547
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,119
it's you know for quite a while uh

1548
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:38,000
dragonfly Earth medicine was in the chat

1549
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:40,278
kind of going like [ __ ] putting

1550
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,920
chemicals on [ __ ] and like don't no

1551
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:44,880
that's the whole plant is better

1552
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:47,119
medicine and I totally get that

1553
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,480
perspective and I'm not like I just find

1554
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:51,640
it super interesting all of this

1555
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:54,400
information and taking apart the plant

1556
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:57,078
and learning about it and uh sort of

1557
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:00,880
expanding our knowledge on I do also see

1558
01:04:57,079 --> 01:05:03,318
value in it a for the science Alone um

1559
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,720
but also for specific sort of patients

1560
01:05:03,318 --> 01:05:08,759
like yeah of course listen if you can

1561
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:11,959
get some beautifully living soil organic

1562
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,799
you know fed whole plant medicine or a

1563
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:16,000
an extract through water extraction or

1564
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:18,079
something yeah that's that's amazing but

1565
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,679
you know the the example I always use is

1566
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:23,119
that that the profiles change and that

1567
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:26,038
they're hard to reformulate if you don't

1568
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:29,440
do things like this and there are you

1569
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:31,278
know like Haley uh Rose Haley's Comet

1570
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,760
which John could speak of as well that

1571
01:05:31,278 --> 01:05:35,559
sometimes that would work and then

1572
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,720
sometimes it wouldn't work and it would

1573
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:40,240
just change the slightest little bit in

1574
01:05:37,719 --> 01:05:42,239
in maybe the grow room variable and now

1575
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:45,838
her medicine no longer worked and her

1576
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:47,558
seizures were super or are super serious

1577
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:51,159
they're not lightweight seizures these

1578
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:55,240
are like you know potential um life uh

1579
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:57,759
ending critical style seizures and so to

1580
01:05:55,239 --> 01:06:00,118
be able ble to like find exactly what

1581
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,640
works for her and then be able to just

1582
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:05,278
take plants apart maybe multiple plants

1583
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:08,000
to put that profile together make it

1584
01:06:05,278 --> 01:06:10,679
accurate and be able to give that to her

1585
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,358
like to me I see a value in that and I

1586
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:15,399
think um I get where they're coming from

1587
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:17,480
they're very passionate about that side

1588
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,358
and I hope they come in later and share

1589
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:21,960
with us uh about that side but you got

1590
01:06:20,358 --> 01:06:23,480
to be careful when you're super

1591
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,599
passionate about one side that you're

1592
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,838
not making a bunch of assumptions in rep

1593
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:30,519
telling the other side what hash church

1594
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:32,519
has taught me is to be more open like am

1595
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:34,480
I going am I dabbing on distillate right

1596
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:37,239
now like no I'm dabbing on six-star

1597
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,519
Bubble has and that's okay but you know

1598
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:42,639
we've we've got to allow the

1599
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:45,519
conversation at least amongst

1600
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:47,480
ourselves to be able to to discuss these

1601
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:48,719
things and that that's that's all I'll

1602
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,960
say about

1603
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:53,439
it look I like fresh rainwater straight

1604
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,599
from the or maybe straight from the

1605
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,400
spring it's beautiful but I also like

1606
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:00,000
pickles and I have to take that water

1607
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:02,200
mix it with Pickles do a process to end

1608
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,798
up with those pickles both are great

1609
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:05,278
doesn't mean I sometimes don't want

1610
01:07:03,798 --> 01:07:07,480
water and sometimes I want pickle juice

1611
01:07:05,278 --> 01:07:09,239
but I had to go through the process that

1612
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,838
this fermentation or this salting

1613
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:12,318
process this is this is life this is

1614
01:07:10,838 --> 01:07:13,880
what humans do we take things and we

1615
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:15,759
play with it we change it and sometimes

1616
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,440
we end up with things like Delta eight

1617
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,359
that might be beautiful medicine for a

1618
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,240
child getting chemo right like there are

1619
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:22,159
high

1620
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:23,679
use like you said you're never going to

1621
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:25,759
get the Delta eight by growing the most

1622
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:27,798
headiest plant you ever grew I'm a

1623
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,039
permaculturist 100% I want all of my

1624
01:07:27,798 --> 01:07:31,639
weed that I'm going to consume to come

1625
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:33,119
from dragonfly yes that's great but I

1626
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:35,199
might also take some of that and turn a

1627
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:37,599
little bit into d8 if that means we

1628
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:38,759
can't be friends then so be it but

1629
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,880
doesn't mean I'm it's going to stop me

1630
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,799
from from doing

1631
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,480
it for sure well they're going to come

1632
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:48,400
in later they're just really busy right

1633
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,559
now so we're excellent yeah yeah they're

1634
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,039
good folks they're the they're the

1635
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:54,000
greatest of folks really they're just uh

1636
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:56,359
I could feel his passion I know also

1637
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,960
that their souls are absolutely Ely

1638
01:07:56,358 --> 01:08:01,400
being crushed right now by the last

1639
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:04,720
2.7% of our rainforest in British

1640
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:07,039
Columbia our our Elder forests uh are

1641
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:08,239
getting uh cut down right now so they

1642
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,200
I'm hoping they're kind of going to come

1643
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:12,719
in as well and give an update on that

1644
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:15,159
because it's uh pretty [ __ ] up

1645
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:17,079
situation that's going on here in BC I

1646
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:19,278
want to talk about that too but okay go

1647
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:22,600
ahead

1648
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:25,000
man so I want to C let's Circle back on

1649
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:28,079
the on the trees too because we have the

1650
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:31,920
same thing happening down here in

1651
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:36,079
Washington absolutely there we go okay

1652
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:38,880
so um let me move trying to there taking

1653
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:41,640
off out of the way yeah I gotta get

1654
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,600
going boys it was uh everyone was really

1655
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:46,600
nice to to see you all I'll catch you

1656
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,920
guys on on the next show um I gotta I

1657
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:51,838
gota get it ready to fly so take care

1658
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:53,798
col have a beautiful beautiful Sunday

1659
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:57,399
everyone out

1660
01:08:53,798 --> 01:09:02,119
brother out brother

1661
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:05,759
yeah so we got right here um says canab

1662
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:10,439
CBG canaberal and they label it as

1663
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:13,279
VII goes to De yeah dehydrogenated with

1664
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:15,158
chlorin uh in Benzene which like you

1665
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:19,159
were talking about

1666
01:09:15,158 --> 01:09:21,639
yuck um and then you know they Explain

1667
01:09:19,158 --> 01:09:24,519
how and why it ends up converting itself

1668
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:28,119
to canab chromin which they've labeled

1669
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:30,440
as V in a pretty decent yield um

1670
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:33,479
especially since we can now Bol grow CVG

1671
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:37,399
in the field and here is the you can

1672
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:41,079
just see the move here's VII so CBG goes

1673
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:43,238
with chloral in that Benzene soup to V

1674
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:45,000
yeah so let's just talk about chloral

1675
01:09:43,238 --> 01:09:47,519
for a second so this is a chlorinated

1676
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,000
aromatic that basically makes dioxin

1677
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,120
type compounds when it's consumed I

1678
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,399
mean again if you're going to make this

1679
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:58,359
in a laboratory it's one thing if you're

1680
01:09:55,399 --> 01:10:00,679
to make this for human ingestion got to

1681
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:02,359
be something just completely different

1682
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:04,960
you know the other thing I would worry

1683
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:07,359
about with this kind of thing is that so

1684
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,719
this the reason why I pointed this out

1685
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:11,839
Dustin is just as an example here's

1686
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:13,840
literature where you could say okay

1687
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,119
there's a method out there that's it

1688
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,159
that's all I need to know right so a guy

1689
01:10:16,119 --> 01:10:20,238
in a warehouse or in a garage would say

1690
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:22,319
well here's a method what equipment do I

1691
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:24,799
need let's piece it together let's

1692
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:27,119
figure this [ __ ] out he did it so we can

1693
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,199
do it I guess the other important thing

1694
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:32,399
and again I I know Colin would agree

1695
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:34,678
with me that one of the big issues I

1696
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:37,559
think is not just necessarily the way

1697
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:42,920
that you're making this but being able

1698
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:46,480
to have the intellectual capacity to

1699
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:47,960
understand that you need to develop a

1700
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:50,319
process for

1701
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:52,520
commercialization run it several times

1702
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:54,039
whenever you run a commercial process I

1703
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,400
think Marcus she'd probably agree with

1704
01:10:54,039 --> 01:10:58,679
me especially when when it comes to

1705
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:01,198
stuff that's related to cannabis so

1706
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:03,719
there's variables in it that sometimes

1707
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:06,799
subtly change we can't tell with our

1708
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:09,520
naked eye or it takes very

1709
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:12,600
sophisticated looking at you know many

1710
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:16,880
many different properties to be able to

1711
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:18,880
reproduce a process time and time again

1712
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,039
to make

1713
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,880
the for something that's going to go

1714
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:27,119
into into

1715
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:29,239
people right and and so so not only do

1716
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:31,840
you need the analytical controls but you

1717
01:11:29,238 --> 01:11:34,678
need to be able to run that process four

1718
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:37,000
and five times look at the data and see

1719
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:38,719
what kind of spread you get so like in a

1720
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,960
process like this where it says I don't

1721
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:44,239
know 95% yield well what if you run it

1722
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:46,600
again and next time it's 98 or what if

1723
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:49,638
you run it next time it's 88 so you're G

1724
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:52,760
to have this constantly moving thing

1725
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:54,480
that you need to be able to standardize

1726
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,679
and the thing that I really don't like

1727
01:11:54,479 --> 01:12:00,399
about using a stochiometric oxidant like

1728
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:03,560
this is it makes stric waste in this

1729
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:06,279
case it's it's it's

1730
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:09,600
chlorinated hogen halogenated

1731
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:13,479
chlorinated waste chlorinated phenols

1732
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:15,639
are the synthetic precursors to dioxins

1733
01:12:13,479 --> 01:12:18,879
so these things if they haven't made

1734
01:12:15,639 --> 01:12:21,520
dioxins will go to a landfill and make

1735
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,960
dioxins in a landfill this is just not

1736
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,239
good not practical would never be scaled

1737
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:28,359
up commercially today

1738
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:35,158
sure ab

1739
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:36,960
and um sorry I gotta Echo think sure um

1740
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:38,759
so yeah this is how we got to delta8

1741
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,119
right oh well no we got to Delta eight

1742
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,320
on accident but once we realize what we

1743
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:44,039
were doing this is how we progressed

1744
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:45,519
Delta we went into the literature saw

1745
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:48,238
that they were doing crazy things with

1746
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:50,000
crazy uh solvents and acids that most of

1747
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:51,718
us can't even get our hands on see that

1748
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,639
that's step one most you know most of

1749
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:55,679
these and and that's changing as these

1750
01:12:53,639 --> 01:12:57,480
like our future compounds lab we we now

1751
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,600
have access to quite a bit of stuff but

1752
01:12:57,479 --> 01:13:01,678
we've never sold any of our

1753
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,520
intermediates and never would because

1754
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:06,719
it's not safe it needs a lot of cleanup

1755
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:09,080
there's lots of processes and yes we we

1756
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:12,279
obviously want to use the cheapest

1757
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:13,960
safest solvents and uh acids possible

1758
01:13:12,279 --> 01:13:16,920
and that's always where we start and

1759
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,920
work in hey Dustin Dustin look look what

1760
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,399
he says right here on this p on this

1761
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:23,480
paragraph to the right work done by our

1762
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:25,479
group and others has shown that one

1763
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:28,399
which is Delta 9 can be readily

1764
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:31,039
isomerized to Delta 2 in the presence of

1765
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:33,799
paroline sulfonic acid and nearly

1766
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:37,279
quantitive that's it

1767
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:40,480
it it they're Off to the Races they're a

1768
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:43,800
chemist now right Y and made a chemist

1769
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:45,959
out of a bunch of people by listening to

1770
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,400
yep that's there's the secret there's

1771
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,760
the big giant secret right there that's

1772
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:53,198
made a lot of people a lot of money in

1773
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:57,039
the last couple years yeah yeah anyway

1774
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:57,039
sorry to keep hijacking the conversation

1775
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:02,199
Market this is not at all man I'm

1776
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:06,679
chatting in the chat

1777
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:09,158
room you guys keep going it's

1778
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:11,359
great yeah and you're you're right about

1779
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:13,479
the the waste products because you can

1780
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:15,559
get you can get all of this to a safe

1781
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:17,599
spot now could you do that you know cost

1782
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,280
effectively I don't know but you can you

1783
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,520
know wash scrub pass through chroma get

1784
01:14:20,279 --> 01:14:25,039
it to an isolated compound you know

1785
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:27,440
like like we take the scel that's at 99

1786
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:30,198
.8% or

1787
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:31,839
99.9% in CBN isolate right there could

1788
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:33,919
have been lots of nasty [ __ ] happening

1789
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,079
before that that now is not present in

1790
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,399
this right I mean it's not

1791
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:40,800
radioactive besides that at this Purity

1792
01:14:39,399 --> 01:14:42,719
you know disregarding the idea that

1793
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,600
we're throwing away a bunch of nasty

1794
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,198
[ __ ] or or in theory we're throwing a

1795
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:48,560
bunch of nasty [ __ ] we got we actually

1796
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:50,279
have a pretty clean process for this CDN

1797
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:52,960
but right

1798
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:56,238
like some of these like and they go

1799
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:58,239
through you know a lot of this they get

1800
01:14:56,238 --> 01:15:00,238
to an isolate point and then are

1801
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:01,799
checking it on NMR that they say that at

1802
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:03,399
the beginning of the of this paper

1803
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,679
that's how they've confirmed so they're

1804
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:09,559
getting this stuff to some Ultra Purity

1805
01:15:06,679 --> 01:15:11,840
right that that CBC that they made with

1806
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:14,039
this nasty process that they got to

1807
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,279
Purity would in theory be safe to

1808
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:18,479
consume right yeah but again to use

1809
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:20,319
chromatography on the laboratory scale

1810
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:23,238
where you're just you know putting a

1811
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:25,679
column together with 60 grams of silica

1812
01:15:23,238 --> 01:15:28,359
if you had to do that and make know

1813
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:30,679
several hundred kilos of material it it

1814
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:33,319
would be not only cost prohibitive but I

1815
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:35,760
mean that the the process chemistry and

1816
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:38,840
the equipment that you would need uh

1817
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:42,199
takes a substantial investment of course

1818
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:44,440
but now now in let's just compare it to

1819
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:47,719
pharmaceutical there are certain drugs

1820
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:49,678
that are insanely expensive because the

1821
01:15:47,719 --> 01:15:51,920
only way that they can get there well

1822
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:53,119
you know politics aside the only way

1823
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,000
they can get there is through that

1824
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:57,158
investment that you said it took so much

1825
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,880
money to scale up this entire thing that

1826
01:15:57,158 --> 01:16:01,799
when we get this 1% of 1% yield that's

1827
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,639
the magical medicine now that may have

1828
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:05,159
gone through a nasty process to get

1829
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:07,960
there

1830
01:16:05,158 --> 01:16:10,439
right well yeah I mean when you're

1831
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:13,319
discovering a medicine there's usually a

1832
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:15,479
two phases there's a discovery you do a

1833
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:16,880
lot of Discovery and you try to find new

1834
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:19,158
structures and you make a lot of

1835
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:21,159
different compounds basically assembling

1836
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:22,759
Legos in different ways then when you

1837
01:16:21,158 --> 01:16:25,879
find your set of

1838
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:28,119
Lego development so so you find out that

1839
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,440
that not only has the biological

1840
01:16:28,119 --> 01:16:32,880
activity you're looking for but

1841
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:36,079
hopefully some sort of safety assessment

1842
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:38,600
or safety assessment on the

1843
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:41,079
metabolite this is a pill what's going

1844
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,800
to happen inside the body and you look

1845
01:16:41,079 --> 01:16:44,719
at a lot of different things when it

1846
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:49,000
comes to safety assessment because again

1847
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:51,920
a drug is not a food ingredient uh but

1848
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,238
uh again the pharmaceutical Mantra is to

1849
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,440
certainly hook you for life and to make

1850
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:57,919
sure that

1851
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:00,559
you have to take this medicine for the

1852
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:03,039
rest of your life you know I I would

1853
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:06,000
assume that again the the discovery

1854
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:08,600
phase can use all kinds of chemistry to

1855
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,560
get there to discover the molecule but

1856
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:12,960
then the most important phase is the

1857
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:16,080
development phase which is where you

1858
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:18,158
take that initial molecule or compound

1859
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:20,119
that's been discovered and now think

1860
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:23,759
about how do we actually make a

1861
01:17:20,119 --> 01:17:25,800
manufacturing process to make this and

1862
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,119
we're not going to necessar use the

1863
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:30,840
laboratory synthesis to make it because

1864
01:17:28,119 --> 01:17:33,800
the laboratory synthesis uses all this

1865
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:36,199
toxic expensive crap that we can't use

1866
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,279
on the [ __ ] ton scale and to make this

1867
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:40,238
drug we need to make it on a [ __ ] ton

1868
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:42,639
scale and we can't just create a bunch

1869
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:44,959
of you know for every one pound of

1870
01:17:42,639 --> 01:17:49,079
product you create 20 pounds of waste

1871
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:51,198
that doesn't so mark on the when they're

1872
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:52,679
doing that process before they go to the

1873
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:54,839
manufacturing scale they've done their

1874
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:56,158
safety testing right well typic

1875
01:17:54,840 --> 01:18:01,039
typically you

1876
01:17:56,158 --> 01:18:01,039
do uh initial research
