1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,680
Howie, you know, I your email said, and

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,199
I thought it was a really great context,

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,879
a good place to kind of jump off the

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,320
conversation, which is why I mentioned

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,798
Mark and and Kevin was seeds versus

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,719
clones, right? And how those two

7
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,920
different types of propagules influence

8
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:21,358
cultivation. And, you know, there's a

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,359
lot of history in that conversation

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,760
because we we've ended up using clones

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,760
because of the way cannabis has been

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,118
overhybridized for years and years and

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,480
years. And you know up until recently

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:37,759
the only way to get to crop uniformity

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:40,319
was to use clones right to get chemical

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,839
chemical stability. And some of the work

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,238
that I did with Mark uh Lewis down in

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,079
California was you know probably some of

19
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,320
the earliest work on towards getting

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,198
towards chemical stability in a seed

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,320
line and and in the last few years you

22
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:58,000
know Philos and Relentless Genetics is

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,439
sorry refined genetics. These guys have

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,759
come a long way in in creating actually

25
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,438
stable seedlines. And so, well, wait a

26
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:11,920
minute. You say refined genetics is

27
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:16,079
stable, but they don't use true

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,719
uh homogeneous parents to create their

29
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:22,719
their F1 hybrid uh so-called stable

30
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,478
varieties. Yeah. When I say stable, I

31
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,280
mean I mean uniform is really what I

32
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:30,478
meant to they're using inbreeding to

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,079
create almost homogeneous varieties. So,

34
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,519
it's a little bit different. Yeah. Okay.

35
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:34,639
Well, and that's the way that it's been

36
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,959
typically done in corn is through

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,519
inbreeding to create, you know, either

38
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,478
inbredads or recominant inbredads that

39
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:45,239
we then use to create F1 hybrids, right?

40
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:48,560
So, hybrid an F1

41
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:51,280
hybrid by definition is not stable, but

42
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,759
it's neutral, right? Dr. Ba always told

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,879
me, don't use inbredads. every time you

44
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:02,399
imbreed you take away vigor and uh you

45
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:05,920
know so I I'm a believer in what he said

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,318
yeah and if you look at you did that I

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,759
mean you you did do that in the in the

48
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,958
creation of the propol lines right like

49
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:16,399
you created those lines yes that's true

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:20,000
but what we also did was uh we restored

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,640
all the bigger which is what they hope

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,919
that they're also doing but they're not

53
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,919
starting with

54
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,839
uh

55
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:31,598
homogeneous lines. We didn't start with

56
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,439
absolutely homogeneous uh homozygot

57
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:37,238
lines either. Excuse me. We uh because

58
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,759
we only sell them three or four

59
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,200
generations and that's not enough to do

60
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,359
it. If you want to have a true

61
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:50,399
homozygot, you need to double a hloid or

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:53,200
or or do some other trick. Yeah. I mean,

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,360
we're splitting an IBL actually from

64
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,560
like 50,000 seed population. I've never

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,239
seen an IBL, I'm just going to throw

66
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,400
this out there for the conversation,

67
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:05,360
that has ever resembled anything true to

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,560
form on the the parent stock. I've seen

69
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,800
IBL IBL is a silly term, you know,

70
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,680
chasing of dreams than I've ever seen in

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,599
my entire career. chasing that the way I

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,519
had described it was uh okay, so you uh

73
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:23,759
you take an IBL that's a cross between a

74
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,200
a white plant and a black plant. Neither

75
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,359
one of those really exists, but

76
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,518
regardless uh and then you back cross it

77
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080
to either the white one or the black one

78
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,439
for three, four more generations, but

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,719
you're never going to get a black

80
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,400
parent. You're never going to get a

81
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,158
white parent. You're going to end up

82
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,920
with a You understand? Yeah. No, listen.

83
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,560
We use the term IBL in the cannabis

84
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,559
world in a really silly way. IBL means

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,318
inbred line. It could be inbred one

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,560
generation or it could be inbred 10

87
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,479
generations, right? And you end up with

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,039
different things along the way. When we

89
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:01,039
say homozygous, we really mean at

90
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,719
multiple traits in the genome. Like

91
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,400
we're starting to fix traits along the

92
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,878
way. And the farther down we go the

93
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,920
line, the more homozygous it becomes.

94
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,158
like if you self a plant every

95
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,598
generation you get 50% more homozygosity

96
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,399
through the process of selfing

97
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,279
subsequent generations right and uh you

98
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,159
know one good example of this

99
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:24,079
is when uh David when Sam sent the skunk

100
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,600
over to the University of Mississippi

101
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,039
they and bred it for a whole bunch of

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,560
more generations one

103
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,199
one and eventually they got to a state

104
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,959
that they called

105
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,560
isozygous isozygus just means the same

106
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,279
on both chromosomes and that's

107
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,839
approaching what you'd get from

108
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:45,198
um like a doubled happy. That's true.

109
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:47,758
And I did it on a family line level in

110
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,919
California for 10 years before I bought

111
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:55,759
it brought it to Holland and then I uh

112
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,839
used clones to reproduce the seeds and

113
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,400
uh

114
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:06,079
the people like when I sent those to Dr.

115
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:08,959
Vza he also told me that uh they were

116
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:13,758
Oh, that was a cytology lab we did that

117
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:16,319
they were more uh homozygot than uh any

118
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,120
of the registered hemp varieties that

119
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,360
that exist in the world. That's number

120
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,079
one because those things have been also

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,639
bred on a population level, right? And

122
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,839
this comes back to this inbreeding

123
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,000
conversation. When you inbreed cannabis,

124
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,560
cannabis being is an obligate outcrosser

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,839
like humans. Okay? So when you when you

126
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,280
breed two plants

127
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:39,359
together, they each have their own

128
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,359
variation in the family heritage that is

129
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,000
essentially replicated, right? And it's

130
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,520
a very unnatural process to breed

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,038
brother to sister, brother to sister,

132
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,959
brother to sister over a series of

133
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,120
generations. And in humans, you just

134
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,239
can't do that, right? You end up getting

135
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,000
all these weird, you know, defects in

136
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,240
the children. And that's because there's

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,399
this really high genetic load of

138
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:07,600
um defective alals or what we call

139
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:10,159
lethal alals. Um and so essentially we

140
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,960
have this built-in these built-in

141
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,639
genetic mistakes in all of our genomes,

142
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,079
right? And cannabis is no different. And

143
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,600
when you start putting them into this

144
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,639
inbreeding process that's quite

145
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,479
unnatural uh to cannabis, you start

146
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,560
uncovering all these traits. So they

147
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,959
start pairing up in a homozygous form

148
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,478
and you end up with with like really bad

149
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,719
performing plants or plants that just

150
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,360
start getting weak. Which is why bok

151
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,199
would say don't inbreed, right? But it's

152
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,879
again it's it's a means to an end. If

153
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,439
you're inbreeding with the intention to

154
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:45,360
outcross at the end, that's how you can

155
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:48,560
restore vigor. So um as long as the what

156
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,000
that at the end you combine uh to

157
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,839
restore the vigor have

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,560
different uh exactly backgrounds that

159
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,799
really helps. Yeah.

160
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,199
What did what did DJ Short do in all of

161
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,360
this? Like wasn't he inbreeding and mut

162
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,038
and finding mutants? Can you explain a

163
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,400
little bit about how he went about that?

164
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,839
Because he it always seemed to work out

165
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,839
in his favor. Well, it didn't it didn't.

166
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,560
I mean, anybody that's grown blueberry

167
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,879
would really say that it's not it's not

168
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,399
a very high performing plant. It's got

169
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,719
all these weird crinkle leaves,

170
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,478
mutations in the leaf and it's a slow

171
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,880
growing plant and it doesn't yield very

172
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,240
much. And when you outcross it to a

173
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,719
bunch of different lines like we did in

174
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,199
our hybrid, our joint projects that the

175
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,120
outcross is actually way outperform the

176
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,400
blueberry, right? And it's it's it's

177
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,319
actually a really good example of what

178
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,079
we call inbreeding depression, right?

179
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,960
This genetic weakness that gets built

180
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,560
into these lines um as you go throughout

181
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,038
the inbreeding process. And Mark, you've

182
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,478
done a lot of work on this. I'm sure

183
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,439
you've seen it to some degree in your

184
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,800
work as well. Yeah. I don't know if you

185
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,759
know, but we've been focusing really

186
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,199
hardcore on type threes for the past few

187
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,520
years. Like not a lot of not lot lot not

188
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,800
a lot of action on the type one side for

189
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,240
genetics these days. Um because

190
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,639
everybody has a tendency not to respect

191
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,800
contracts. But on the type three side,

192
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:16,879
we took the propel um 3Vs and what we

193
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,840
inbred them by uh TP profile. So we

194
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,960
have, you know, about 12 uh inbred lines

195
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:26,560
that are S3 or deeper now. And same on

196
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,478
the pencil side. So when you pair those

197
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,439
TP cassettes up, you get your hybrid

198
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,958
vigor back and you get like twice the

199
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,200
oil, you know, because you you watch

200
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:38,000
your oil start depressing. Like you know

201
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,278
that first that first introgression step

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,360
you'll have like 3 4% oil and then as

203
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,439
you imbreed the total oil just keeps

204
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,200
going down but you lock in the TP

205
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,519
cassette. Then when you bring it back to

206
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,720
the pentle you get that hybrid vigor

207
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,399
back. That's exactly what we did for

208
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,680
canabonoids.

209
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,360
And the same there's a place in Europe

210
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,199
called the crag. I don't know if you've

211
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,600
heard of it, but they do a lot of

212
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,759
genetic work and they were saying that

213
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,320
it only takes uh three inbred steps um

214
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:13,679
in different directions to to be able to

215
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,839
create a hybrid with hybrid bigger. So

216
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,599
S3 one way and S3 the other way and then

217
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,880
you can bring them back together. We did

218
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,278
it to three, four. I think we made a few

219
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:28,879
that were five self generations. And uh

220
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:32,240
after three or four the they're most of

221
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,240
them were functionally sterile.
