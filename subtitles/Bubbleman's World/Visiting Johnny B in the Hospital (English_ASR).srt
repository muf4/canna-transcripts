25
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,159
on camera but def we'll let him decide

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,000

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,400

28

say dirty East Vancouver I bet you I

40
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,759
could find a dirtier spot well we could

41
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,919
go down to Pigeon Park oh find a puddle

42
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,718

46
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,399
get that vibration there we go there we

47
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,959
go maybe this guy in the layered Wheaten

48
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,719
will just drive right into the back of

49
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:18,000
us oh that was a disappointing little I

50
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,359
heard it no I'm not looking for it I'm

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
pulling out a new one it's probably in

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,560
here somewhere well maybe if we were

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,280
actually [ __ ] it's my truck crack or

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,080
something we might spend about 4 days

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,439
looking for that one we dropped after

56
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,319
we're finished doing what we're going to

57
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:36,159
do now right or in between Hoots but uh

58
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,280
we don't do that so well that's probably

59
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,039
why I have like 10 gram of hash on my

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,318
floor yeah I've got little nuggets all

61
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,679

00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,799

121
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,159
little bit of chatty chatty chatting

122
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:37,519

123
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,879
it it's a rainy ass day in the city but

124
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,318
uh you know after a bong rip well

125
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,680
actually it was after Darren told that

126
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,680
woman to [ __ ] off really super loud out

127
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,560
of the window everything changed from

128
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,199
that moment on it was kind of like a

129
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,199
heavy Vibe we were a little bit kind of

130
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,199
having a rough morning and then then

131
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,038
someone just gave me the finger for

132
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,800
basically for nothing for nothing and it

133
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:59,399
was his opportunity Darren saw the

134
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,639
opportunity there's the plug if I can

135
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,120
just pop that off all of this will

136
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,720
release I opened the window just that

137
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,160
much just so I could get my lips out

138
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,000
even so they could hear me it was like

139
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:15,599
that and just was [ __ ] you it was loud

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,478
it was anyone that had ever listened to

141
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:21,560
Hash Church would have been like that

142
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,758
sounded like d420 K but I think it was

143
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,560
[ __ ] you instead of bong rip it was

144
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,639
[ __ ] loud so loud that when Mark took

145
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,000
a look in his rearview mirror at that

146
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,680
moment it's true they both they turned

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,598
around turned around with chicken heads

148
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,000
chicken necks chicken headed it rubber

149
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:41,879
necked it rubber neck and like hard core

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,279
it was we were we were a half a block

151
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,800

152
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,159

was a big deal that's 10 years in the

268
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,239
waiting 11 years in the waiting for what

269
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:41,639
you just went through

270
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:45,278
well easy and simple um posterus

271
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:48,198
cervical L be Fusion C3 to C6 they took

272
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:51,278
out my C4 because my spin cord was

273
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:53,439
deflated and compressed so when they

274
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:56,078
took the C4 off my spinal cord inflated

275
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,399
like a balloon and with that gave me my

276
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,799
relief the burning of my knees went away

277
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,839
and the burning of my my feet my hands

278
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,479
had neuropathy so that's changed that's

279
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,399
vibration that been in my body for the

280
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,839
last 10 years it's gone it really took

281
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,679
an effect on July 14th in 2014 when I

282
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,399
got a car accident and it pinched the

283
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,638
cord and it caused major and that's

284
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,759
where the burning really started and

285
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,560
that's where they found what was

286
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:21,159
happening and here we are in almost like

287
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,838

don't know if it's fruity though or if

394
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,320
it's what it is but it's definitely

395
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:11,200
like even from here I can smell it

396
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,960
really strong it's like a cushy and then

397
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,360
it's got like a fruity to but yeah it's

398
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,480
like Fruity cushy yeah like a fruity

399
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,240
which changes the fruit aspect fruit

400
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,120
bowl maybe that's going slightly bad

401
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,359
that that that that first one I could

402
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,879
actually feel how help this one didn't

403
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,399
the purple punch help it just it kind of

404
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,480
something a little release or something

405
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,640
it released this one does

406
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:36,360
well we've got a ton to go through here

407
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,280

408
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:43,678

409
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,678
back let's try strawberry mind

410
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,280
warp man I like that one I always smell

411
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,440
like a strawberry banana esque smell as

412
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,319
I take it away after you do get banana

413
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,440
right and if you smell it enough times

414
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,960
you'll that banana turns into you can

415
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,798
see the similarities between a

416
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,640
strawberry have that that purple punch

417
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,240
again yeah I just want to see something

418
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,400
right

419
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,880
now just got to find it I'm getting this

420
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,880
noodle soup with slight hints of

421
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,240
TPS which is nice yeah it's not bad

422
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,240
purple

423
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:25,039
punch even the lid is it it does

424
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,319
actually here for 10 minutes my pant I I

425
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,319
was curious cuz the other two weren't

426
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,240
but this one is smell it off the lid

427
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,240
it's coming

428
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,240
really strong off the

429
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,000
lid like it actually the smell is so

430
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:43,158
there it's like the pain goes like

431
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,200
this interesting and because I'm sitting

432
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:49,120
here in pain right I can only imagine

433
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,038
right so um but the other two didn't

434
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,000
that's why I wanted to P back on that

435
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,759
yeah I was just curious I was just

436
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,640
curious because one thing you're looking

437
00:19:54,759 --> 00:20:01,400
at is Hell tur are mulating everything

438
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,759
right here's one that uh everyone loves

439
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,759
chem

440
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:11,038
dog yep I remember that

441
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,600
one and when I bring it to here here's

442
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,200
the difference the lids are killing how

443
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:16,279
about this when I go here exactly helps

444
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
with my pain when I take it away it's

445
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,558
gone really with the purple punch it's

446
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,558
it takes longer for the pain to come

447
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:22,519
back

448
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,158
interesting what I noticed with it is

449
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:27,038
that from different angles and distances

450
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:29,400
from my nose I could smell things that I

451
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,919
don't smell otherwise like they have

452
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,519
their very fine areas of where you can

453
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,840
pick that

454
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:39,639
subtle smell up yeah it's

455
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:42,079
interesting I'm zooming in on Johnny's

456
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,280
bolt marks like Frankenstein see that

457
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,720
yeah they bolted my head actually bolted

458
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:51,960

459
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:54,759
table screwed his head right to it yeah

460
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:59,600

464
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,000
present in a lot of the other flavors

465
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:17,640
that they have similarities and

466
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,119
differences but the differences between

467
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,320
SM this is different smoother yeah it's

468
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,759
just with that little bit of spice in

469
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:27,839
the background that's that's part of

470

of tped modulate right we all that so

492
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:27,480
for me this is huge you'll like this

493
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,440
one that's quite a difference in smells

494
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,440
that's the orange

495
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,840
creamsicle oh man I'm telling you like

496
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:44,798
the lids are incredible the more P this

497
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:47,399
smell the more it l you the that's nice

498
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,759
tilt brain it takes over your brain and

499
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,759
it's also like what I find about it

500
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:53,278
that's strange is when I smell it I find

501
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,759
that I want to

502
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:58,159
picture pictures in my mind this this is

503
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,038
you know if that makes any sense this is

504
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,520
another one so this is like four orange

505
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:05,119
cream is good I think you're also going

506
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,158
to like pineapple cream I pretty much

507
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:10,519
love

508
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:13,600
turs well exactly obviously

509
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:15,400
obviously that you love turs pineapple

510
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:18,558
cream how did I do

511
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:22,200
that that's a deserty

512
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:25,319
tasting and smelling like a like whipped

513
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,759
cream and fruit salad with dominating

514
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:31,000
pineapple in it like my paint still

515
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:33,480
there the other ones are taking over it

516
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,240
that makes sense and it's I'm just like

517
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,558
for me I'm just like you know close your

518
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,599
eyes and really like breathe it in

519
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:42,759
gently not just really close but also

520
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,240
from a distance yeah and and it's it's

521
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,839
it's almost like it's enhancing a little

522
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,839
bit of fig so tense right

523
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:51,519
now

524
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,599
wating making a tense

525
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,079
wating so we can find ones that we don't

526
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,199
guaranteed there's going to be turps

527
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:01,199
that heal and the turps that basically

528
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:05,120
don't Pur another great

529
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,798

[Music]

548

go from a distance and then slowly kind

549
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,158
of bring it up so until you can just

550
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,640
it's on the edge of really being

551
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,720
powerful cuz some of them are also too

552
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,799
strong to smell right close to your

553
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,200
notse some are good I like the pineapple

554

down and do the good work do the good

572
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,919
work we were so inclined to do that is

573
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:05,918
the Gorilla

574
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:08,278
Glue it's also a very strong strain what

575
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,880
got doing it for

576
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:13,038
you as I thought it would it's not it's

577
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,360
just like it's a strong one yeah no but

578
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,679
different right different than what your

579
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,278
what would really be cool is if we had

580
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:24,320
an idea as to the um

581
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,319
profile this one's the Blue

582

583
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:32,919
you know pretty pretty pretty popular

584
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:34,639
strain down in Cali can can be grown on

585

a commercial level and still produce a

586
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,278
pretty nice product but see see if my

587

it's like my Pain's high and it's like

594
