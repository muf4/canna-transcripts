00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,560
that everyone else can hear much

98
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,000
appreciated to know

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,079
that um most of the cameras work like

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,560
that most of the cameras do mirrors and

101
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,800
that's why everything's backwards but by

102
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,280
all means if you want it to be right

103
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,000
side up go stand in front of a mirror

104
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,638
and hold your phone up and you'll see it

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
all the right way I wish there was a

106
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,038
little mirror button I could just push

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,519
to make that right but uh I alas

108
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:13,120
can't well good Dy I'm glad or Cody yeah

109
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,719
Cody Dy looked away for your name for a

110
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,560
second and thought am I calling him the

111
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,919
right name cleaning up the Sapphire for

112
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,918
the next

113
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,080
dab six star hash Rosen well I'm

114
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:30,560
guessing you're calling the hash it was

115
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:32,758
made with six star as in six-star bubble

116
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,319
hash made into rosin because rosin

117
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,919
itself has no star rating and the reason

118
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:42,000
that is is because rosin is an oil and

119
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:45,240
oil is melty not all hash will melt but

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,199
all oil will melt because it's a liquid

121
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,600
it's already been melted so I'm not sure

122
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,680
exactly what you were mentioning but if

123
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,879
you're calling it six-star rosin then it

124
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,519
should be made with six-star bubble

125
00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:00,439
because rosin itself once again does not

126
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:03,399
have um a star rating

127
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,839
and I agree Indra has been an incredible

128
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,598
addition to Hash church although I'll

129
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,918
tell you he is now worried that since he

130
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,560
showed the liquid nitrogen trick that

131
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,719
people are going to hurt themselves with

132
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,120
liquid nitrogen he's very worried about

133
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,840
giving away information and people

134
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,319
turning around and harming themselves

135
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,918
because he did it with BHO and keep in

136
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,080
mind the majority of people who are

137
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:24,758
making BHO when I say the majority I'm

138
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:28,079
talking about

139
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,720
99.5% are not doing it properly they are

140
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,680
not doing the BH show properly they're

141
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,319
not following his patent properly and

142
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,280
there's little things that he does

143
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,598
within his chamber that moves the

144
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,318
material around and gets higher yields

145
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:43,719
and there's different things in regards

146
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,759
to how the chamber sits and how he uses

147
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,400
the gas to cool the reaction down and

148
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,360
all of these different things it's

149
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,120
seriously on his conscience dude he is

150
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,400
feel so bad about this BHO thing he's

151
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,680
happy that it's helping people he's

152
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,638
brutally um you know remorseful in the

153
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,800
sense that people have died from it and

154
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:08,000
and blown up and stuff so welcome uh MC

155
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,879
West to the room I thought I saw someone

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,079
else just pop in that I recognize but

157
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,639
now I forgotten their name yes quite a

158
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,800
few people want to license his patent

159
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,478
and you're welcome to get in touch with

160
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,280
me and I'll sort you out and get you in

161
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,000
touch uh with the right folks in that

162
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,839
way uh it's just been a little bit uh

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,720
crazy right now as I'm working out all

164
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:27,799
sorts of different licensing deals

165
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,039
myself not for BHO uh albeit but

166
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,038
different uh you know the water

167
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,439
extraction patent uh some dry sift uh

168
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:37,878
intellectual properties from Sam as well

169
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:40,160
as um from Indra so I'm also trying to

170
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,919
organize myself to make sure that at

171
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,400
least my own companies are taken care of

172
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:47,158
and I'm able to do the work that I want

173
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:50,560
to do and then uh obviously right as I

174
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:52,759
sign and seal my deals I will pass Indra

175
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,639
on to everyone that requests uh Mark

176
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,840
scalone who was at the top of the list

177
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,120
was very uh worried that um I wasn't

178
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,000
going to pass his information but it's

179
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,560
just been I I spoke with Indra today for

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,879
2 hours wonderful amazing conversations

181
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,079
and I'm actually calling him here in a

182
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,960
little bit uh I feel blessed to have him

183
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,359
in my life you know he contacted me a

184
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,399
long time ago and he told me that he was

185
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,598
this guy that created this method and

186
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,359
that if I could help him go online and

187
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:21,319
tell people what the wrong things were

188
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,400
that they were doing it became because I

189
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,120
tried to do that um I became very biased

190
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,758
in the eyes of everyone because I was

191
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,199
selling a product and they thought I was

192
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,439
just trying to put down BHO

193
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,839
I'm not trying to put down any

194
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,080
extraction process any process that

195
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,360
produces beautiful high quality resins

196
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,519
I'm in full support of I've just never

197
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,639
been in full support of everyone doing

198
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,839
something that's dangerous and not

199
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:48,519
understanding the ramifications of

200
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,399
exploding at 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit

201
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,959
and and burning so um I think that's why

202
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,360
Indra and I have gotten along all these

203
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,479
years when he started telling me these

204
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,200
things um I didn't give a shout out to S

205
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,320
the skunkman are you sure go back and

206
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,680
read that honestly go back I had to have

207
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,240
I I remember typing

208
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,719
it but uh yeah that threw me off a

209
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,759
little bit in my conversation so I think

210
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,040
it's time for another dab I would always

211
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:17,958
give skunkman Sam oh my God he's the

212
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,360
original OG Mentor that deserves all of

213
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,958
my praise and will always have it you

214
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,278
know now as a friend I'm in a different

215
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,239
situation as he's a friend and I try not

216
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,039
to blow smoke up my friend's asses but

217
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,600
as a

218
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,639
mentor I would really try to never

219
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,040
forget Ron I knew I was going to for or

220
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,759
Ron uh Sam I would I I I would I will

221
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:41,439
definitely go back and edit it if it's

222
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:44,200
not there so I'll look after this

223
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,160
video liquid nitrogen hey bro what temp

224
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,079
you dab at right now I'm dabbing at 590

225
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,120
some pretty low temp dabs some pretty

226
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:55,639
light colored

227
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,639
rosin flower rosin let's do it up

228
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:09,078
she's still working

229
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:12,759
Stevie you see my

230
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:12,759
little still working

231
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,079
perfect well John he didn't really give

232
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,240
directions properly as well he was just

233
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,239
sharing something he knew was

234
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,360
incredible

235
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,479
but enough of the large larger companies

236
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,679
have contacted me in regards to getting

237
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,000
in touch with them and uh hopefully some

238
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,199
of those guys work something out with

239
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,958
them and they figure out that they can

240
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,440
be more efficient and they can be safer

241
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,919
and they can lease his patent and he's

242
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,320
certainly not a greedy man I think it uh

243
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,039
he would be very reasonable with

244
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,200
companies that want to lease his patent

245
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,519
and I think uh he's already sort of

246
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,040
expressed that he has no interest in

247
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,600
putting companies out of business but

248
00:10:54,039 --> 00:11:00,399
I'll tell you uh I have faith in the man

249
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,560
when he says that his extraction are

250
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,240
much more efficient I I'm in full belief

251
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,679
that that that's the case so I look

252
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,159
forward to seeing all these different

253
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:12,919
processes that he's got going once I

254
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:15,199
can sign these uh ndas and get them out

255
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,199
of the

256
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,919
way how do you keep your nail in the

257
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,480
middle clean I dab so low that oil gets

258
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,439
down in there and clogs I don't got a

259
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,879
dil I don't know get a d now my nail is

260
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,160
huge it's not that clean but it's a big

261
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:33,639
Sapphire uh dish how I clean it is I

262
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:36,919
unplug it from the dabinator and I plug

263
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,799
it into the Dil 2.0 the Dil 2.0 is set

264
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:42,719
at 1,000 degrees and the dabinator is

265
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:45,838
set at 5 78

266
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,120
580 um well my my thoughts are that I'm

267
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:52,399
not overly bummed out about it

268
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,360
um um you know it's they they're they're

269
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,799
allowing Canadians to grow most people

270
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,480
so-called activists that had mm licenses

271
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,159
were so so worried about losing their

272
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,959
license they were just hoping that they

273
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:06,519
would get grandfathered in and I was

274
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,879
more along the lines that uh I was

275
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,560
unaccepting of any type of

276
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,439
grandfathering in and that we would

277
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,879
obviously have to fight for everyone's

278
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,120
right to grow cannabis not just a few

279
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,439
people uh that may have gotten a license

280
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,159
in during a a specific

281
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,279
time so yeah that's what I'm saying

282

00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:29,479
like my butane isn't uh isn't um uh

330
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,720
isn't a problem I don't use butane and

331
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,399
I'm sure the people that fight for

332
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,160
butane oil will have no problem changing

333
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,720
Health Canada's Minds especially someone

334
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,360
like Indra who could come in and show

335
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,079
the proper standard operating procedures

336
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,839
uh with everything done properly in

337
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:47,799
proper rooms um it's already being done

338
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,160
in Canada with food products so it's um

339
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,879
I don't think that the right people

340
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:52,360
would have a hard time uh showing them

341
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,720
where they made their mistake I'm more

342
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,120
align the lines of showing the

343
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,120
solventless methods so I'll be doing the

344
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,399
water and doing the um uh rosin and

345
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,159
doing the dry sift so that's what I'm

346
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:06,399
going to be doing those are my focuses

347
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,759
but I'm sure that people who are uh very

348
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,519
believing in the gas methods like Indra

349
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,039
will fight for those methods to be

350
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,560
allowed now as it stands I think it

351
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:18,360
makes sense that they don't allow those

352
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:20,799
products but the way someone like Indra

353
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,159
for SE could come in and build a lab and

354
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,559
get it done then it would make perfect

355
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,278
sense so it's just a matter of cannabis

356
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,359
once again catching up with the rest of

357
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,278
the world all of these machines all of

358
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,159
these methods extraction processes

359
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:37,120
shakers everything already exists in the

360
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:40,519
agricultural world uh it's just that

361
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,560
we're in um you know the Cannabis world

362
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,560
so what happens is is this information

363
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,159
trickles down into the Cannabis world

364
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,638
and people kind of get it right kind of

365
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,958
get it wrong and they build their little

366
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:53,318
worlds which we've done and now those

367
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:54,838
worlds are getting to to be too big for

368
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:56,599
the community that we were in and you

369
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,279
can see we're cracking and breaking into

370
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,278
this mainstream world uh things are

371
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,720
going to become more uh agricultural

372
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:06,360
things are going to become a little

373
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,959
closer uh together rather than divided

374
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,519
and once we can bring that wall down uh

375
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,838
well we'll be able to plant cannabis the

376
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,600
way it was supposed to be planted

377
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,120
outdoors in fields and we'll be able to

378
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
process mountains and mountains of the

379
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,039
raw product which will then be able to

380
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,759
turn be turned into all sorts of

381
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,360
different products and um yeah I think

382
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,360
it's going to be a a a welcome change

383
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,519
for the majority of the products there's

384
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,680
always going to be um the the the the

385
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,519
craft sort of cannabis Growers the

386
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:37,159
smaller um you know people that pay more

387
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,120
attention to things and I think that

388
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:43,078
they're both going to be um definitely

389
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:47,000
both well received in this upcoming um

390
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:47,000
economy that cannabis is blooming

391
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,919
into oh well you know Nick I'm just

392
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:55,958
going to make a another great show you

393
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,599
know the the the plan is that every time

394
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:01,159
I mention a plan people don't show up

395
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,759
people flake so I don't mention plans

396
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,599
and I told Rob Clark that a couple of

397
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:08,880
weeks ago on hash church when he was uh

398
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:11,119
kind of whining a little bit about um

399
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,880
about you know the the way that it works

400
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,198
and sometimes there's that he would

401
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,439
rather be um scheduled in and I said man

402
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,279
I'll schedule you in no problem you just

403
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,759
got to let me know in advance then the

404
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:25,199
problem I have generally with scheduling

405
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,879
people in is that they [ __ ] flake

406
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,798
every time I

407
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,960
do um have I heard have I tried any of

408
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:35,720
Matt rise's hash no I have not I have

409
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,120
not

410
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,600
um I I'm I'm doing okay

411
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,959
though as John D was saying on giveaway

412
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,798
yesterday growing is a full-time job

413
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,400
when done right hold on we need to grow

414
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,359
on medicine then and only then will

415
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,480
really yeah you know it's not really

416
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:53,798
realistic for everyone to do you know

417
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,679
grow their own medicine I think that um

418
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:57,519
it's reasonable for some and it's and

419
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,080
it's a lot of work but for some it's

420
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:03,639
just completely not reasonable to try

421
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:06,798
and uh grow their own uh cannabis for

422
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,880
medicine so I think that it's important

423
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,319
that we should always be allowed to but

424
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,440
the idea of everyone growing their own

425
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:14,960
is just not realistic that certain it's

426
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,080
kind of like do you grow all your own

427
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,240
food do you make all your own clothes do

428
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:21,399
you you know like all of these other

429
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,599
things in life we have industries that

430
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,200
we use it's like and it's another funny

431
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,879
thing actually about when people slam

432
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,279
down big corporations cuz I almost

433
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,559
guarantee your phone uh the computer

434
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,918
screen you're on right now and your

435
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,558
television and where you buy your

436
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,440
groceries and your clothes and all these

437
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,720
other things are giant corporations uh

438
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,360
people are just freaked out about it

439
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,360
with cannabis they're freaked out

440
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,439
they're like ah you don't want to

441
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:45,240
support those big corporations it's like

442
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,000
really while you're wearing Levi's jeans

443
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,759
and uh you know a marks workor Warehouse

444
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,880
shirt with a a a a a forum hat and a

445
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,839
iPhone in your hand uh I think I always

446
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,360
will want to grow but I'm telling you

447
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:02,279
right now if I could just go and buy at

448
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:05,279
a very reasonable price full melt sifts

449
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,240
and rosins and dry and water hashes and

450
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,519
all different types of extractions and

451
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,558
products for really really great

452
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:16,359
prices [ __ ] I'd be I'd be all over that

453
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:19,399
right now the growing your own is more

454
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:21,678
realistic because the ex the insane

455
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,280
insane price that people pay for

456
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,679
cannabis uh and it's insane trust me

457
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,200
like when we slam pharmaceutical

458
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,120
companies for overcharging for their

459
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,798
drugs it's it's really not too different

460
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:35,558
for charging the amount of money that

461
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:38,319
this [ __ ] plant sells for and I know

462
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:41,038
it's because of prohibition as well as

463
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:44,158
greed those two combinations make for

464
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:46,519
very expensive pot and make it good pot

465
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:47,799
or great pot and that seems to even be

466
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,440
more of a reason to be like well you're

467
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:51,879
going to pay like 600 for this I'm sorry

468
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,320
well what's a great price what's

469
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,360
reasonable Pennies on the gram and

470
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,319
dollars on the grams for concentrates

471
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:01,759
what people could afford if you want to

472
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:05,359
use gram a day uh and you know or even

473
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:08,200
more then it can't be $100 a day that's

474
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:11,439
$ 3,000 [ __ ] dollar a a month which

475
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,279
is $30,000 a year just for just for your

476
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,880
cannabis resin that's that's

477
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,359
unreasonable to me it's it's insane it

478
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,919
doesn't cost any more to grow than

479
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:23,719
tomatoes it's the prohibition that has

480
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:26,400
jacked the price up and it's what people

481
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,440
love about Prohibition and even in this

482
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,519
legal flip where it's going to be legal

483
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,000
now people still don't want to get rid

484
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,359
of that prohibition dollar they're like

485
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,319
well people are used to paying it let's

486
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:38,798
just keep it up there it's like I'll

487
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,798
tell you

488
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:45,558
man yeah I think so too Cody dandi of

489
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:48,399
course they will absolutely uh only on a

490
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:51,240
few occasions Chandler like

491
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,559
twice yep and then exactly and then

492
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,120
insurance and then insurance insurance

493
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,119
you know what I'm saying

494
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,158
well I mean yeah I don't even like to

495
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,079
compare alcohol and cannabis at all I

496
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,760
think it's insane I think it's like a

497
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,319
comparing uh you know teddy bears and

498
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:26,240
grenades it's like one soft and cuddly

499
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:28,879
and one will blow your [ __ ] head off

500
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,079
uh what a crazy thing to con stantly

501
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:35,120
bring cannabis into the comparison of

502
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:37,960
alcohol when alcohol is a killer it's

503
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:41,879
just a killer there's no comparison I

504
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,960
just uh yeah I don't know let's hope

505
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,640
here in Canada we're we're slowly but

506
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,480
surely crushing it as Hillary black

507
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,679
comes into the room the you know one of

508
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,000
the one of the leading activists in my

509
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:58,240
opinion from day one in all of this who

510
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,038
actually has an Integrity a very pretty

511
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,919
[ __ ]

512
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,640
like bulletproof one I I might add

513
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,400
what's my favorite dool piece my

514
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,679
favorite denil piece is the sapphire

515
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:12,640
Bowl this one right here that's the one

516
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,840
hello I was jealous You Salt Spring

517
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,559
Islander I was seeing that your post and

518
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:18,359
was like oh there's a Salt Spring Island

519
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,158
Gathering I'd love to put the boat in

520
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,240
and just hit

521
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,120
that well Jason a because it'll get the

522
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,839
price right exactly it will get the

523
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,558
price and because also no one else is

524
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:31,119
really producing it if all of a sudden

525
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:33,558
tons of other people had that same

526
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:35,519
product and they were bringing it in and

527
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:37,359
if you if you look at why it's expensive

528
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,839
it's because they're comparing it to the

529
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,000
price they need to get of what their

530
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,000
herb is worth and what how much it's

531
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
always the same thing it's based on the

532
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,359
prices of the market which I don't care

533
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,240
how much people want to say we've we've

534
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,319
we've organized cannabis to a point

535
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,440
where it's almost legal the prices are

536
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:59,359
the same as prohibition if not worse and

537
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,960
I would love for anyone to tell me that

538
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:06,038
I'm wrong on that that a dispensary or a

539
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,278
LP or a whatever isn't selling cannabis

540
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:10,480
for as expensive as you ever paid in

541
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:14,720
your

542
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:17,759
life yes Hugo I remember Hugo Hugo was a

543
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:21,360
32 ooun Haze plant that Ron and I grew

544
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:24,839
back in the day in Winnipeg and it

545
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:28,479
was it was amazing it was straight

546
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:30,558
amazing that was a land race sativa or

547
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,038
narrow Leaf drug cultivar whatever you

548
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,519
want to call it that I'll just never

549
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,480
forget it was so special it's literally

550
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:41,599
why I named my son his middle name Hayes

551
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,759
was basically because of Hugo it filled

552
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,759
up the whole back of the truck it was

553

584

585
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,200

587
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,600
it yeah well I have a couple of sons so

588
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,159
I'm sure one day they'll be seen if they

589
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,678
decide to be you know it's up to them

590
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,679
and it's their

591
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,759
decision yeah but how is it made and

592
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:32,079
what's what's the quality and are there

593
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:35,278
you know medic mer capatin and heavy

594
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:37,000
metal contaminants or Mystery Oil I mean

595
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,038
it's another worry I have about people

596
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,679
selling BHO as medicine should be really

597
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,720
careful with that especially with the

598
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:47,840
knowledge that Indra is laying out you

599
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,759
know make sure you're covering all your

600
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,959
bases o dry sift or good bubble dry sift

601
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:55,879
or great bubble are both my my favorite

602
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,759

603
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,240

604
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:03,960
daughter as well Grace I absolutely do

605
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,919
have a daughter she was my first in

606
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,798
fact my first was a girl I have three

607
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:12,000
children and very happy with all of them

608
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:15,558
they're amazing people they teach me

609
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,240
much about life I don't look at it as me

610
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:19,639
being their teacher so much as them

611
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,440
being my

612
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,799
teacher I'm not too sure Jason you know

613
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,159
Indra is his own man he'll drop what he

614
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,278
feels like dropping he's uh he's kind of

615
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:30,720
a character that way I'm sure regardless

616
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,558
of it he's going to come back and talk

617
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,960
about liquid nitrogen cuz he phoned me

618
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,720
right after and he was like you know I

619
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,000
talked about liquid nitrogen and that

620
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,000
way of combining oil with triome heads

621
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,558
and making Temple balls and I'm a little

622
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,159
bit worried that people are going to

623
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:49,398
hurt themselves with liquid nitrogen I.E

624
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,278
not understanding how important it is to

625
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:54,639
say we safety equipment around liquid

626
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,240
nitrogen you if you like don't do it in

627
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,840
sandals cuz if you dropped liquid

628
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,359
nitrogen on your foot it would [ __ ]

629
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,439
burn you so badly and the same thing

630
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,879
even with shoes with laces it could get

631
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,840
through and roll through there um so

632
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,120
it's probably uh pretty important for

633
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:11,959
him to come first and talk about safety

634
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,278
precautions um handling liquid nitrogen

635
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,000
CU he is worried that people are going

636
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:18,839
to hurt themselves doing that now uh and

637
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,919
uh so he's kind of an awesome guy I

638
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:23,199
can't give him enough props

639
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:26,559
really that's what I'm saying Nick you

640
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,399
know what I'm saying like please he

641
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,440
doesn't want to do that he wants wants

642
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,879
to so you know when he comes on this

643
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,399
week whether he shares his secret or not

644
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,799
cuz he's he's told me look before I

645
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,839
share another secret I have to give

646
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:43,398
people like proper how to handle these

647
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:46,158
things because

648
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:47,959
um I don't see my myself tracking down

649
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,559
that stuff just to mix my hash and oil

650
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,480
well liquid nitrogen is not that hard to

651
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:53,440
track down and honestly once you see

652
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,839
people doing it you may very well change

653
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,399
your mind in regards to the product that

654
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:58,839
is being produced is going to be a

655
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:00,439
little bit different than hash and a

656
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:02,359
little bit different than oil being

657
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,038
because it's both it's going to have a

658
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:07,000
little bit of a different profile that

659
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:08,960
will produce different medicine so I

660
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,759
think once you see a few people rocking

661
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,679
it out I I myself am going to do it with

662
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:14,720
some rosin and some dry sift as well as

663
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,720
some rosin and some bubble hash get some

664
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,720
nice pictures you know pass the medicine

665
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,759
around to some patients and see how it

666
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,480
differs from maybe the same uh uh rosin

667
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,879
or the same water hash but being the two

668
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,798
combined see and combined in a very

669
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,399
unique way anytime you do something cold

670
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:33,720
with cannabis you're better off than

671
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:35,879
doing it

672
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,839
warm oh

673
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,679
really we better crack that back

674
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:43,079
on got to crack it into the right unit

675
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,440
before I take my

676
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:47,278
dab what about Carbonite it was good

677
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,278
enough to freeze hand solo hey [ __ ] give

678
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:52,599
it a shot come tell us about it in uh

679
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:52,599
hash

680
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,759
Church come up for hash Church you'll

681
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,200
come up for that b man I don't know what

682
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,720
I said you'll come up for what Nick

683
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,679
reading so many different things trying

684
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,240
to keep uh track of this

685
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,919
chat oh just do a little uh Google

686
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,919
search Justin it's not that hard to

687
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:16,440
find um well he's claimed not 99 but

688
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,159
he's claimed that there's um that he

689
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,840
gets a very very high percentage of

690
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,760
heads like over 80 maybe 90 maybe even

691
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:25,480
higher and then he has another process

692
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:27,919
that he uses to clean it

693
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,839
so oh the liquid nitrogen will be in the

694
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,000
like the next day or

695
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:34,000
two that's going to be on the quick

696
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,919
quick yeah well

697
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,919
yeah the

698
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:49,199
Ln Google Justin

699
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,278
Google it is your

700
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,798
friend it'll tell you everything you

701
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:57,599
need to know for where you live welcome

702
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:00,720
Gabriel T farro have you seen the melts

703
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:04,278
claiming 99% in their water hash I have

704
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,759
not but uh that's absurd and ridiculous

705
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:06,759
to say the

706
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:13,240
least I'm surprised they would make such

707
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,240
a such a claim

708
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:41,639
who's to know who's to

709
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:41,640
know welcome

710
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:51,319
Chris o that was a real nice low temp

711
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:55,678
dab that one felt more like around

712
00:30:51,319 --> 00:31:00,240
450 Sapphire I'm hitting that Sapphire

713
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,240
Wayne you should have a dab Jamie like

714

you'll feel great when you come back

718
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,880
it's always nice to take a little

719
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:22,720
break see where you sit see how cannabis

720
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,840
is affecting your body whether it be

721
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,200
mental or emotional or physical

722
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:31,558
or everyone's different it's it's a good

723
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,200
thing to do yes aristotles thank you

724
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:35,319
good to see you guys all as well it's

725
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,919
nice to read your words H it's nice to

726
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:39,240
do these live chats I really enjoy them

727
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:39,240
quite a

728
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:50,879
bit no problem Evan that actually came

729
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,880
from Jim fra uh

730
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,120
chemist believe he has a PHD in

731
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,960
chemistry that's uh much of that

732
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,839
knowledge that I spit uh in that

733
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:04,399
question that you mentioned about uh

734
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:07,879
lipid pneumonia came from Jim he's very

735
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:10,359
uh articulate and very intelligent and

736
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,960
um it's always good to pass on great

737
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:14,959
information like that and make sure yeah

738
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,079
[ __ ] a I'm getting high are you

739
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,919
kidding me uh it's always great to pass

740
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:21,519
on information like that to people that

741
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:23,480
are also you know looking for good

742
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,960
information and want to understand

743
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,200
rather than assume there's so much

744
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:31,519
assumption going on in this industry

745
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,798
I've tried CBD pure CBD pure CBN pure

746
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,278
CBG pure THC a acid versions of all

747
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,200
those things but of course he them all

748
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:42,319
up and made them uh decarbox and had the

749
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:46,759
non- acid version uh as well with tpine

750
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:48,558
modulations CBD is um kind of like Sam

751
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:50,558
has mentioned it's the anti-h high for

752
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:54,079
me you know someone like me and Sam

753
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:56,599
particularly we love the effects of THC

754
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:58,558
uh we love the strong effects of feeling

755
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,719
elevated or high

756
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,798
um not too much going on with that with

757
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,360
CBD it's kind of the opposite takes that

758
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,319
feeling in the other direction very

759
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:08,798
medicinal for a lot of people probably

760
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:11,678
even enjoyable recreationally for some

761
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:11,679
uh not for me

762
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,440
though well you know I think it's always

763
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,319
easy for a company that makes oil to say

764
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,399
lipid pneumonia is not a real thing I

765
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,079
think it's a lot harder to deny people

766
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:27,079
who suffer from it or whether it's lipid

767
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,319
pneumonia or chronic bronchitis or a

768
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,359
different name

769
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:34,000
there have been people who smoke chronic

770
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:36,158
amounts of oil um who get these chronic

771
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,679
bronchitis who are affecting their lungs

772
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,278
in a in a deep way and it makes sense

773
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:42,159
when you understand the science of it

774
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:44,319
the way Jim spits it out with the polar

775
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,679
non-polar and semi-polar components and

776
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,398
the non-polar solvent leaving behind all

777
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,679
the semipolar and the polar components

778
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,638
and the polar and the semipolar

779
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,798
components acting as nucleation points

780
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:55,599
in the lungs and keeping those nauseous

781
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,879
plant waxes from actually getting deeper

782
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,480
into the lungs where they could do

783
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,039
damage and create chronic bronchitis to

784
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,120
me it makes a ton of sense and uh I

785
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:06,319
certainly wouldn't dismiss it and if it

786
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:09,239
was an oil company telling me that it

787
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:13,480
didn't exist I would probably dismiss

788
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:15,838
them before I dismissed Jim fr the

789
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,240
chemist well I mean there's another one

790
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,799
right fake I've know I knew a guy that

791
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,598
had it and it freaked him out and he

792
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,839
sure didn't want to have it most people

793
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,838
who get it don't even want to Pro talk

794
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,039
about it it's like uh blowing up in your

795
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,440
lab you just uh you just move move on

796
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:31,239
you don't really talk about it unless it

797
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,679
makes the paper you never hear people

798
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,479
talking about how they blew up unless it

799
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,039
makes the paper because they don't want

800
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,679
to promote that they don't want that to

801
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,559
be a part of the reality that was a

802
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,440
mouthful Grace you know I kind of did

803
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:45,039
that in a sense to let the person know

804
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,918
who thought I was getting really high

805
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,960
and I was no longer able to articulate

806
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:53,960
my message that I was actually still

807
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,960
able to pull out some uh some

808
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,400
language what do I think about venil

809
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,838
Vaporite I'm not too sure Henry what I

810
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,838
think about

811
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,719
that I'm way on the other side over in

812
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,000
Vancouver here well kind of between

813
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:08,879
Vancouver and Whistler and it's a

814
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,519
beautiful day I'm hoping on going and

815
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,000
