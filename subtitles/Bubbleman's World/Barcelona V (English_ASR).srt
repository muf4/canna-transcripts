gonna watch the court case and hopefully

287
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:47,109

288
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:52,880
that's what I won't have anything jumped

289

[Music]

290
00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:04,280
legally legalization well I believe that

291
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:04,279
patients gonna win this

292
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,839
the amounts or maybe actually genius

293
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,850
some kind of a change of course but at

294
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,069
the same time I mean hey it's medicine

295
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:17,009
that's gonna be hard to take away the

296
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:18,879
rights for people that gets better

297
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:20,859
therapy and stuff like that

298
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,750
frankly those judges you know much yeah

299
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:24,339
of course you do the right thing way too

300
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,089
much right they need to give us the

301
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:26,769
right girl

302
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:30,069
it sure seems as though Health Canada's

303
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:32,170
taken a very aggressive stance against

304
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:34,210
us so far well one thing I find totally

305
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:35,980
unreasonable is seeing that you know a

306
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:38,350
lot of our patients are on fixed income

307
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,360
I think seventy percent are is that they

308
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:42,339
wants to take her meds the other night

309
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,990
before and destroy the perfectly good

310
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:45,939
match and then the next date purchase

311
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,920
meant there's no grace period of six

312
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,630
months say hey you got 62 you have to

313
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,310
stop growing in this period but egg your

314
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,380
excess wheat you have this much time to

315
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:55,480
use it up you're not even giving us any

316
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,160
this ones they throw the toilet destroy

317
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,490
it with Kenya later to buy [ __ ] the next

318
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,529
steps

319
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,269
Oh lately unreasonable yeah and at the

320
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:02,769
same time we have to document how we

321
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:04,180
destroy the company class what it's

322
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:06,789
doing on the ground it's going in the

323
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,410
garbage put on a piece of paper and send

324
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:11,079
it to health can develop like if we

325
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:14,560
don't on April 30th they gonna let the

326
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,329
local RCMP or the cops of first day give

327
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,589
them all of our addresses and saying hey

328
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:20,409
these guys didn't destroy their

329
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:22,869
marijuana so now they are criminals so

330
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:25,060
they are about to ready to turn thirty

331
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:27,789
nine thousand patients in Canada into

332
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:29,440
criminals so there's some major problems

333
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,418
happening up in Canada and you know the

334
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,548
rest of

335
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:35,940
here that medical patients been growing

336
00:28:32,548 --> 00:28:37,618
their medicine Ella since 2001 and now

337
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,239
they're saying you can't do that anymore

338
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:41,339
we're gonna sell it to you at an

339
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:42,869
inflated price diamond from me roughly

340
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,058
