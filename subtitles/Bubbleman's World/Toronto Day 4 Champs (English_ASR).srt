167
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:09,839
and choose the options that you want in

168
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:11,959
your car and so you also have um rure

169
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,519
Tech that you're that you guys now have

170
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:18,478
doing rure in

171
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,478
America yes this is like Tech is

172
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:26,120
like's innovation meets tradition so

173
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:30,519
Innovation meets tradition yes and it is

174
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:34,038
about the culation systems in

175
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:37,158
classic is only the diffuser as a purp

176
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:41,519
laser and here they have all kinds of 10

177
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:44,439
trees and barrels and recyclers and uh

178
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:48,278
that's the American flavor uh which is

179
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:52,480
also not so big in Europe in Europe

180
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:54,759
people like the traditional uh uh uh

181
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,240
smoking machine do you see the dabbing

182
00:08:54,759 --> 00:09:01,519
culture popularizing in Europe a little

183
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,759
a little bit in C certain countries more

184
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,440
certain events here but it's still very

185
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:14,360
small compared to here I don't know all

186
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:14,360
the reasons but uh we have um weel also

187
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,958
some show it and sometimes people come

188
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,240
in the shop and say hey what is that so

189
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,239
you can nobody would ask you what is

190
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,278
that they all know about how much is

191
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,759
that yes yes and there not this

192
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:33,439
availability from titanium and all that

193
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:35,759
stuff it's only rare places where people

194
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,720
start slowly right

195
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,480
yeah and what do you think of all these

196
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,560
electric nails that are happening do you

197
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,639
have an interest in uh does rer have any

198
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,359
interest in the electric nail Market

199
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,879
yeah probably I think it's a good thing

200
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,680
you don't handle this flame and the

201
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,838
propane gas which can be dangerous and

202
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,120
uh it's definitely perceived to be more

203
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,120
hardcore by Regular People yeah it's

204
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,440
probably also more good for medical

205
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:07,720
and using it at home very like cultural

206
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,440
uh so I think it's a good idea and and I

207
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,120
I want to look here also get some

208
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,079
contacts probably to find out some

209
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,120
teaming up with a with the electro name

210
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:21,359

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,560

219
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,040
pushing the envelope of that unit and

220
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:44,919

448
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,079

450
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:30,439

452
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:42,038
Happy 420 yeah we're going to make some

453
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,038
dry sift hash I'm not just going to talk

454
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:46,640
to the camera I'm going to talk to

455
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:49,640
everyone while we're making this hat so

456
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,640
this is both uh the way that John and I

457
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,679
uh extract our medicine off of the

458
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,120
plants that we grow in our personal

459
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,559
licenses so we take whole plants we dry

460
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,599
them for 2 to 3 weeks this is actually

461
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:05,158
dry the uh wax membrane of the glandular

462
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:07,558
triome head this is important when we

463
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,919
say we're dry shifting you can't really

464
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:12,879
do it with fresh material because the

465
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,400
wax membrane is going to be hydrated and

466
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,440
it's not you want to see it when it has

467
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,400
ridges in it when it shrinks and it has

468
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,880
these little ridges not when it's bulous

469
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,919
and fresh so you do need to dry your

470
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:28,440
material how long you been drying about

471
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:31,440
a month or two at least eight weeks plus

472
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,480
it's this is exceptional beautiful

473
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,360
awesome her uh it's John strain the med

474
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,798
Kush totally floral bouet nose to it

475
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:44,759
very strong John uses it for pain relief

476
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:46,720
and John has a fa amount of

477
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:48,759
pain so we're going to we're going to

478
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,120
grind that medic cush up gently over the

479
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:57,119
screams and we're going to make some

480
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,119
dry realized

481
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:08,679
all right

482
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:11,239
so I like my bottom

483
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:12,519
screen upside down like this cuz this is

484
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,159
the screen we're going to clean the

485
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:17,440
resin that we extract we'll get back to

486
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:17,440
this

487
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:25,918
screen yeah meditators are very

488
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:28,720
handy in this whole

489
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,399
process all right so this gives us a

490
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,720
little bit of a space between the two

491
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:35,798
screens and it'll allow us to work over

492
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,319
the top screen with the Cannabis and

493
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:39,038
eventually we'll take this screen we'll

494
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,639
get it out of the way and then we'll

495
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,200
work the secondary screen most people

496
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,360
know what we're doing with the first

497
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,038
screen bouncing raw cannabis buds

498
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:52,000
flowers over the screen and when we say

499
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:54,640
we're bouncing raw cannabis flowers

500
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,839
we're bouncing raw cannabis flowers

501
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,840
They're bouncing

502
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,960
a lot of people don't know what they

503
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:03,639
should do at this point they're like

504
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,600
should crush it all up in powder John

505
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,480
has a method that he likes to get the

506
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:11,558
best of the best of the best so we do a

507
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,839
very gentle gentle light

508
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:16,558
system one of the things people will be

509
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,359
amazed at and slightly disappointed is

510
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,158
that we're not going to get an enormous

511
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:22,439
amount of a yield what we're trying to

512
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,039
show people is is that the prohibition

513
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,759
based way of thinking about cannabis and

514
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:30,158
the numbers that we think about in oh I

515
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,879
got a pound cannabis well pound of

516
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:37,200
cannabis might be 20 G of cannabis res

517
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:41,080
if it's dryed it might only be like 10 G

518
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:44,000
maybe five so we're working in a 1 to 5%

519
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:47,439
return for a product like this and we're

520
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,759
using beautiful bus well if you want

521
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,720
quality you got to use quality to get F

522
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:56,558
quality right so Betty

523
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,079
cush if you go I've w a few hand CHS

524
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,918
here in the last few years with it

525
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:05,439
very nice very cushy very

526
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,240
resinous this year we're going to dry SI

527
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,679
to show you the true medicine one of the

528
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,880
things about dry sifting is that

529
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,720
something that will help you enormously

530
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,760
which is great if you're from Ontario is

531
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,079
doing it in the cold so for like 7

532
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,480
months of the year it's cold here you

533
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,839
can go outside and you can do this and

534
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,480
the glands is so much more brittle when

535
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:28,918
it's cold that they really do break off

536
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,519
much easier

537
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,360
without it's a counterintuitive process

538
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,319
you want it to shake the [ __ ] out of it

539
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,158
but then you'll get a lot of contaminant

540
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:39,960
because water is not present water's not

541
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,799
keeping everything afloat the Bubble

542
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,720
Bags make this process a joke the Bubble

543
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:49,839
Bags will extract through the water

544
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,839
being used water soluble tures and

545
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,038
terpenoids that are flavors that

546
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,439
modulate canono and that we would rather

547
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:58,200
have a present in our medicine rather

548
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,399
than extracting into the pocket and then

549
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,640
pour down the drain I personally feed it

550
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,639
to my plants I'm not sure if it's going

551
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,679
to increase their turine content but I

552
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,399
definitely pour my bubble water right

553
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:13,038
into the roots of my cannabis plants and

554
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:15,239
they seem to like it I like it as you

555
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:18,440
can see this stuff look like bold dry it

556
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,159
just slowly coming apart

557
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,960
but very sticky we got a bit of a warm

558
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:28,360
temperature here we should should still

559
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,360
be able to uh sift up some nice resin

560
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,599
[Applause]

561
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,840
very very very light right there look at

562
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,840
the

563
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,159
color so generally when you're at home

564
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,839
doing your own medicine and you're doing

565
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,960
a light bounce like this you can make it

566
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:00,599
up for a hit or two hits or freeh hits

567
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,120
depending on how much cannabis you're

568
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:06,439
using there's a variety of ways to

569
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:09,000
extract the resin carefully so that you

570
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,000
don't do what everyone does the mistake

571
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,599
is

572
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,519
um overe extracting extracting too much

573
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:18,879
contaminant and being left with a

574
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:21,120
product that you don't know how to clean

575
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,640
that resin is so sticky when I touched

576
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:26,839
it for the car it started to melt and

577
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:31,399
liquefy in my hands so this is not your

578
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:34,199
ideal condition to do dry SI exactly

579
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:37,239
come take a rip while we're doing this

580
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:40,080
mat and even in the meder

581
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,240
she Matt's got some finished product of

582
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:46,480
dry sip that uh he tumbled it was about

583
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:49,798
50% gland heads I cleaned it so it was

584
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,720
about 99% gland heads and it turned into

585
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:55,278
this unbelievable the the quality was

586
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,440
always there but without the Purity you

587
00:29:55,278 --> 00:30:00,558
can sometimes not perceive that the

588
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,720
quality is there even though with Barb

589
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:06,798
you can even at 30% heads you can look

590
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,839
at Barb and go that is insane each time

591
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,839
you clean it you're like no

592
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:22,000
no this is going to be a bit of a I'm

593
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,720
going to grind it straight up by now

594
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,519
yeah this is a slow process we do the

595
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,600
grinding we get it broken up smaller and

596
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:30,278
smaller cold environments the worst

597
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,519
environment to be doing this but we want

598
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:34,679
to do it for you anyway breaking it up

599
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:37,278
over the screens and then when the resin

600
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,200
falls through the second screen that's

601
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,798
where the work comes in we need to clean

602
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,960
that resin and how we clean it is we

603
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:46,558
push the contaminant through the tighter

604
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,079
screen hole while hopefully being left

605
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,519
with just the grand heads of 70 micr on

606
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:56,119
en larg everything else we have to break

607
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,120
through the screen that's the second

608
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:21,599
you see why it's a good idea to not use

609
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:26,240
this screen upside down you'll end up

610
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:26,240
losing your nuggets all over the floor

611
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:32,480
L touching the buds and not squeezing

612
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,960
them so as to not heat up the glands and

613
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,759
press them onto my

614
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,159
fingers when you start photographing and

615
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:42,398
spending time with your cannabis on a

616
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:44,840
macro level like this level you realize

617
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:48,319
that things that you do and the way you

618
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:50,798
handle the product can produce even that

619
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,759
1% of contaminant which to anyone that's

620
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:53,918
like

621
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,798
OCD

622
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,320
German she just

623
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:00,879
like like get that hair out of it looks

624
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:04,678
like a Monster

625
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,840
yeah scary if I ever taken like shatter

626
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,840
that

627
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,399
look well someone told me recently

628
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:16,518
cannabis cop or maybe it was the secret

629
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:19,398
cop they said your your resin can go

630
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:23,880
from first place to 30th with the dog

631
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:25,439
hair in it just someone like going oh 30

632
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,600
could have been a

633
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,440
contender dog hair and the cleaner you

634
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:35,119
get a product the more readily available

635
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:38,240
it is to see contaminant the easier you

636
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,839
make it to see stuff that doesn't belong

637
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,759
so even if the more you clean it you can

638
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:44,918
get out a ton of [ __ ] people are like oh

639
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,798
it almost looks cleaner before even

640
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,840
though it had these 20 contaminants in

641
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,759
it sh out now it only has two

642
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:53,199
contaminants but they stick out like

643
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:53,200
sore

644
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:59,158
PS it's weird

645
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:01,278
I'm I'm going to have a hit where's my I

646
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,278
know

647
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,398
I so that's what I've be doing with my

648
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:11,440
medicine lately if I'm not doing this

649
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:13,879
putting in ice and water do it together

650
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,440
doing it together got to start this over

651
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,559
the world

652
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,278
do John's breaking it up grinding it

653
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:23,960
down a little bit it

654
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,720
down way better to use a medtainer for

655
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,440
this and really what a good idea would

656
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,679
be on this one no doubt

657
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,600
fill your maintainer with ice and then

658
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,519
when you're grinding the whole thing's

659
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,519
cold and you get this real

660
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:41,558
nice warmer you get it the more you're

661
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,399
working

662
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:47,879
against what you just bu the

663
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:49,000
street got a ton of people standing

664
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,760
around

665
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,319
and I just ready to put it in there

666
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,558
store it for a while the best thing

667
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:57,918
about a me you actually have it in there

668
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:00,798
how many mic50

669
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,440
and 70 so you got an extraction screen

670
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,839
and then you got a cleaning screen you

671
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,720
can clean the resin the farmer screen

672
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:09,039
and then you work it together to make

673
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,599
itable if you want to you don't have to

674
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:15,800
work it when you make this cleaning all

675
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,800
you have to do is go up

676
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:29,719
this got to dry it you got to dry the

677
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,720
bubble now

678
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,599
Johnny you know you know good friend

679
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:13,480
we do both turn our entire props into

680
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:15,598
half washing dry sifting coconut oil

681
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,240
extraction get the medicine people are

682
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,000
like wow that's crazy I'm like I know

683
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:20,879
when I get pizza I open the box and eat

684
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,760
it and throw the Box away that's crazy

685
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,760
too I know it's not really crazy

686
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:40,838
I've only grown one cl of the string

687
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:45,000
damn I photographed it with my ma

688
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:45,000
lens she is

689
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:53,639
photogenic just let

690
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,639
our how much

691
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:03,159
too much to get out

692
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,920
of yeah it's just a matter of gently

693
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:09,559
sifting it back and forth breaking it up

694
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,760
in countries like Morocco in 1965 a

695
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,119
Nigerian by the name of Mustafa showed

696
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,400
up with Lebanese screening techniques

697
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:20,480
and changeed that way that country works

698
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,599
with Canabis I mean the rip is one of

699
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,559
the largest hash producing areas in the

700
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,000
world it produces some of the most hash

701
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,400
not necessarily the best but definitely

702
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,119
the most and it all started with one guy

703
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,838
and some screening techniques that he

704
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,760
rolled in now the Moroccans what they do

705
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:40,039
is they break up the herb they they wrap

706
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,960
it in this drum that has a tight screen

707
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:43,960
over the top of it and then they've got

708
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,720
these sticks and if you're in the farm

709
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,199
area in Morocco in the ri you can hear

710
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:52,559
in these distant Farms

711
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:54,159
this and it's like they're drumming and

712
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,119
some of them have different beats but

713
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:59,078
most of them are all

714
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:03,519
do and it's like all over the place you

715
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:05,079
can he this a little bit more gentle if

716
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,358
you're that r with it you end up

717
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:09,359
contamin basically just smashing up the

718
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,480
herb till it's small enough to fit

719
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:14,519
through the screen we're going at it

720
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:17,280
from a different angle we're like gently

721
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:19,440
rubbing the resin the the plant matter

722
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,000
over the screen to just let those heads

723
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,240
fall through hopefully with not as much

724
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,159
contaminant I'm grinding the [ __ ] out of

725
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,679
it so I can get it all up yeah I didn't

726
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,039
want it it's your

727
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:33,799
medicine and then John could easily take

728
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,838
this cannabis and he could decarbox it

729
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,318
and he could put it in caps and he can

730
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:41,799
take his daily as another supplement to

731
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:41,800
I do

732
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:47,759
actually so we know this is a bit of a

733
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:58,280
process

734
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:58,280
good oh no save the best right

735
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,440
a lot of people are just like wow you're

736
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,440
going to throw Bud like that into

737
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:15,279
water smells nice

738
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,279
tast people aren't even listening to

739
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,759
us hey and that right person hashing get

740
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,440
a

741
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,440
free yeah exactly

742
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:34,480
wor at the chance

743
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,960
show

744
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,960
everywhere was

745
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:04,980
[Applause]

746
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:20,519
[Music]

747
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:22,639
is that em ever coming

748
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:27,719
back

749
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,719
anybody John John's taking

750
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:39,318
I like the look

751
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:41,760
M

752
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:45,039
here

753
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,839
my I went over to get it and they got it

754
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:47,838
well hello there

755
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:03,039
bar so this is full Barb dryp that he he

756
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:05,119
uh made and I cleaned basically a very

757
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:07,318
similar process although he used a large

758
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,039
Tumblr then I took it put it over

759
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:10,838
another screen and cleaned it up the

760
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,679
same thing we're doing right here you

761
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:13,679
can produce this

762
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,640
stuff just like

763
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,880
that awesome my little you can get a

764
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:35,960
Barb seeds over at the great Gardener uh

765
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,960
Booth 5.9 these

766
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,570
[Music]

767
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,240
wonderful looks like a lot like a

768
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,879
support people doing good

769
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,960
work when you have more bu and you're in

770
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,680
a colder environment you can really

771
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,119
spend more time balancing just the bud

772
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:25,239
this is like probably less than 100 G of

773
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:28,318
Bud 60 or 70 I don't know generally 100

774
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:30,759
G of bug will have maybe 10 G full melt

775
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:33,800
water hash on it but it could have as

776
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,400
low as four to 5 G of full melt dry sip

777
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,400
I'm only expecting a ground it could be

778
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,960
that low

779
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:42,760
oneck my mentor who taught me a lot

780
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:47,199
about this who made this particular hash

781
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:51,680
he usually gets 10 G per

782
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,679
kilo so that is a 1%

783
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:58,199
return down

784
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:02,280
theet that's skunkman sand do not in the

785
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:06,118
know originator of scum number

786
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:11,680
one superb member of the

787
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,680
can I'm like grinding a damn

788
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,119
inspir Jo

789
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:38,719
so with this material I like to kind of

790
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:41,039
throw it across the screen I'm not too

791
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,799
like rubbing it hard but I like to sort

792
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:46,159
of throw the material across the

793
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,839
screen whatever reason it us the seams

794
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:50,399
to rob the heads of the material nicely

795
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:52,199
remember these heads are dense they

796
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,920
still they sink in water and that's why

797
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:57,358
water hash is so effective so they do

798
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,480
want to fall through the screen it's

799
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:02,799
just a matter of how much [ __ ] falls

800
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,800
through

801
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:14,000
with very very soon

802
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:47,318
yeah that's you Z have a good

803
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,440
one

804
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:57,759
nice check on the dab homie that's how I

805
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,760
treat B can you see what I did to

806
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,039
up right away so it's hard to work

807
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:42,558
so generally you'll take your pile and

808
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,920
put it off to the side and then you can

809
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,839
just sort of redo what you're doing you

810
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,960
could easily get three or four or five

811
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:52,920
piles like that get maybe you know off

812
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,280
the amount of herb we put in there maybe

813
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,920
get 10 g return of dirty single screen

814
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,400
sifted bre

815
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,760
we're going to clean that up over the

816
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,160
screens because it's so warm in here

817
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,160
it's going to be real hard it's a

818
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:08,440
process probably take me about 30 to 40

819
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:12,358
minutes of carting the resin gently

820
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,358
which I you want to do a little bit of

821
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,119
resin see how it is

822
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:31,118
bring it

823
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:57,559
down good so this process the final

824
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,039
process is a gentle f standing up the

825
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:01,880
resin over the

826
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:05,639
screen try not to let it stick to your

827
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:07,440
card I don't I don't want it to be th I

828
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:11,318
don't want to use a lot of resin at a

829
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:14,559
time so I Lally use very small amounts

830
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:16,318
even just in a few runs there one one

831
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,640
pass this is a lighter color than this

832
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:21,838
already this one's almost green the

833
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:23,318
white you can do it a couple of times a

834
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,440
lot of the material will push through

835
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:27,960
the screen and a small amount of the

836
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,200
material will stay on top up and that's

837
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:35,720
what you want once again way too hot for

838
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,719
such a thing but you want to dab this

839
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:41,559
up definitely

840
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,480
really you don't want to let the resin

841
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:55,240
build up on your screen on your card

842
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,240
start gumming up more and more of the

843
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:22,519
reference a lot of things I strin will

844
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,119
um return more at times the Barb the the

845
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:27,559
stuff that I make with Matt is an

846
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,599
unbelievable producer of bre

847
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:32,280
the same amount of herb if that was car

848
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:35,240
we would have just leaked an insane

849
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:39,119
insane am of bre but whatever's there we

850
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:43,879
get so we clean we C it's too hot in

851
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,880
here I'm sweating he's sweating but the

852
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:56,039
H I say it's probably up to just from

853
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,639
that small amount of caring it's

854
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:02,599
probably around 70 to 80% glandular

855
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:04,400
heads that last 20% is a lot to clean

856
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:07,760
and most people never get it clean

857
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,280
Beyond 70 or 80 when you get into the 90

858
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,599
and the

859
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:16,119
99 there really is a reason for it and

860
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,720
that's requiring the unadulterated

861
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:20,318
cannaboid High the pure thing that we

862
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:22,519
all love about cannabis that we all

863
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:24,880
smoke it for or eat it or use it for

864
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:28,599
this way it's about that unadulterated

865
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,960
canabo profile and that is found in the

866
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:34,359
res want to keep sifting for a while

867
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,920
keep for a while keep working

868
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:37,920
away wel

869
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,880
St you find when you work in a colder

870
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:51,640
environment the resin will just break

871
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,280
off so much

872
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:58,118
easier boy some of my videos on YouTube

873
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:01,119

dry you got yourself a seat now and

919
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:34,279
you're just gently rubbing your herb

920
00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:36,480
back and forth and this is what you do

921
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,119
at home this is your method this is kind

922
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,960
of what just gets done normally like you

923

Bubble man's world but we're sort of

1075
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:49,719
down in the dumps right now we had a

1076
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:52,679
great day you know right up until about

1077
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:55,239
6:00 we were educating people we were

1078
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:57,879
sharing showing John was breaking up

1079
01:00:55,239 --> 01:01:00,439
Buds and we were dry sifting we uh had

1080
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:02,400
someone had broken the denail and that

1081
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,960
was devastating and it came around and

1082
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,838
they bought a new denail and they

1083
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,480
replaced it and let us use the bowl and

1084
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:10,558
it was all great

1085
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:15,079
and basically right before I left

1086
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:17,960
someone stole my $5,000 5D Canon Mark

1087
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:20,559
III with uh my camera chips and the

1088
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:23,559
battery and the lens the whole a whole

1089
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:25,559
nine yards so we're just trying not to

1090
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:27,760
be disappointed in humanity right now

1091
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:29,319
trying not not to be bummed out but you

1092

know it's not the end of the world it's

1093
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:33,880
a camera it's just a very expensive

1094
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:36,440
camera and it's a camera that's very

1095
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,318
important to the shows that John and I

1096

1157
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:59,038

1159
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:04,079
other stuff I found out of booth there

1160
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:06,318
yeah I had even some 93 blueberry

1161
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:09,079
sitting on the Dil powder that was from

1162
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:11,480
93 that was blueberry was it but it

1163
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:13,720
should be there it's it's it's common

1164
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,880
sense it kind of is you know it's like

1165
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:17,959
uh that was just a lot of people in the

1166
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,880
booth today and uh you know somehow that

1167
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,838
camera walked out I'm

1168
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:25,119
hoping that I can

1169
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:27,880
somehow figure out a way to locate that

1170
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:31,559
camera po potentially with GPS um

1171
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:33,599
potentially with exi data and if not

1172
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:34,720
that I'll just uh I'm going to have to

1173
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:36,720
figure this out whether it's an

1174
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:38,239
insurable product I do not know it could

1175
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:40,480
have potentially been a complete and

1176
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:42,318
total loss and that's kind of the way

1177
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,719
I'm taking it right now that it's a

1178
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:46,639
total

1179
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:48,798
loss so wanted to give you guys the
