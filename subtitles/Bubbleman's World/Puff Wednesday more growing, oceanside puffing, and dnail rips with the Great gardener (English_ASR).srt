Vancouver behind the Lionsgate bridge

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,519
Vancouver is just on the other side of

102
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,918
that bridge and that's Stanley Park that

103
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,918
is attached to and we just figured we'd

104
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,079
stop on the way back from the city for a

105
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,599

World guys uh John and I have as you

109
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,198
noticed left the house uh we actually

110
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,959
went to get my laptop computer which has

111
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
caused me some major problems in the

112
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,159
last couple of days and it's why I

113
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,159
haven't uploaded a video for about 3

114
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,639
days I did a little one on my phone but

115
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,080
I haven't been able to upload a good

116
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,560
video and even the one I uploaded today

117
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,758
was what I would consider less than the

118
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,160
versions I had made of it prior that

119
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,199
weren't working so corrupted files blah

120
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,759
blah blah blah blah anyway we fixed that

121
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,000
on our way home we decided to stop at a

122
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,479
few spots and show you some of the

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,600
beautiful places that you can blaze here

124
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:07,719
in Vancouver it's a very nice area yeah

125
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,879
so we're in actually West Vancouver and

126
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,840

127
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,038
behind us we're just on a well-known dog

128
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,439
path here and uh this is part of the

129
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:18,120
house sound um it's not a lake by any

130
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,839
means if you pay attention to the corner

131
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,959
of the screen I believe you can see a

132
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,679
giant ship making its way there's a big

133
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,599
giant ship coming in which is kind of

134
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,000

328
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,160
but for like the the the medical the

329
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,199
industrial the recreational for for all

330
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:01,639
of it not just one specific specific

331
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,439
thing pulled out of the hole but to

332
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,399
cover the whole gamut that once the

333
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,720
legality is removed really it opens the

334
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,519
doors for for everything to be focused

335
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,800
on not just the medical aspect or the

336
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,440
industrial hemp aspect but literally

337
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,879
recreational is right in there as well

338
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,680
oh 100% And that comes even down to like

339
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:22,240
like 420s investors uh uh Alan

340

341
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,360
