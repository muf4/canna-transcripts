114
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,799
little scoop for your hash yeah I mean I

115
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,439
I'd probably need a couple Scoops there

116
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,959
but I I think I I was going to say I was

117
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,600
going to say if happy DAV would do me

118
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,918
one about four times size yeah you need

119
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,120
the the what's it called the the ladle

120
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,680
yeah it needs to be a little bit more of

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,879
a ladle than a than a scoop I like that

122
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,519
it's sharp though cuz when we press our

123
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,680
melt toad or anything to just give it a

124

little cut not only sharp but bent and

125
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,280

328
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:35,000

330
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,879
that's one of my girl's favorite flavors

331
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,120
whenever she I come home that's what it

332
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,039
smells like I'm like all right puffing

333
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,799
on puff

334
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,078
Wednesday yeah we haven't done a puff

335
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,758
Wednesday in a little while uh yeah I

336
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,919
would have definitely not taken that

337
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:52,959
much but that's okay I can just do this

338
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:54,759
I'm so sorry don't be sorry not boom

339
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,799
it's the rosin you know bubble hash I

340
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,720
take the bigger rips rosin I just like

341
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,599
the tastes I don't really like blasting

342
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,920
my head head off with the rosin but I

343
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,560
have to say you guys nailed it today

344
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,439
when you said the rosin is really a

345
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:07,000
byproduct of the bubble it is it it's

346
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,279
just the non-melt bubble exactly how we

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,159
made well it's not non-melt it's

348
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:13,159
definitely often a lot of people it's

349
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,159
not it's not full

350
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,440
melt yeah it's just nice to be able to

351
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:21,559
offer you know a product that's at least

352
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,480
as good as good as it can be yeah and

353
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,359
some people just like oil yeah

354
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,159
definitely I I prefer oil sometimes it's

355
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,159
easier to hold a lot of people prefer

356
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:33,039
oil sometimes but I'm not sure

357
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:36,039
if they ever really had the actual

358
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:39,360
ability to test having a stash of

359
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:41,519
beautiful melty dry sipped in water

360
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,680
hash cuz man if you have that in your

361
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,720

what you want to look at is it trippy

447
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:11,199
watching YouTube videos and then being

448
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:13,558
in them you have no idea weird right

449

450
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:16,918
little weird it's weird it's all right

451

that's trippy for sure it gets it gets

452
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,360
easier as it goes but it's definitely

453
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:23,558
weird you know yeah at first it

454
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,079
was kind of trippy yeah it was a little

455
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:27,158
trippy it's all good though you adapt

456
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,000
it's the

457
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:32,360
evolution it is the Evolution let's wrap

464
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,158
you have to do to get a rip it's like

465
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:51,000
clearly I just love hash yeah it's just

466
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,880
a process you know like everything was a

467
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,880
process when I when I was smoking joints

468
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,400
all the time it was a process you had to

469
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,159
go bust your wheat up you know get a

470
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,519
paper pick whatever paper you like to

471
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,240
use like I usually had a couple of

472
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:04,519
different papers going up at the same

473
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,000
time just switching it up and it was

474
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,480
just a process you had to go outside and

475
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,200
smoke it cuz stin your whole spot up it

476
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,000
just I don't know y this is definitely

477
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,600
the evolution of of what's happened you

478
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,240
know it really is I um I remember when I

479
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:22,439
stopped smoking joints started smoking

480
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,798
hash and it really was like the end of

481
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:29,480
that party yeah 20 people sitting around

482
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:31,558
and just smoke everywhere and

483
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,839
then it was just like a bong went around

484
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,960
yeah and everyone was just like boom

485
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,038
especially when we first got turned onto

486
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,000
it oh yeah it was

487
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:45,279

00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:02,120
it oh that was good strong effect you

612
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:04,839
know just a good oldfashioned puff

613
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:06,558
Wednesday where we just puff and we have

614
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,000
been puffing in many bowls throughout

615
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:11,200
the day some of them we did on Periscope

616
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,599
we didn't even do all the the sessions

617
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,200
on the camera today the breakfast

618
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,959
session the breakfast session was a

619
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,038
periscope session that was

620
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,519
fun that was

621
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:25,519
good good job on the torching I find if

622
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,519
you use a small a few of these if you

623
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,798
use a smaller torch on that Hive it

624
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,798
becomes very difficult because as you go

625
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:35,839
around you end up actually um yeah it

626
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,558
cools down but I find the smaller torch

627
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,079
when it touches the hole in the middle

628
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:43,398
when it just goes by it it makes it go

629
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:45,879
out yeah only with a smaller

630
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:47,839
torch so definitely you don't want to

631
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,399
just be holding your torch down on your

632
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:53,079
ceramic uh Hive nail uh it could uh end

633
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:55,038
up cracking if you do that over and over

634
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:57,678
and over again so yeah you got to do it

635
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:59,480
evenly how um Adam was doing it

636
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,360
definitely got do it evenly uh there's

637
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,120
your rip yeah and then he's next so and

638
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:06,319
this carb works perfect on that nail

639
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:09,000
definitely works nice we bought a little

640
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,879
ceramic dish wait a little bit longer um

641
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
the other day we were like so stoked

642
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,559
like oh we're going to do it it's going

643
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,599
to look sick for mbits yeah [ __ ]

644
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:19,798
cracked it first time it was super right

645
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:23,439
in half and it fell right onto my carpet

646
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:26,200

650
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,399
