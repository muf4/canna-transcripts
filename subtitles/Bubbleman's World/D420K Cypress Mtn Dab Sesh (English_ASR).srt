00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,359
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,919
uh I'm here with d420 K and we are uh

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,679
we're up at Cypress Provincial Park

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,160
Lookout so you're going to hear a lot of

6
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,719
cars going by you'll probably see people

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,840
in the background over there sort of

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,640
looking at this pretty beautiful City

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,440
View in the background in between D and

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,759
I you can see that uh the city of

11
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,199
Vancouver's back there we'll probably

12
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,878
show you guys another little Glimpse I

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,079
did a video up here uh some time ago

14
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:48,238
with Johnny B so you might remember this

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,000
view but uh we never actually sat down

16
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,198
and kind of did the session like we're

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,878
going to do today I've got uh I got my

18
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,599
new plasma Mini battery so this this is

19
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:02,479
a real nice little unit just turn that

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:04,478
on give it a check boom she is live yep

21
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,200
here we go a nice hot rod water bike

22
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,640
coming up the GP up the oh yeah so let's

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,400
tell our story as we're waiting for this

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,040
to heat up um what a crazy

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,880
story [ __ ] got speed dick coming up the

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,880
mountain we did get a speeding ticket

27
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,759
coming up the mountain that's true we uh

28
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,039
we had a little bit of uh we got a

29
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,118
little excited coming up the early part

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,159
of the mount you can hear these guys

31
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,879
ripping because what did the cop tell us

32
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,118
after he gave us first of all he gave us

33
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,640
a huge break we were so much over the

34
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,719
speed limit that he could have impounded

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,319
the bikes and given us a $400 ticket

36
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:40,359
each uh whereas instead what he did was

37
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,839
he gave us a $120 ticket $138 ticket

38
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,599
there was a discount on it if we paid it

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,200
early I think he said it would be 120 or

40
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,359
125 bucks no uh taking the bike which

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,520
was huge and uh you know what I just

42
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,640
remembered this is my 2.0 D oh no it

43
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,359
should work let's hope this works I've

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,118
actually only used this battery with my

45
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:02,118
dabinator I haven't tried the denail on

46
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:04,319
it so it's possible that if the the

47
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:06,759
electronics are too powerful in here too

48
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,598
much wattages wattage is needed and this

49
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,680
isn't enough uh we got this for the

50
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,359
backup brought back we do have the

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,959
backup and uh hopefully this will turn

52
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,800
on but you know what I don't think it's

53
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,199
going to I think that it's just going to

54
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,920
turn off and it's not enough power what

55
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:25,039
a bummer I totally spaced

56
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:29,079
that would have been nice to

57
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:31,519
uh here we go it's up to 93 that's 3°

58
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,599
hotter than it was

59
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,239
no now it's going down it's funny cuz

60
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,919
I've had this problem with my denail uh

61
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,400
just not working with the batteries I

62
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,799
don't know what kind of electronics

63
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,879
they're putting in here but they are

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,480
good because I'll tell you they pull so

65
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:48,598
much power that a giant battery like

66
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:51,199
this uh you can't even basically uh heat

67
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:52,799
heat up a nail with it so yeah it's cool

68
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,119
it's weird all right well you want to do

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,040
the Torchy action yeah you bet cuz I did

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,400
bring a couple of varieties of nails I

71
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,280
brought that little stain uh little uh

72
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,799
titanium ium one that I was showing you

73
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,759
earlier which is this guy here and then

74
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,599
I brought the Banger as well so we've

75
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,679
got both the quartz and the titanium I'd

76
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:13,119
like the Banger the quarts just because

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,159
that's that's what I like the most let's

78
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,480
do it you want to set it up and start uh

79
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,639
getting it going here sorry about that

80
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,518
guys I'll try to get this going

81
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,798
eventually uh it seems as though if I

82
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,480
want to use my battery I'm going to have

83
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,760
to bring my dabinator it seems to be the

84
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,318
tool for the job uh this denail just

85
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,199
doesn't seem to want to run off of a

86
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,000
battery so until the those guys get that

87
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:37,039
organized I think I'll probably just

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,400
stick with my dabinator and uh thus the

89
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,598
reason we have a quiver of these tools

90
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,840
in our Arsenal cuz you never know when

91
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,359
uh when one might not be able to get the

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,719
trick done while uh while the other one

93
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,720
simply

94
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,840
can having a good time yep all right so

95
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,759
we got the quartz Banger in there we got

96
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,039
the torch we got all sorts of varieties

97
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:02,199
here you want to hit some raws in

98
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,479
I'd like to hit some rosin dipped in my

99
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,679
Harmony dry sips all right let me pull

100
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,679
something

101
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,199
else and this harmony dry you know I had

102
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,400
I had such a problem with my stuff

103
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,598
turning and caking out when I'd come

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,439
down to the coast because of the

105
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,918
moisture right yep well then we were on

106
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:23,519
Hos Church there and I asked a Cuban

107
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,959
grower and yourself like what's uh

108
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,120
what's the deal with

109
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:30,758
uh with that like how come it cakes out

110
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,560
like that and you got to cure it for

111
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:38,240
more more time yeah get it dry and what

112
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,319
I did is I did that I cured it and even

113
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,439
I I brought it down here in my pocket on

114
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,478
my motorbike all the way down from front

115
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:48,839
storage to back here nice and it's still

116
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,839
nothing but Sandy

117
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:55,599
beautifulness I see the difference on

118
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:55,599
the Cure big time that's

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,360
awesome all right yeah I got get

120
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:11,758
SC all right here you go brother thank

121
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,080
you little bit of D nail for the D

122
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,639
Man minus the

123
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,758
nail I've had I've been having quite the

124
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,759
time with this battery thing and it's

125
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,120
this is I was so excited to finally get

126
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,600
this going with the battery and be able

127
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,840
to show you guys I got a battery the

128
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,439
denil works on it and I I'm so sorry

129
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,079
that uh the Dil does not work on it but

130
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,879
next time you see me and I'm out about

131
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,758
I'm going to have my dabinator and big

132
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,560
shout out to maximillan for producing a

133
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,160
unit that it's a little bit different

134
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,800
from D now but I'll tell you the unit

135
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,240
works on both UK power uh European power

136
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,280
and Canadian power and it also works on

137
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,759
this battery for whatever reason so

138
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,799
we'll continue to troubleshoot with

139
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,360
denil cuz uh I of course love to support

140
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,240
those guys but man that was a tasty rip

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,520
you better you better set that up yeah

142
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,120
definitely down for one of those and

143
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,519
it's nice to have the Torches the backup

144
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,560
which is what I told you to bring isn't

145
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,000
it

146
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,680
yep I kind of knew what was going to

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,759
happen I already had it though of course

148
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,199
you did just in

149
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,199
case oh that's so beautiful look at this

150
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,360
guys bit of rosin dipped in full melt

151
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:21,679
dry sift the Holy Grail of melts you

152
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,639
know that top grade full melt bubble

153
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,759
hash or full melt dry sift

154
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,598
99.9% heads really hard to beat guys

155
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,800
really hard to beat

156
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:35,120
all right so I'll give it a little

157
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,800
second there I'm learning this culture

158
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,519
of you know keep feeling the nail with

159
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,639
my with my hand I have to say I still

160
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:44,598
I'm not good enough at it that I really

161
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,439
appreciate the the denail for that

162
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:48,478
reason where I just know the temperature

163
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,918
not not to mention also when people

164
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,519
watch this video they'll notice that

165
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,198
whenever the torch gets lit it dilutes

166
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:55,839
our the sound of our voices and you

167
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,439
can't hear the stories that we're trying

168
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:01,878
forun is a bit of a pain in the eyes a

169
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,879
little bit you know a little bit yeah R

170
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,879
him that's

171
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,960
okay what a great hit yeah it was that

172
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,800
was a beautiful hit for me too you know

173
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,159
one thing I seen guys doing uh it was

174
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,960
the um I think it was the van City

175
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,240
extract guys with the Q-tip yeah they uh

176
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:30,159
they were doing um they they put their

177
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,879
iPhone on the timer and

178
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,400
time at 45 seconds after they got the

179
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,840
cryst the courts red or orange time at

180
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:42,478
45 seconds and then hit then do their

181
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:44,359
hit they do 30 seconds some do 25 45

182
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,839
nice cooler hit and you know that sort

183
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,759
of thing so that's pretty I like I like

184
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,519
that just different methods I guess and

185
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,120
if you really wanted to get tactical

186
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,719
grab one of those little laser pointer

187
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,560
things that do does a temperature watch

188
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,080
what the temperature drops to after that

189
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,478
45 second well that's why I want to

190
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,680
invent a torch that has that built into

191
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,560
it oh man so you're just torching with a

192
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,000
little LED readout and it tells you when

193
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,000
the thing has reached the temperature

194
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,158
you turn your torch off you do a double

195
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,158
check yeah we're at the right

196
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:14,918
temperature you can hit right away don't

197
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:17,879
like the idea of waiting to have a hit

198
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:19,519
mhm you know and wasting your your your

199
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,199
butane when you don't have to and

200
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,799
wasting the butane when we don't have to

201
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,639
man I'm so glad that our bikes are still

202
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,038
here and not impounded that was really

203
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,079
you know what we always hear the stories

204
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,079
about the bad cops well we're here to

205
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:34,000
tell you today that Darren and I dealt

206
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:37,278
with a pretty decent cop he had zero

207
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,559
attitude he was Zero suspicious of us he

208
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,879
could have easily ran our names and

209
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,158
found out we both had felony records uh

210
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,720
he just was decent you know what I'm

211
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:48,600
saying like he he he he gave us a break

212
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:53,200
on a $400 ticket and he didn't impound

213
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,759
our vehicles for 7 days at $70 a b a day

214
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,600
which is another like 400 500 bucks so

215
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,799
it ends up being a$1 th000 pinch when

216
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,920
they give you that ticket and they take

217
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:04,039
your vehicle away way so instead of that

218
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:05,679
happening D and I each got $120 pinch

219
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:08,799
and 5 minutes later we're sitting at

220
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:11,799
this table um enjoying some bowls of

221
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,439
some beautiful rosin and dry so got to

222
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:16,919
like the way

223
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,920
uh that worked

224
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:21,479
out I wonder what people think when they

225
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,399
drive by on their bicycles or they just

226
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,639
happen to be walking by and they

227
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,759
see this big tattooed bearded guy with a

228
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,120
blowtorch in his hand heating up a fatty

229
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,078
piece of glass

230
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,720
I hope what they think is damn son I

231
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:35,599

00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,958
actually were cuz I bet you he's

271
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:59,679
downplaying it you guys were really

272
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,599
peeled very soon well you're so I just

273
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,199
got it how long was that that I was

274
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,839
telling that story after I heated that

275
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,600
up and everything cuz I got it like it's

276
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:07,560
not

277
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,240
even 40

278
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:13,559
seconds and the taste of that low temp

279
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,759
dab of course was [ __ ] phen

280
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:20,119
phenomenal really good really good that

281
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:22,600
RW it in the dryp just that's why I you

282
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,799
know I love the low temp dab I love the

283
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,560
intensity of a hotter rip I love the

284
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,479
idea of producing a rip that is both of

285
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,078
those things you know the best of both

286
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,240
of those things and neither of the the

287
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:38,958
the the Lesser parts of those

288
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,959
things truck pulling

289
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,720
in look at that we've already condensed

290
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,719
quite a little bit of

291
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,120
rippage

292
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:56,680
well go for some of this crazy reddish

293
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,679
purple that's some seriously looking

294
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,240
fire wow and tasty too

295
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,320
it is pretty ridiculous I squeezed some

296
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,799
rosin out of it and is absolutely just

297
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,680
freaking

298
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,919
ridiculous dude you can't even like

299
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,799
touch it I bet you I could squeeze rosin

300
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,399
out of it with my fingers I bet you 100

301
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:20,000
like bucks I could

302
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,399
do yeah just be

303
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,639
like I can feel it on my fingers just

304
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,799
touching it leaves a clear oily

305
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,440
residual it's awesome pretty nice and

306
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,599
cooked going to back it up with one of

307
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,399
these

308
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,800
though man the motorbike is so shiny

309
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,240
yeah it feels nice when you pick it up

310
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,559
it's not so great when you leave the

311
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,240
place and then get a ticket but who

312
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,278
would have known that that guy was a

313
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,959
police officer following behind us from

314
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,958
like miles back yeah we were doing a

315
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,439
buck 40 on the freeway just [ __ ]

316
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:55,439
ripping that was fast ripping just

317
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,680
cruising too fast and then up the hill

318
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,600
[ __ ] just being [ __ ] kids on bikes

319
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,359
I guess not obeying the law yeah not

320
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,440
necessarily being dangerous I wouldn't

321
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,240
say just maybe going just a little bit

322
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,320
over the speed limit so uh well we got

323
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,519
caught as uh as generally we do when we

324
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,839
do things we're not supposed to be do

325
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,240
you know normally I would dispute

326
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,440
tickets and stuff because it's it's the

327
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,759
thing to do just in case the cops on

328
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,199
vacation or I wouldn't dis whatever but

329
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:25,399
you know what one thing they do these

330
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:28,240
days is they pay cops double time now to

331
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,759
go to court and to test and actually to

332
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,680
go like that because before in the old

333
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,000
days you dispute it and sometimes the

334
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,719
cops would be off duty and they'd be

335
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,799
like I'm not going in on that day and

336
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,759
[ __ ] wasting my day off and they just

337
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,838
wouldn't show up for court you'd win

338
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:44,759
[ __ ] no ticket no point you're out of

339
