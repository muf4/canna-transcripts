what we got going here this is a big

105
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:48,000
test room mostly high CBD phenotypes of

106
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:51,090
a lot of favorite strains from the

107
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,320
Kobashi Club so we got high CBD warlock

108
00:14:51,090 --> 00:15:02,399
high CBD a high CBD digweed high CBD

109
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:04,680
Renee beautiful so these were all

110
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,909
crossed with these are all catatonic

111
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:10,099
crosses Hannah tonic crosses and

112
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:11,659
we started off with 50 seeds of each

113
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,409
[Music]

114
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:17,269
down to 20 within the production and

115
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:21,339
then of the 20

116
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:24,500
by roughly about five here is the

117
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,300
phenotype that we were looking for is a

118
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,220
warlock so five of them had warlock

119
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:31,609
characteristics and it of those five and

120
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:35,779
we CBD tested them roughly about two of

121
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:38,690
them came out high CBD so now we're

122
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:41,269
pretty here I got the candy cannon tonic

123
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,950
eight and then back tears he came to

124
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:43,299
talk

125
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,690
now we're trying to just figure out

126
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:47,740
which one's best we've been that way

127
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,420
we're going to put into the members of

128
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,310
the club and we'll let them decide which

129
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:56,078
one they like better right excellent

130
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:57,458
bioassay CBD line and you want to give

131
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:58,719
just the people that you know who are

132
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,129
watching I know a lot of people are

133
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,778
hearing a lot of things about different

134
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:06,448
cannabinoids and CBD in particular what

135
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:10,480
why are so many people looking for CBD

136
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:15,219
CBD carries a lot of the medicinal

137
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,289
healing effects without the THC high so

138
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,440
a lot of people are coming to medical

139
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:22,299
cannabis not from the recreational

140
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,220
cannabis and they want more healing

141
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:26,259
properties and not necessarily getting

142
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,028
really high absolutely so some people

143
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:29,679
like to you know they want to go to work

144
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:32,769
and they want to be able to eat a

145
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,870
lozenge or either either eat something

146
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:37,839
that's not going to get them high and

147
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:40,839
make their job difficult but in with the

148
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,970
high CBD strains they can have it they

149
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:45,540
can know

150
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,759
paint goes away information goes away

151
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,948
headaches go away and they don't

152
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,688
necessarily get high from it so right

153
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:55,519
now could they deal with a lot of clubs

154
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:57,679
yeah the high CBD is

155
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,039
is sought after the canna tonic that we

156
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:03,079
have it's everybody wants it it's the

157
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,789
popular choice I'm noticing as well for

158
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,890
kids with Tourette's syndrome and other

159
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:10,009
forms of epilepsy yeah that's the high

160
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:12,200
CBD is virtually no THC we haven't gone

161
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:13,519
on we haven't found one yet I know

162
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,259
there's a few out of there but we're

163
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:19,509
still we're still looking for that

164
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:21,650
elusive high CBD low THC phenotype

165
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:25,088

166
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,089

00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:44,748
the airflow is good

170
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:44,749
you got your ballast tie which is key

171
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,790
then all your Reza's are outside in the

172
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,789

sure

177
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,829
you foliar spray as well

178
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,410
preventive is always good to be

179
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:28,409
preventive

00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:34,339
we have flour yeah

181
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:48,919
I took the Barbara excellent look at

182
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:54,418
this

183
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:57,740
screens are out more importantly start

184
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,740

189
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,610
through

190
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:26,849
and what kind of temperature and

191
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:29,509
humidity is are you looking for in here

but doesn't feel muggy in here at all it

195
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:38,759
definitely no no if it gets too hot we

196
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,710
have fans I'm more concerned with the

197
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:46,799
air blowing down and just keeping a

198
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:49,500
constant airflow still takes seven to

199
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,319
ten days for them to draw here and then

200
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:56,460
we'll go into bins and then from there

201
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:59,009
we'll treat them right flip them get the

202
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:03,380
moisture out and then from then destock

203
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:06,390
them and then back into bins okay oh

204
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:09,000
good process all this all the shake is

205
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,410
put on screens no that's what I'm

206
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,569
talking about right there this is what I

207
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,580
want people to see this is how you do it

208
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:17,429
people you don't have to go and buy

209
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:19,490
expensive racks from restaurants you can

210
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:24,259
build your own this is perfect

211
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:27,509
he's got them dated and named this is

212
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:29,759
really nice to see this is just so much

it's ready it's ready no it's ready for

216
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,230
that and you know you have catch trays

217
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:47,159
on the bottoms or on the very bottom we

218
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,670
have little trays that clip onto here

219
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,040
mm-hmm

220
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:55,050
so it clips onto here and then you pull

221
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:57,389
it out and then you flip it beautiful

222
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:59,490
and then you move it down you're holding

223
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:02,500
X going out but all he ever gets

224
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:06,009
flipping once and that's it

225
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,690
from there and scooped up and excellent

226
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:10,599

00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,769

232
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:31,289

233
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:34,500

work personally well there's a cake and

240
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,160
this is why you do this over screens cuz

241
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:26,349

heads I didn't catch it and we're

244
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,049
catching them all absolutely but they

245
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:42,970
wouldn't be caught without those screens

246
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:44,879
you can see if I just oh yeah do you

247
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,289
have a seat separator that you guys user

248
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,080
just do it on a couple sort of again

homemade machines you know just run them

250
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:55,119
through holes no I'm not even a use

251
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,279
night is more sort of gravity and pump

252
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,289
and airflow you've seen those laser

253
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,119
perforated whole sheets though those are

254
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:03,539
pretty good with a little vibrator I've

255
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:06,519
seen as long I've seen the one with the

256
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:08,649
blows the air up and blows the shop up

257
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,660
right yeah that's nice and through the

258
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:17,470
tube or whatever yeah those are pretty

259
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:19,450
impressive too Wow ingenuity so

260
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:27,910
basically the work here is to de-seed

261
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:31,120
these do stock them you don't really

262
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:34,110
have to do this stage but because the

263
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:37,089
fact that we miss that we want to

264
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:39,069
capture the trichomes right always want

265
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:41,500
to keep the surface in front of you

266
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:43,990
clean is when you cut it off and it's

267
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,910
the screen thousands of trichomes have

268
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:49,329
just fallen off that button you collect

269
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:50,620
that so you sit here you know it's you

270
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:53,629
know it's a try when I could sit here

271
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:55,069
and use my fingers

272
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,410
even need the Fiskars nobody I don't

273
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:59,629
need these scissors like I can operate

274
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,550
this whole thing with just using my

275
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,580
scissors but but this but it's soft and

276
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:12,109
still if you squeezed it mm-hmm

277
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:14,539
it's good so we'll sit here and do a

278
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:16,069
little debugging do a little debug I'm

279
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:17,539
gonna take a few macro shots of that

280
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:19,909
resin to show people the quality that

281
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:22,119
you're working with and then once you

282
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:25,009
have a little pile in front of you just

283
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:27,109
lightly push it forward you always want

284
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:29,920
to make sure that the bun falls directly

285
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:29,919
on the screen

286
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,390

using forced air to clean just the

320

power

323
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:58,270
like even put it in a small box or

324
00:28:56,288 --> 00:29:00,640
something with a little intake and then

325
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:03,960
a bunch of air that just blows it from

326
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:08,038
multiple angles and spins it oh yeah

327
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,038
yeah you can definitely see it

328
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,380
and there goes more resin than most

329
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:14,380
people will ever see

330
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:20,638

inserts the tumbler and I've got my

336
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:42,519
tumble now as well as some big screens

337
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:47,048
he's got some big screens so we're gonna

338
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:49,500
play around it make some cries - you

339
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:49,500
need some help

340
00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:01,160
no now before you say anything the last

341
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:03,799
room that went through this was we

342
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,890
called it the 48 hour and a 72 hour run

343
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:10,250
it's a it's already done a 30-second run

344
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:12,590
I got like a minute run and then we go

345
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:15,950
to an hour run and then we do a 24 hour

346
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:19,939
run and then we go for 24 to 48 hour run

347
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:22,789
and then we could do the 48 hour to 72

348
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:26,240
hour run well so this is the spin or

349
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:28,009
nine hour to 72 hour run so you're

350
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,569
cleaning it out and we're just cleaning

351
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:32,200
it or skip vacuum it out all right

352
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:32,200
sounds good

353
00:30:50,650 --> 00:31:10,640
[Music]

354
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:10,640
so time to make some dry center of that

355
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:37,350
because it's a seed crop we're gonna do

356
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:45,809
it for 30 seconds ten minutes one hour

357
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:48,480
run at which point we'll take it after

358
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:53,869
we got the seed out of it bring it back

359
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:57,269
and we'll bring it back for 24 hour run

360
00:31:53,869 --> 00:32:01,019
and then we'll put it in 24 to 48 hour

361
00:31:57,269 --> 00:32:05,210
run and then we put it in for like 2

362
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:05,210
days 48 to 72 hours

so wouldn't we just dump it in there 15

366
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:53,470
pounds or 10 pounds of Earth five pounds

367
00:32:50,380 --> 00:33:00,430
of Earth gonna be ten five yeah probably

368
00:32:53,470 --> 00:33:03,130
five it's lucky that high well within my

369
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:20,430
storage limits of my MMA our license

370
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:25,860
yeah it's got a stopwatch this stopwatch

371
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:25,860
30 seconds one minute will be one minute

372
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:44,899
ready one minute one minute run just

373
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:47,250
leave the lid off it's happening ice in

374
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:49,918
so it's nice to be standing next to a

375
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:51,750
nice large unit the tumble now doesn't

376
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,720
come in this size and fortunately have

377
00:33:51,750 --> 00:34:09,148
left when they occupied this particular

378
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:13,349
is a gardeners that's the 10-minute run

379
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:15,138
and oh my god the smell is like shish

380
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:21,690
kebob

381
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:28,440
is so strong yeah there's only that

382
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:30,119
corner and look at that you can see the

383
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,119
difference of the colors on the top it's

384
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,769
almost marinas tinge and as you flip the

385
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,500
resin over you can see a much bolder

386
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:39,449
resin underneath so we'll get to that

387
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,190
later separating those two grades and

388
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:48,449
we'll show them on a plate and green and

389
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:50,869
the gold separator pile there Tommy and

390
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:50,868

harder harder and harder female

396

blackheads from the capitate stocks as

397
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:44,900
for the pears the flat pattern grab a

398

piece of hard work heavy SIPP is a good

399
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:52,059
something better than light sift tends

400
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,060
to be down with it rather than glad to

401
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:59,150
the sift

402
00:35:53,989 --> 00:36:01,338
covered everywhere you need like big

403
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:05,630
scoops like painters tools or you know I

afterwards - after you've run this for

424
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:59,219
10 minutes yeah perfect that is a nice

425
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,220
smell

426
00:39:07,699 --> 00:39:12,969
not so much on the outside but after the

427
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,970
24-hour

sorry sure yeah yeah papaya that's so

433
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:10,680
deep when you can see the screen where

434
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:17,099
the screen was hit night that looks like

435
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:21,859
some hundreds of grams you might want to

436
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:24,539
get some type of tough tub in there

437
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,010
it'll happen it's what you're gonna want

438
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:29,539
to get some sort of tough and then write

439
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,540
all that out that

440
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:37,989

that's a good amount it's a good amount

444
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:21,279
of weight right there for sure and it is

445
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:23,590
dense you're right it's it looks denser

446
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,370
when you think or it is denser than you

447
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:31,930
think it's denser than it looks

448
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:34,739
you're covered so you've gotten to the

449
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:38,500
point where Barbara has been well sifted

450
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:42,909
for an hour and those big fluffy buns we

451
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:49,210
hide I have this sort of like this but

452
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:51,670
you gotta get the seed out so we do it

453
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:54,099
onto the screen so all the seed and

454
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:56,490
everything nuts will already fall

455
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:56,489
through

456
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:15,480
breaks up all the band get in particular

457
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:20,309
it gets out all the see usually do this

458
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:23,780
with love I thought we stopped all the

459
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:23,779
teens authority harvested

460
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:48,568
loose stuff fall through

461
00:43:05,298 --> 00:43:20,429
happy to do it all end up end up throw

462
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:23,028
with that then from in there you get the

463
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:23,028
CD do

464
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:33,358
ready get them

465
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:35,159
but they're in there and separate those

466
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,389
further using the scene screen

467
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:38,879
separators and pulled them out by hand

468
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:40,889
yeah we have a couple other wind

469
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,390
machines that will blow the chip blow

470
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:48,690
the chaff away and then one more after

471
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:51,539
that one more system after that that

472
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:53,730
uses the angles and lets the seeds roll

473
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:55,469
down perfect then you put a fan on their

474
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:59,880
clothes off so a good amount of sift

475
00:43:55,469 --> 00:44:02,848
came off of that off without Barbara

476
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,670
looks pretty good so that's the one-hour

477
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:08,940
run so then after we get the seed out

478
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:12,599
we'll actually put this back in back in

479
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:15,059
the sifter and do a 24 hour run okay and

480
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:17,730
the last little bit in the 24 hour to 48

481
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:24,690
hour run and that stuff will go to

482
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:26,929
edibles tinctures awesome awesome there

483
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,929
we go

484
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:37,300
it's the great gardener today's chores I

485
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:41,970
was pulling everybody taking down a

486
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:45,570
little catatonic icdd

487
00:44:41,969 --> 00:44:45,569
been hanging

488
00:44:46,778 --> 00:44:56,809
for just about a week perfect we're

489
00:44:52,130 --> 00:45:00,380
gonna put it in the bins leave the lid

490
00:44:56,809 --> 00:45:04,569
off the bins overnight and then we'll

491
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:08,119
sort of then we'll little flip them a

492
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:11,268
couple days probably three four days

493
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:13,849
what five is then we'll destock it goes

494
00:45:11,268 --> 00:45:17,088
back into the bins and then it's just

495
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:18,739
the process of every day you go in slide

496
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:21,650
your hands behind your hand to the

497
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:23,420
bottom of the bin and it feels a little

498
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:25,849
moister at the bottom and you sort of
