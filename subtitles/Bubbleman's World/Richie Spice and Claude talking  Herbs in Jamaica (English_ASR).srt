94
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,438
that you it's a good thing and it's a

95
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,280
good plant it's a plant where I really

96
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:10,840
meditate and wonder at times you know

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,560
why is it that this plant get so many

98
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,158
fight you know and people fight against

99
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,160
this plant so much we which mean it's

100
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:20,238
just a herb just like any other else

101
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,240
tree you know just like we have like you

102
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,719
have a lot of herb tree right now in

103
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,360
Jamaica for different different you have

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,600
Oliva you know you have many type of

105
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,919
trees Bush you you know as we would call

106
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,080
it but the herbs now you know we we

107
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:37,639
really wonder why you know people really

108
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,680
fight the herbs so

109
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,519
much we in which mean give us more time

110
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,519
now to look in it and and check and

111
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,879
realize something must good about it

112
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:49,120
because only the good things are person

113
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,279
would fight against you know rebel

114
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,840
against you know so we get over

115
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,079
understand that you know it's a it's a

116
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,679
plant that you know the king of the

117
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,758
forest you know yeah it's the king of

118
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,959
the forest and is a plant that have a

119
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,400
lot of meaning and and have a lot of use

120
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,120
you know and the more the more I learn

121
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,239
about this plant I learn to know I get

122
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
to learn

123
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,720
that it carry this Farm of medicine

124
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
within it where which where in which it

125
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,520
heal a lot of people worldwide you know

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,479
so I guess probably if them free it up

127
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,399
and Legalize It And thing you know some

128
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,000
of those like um pharmaceutical and all

129
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:29,000
these things you know have to take them

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,600
off the shelf because you know this

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,279
would come and Place everything you know

132
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,879
so when you check back now you really

133
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,478
check the measurement and and check

134
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,279
check the ratio of things and get to

135
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:42,079
over you know that is the reason why

136
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,119
fight against the three so much you know

137
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,000
and then come for find out say we didn't

138
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,360
want human being structure a Canon

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,199
system learning all about these things

140
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,720
it really enhance our knowledge to

141
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,400
understand say certain areas of the

142
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,440
plant the troms the canaban Noid the THC

143
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,839
you know where we as Jamaicans and we as

144
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:05,038
a people as a people need to know about

145
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,959
so we talk about educational aspect

146
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,159
growing and learning about marijuana

147
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,598
from the universities from case come

148
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,000
right back to UI to ncu you know we like

149
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:16,360

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,598
great opportunities and there's great

152
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:25,478
medicinal value for this plant which we

153
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:27,199
continue to to to hold back even though

154
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:29,079
there are some some some federal

155
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,960
governments who say here free up we

156
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:33,560

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,520
government for make such a positive step

160
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:43,519
and we hope we trust within within the

161
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,000
Parliament that it will continue to move

162
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,598
