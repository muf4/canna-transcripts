popularized a Pioneer waterash back

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,960
about 25 years been in the industry for

6
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:35,159
a very long time hemp activism medical

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,520
cannabis and of course recreational

8
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,799
Cannabis I've been coming to ICBC pretty

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,359
much since the beginning uh Alex is a

10
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,599
good friend of mine I've known him since

11
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,399
back in the days of Amsterdam uh 25 plus

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,879
years ago and I've always found that

13
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,000
Alex has done an amazing job with ICBC

14
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:55,759
bringing together the corporates and the

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,960
Legacy you know helping push regulations

16
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,079
helping uh inform and educate

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,439
governments and different groups that

18
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,079
are going to you know obviously be

19
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,759
requiring to understand what this

20
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,759
industry requires and what this industry

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,118
could look like if we all sort of got

22
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,159
behind and and pushed it through the way

23
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:16,478
it needs to be pushed through very

24
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:19,240
different from shows in Canada um in the

25
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,438
sense that you know Berlin is you know

26
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,519
second to none for a cannabis show the

27
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,758
amount of companies and people that that

28
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,039
arrive from both the corporate entities

29
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,118
the Pharma companies but also from

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:34,040
Legacy seed readers and Growers and uh

31
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,959
without ICBC there would really be no

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,960
platform for so many of us to gather uh

33
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,000
and it is truly the conversations that

34
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,078
happen at ICBC are the conversations

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,590
that will shape the future of the

36
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:58,589
Cannabis world that we

37
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:58,590
