you know the quality of the Apex pen as

22
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,680
you've already hit it but uh I think

you'll enjoy that just to have as your

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,799
you know what this is I'm super stoked

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,960
because I did uh spend the day with um

26
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,880
new DK 420 and Sarah Sunday there are

27
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:30,759
last actually was on BC day and we

28
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,359
puffed this thing hard all day

29
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,159
then the next day we ran into you again

30
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,359
we puffed hard

31
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,079
again and then a few days later I ran

32
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,599
into Mark again and it was still puffing

33
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,759
the battery hadn't quite died I was

34
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,158
super stoked even I had it for 5 days

35
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,478

36
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,118

92
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,640

94
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,479

106
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,199

119
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,759
puff uh we've had the pleasure of uh

120
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,319
finding a lot of beautiful hash here

121
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,520
meeting a lot of nice people while here

122
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,038
in Barcelona I agree like I have to say

123
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,560
you know like for the most

124
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:10,839
part I guess I would call us somewhat

125
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,280
pot snobs hash snobs for sure we like

126
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:16,000
the certain level of quality jelle's

127
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:19,038
laughing at us on camera understatement

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,079
is to say the least but um people have

129
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,599
had some really nice stuff I mean even

130
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:26,159
really nice hash even if it's not the

131
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,199
the best melt on the this particular

132
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,280
stuff I love the color love the texture

133
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,680
great

134
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,519
it's just nice smoking some different

135
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,199
hash this is exotic hash we're hitting

136
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:39,318
right now I'm not sure if this is the HQ

137
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,400
mix or the Africanized or the super

138
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,080
silver there's three of them that were

139
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,359
red you know the Shish berries were

140
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:50,359
white but these three were red I got the

141
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,240
Shish and red hatch is something in

142
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,879
Canada and in the states that we

143
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,918
necessarily don't get to encounter very

144
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,399
often at least myself personally very

145
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:00,519
true so it's really nice to see the

146
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,758
different resins the different genetics

147
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,079
and enjoy just enjoy them all around

148
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,759
well I'll tell you when I saw the

149
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,959
Africanized bubble and the fact that it

150
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,199
was red I I believed it you know what I

151
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:13,680
mean like if it would have looked like

152
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,598
the Shish Berry or any other normal hash

153
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,280
I would have been less INRI by well for

154
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:20,319
sure you know it's like you can put a

155
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,719
name on something and make it exotic but

156
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,919
it doesn't really make it exotic you

157
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,680
know th this is what makes it

158
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:30,519
exotic I was told this was the

159
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,400
strongest and the fastest the shishu ber

160
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:35,598
was the most expensive on the menu as

161
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,799
well at35 a gram uh the Africanized

162
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:40,918
bubble came in at €20 a gram Super

163
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,120
Silver Haze was 30 I

164
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:47,719
believe

165
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,680
and the HQ I believe was H was 20 20

166
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,080
yeah the HQ mix was 20 there was 20 25

167
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,000
yeah it was all within you know a

168
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,839
reasonable range all great quality yeah

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,959
I mean considering the same price for

170
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,198
herb if you did the math even for their

171
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,918
cheapest her was $7 a gram their most

172
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,800
expensive was 11 if you do the math of

173
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,680
you know 10 G per gram of bubble herb to

174
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,759
Bubble you're looking at 100 plus dollar

175
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,598
70 to 100 plus dollar for a gram of hash

176
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,080
so we actually got it quite a bit

177
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:18,839
cheaper than if we would if we would

178
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,198
have bought the weed and made it into

179
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,679
the hat and they both understood that

180
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,598
there um David and Eduardo both were

181
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,038
like slow education you know the Spanish

182
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,120
people still have a very hard time

183
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,279
paying uh 20 or30 for a gram of hash you

184
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,519
have to understand the hash culture here

185
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,679
is from Morocco uh Morocco is literally

186
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,399
a Stones throw away from from this

187
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,478
country across the water and so a lot of

188
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:49,758
hashes comes over here average price for

189
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:51,758
Spanish Moroccan hash is about $3 a gram

190
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,240
they're mixing it in with their tobacco

191
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,080
and they're smoking spliffs with that

192
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,800
now imagine these young guys opening up

193
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,959
a beautiful place and showing people no

194
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,478
no no if you're going to smoke it smoke

195
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:04,399
it pure and in it's €30 a gr 10 times

196
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,959
the price that they they're used to

197
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,758
paying for hash not to mention they

198
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,399
can't really smoke it the same way and

199
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,240
it doesn't have the same taste and it

200
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,000
doesn't so these guys have an uphill

201
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,918
battle in my opinion but the fact of the

202
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,839
matter is fighting it head on the fact

203
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:24,038
that he was willing to take dried cured

204
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:26,519
beautiful buds and be willing to stick

205
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:28,478
them in ice and water to get that return

206
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,918
quality back and he said that Shish

207
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,679
Berry was beautiful he said he showed me

208
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,838
pictures of the nugs that he used to

209
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,359
make and we uh actually got to even try

210
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,560
some I got to try some of the herbit

211
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,158
it's just the same I photograph I I sat

212
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,319
with the breeder who bred all these

213
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,278
strains uh while I was photographing

214
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,040
them his name was Danny and spoke with

215
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,759
him a little bit about how he went about

216
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,199
he's been doing it for eight years now

217
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,360
how he went about breeding his strains

218
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,120
and selecting and whatnot and just was

219
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,360
all around impressed um the herb that he

220
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,679
had that he showed you in in the jars to

221
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,079
for us to run uh David the Russian guy

222
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,799
he basically told me it wasn't good

223
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:06,838
enough quality for a shop and I'm

224
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,559
looking at this Bud gr I could have

225
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,880
easily run this through this shop he

226
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,639
could have just easily put it on the

227
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,078
menu and run the whole kilo right out of

228
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,439
the shop but he was like and I was

229
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,559
impressed that he said this I couldn't

230
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,800
believe it he said you know it was

231
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:21,799
because of you you know we watch you and

232
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,599
we follow you and you're Perfection and

233
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,958
everything has to be the best and that's

234
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,680
why we want to wash this butt and not

235
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,759
sell it on our menu and I was like holy

236
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,719
smokes man that's like twice as much

237
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,879
money lost for him to for him to have

238
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,800
that kind of Integrity level of

239
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:40,879
dedication quality and the customers I

240
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:45,278
mean I'm con convinced but most people

241
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:48,519
choose profit over integrity and thus we

242
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:51,200
have what is called you know and I say

243
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:54,919
this in a way I don't call it the entire

244
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,920
scene but the BHO scene in Brackets

245
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:00,000
which is not Vern Phillips which is not

246
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,599
like the high-end guy k triome

247
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,360
technology these guys are actually doing

248
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
it on a level that's that's that's

249
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,560
unique and different I'm talking about

250
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,759
the

251
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:12,199
98% so these guys really impressed me in

252
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:15,679
that sense they only want ice hat Tony's

253
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,759
in the house Tony in the house all right

254

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,880
Spain Tony's having issues but we're

258

going to get his issues sorted out we're

259
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,639
actually on our way to Medical seeds

260
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,399
here right away we're going to go see

261
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:34,199
Javier who won uh first prize for the

262
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,120
best water hash uh at spannabis and I

263
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,920
believe he won also maybe a second for

264
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,039
his uh oil extraction but I I don't

265
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:45,319
quote me on what extract it is I don't

266
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:48,759
know if he made it with ISO or butane or

267
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,879

I and this

289
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:55,120
would yes and we also have super silver

290
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:57,560
haze uh HQ uh

291
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,839
mix which I I suggested to them that

292
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:02,399
they call Lucky Day cuz it's a canono

293
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,279
profile they'll never see again right

294
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,839
it's when they take certain hashes and

295
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:07,759
they mix them all together they call it

296
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,680
their HQ mix I said man you should call

297
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:13,078
that stuff Lucky Day because really

298
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,838
whoever buys that it's their lucky day

299
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:17,599
they're never going to find that canabo

300
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,880
profile ever again you know where you

301
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,800
mixed in like some OG and some sour and

302
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,240
some emerald and some Tahoe and you just

303
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,519
had a little bit of this other one that

304
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,240
you threw in some those quite frequently

305
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,679
end up becoming my favorite batches I

306
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,560
having to do it a lot myself listen

307
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,439
because that gets us to a point now

308
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,359
where we're not just extracting resins

309
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,480
now we're like Alchemists or something

310
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,079
and we're Mi exactly we're making our

311
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,839
own blends of cannaboids you know that

312
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:48,479
is cool particularly in the way of just

313
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,160
looking for a different relief you know

314
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,480
having all your different kinds and

315
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:58,120
that's great I like a lot of about 45 I

316
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,360
like the toilet it's 10:00 it's 10 11 oh

317
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,159
that the 11 get 11 get 11 things they

318
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,839
let us know every time what time it is

319
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:07,319
up here in Barcelona so I guess we're

320
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,880
going to finish off with a few more rips

321
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,360
and then we got to get jump in a cab and

322
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,320
go see Javier from medical seeds get

323
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,560
this day started uh I guess we're going

324
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,120
to wash some uh resin today sounds good

325
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,359
excellent all right guys well keep

326
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,440
watching I'll talk to you soon well I'm

327
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,639
kind of all for John's idea in which uh

328
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,560
we crush this herb that he put on the

329
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,240
screens in front of us I don't know

330
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,479
there's a boat 50 or 20 or 70 G yeah 70

331
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,560
grams

332
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,360
together so I don't know we got the

333
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:42,239
screen set up we got the 250 and the 180

334
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,000
which is the 90 and the 60

335
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,879
LPI so we have the 60 on top as it is

336
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,759
the smallest number it'll be the biggest

337
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,919
whole size if measured in in microns

338
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,320
that's how the LPI to

339
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,719
Micron uh it's confusing isn't it yeah I

340
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,399
no it's really good that actually

341
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,519
measuring this because even I've been

342
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,278
confused gets confused and I've taken

343
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,519
pictures of them backwards and I was

344
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,559
like yeah so thank you for explaining

345
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,399
this well we get into the Micron sizes

346
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,838
we know that microns are easy it's uh a

347
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:18,000
250 would be a big hole going down to a

348
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:20,360
180 to a 160 a 120 a 90 a 73 Etc if we

349
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,839
were doing bubble bags or whatnot um it

350
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,240
goes from bigger to smaller but lines

351
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,759
per inch works in the opposite way of

352
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,600
the actual size of the hole how many

353
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:34,320
lines per inch measures how big the hole

354
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,000
is and it generally works in the

355
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,680
opposite way so um you know 250 Micron

356
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,919
would actually be 60 lines per inch

357
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,799
whereas 180 Micron would be 90 lines per

358
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:49,078
inch and it continues down that way I

359
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:51,679
have the 70 Micron here which is 10 and

360
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:55,120
no sorry a 200 lines per inch as you can

361
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:57,559
see right there on the 200 200 so we're

362
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,399
going to take some of this herb and uh

363
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:01,638
yeah just get some quick hits let's go

364
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,879
for some quick hits get some quick hits

365
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,919
I love quick hits so this is the

366
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:08,000
watermelon that um basically that I just

367
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:11,000
finished trimming up and

368
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
uh

369
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,919
Hey and this is just the

370
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:27,240
easy get a couple quick hits God does

371
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:30,360
that smell good

372
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,360
[Music]

373
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,440
this is the nice little popcorn two

374
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,439
screen method

375
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:53,639
[Music]

376
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:57,079
here all right let's check we know this

377
00:15:53,639 --> 00:16:00,600
method the way lighter you are the way

378
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:03,239
higher the the quality will be so uh

379
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,240
yeah nice and

380
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,839
light hold that up for one second so

381
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,719
that is one grade right there that's

382
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,959
down on this screen but remember if you

383
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,959
lift them both

384
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,679
simultaneously

385
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:23,519
gently very gently gently gently what

386
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,120
will be left on top of this screen will

387
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,278
should be of the highest quality you got

388
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,318
my brush there yes it is excellent so

389
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,318
let's see what we got got

390
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:46,318
here now that is some glistening stuff

391
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:49,278
oh yeah I mean ridiculously

392
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:53,198
so uh let's get the macro camera on that

393
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:59,759
right now all right so a little bit of

394
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:59,758
heada for Sir John here we go it

395
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:10,720
some full melt

396
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:10,720
trones just the head

397
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:18,359
is how's the taste on that well I do

398
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:18,359
know one

399
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:27,240
thing organically grown only low temps

400
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,400
low humidity tasty as hell that is that

401
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,839
is by far some of the most resin plant

402
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,120
that I've actually grown um had some bug

403
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:39,279
problems so I went down to 65° at night

404
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,279
70 during the day and uh with that we

405
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,879
got some amazing

406
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:47,440
resin definitely the turps are

407
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,520
definitely amazing too and Next Step a

408
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,000
little bit colder see what

409
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,000
happens let's make me a hit

410
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,759
100% I think this stuff is not dry

411
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,919
enough for this re real type of dry

412
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:06,079
sifting I think if you dry this out even

413
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:09,080
more you'll uh you'll find that it

414
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,798
really releases those heads well maybe

415
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:12,119
I'll have to do that we bone dry and

416
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,759
then I'll crush it over the screen and

417
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:18,759
see exactly what we get out of this

418
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,759
yeah

419
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,880
exactly that's probably good right

420
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:27,439
there oh guarantee it is going move it

421
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,760
right over grab that little butt up

422
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,759
there we put it right back where it was

423
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:40,079
oh that's all

424
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,319
right and

425
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,079
over and we are kind of a little bit

426
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,079
blocked by

427
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:50,798
the a little bit of contaminant floating

428
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,798
around there but I'm able to get that

429
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,798
out

430
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,199
all

431
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:08,000
right nice

432
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,240
little hit for

433
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,640
me here you

434
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,759
go here you

435
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,640
go camera down now we can even do the

436
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,319
the after this we do the flick the flick

437
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,759
the

438
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:26,678
flick got to remember the

439
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:29,240
flick oh yes the I love the brush it

440
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:31,360
seems to work very well def going to get

441
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,798
myself one there's the simple brush

442
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,798
that's all you

443
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:40,240
need all right this is just a little

444
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,240
mini hit but a hit

445
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,120
nonetheless we're going to get some

446
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,120
bigger hits out of this 100%

447
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,558
super tasty and

448
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,558
lovely all right let's give it a

449
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:12,519
flick the

450
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,400
flick now I can definitely see the

451
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:15,200
amount of contaminant on the screen

452
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,410
right

453
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,920
now and some very big

454
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,920
[Music]

455
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,840
heads see you got to get a

456
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:31,599
brush wow that actually looks really

457
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:35,119
nice and clean too well I think these

458
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,119
ones look even

459
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,759
nicer so that's definitely uh well well

460
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,919
let's get out the macro camera and see

461
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,158
there you go that's coming up okay we'll

462
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,840
do

463
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:00,840

realized that the bud was just not

490
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,200
really dry enough when you're when

491
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,240
you're this is a hard thing it's it's

492
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,480
hard enough to commit to put your buds

493
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,519
on a screen and and grind them all up

494
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,038
but the true commitment comes in will

495
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:17,519
you actually dry that bud right to bone

496
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:20,599
dry to the point where it's not really

497
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:23,079
going to be that good for puffing like

498
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,480
in in joints and stuff it's it's really

499
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:28,918
being committed to you're using it in in

500
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,798
hash making yeah well it looks like I'm

501
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,000
taking it back home I'm going to get a

502
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,839
nice and Bone and crisp dry I did that

503
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,200
last time let it hang for about a month

504
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:39,678
and this time well it was hot out and

505
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,120
then

506
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,640
uh I guess the bag started sweating a

507
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:47,678
little bit so back to the old screens I

508
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,200
got the same set sitting at home so I'm

509
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,038
definitely going to go home I'm going to

510
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,919
throw that popcorn on there and uh we're

511
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:56,839
going to Bone try that out and uh

512
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,520
basically come back with it all nicely

513
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:00,359
crushed maybe I'll film it and then I I

514
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,918
can uh come back here and I'll clean it

515
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:05,959
next puff Wednesday excellent yeah and I

516
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:08,240
still have to do the fresh floen of the

517
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,038
same strain in uh in the freezer so

518
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,200
that's 280 G of that and I think uh

519
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:13,960
because of the weather right now and it

520
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,319
being cool out and it's raining I think

521
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,120
I'm going to get to that batch maybe

522
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:20,678
tomorrow myself and uh I know you got

523
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,439
some backup yourself is there is my rag

524
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,240
next to you there I had my rag up on the

525
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,600
