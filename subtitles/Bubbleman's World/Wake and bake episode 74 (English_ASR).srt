4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,980
of my good buddy Dana Larson's books

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:15,990
today green buds and hash this is a

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,028
[ __ ] awesome little book when I first

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,260
saw it it threw me off a little bit I

8
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:21,239
was kind of like wow oh he's doing these

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,368
kids books but he's making a cannabis

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,439
like I wasn't I was a little like Oh

11
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:27,179
what and then as I read the book and I

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,730
learned more about what what Dana was

13
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,649
doing with Harry pothead and with green

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,140
buds and hash and a few other different

15
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:36,238
books I really saw that the parody was

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,920
really educational and there was a whole

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,649
bunch of information that he was passing

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,090
on that would be good for parents to

19
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,160
read to their kids particularly if maybe

20
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,920
they're using cannabis as a medicine and

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,378
they want to kind of break into the ice

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,359
the book I wanted to give away today was

23
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,179
a copy of cannabis in Canada another

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,500

25
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:57,269
artwork done throughout the whole book I

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,840

mixture look at this guy he loves herb

202
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:39,250
he learned the secret perhaps I would

203
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,679
prefer to puff and stop when I have had

204
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,570
enough I will roll some juicy joints and

205
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,359

206

214
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:06,399

216
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,580
mister stache thank you for green buds

217
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:14,440
and hash yeah dude Thank You Dana Larson

218
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,990
for putting together such a cool little

219
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,000
book I think that that is a real fun

220
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,009
little story I didn't read the whole

221
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,778
thing there was quite a bit of him kind

222
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:25,600
of trying to turn the dude on and get

223
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:28,059
him to try some cannabis of course you

224
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,980
know it's a classic story really done

225
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,269
and a parody of a dr. Seuss but we all

226
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,769
know the story we all have our

227
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,049
grandparents and some of us have our

228
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:37,059
parents that are very endocannabinoid

229
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:39,789
deficiency and it's one thing to have a

230
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:41,649
negative against cannabinoids and and

231
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:42,969
you know feel people that use them are

232
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,639
negative and have this sort of prejudice

233
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,620
towards it but it's another to cut

234
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:49,990
yourself off from the actual benefits

235
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,570
that it could be giving you so I think

236
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:57,730
that that book is a real neat little way

237
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:59,560
to educate through the parody of dr.

238
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,639
Seuss which we all love dr. Seuss I mean

239
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:02,859
my goodness couldn't have picked a

240
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,419
better one really and I think we should

241
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,579
have one more little dab what do you

242
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,500
think The Grinch grinning the rasen

243
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:10,359
pressed has squeezed out its last drop

244
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,450
Tina Larsson is great I want to give a

245
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,659
mad shout out to Dana Larson he has done

246
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,329
so much good for the cannabis seen here

247
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:20,448
in van

248
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:22,729
Coover really from the beginning days

249
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:25,428
when I first met him Dana was the editor

250
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,798
for cannabis culture magazine that was a

251
00:10:25,428 --> 00:10:30,619
long time ago like over 20 years I want

252
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:32,360
to say and he's done a lot since you

253
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:34,790
know when Mark went to jail Dana really

254
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,379
picked up the slack he started opening

255
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:38,149
dispensaries teaching people how to open

256
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:40,938
dispensaries he's got his MJ cream

257
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:42,889
company he was doing sensible BC he's

258
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:45,948
running for the NDP he's like the guy is

259
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:47,298
really busy and I just think that all

260
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:48,528
the work that he does is really good and

261
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:51,048
you couldn't really support a better

262
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:53,239
person in the cannabis industry if you

263
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:55,278
put money towards Dana or his companies

264
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:59,480
you know the majority of it goes right

265
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:04,129
back into the industry the community you

266
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,829
know activism so yeah yeah he's got some

267
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:08,360
great pot TV I remember him doing like a

268
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:10,488
what was he doing like smoking DMT and

269
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,899
smoke and herb and then driving his car

270
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:13,970
yeah I got it he got into a bit of

271
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:15,860
trouble for that one but hey let's have

272
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:30,139
a quick dab here and gonna get another

273
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:32,959
one done here another one done if you

274
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:35,600
could change one thing who you have done

275
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,969
your cannabis travels what would you

276
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,319
change and why

277
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,540
well a lot of people might say that they

278
00:11:39,318 --> 00:11:43,278
would change getting busted at the

279
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:45,769
roadblock was 16 pounds in six and a

280
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,869
half grand cash but for me that was an

281
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:49,188
obstacle turned into an opportunity and

282
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:51,860
I don't think bubble bags would have

283
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:54,139
ever been created had I not had that

284
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,239
happen so I don't think I would change

285
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:57,558
anything I think that when you go back

286
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:59,749
and you try to change things in your

287
00:11:57,558 --> 00:12:03,198
life and inadvertently you will change a

288
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:05,540
lot more than you think and I'm not

289
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:08,208
really a big on regrets guy I look at a

290
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:11,298
lot of my obstacles my mistakes if you

291
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:13,609
will as obstacles and I wouldn't regret

292
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:16,838
any of them in fact maybe my only regret

293
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,839
is not making more mistakes

294
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:24,639
they were very submit my mistakes were

295
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,100
very successful for me that's what I'll

296
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:32,350
say my mistakes were very successful for

297
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:45,579
me so the more mistakes for me the

298
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:50,159
better exactly exactly

299
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:54,068
I [ __ ] up rather well that's right

300
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:58,028
sometimes anyway a bunch of know what

301
00:12:54,068 --> 00:13:00,338
else but if you'd only find purple candy

302
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:03,370
strain and shatter well I feel your pain

303
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:05,439
buddy I feel your pain I think mine is

304
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,539
not trying cannabis before age 42 that's

305
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:11,769
okay Tara Leigh that's ok you found it

306
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:13,208
now it's your friend and it will be with

307
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:15,068
you you know throughout the rest of your

308
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,659
life if you just if you so choose and if

309
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:18,039
not it'll always be there when you

310
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:21,219
choose to come back that's the beautiful

311
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:24,669
thing about cannabis it's always there I

312
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,290
know that today on Canada Day they'll

313
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:27,818
have the police out on the boats and

314
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:29,139
they'll be looking at all the boats and

315
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:30,490
they'll be coming around to everyone and

316
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:33,278
the reason that is is not because people

317
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,829
enjoy cannabis but because people abuse

318
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,509
alcohol and alcohol is dangerous

319
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:40,899
particularly in almost any situation

320
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:42,669
actually it can become dangerous so out

321
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:44,438
on a boat definitely can become

322
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:46,058
dangerous things like being out on a

323
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:48,099
boat especially on the ocean you want to

324
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,568
be humble you want to be respectful you

325
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,240
want to pay attention you definitely

326
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:54,578
don't want to turn your back on the boat

327
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,709
Oh what do we go we got Lilian Morgan

328
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:59,649
let me just pull out my hammer I think

329
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:01,688
that's what she wants I think dad's when

330
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:06,278
she wants there she is

331
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:07,659
there she is boom wouldn't be a big make

332
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,149
without a Bott experience you know I

333
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:11,708
kind of feel like that as well that was

334
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,149
one of the a sports people die for

335
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,649
drinking and boating near the lake near

336
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:18,100
me every summer of course they do of

337
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:19,149
course they do so you know today they'll

338
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,459
be out there they'll be in their

339
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,740
militarized vests and guns and radios

340
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:26,839
and pepper sprays and they'll be driving

341
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,950
around searching from boat to boat and

342
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,990
you know when they get to mind boat

343
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,450
they're not gonna find any alcohol

344
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:35,149
whatsoever they might see a bomb they

345
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,129
might see some hashish but they're

346
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:39,500
definitely not going to be seeing any

347
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:40,909
alcohol so we'll see how it goes with

348
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,679
that maybe we'll end up having a

349
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:44,120
conversation definitely gonna be

350
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:47,659
bringing my federal license with me out

351
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,889
on the water that is for sure yeah there

352
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:51,350
you go when was the last time you ran

353
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,090
out of hash bubble man I don't think

354
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,070
I've ever run out of hashes bubble man

355
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:57,170
to be honest that sounds like an alien

356
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:01,400
experience I've gotten low but not

357
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:03,199
running out I mean for instance my okay

358
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:08,179
for instance let me show you this little

359
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:10,220
situation here this is a jar of about 10

360
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:12,769
or 15 grams of full melt dry sift and

361
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:16,009
this is another jar of about 10 or 15

362
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:18,889
grams of full melt dry sift and they are

363
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:21,470
used from for my phone I put my phone on

364
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:23,120
them I bounced my phone on these two

365
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,550
jars I guess that you guys didn't even

366
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,129
know that but every day I do these wake

367
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:31,479
and bake videos my phone is sitting on

368
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:34,189
about 25 grams of full melt dry sift

369
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,960
it's funny because each time I kind of

370
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,580
want to smoke it and I'm like all the

371
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,800
phones on it I don't want to really move

372
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,320
it and buhbuh buhbuh blah but yeah I

373
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:46,519
mean I can open almost any jar any any

374
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,200
spot on my desk and there's just there's

375
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,750
just stuff you know there's some other

376
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,750
ratios distillate boom you know there's

377
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,759
some leftover dry sift it's just

378
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,740
everywhere this stuff this stuff is

379
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,779
everywhere I think we've been through

380
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,310
this already it's stuck everywhere it is

381
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:04,759
everywhere I have some 10 year old stuff

382
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:05,539
stuck right here next to my computer

383
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,879
desk

384
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:12,199
I love hashish I like to keep it around

385
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:14,000
don't run out show the aircon temp

386
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,000
control I'm not sure what that is that

387
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,529
you're requesting how about the floor oh

388
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,750
god did the floor yeah the floors the

389
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:25,639
floors got some hash on it I'm not gonna

390
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,769
lie I spent about 20 minutes yesterday

391
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,549
cleaning my desk and it's the first time

392
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:35,120
in a long time like I cleaned down here

393
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:37,490
and you can barely see there's some of

394
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,320
the some of the hard drives on the other

395
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,220
side there but ya cleaned her up a

396
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,600
little bit

397
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:47,570
a little bit scrape scrape scrape I

398
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,550
remember I had my desk in my office at

399
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,110
the melting point and there was a

400
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:53,779
homeless guy that used to come and ask

401
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,039
for any type of jobs and we would of

402
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,629
course you know try to give him as many

403
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,699
jobs as possible and one of the things

404
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,939
that he would do is tidy up the gallery

405
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,650
and do the floors we had like a mop and

406
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,420
pail and whatnot and he used to come in

407
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,799
and when he was around my desk I came in

408
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,720
one time I felt so bad

409
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,309
he's like down with his hands and knees

410
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,630
and he's trying to use the soap and he's

411
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:14,599
like I don't know what this is it's some

412
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,460
kind of some kind of a resin and it was

413
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:20,240
just like there was probably like seven

414
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:23,120
to ten grams of it around my chair on my

415
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,339
desk like an absurd amount for really I

416
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,899
said Oh try some alcohol I gave him some

417
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:28,939
isopropanol I'm sick Oh what's coming

418
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,670
off really good now just felt bad you

419
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,900
know it's like a lot a lot of hash on

420
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,550
the ground there probably could have

421
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,040
like a trailer-park but yeah I'm serious

422
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:39,409
I'm not even [ __ ] joking like a no

423
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,000
joke it was that much because when he

424
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,940
finally scraped it all up it might have

425
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,319
even been more it was ridiculous

426
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,750
but back then it was the days of

427
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:49,819
abundance and youth and stupidity and

428
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:54,980
lots maybe more we're getting dropped

429
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:58,759
and needed to be oh yeah chest out your

430
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:01,009
desk hm that's good floor hash well they

431
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:02,450
were hardwood floors in that sense so

432
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:04,460
that was good but I had a roller chair

433
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,920
and I'd end up rolling over all of it so

434
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,259
actually the wheels on the chair I also

435
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:13,400
were pretty gummed up not as impressive

436
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:15,319
as skunk man Sam sealing a pipe okay

437
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,930
with cleaning his bong I think it took

438
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:20,059
him about 15 to 20 years but he sealed a

439
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,860
pipe like when they came and they cut

440
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:25,159
that pipe out and they cut it open it

441
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:28,250
was like solid resin on the inside of

442
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:32,230
like a pipe bro like do you know tough

443
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,230
you have to puff to be able to do that

444
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,800
yeah hardwood floors are not a good

445
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:42,019
desiccant at all ooh cat hairs man I'd

446
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:43,279
be picking my cat out of my house if it

447
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:48,680
was doing that sort of thing

448
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:50,720
mess around shave that cat one man

449
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,890
gather wood another man spills do you

450
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,100
know would have been like hey bud I

451
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,200
scraped that out makes it

452
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,969
alcohol strain it through a filter don't

453
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,220
be that don't be like that set your bar

454
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:02,009
higher my friend you can do it you can

455
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,750
do it you know it's a weird kind of

456
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:05,730
thing with cannabis where we want to

457
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,230
save every last bit and I feel it and

458
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,000
I've always felt like the edible

459
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,860
industry really started by people trying

460
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,279
to save what they were throwing away

461
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:18,750
from after extracting or you know lower

462
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:20,160
quality materials trims whatever and you

463
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,419
know it turned into oh let's just you

464
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,009
know we'll make some butter we'll make

465
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,169
some product with the leftovers and

466
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:27,419
that's the edible quality that they're

467
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:29,100
giving to people I would love to see the

468
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,600
day where edibles are made with the

469
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:32,639
utmost I mean I guess there's a huge

470
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,859
distillate edible market now so that's

471
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,900
good that they're taking high-quality

472
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:40,500
cannabinoids or at least high percentage

473
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,090
maybe not quality of hopefully purity

474
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,038
when you're using monomolecular

475
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:46,798
medicines because generally if you're

476
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:48,150
not coming up pure probably it's going

477
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,179
to be some of the solvents that are left

478
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:52,769
over in there but yeah very interesting

479
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:57,120
I saw the Vegas drop yesterday

480
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:58,408
I saw that good for Vegas yeah high

481
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,298
quality medicine why not make the best

482
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:02,100
hash that you could make like take your

483
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:05,038
90 micron and make your edibles with

484
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:07,709
that now that's a level of medicine that

485
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:11,069
fur for myself that's what I want I

486
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:13,890
would want that's what I would want what

487
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:17,038
was that question oh I miss let me just

488
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,330
get caught up here what your thoughts

489
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,158
are making dries up with bubble bags

490
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:21,990
well what are my thoughts are making dry

491
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:26,720
sapote bubble bags what are my thoughts

492
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:30,450
on filming a movie on a still camera or

493
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,339
taking pictures with a video camera what

494
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,019
do you guys notice when you take

495
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:35,699
pictures with a video camera do you

496
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:38,579
notice that the pictures kind of suck

497
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,159
and you notice when you make video with

498
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:44,759
a camera even a beautiful camera like a

499
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:47,970
5d Mark 3 beautiful camera they they

500
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,490
filmed some Hollywood scenes of movies

501
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,710
with that camera however there are

502
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:55,380
limitations to it and it's not properly

503
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,990
designed for that job so for instance

504
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,789
with the 5d Mark 3 it's fine if you want

505
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,349
to set up the camera set your focus and

506
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:03,419
your lighting and have a shot move

507
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:05,219
through the camera but if the camera

508
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,410
itself has to move with the shot and

509
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,200
focus has to stay and

510
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,670
and an interchange then you're gonna be

511
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,100
[ __ ] and you would want to use a

512
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,960
camera that was designed to film in that

513
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:18,599
way so for me the bubble bags were

514
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,090
designed to use water I'm not saying you

515
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:22,949
can't make a sift with bubble bags but

516
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:25,829
I'm saying they weren't designed for it

517
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:28,680
they're not ideal for that job and if

518
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:31,259
you're taking it seriously it's not

519
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,690
really a ton of cash to get some dry

520
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:35,009
sift screens you can make them yourself

521
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:38,120
for probably a hundred maybe a little

522
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:42,359
more I sell them for a couple hundred

523
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:44,009
obviously minor great quality warrantied

524
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:47,339
and come with the customer service that

525
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:49,769
is asking me a question about it at any

526
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,779
time so those are the value differences

527
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:53,339
you can do what you need to do if you

528
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,079
want to support fresh headies bubble

529
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:56,399
bags we got your screens we can show you

530
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,099
a couple of different ways to make some

531
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,690
really great dry sift screens that are

532
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:05,519
designed specifically to do that well

533
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,350
the best heating unit is going to be the

534
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,569
one that you like the best you know you

535
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:11,009
can't ask someone else what the best is

536
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:15,000
because we all have different opinions

537
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:16,500
and we all have different abilities I

538
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,160
guess you would you know if someone who

539
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,230
has a very low olfactory and very low

540
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,940
taste compared to someone who has a high

541
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,890
olfactory and a high level of taste

542
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,230
they're not going to be experiencing

543
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,750
things the same ok one's going to

544
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,970
experience much more of the terpene

545
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,640
profile that is present than the other

546
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:38,339
and so that's a level of enjoyment that

547
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,140
maybe the one doesn't even know exists

548
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:42,089
you've also got people that are so

549
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:45,360
sensitive that they notice the

550
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:47,250
differences between resin and terpenes

551
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,099
evaporating off of different heat

552
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:52,890
sources so titanium versus sapphire

553
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:56,819
glass versus silicon carbide ceramic all

554
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:58,980
of these different compounds are going

555
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:02,490
to disperse the heat differently and

556
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,930
that is how we vaporize like when you

557
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,299
hit your torch

558
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,430
you torch up your nail whatever your

559
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:10,950
nail is made of and then you decide how

560
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:13,289
long you allow that temperature to leave

561
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,900
that nail each one of these surface

562
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:17,920
areas is are different so there's really

563
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,519
no real answer for that and this

564
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,750
that that it's gonna be different for

565
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,430
all of us it's gonna be different for

566
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,559
each of us and it's interesting because

567
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,789
once you know that you can grab these

568
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,529
different surface areas and you can

569
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:31,509
start doing some experimenting and see

570
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:34,329
if you can't notice the difference

571
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:36,879
really a perfect example is you know

572
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:40,689
with with the count with how people are

573
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,550
in the their lot their the horrible

574
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,980
distaste that is left in their mouth for

575
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:46,359
thinking of wasting a cannabis product

576
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,740
especially something that's been illegal

577
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:49,899
for so long and even through its

578
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,970
legalities it's still expensive like

579
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,440
platinum it's so expensive people don't

580
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,600
want to waste it so what people tend to

581
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,809
do is they tend to heat things too much

582
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,429
they hit things too hot they Chazz they

583
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:02,740
get this really hot hit but they feel

584
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,630
that they got it all you did get it all

585
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,099
in a sense but you destroyed so much of

586
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,920
the terpene profile that you didn't

587
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:12,459
really experience the other side of that

588
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,750
rip you got that hardcore blue like THC

589
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,180
buzz but you didn't really experience

590
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,910
the the velvety smoothness of the

591
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:21,400
bouquet that profile that is the

592
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,960
underlining you know connection it's the

593
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,400
language if you will and we're going to

594
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,250
be getting into this into hash church

595
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,650
tomorrow terpenes are the most widely

596
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:31,930
ranged language on the planet it's hell

597
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:34,150
it's how we communicate its plants

598
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:37,450
communicate to us and to one another

599
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:39,610
smells pheromones all of these different

600
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:43,960
things are languages that create

601
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:47,649
dialogue between different you know from

602
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,730
people to animals to plants to etc so

603
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,590
we're gonna have a really cool

604
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,900
conversation about this we're gonna get

605
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,490
in some great guys from soil Balance Pro

606
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,190
to come in and talk about their love of

607
00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:00,720
soil and probiotics and the importance

608
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:03,670
of these bacterias to produce these

609
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,610
symbiotic relationships where the plants

610
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,230
can be pushed to express greater and

611
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:11,889
further terpene and cannabinoid

612
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:13,960
expressions so it's gonna be good for

613
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,280
sure in the meantime I feel like I

614
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,250
should have one more rip with you guys

615
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:21,009
before we send you off I have been

616
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:23,980
yammering a little bit but when I get on

617
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:25,569
it you know I want to stay on it so that

618
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,269
was something I wanted to share with you

619
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:30,639
guys in regards to is there ever just a

620
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:31,690
simple answer no there isn't and it's

621
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,990
taken me 20 years

622
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:39,129
learn this I will have a big rip for the

623
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:41,259
Aussies love the Aussies yeah man

624
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:42,759
yeah Oscar it's gonna be good well blue

625
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:44,409
river above the man brand be a chalice

626
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:45,940
this year I'm not too sure Tony said no

627
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,399
and then I saw the other day like oh

628
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:53,590
maybe I will go so maybe he'll just roll

629
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:57,128
through I'm not sure I'm not sure we'll

630
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:59,528
see what happens we'll see what happens

631
00:25:57,128 --> 00:26:01,000
and then more hashed Church dramas

632
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:02,409
coming out in the near future that you

633
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,819
guys will hear about you'll notice a

634
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:05,139
little bit of change in hashed Church

635
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:07,720
over the course of the next two or three

636
00:26:05,138 --> 00:26:09,729
weeks and yeah it's gonna be exciting

637
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:14,100
I'll see what happens all right here we

638
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:14,099
go lemon Larry oh gee

639
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,779
well yeah yeah drama we got to keep it

640
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:28,700
we got to keep it dramatic so people are

641
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:28,700
interested that's how it goes right

642
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,940
there you go deej right hey you know

643
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:44,460
what drama doesn't have to be a negative

644
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:47,070
thing it really doesn't sometimes drama

645
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,319
is really exciting and awesome I think

646
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:51,539
so many people are focused that drama is

647
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,189
like this negative thing that people are

648
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:55,680
creating and it's all harsh and it's

649
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,620
that's one form of drama but there are

650

best way you could have put that drama
