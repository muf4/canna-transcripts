00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,540
hey what's going on everybody welcome to

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:09,388
hash Church episode 144 sorry for being

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,269
a few minutes late there I was of course

4
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:16,500
doing a little research and I got a

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:20,640
little stuck on the research and now I'm

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,320
gonna send out the links pop that down I

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,380
hope everyone's doing well today I'm

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,368
just gonna course get the links out here

9
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,868
doing a little bit of research today

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,118
trying to find out what companies have

11
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:34,170
been lobbying the Canadian government to

12
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:35,460
shut down dispensaries and it's a little

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,800
bit interesting it's not that easy

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,710
because a lot of these groups do you

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:43,500
know they hire a group to do their

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,910
lobbying for them and I'm sure we'll end

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,429
up talking about it a little bit here

18
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:49,199

passed away I never knew him as a

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,979
cannabis activists as much as I knew him

34
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,849
as an internet troll and I don't say

35
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:32,219
that as a negative

36
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,809
I just really only knew him as that and

37
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:35,819
seeing the beautiful wonderful things

38
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,978
that people have said to him I'm pretty

39
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,750
much concerned I believe that they're

40
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,429
not saying it just because he's passed

41
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,649
away the guy actually did some great

42
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,530
things and had a lot of people actually

43
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,299
loving him so rest in peace Mickey

44
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,670
thanks for the good work that you did in

45
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,920
the cannabis industry yeah Mike Mickey

46
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,439
was a pioneer in the edibles here in

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,340
California and he was busted and did his

48
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:01,199
time and took his lumps and yeah always

49
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,299
yeah he was definitely a troll he gave

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,978
people their [ __ ] he was kind of uh he

51
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,640
was a [ __ ] stirrer but he was our [ __ ]

52
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:10,519
stirrer right he was never afraid to

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,408
call everyone in anyone

54
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:14,859
I was very fortunate not to be on the

55
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:18,769
[ __ ] list at the same time if you were

56
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:20,420
you resent you received samarth and it

57
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,769
was usually justifiably so you didn't

58
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:22,218
just pick on anybody just to pick on

59
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:24,680
anybody

60
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:28,039
no body who was doing [ __ ] and he gave

61
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,569
you the shit's I don't know I will ever

62
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:32,269

64
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:37,370

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,489
have nice things to say about people

70
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:55,459
rather than the tossing of them under

71
00:02:49,489 --> 00:03:01,129

100
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:21,139

121
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,180
to my mentor kind of letting the cat out

122
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:29,800
of the bag kind of thing and I don't

123
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,168
know if it'll manifest but I feel if I

124
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,300
talk about it especially to thousands of

125
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:36,639
people it'll be more likely to manifest

126
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,139
in my newest dream my newest

127
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,569
manifestation that I'm trying to get

128
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:42,789
going is thanks to Todd for inviting

129
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:44,740
forever flowering greenhouses in here

130
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,530
because I'm still thinking about that

131
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,509
greenhouse non-stop thinking about

132
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:52,059
putting it in behind my house thinking

133
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:54,399
about getting my mentor Ron Hickey to

134
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,949
move from his grow in the Kootenays to

135
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,589
come out here and take care of the grow

136
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:02,500
it would be the r grow in the back yard

137
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:05,109
here and just do shows every day with

138
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,329
tips from Ron I mean the guy has he

139
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,220
truly knows how to grow great cannabis I

140
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:11,918
put him up there with a lot of people

141
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,600
that I know we often say he's forgotten

142
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,209
more about cannabis than most we'll ever

143
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,950
learn and so we were looking forward to

144
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:21,250
maybe getting that manifestation in the

145
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:23,050
next couple of months a reality build an

146
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,449
ice forever flower in green house in the

147
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,970
backyard start the project plants a

148
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:30,370
whole crop of Congolese is what we were

149
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:33,220
thinking to do it may be 99 Congo plants

150
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,810
and I just think it would be great just

151
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,020
for the social media for the wake and

152
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:40,199
bakes for me to be able to hang out

153
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:42,659
one of my best and oldest friends mentor

154
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,120
father figure grandfather figures so

155
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,409
that's sort of something that I'm hoping

156
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,449
that's gonna happen in the near future

157
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:51,060
even if the grow itself didn't happen

158
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:54,120
and I just got Ron out here living out

159
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,579
here in my kids life in my life that to

160
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,649
me would be a win-win-win but if the

161
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:02,310
green house happens and the grow happens

162
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:05,359
well it's gonna be fun I'll tell you

163
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,949
what it's gonna be fun well why not well

164
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,990
that's just it I have a federal license

165
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:12,300
for 99 plants and I don't have a single

166
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:21,150
plant in the ground like what is wrong

167
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:23,668
with me think of all the money you can

168
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:26,120
save don't have to buy pot if you just

169
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:29,129
spend a couple hundred grand growing it

170
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,658
ya know it's for real and and cuz Ron

171
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:32,879
and I obviously have no interest in

172
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:34,918
undermining the the program and selling

173
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,750
the plot as much as we just want to the

174
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,468
value really will be in the sharing of

175
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:42,000
the information the social media

176
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:43,680
promotions the photography that I'll be

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,560
able to get and all that sort of eye

178
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,199
candy and then for me really the real

179
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,209
value I'm not gonna lie he's getting to

180
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,038
spend time with one of my mentors man

181
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:55,500
like these these guys are getting older

182
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,209
and older and I just I'm getting older

183
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,689
and older and I want to spend as much

184
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:03,538
time as I can like I wish I had 50-plus

185
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:06,089
years to spend with my mentors let alone

186
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:08,610
the 20 or 30 or 40 that I might be

187
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:13,948
limited to depending on how long we get

188
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:20,840
to live yeah I know Tahoe bird an unused

189
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:20,840
federal license hmm yeah I know

190
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:30,509
nice how was that it's cool they're all

191
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:32,399
in their 60s and it's funny to see all

192
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,829
these like raging hippies that are like

193
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,908
you know professors and all welted ooze

194
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:40,679
and there's still such rage and put it

195
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:43,019
but their lawyers and their professors

196
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,239
and their scholars and you know it's

197
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:46,889
it's it's a cute mix it shows me that

198
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,370
even stoners can grow up to be very

199
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:52,470
productive successful members of society

200
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,909
established that's not that's the truth

201
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,389
right there there's no doubt about that

202
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:59,338
a STONER I mean even the word stoner it

203
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:01,199
always seems to have this sort of at

204
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,820
least through the prohibition lends this

205
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,910
a negative connotation although when I

206
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,260
hear stoner I think of I think of more

207
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:10,039
positive things I'm not gonna lie

208
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:12,330
because well because I'm a STONER

209
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:13,949
well we've accepted that myth pride

210
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,500
because what else you gonna do you know

211
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,870
yet to accept your you know stoner you

212
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,450
know badge with honor because yeah

213
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,580
because of the misinformation and you

214
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,140
realized it's so early so we went out

215
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,910
and preached about it and yelled about

216
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:28,679
it and sit on street corners and people

217
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:29,909
were like what the [ __ ] you talking

218
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,370

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,960
that we're successful in high as well

misting the other day man starts talking

225
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,939
about all these cops stopping searching

226
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,820
on us after they legalized in various

227
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,070
states you know what I gotta say this

228
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,720
after the whole Alma our Alma Alma

229
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,940
whatever you guys want to call it the

230
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:22,500
arguments against and for it really

231
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:24,330
seems that Todd from you prop 64 you may

232
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,639
have fallen on the right side of things

233
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,740
because I'll tell you not a single

234
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,870
person who argued against it is

235
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,879
continuing to I haven't seen them say

236
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,379
post about look at this [ __ ] the

237
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,240
cops aren't even searching us anymore

238
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:38,429
and a bunch of people got led off the

239
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,120
head that had charges that's [ __ ]

240
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:46,739
man I need 300 grams $300 a gram for my

241
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,480
[ __ ] it's like sorry actually right even

242
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,250
the people that aren't that we're hating

243
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,839
it love it now because they're not sweat

244
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,870
and driving their [ __ ] around they're

245
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,060
not worried it's a different world right

246
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:59,100
now and you know they can all kiss my

247
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,809
ass I mean it was the right side of

248
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,879
things to fall on you know we need to be

249
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:06,099
free we shouldn't be criminals and

250
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,750
decriminalization the answer is an idiot

251
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,470
because it makes you a criminal in the

252
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,120
first place

253
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,740
we should be decriminalized because

254
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,500
we're not [ __ ] criminals to start off

255
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,289
with yeah I'm surprised I'm really

256
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,169
surprised at how these posts that are

257
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:22,329
coming out after this Prop 64 seem to be

258
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:24,219
extremely positive I mean people that

259
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,379
were going to be charged having their

260
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,629
charges dropped cars not getting

261
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:32,250
searched by cops I mean those are major

262
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:35,200
major major big deals

263
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:39,129
one of the reason it is so major is

264
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,530
because that gave them access to all the

265
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:43,840
other charges in other words if they

266
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:46,149
could get inside your vehicle and start

267
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,580
snooping around who knows what they

268
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:49,990
might find well I can tell you exactly

269
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,990
what they're gonna find in my vehicle

270
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:56,799
and it's not going to be good like when

271
00:11:52,990 --> 00:12:00,060
I got pulled we can smell cannabis and

272
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,059
that led them to my searches

273
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:08,889
yeah they searched my car's which John

274
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:10,870
replied I am cannabis yeah I'm actually

275
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:12,519
I love it that I handed him the

276
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,980
container what smell proof he opened up

277
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:18,549
smelt and gave it back to me I'm a 44

278
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:20,440
year old flowering cannabis plant well

279
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:22,449
the great thing about 64 is it should

280
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,340
move the line in the sand completely I

281
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,980
read I have lawyers that I follow on

282
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,170
Facebook and every day I read someone

283
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,629
else dismiss someone else felony

284
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:34,539
dismissed felony dismissed and I would

285
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:36,820
love to just stack those the the fifty

286
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:38,860
to a hundred that I have seen go by of

287
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,480
people and just you know really hit

288
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,419
those people who are giving us so much

289
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,370
[ __ ] for 64 you know and just remind

290
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:47,229
them hey you really were happy with this

291
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,330
person going to jail or going through

292
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,100
this your you know where are you to not

293
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,320
celebrate these people not going to you

294
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,870
including somebody with staunch against

295
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,820
it came out and immediately had a case

296
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:04,029
and I mean it was thrown out right after

297
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:06,220
it happened and they're like oh I'm

298
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:08,049
loving rim on Dennis perón's Facebook

299
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,730
page after I saw that thousands of

300
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:11,649
cannabis cases are getting dismissed

301
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,649
because it's like how could anybody in

302
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:16,328
this industry not support thousands of

303
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:18,749
people getting their lives back and get

304
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:21,998
of course and not having to pay lawyers

305
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:26,439
actually dependent on the trade and

306
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:28,149
Engel prices DePaul bingo well I'll tell

307
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:30,399
you what it's pretty shitty that that

308
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:33,610
many people faust people that claim to

309
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,798
be activists that fought against prop 64

310
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,919
I don't see them doing any activist work

311
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:41,438
anymore and it just seems to be a like

312
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,878
what what if Shh like that got real

313
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:45,399
personal it wasn't like people were

314
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:49,329
being mature and arguing on amateur

315
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:51,730
level [ __ ] got super personal which I am

316
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:53,649
inclined to believe Sam because the

317
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,579
level of personal that it reached was

318
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,749
like you're taking away my livelihood

319
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:00,488
which is like guess what if your

320
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:02,949
livelihood is based on people going to

321
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:06,129
prison and prohibition [ __ ] your

322
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:08,229
livelihood and [ __ ] you so no offense

323
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:11,379
but come on like that's not a good

324
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,819
profit margin we deserve it I love you

325
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:15,249
I'll be like for the Americans

327
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:18,278
think your neighbors should go to jail

328
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:26,588
because you deserve to get high-priced

329
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:28,269
or pounds of pot you are an [ __ ] hold

330

on that's an insult to [ __ ] cuz

331
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:36,159
[ __ ] are useful people do not err in

00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:46,058
that mindset or straight off pieces of

dog [ __ ] with the dog on the arm the dog

334
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:54,039
on the arm expert in dog poop well you

335
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:56,199
know what we're still not seeing prices

336
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:57,938
drop link here in Canada we have legal

337
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:00,639
cannabis access for years but

338
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:03,639
legalization happens in 2018 let's see

339
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,089
those prices drop so axe accessibility

340
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:10,480
will be more there for everybody can't

341
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:11,709
wait that's it access for everyone I

342
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,389
mean you know what it's funny because

343
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,039
this industry is a lot of different

344
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:17,350
things I mean we we all came from

345
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,418
different aspects we let ourselves into

346
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,159
this sort of you know cannabis led us

347
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,629
down this sort of guiding light that is

348
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:24,068
all there's really a lot of good that

349
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:25,839
you can do with this plant like it's

350
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:27,639
bigger than just getting high it's

351
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,570
bigger than me having access to it it's

352
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,120
bigger than me grow

353
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,860
making profit and you meet people like

354
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,200
Forrest and you meet you know these

355
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,970
people that are that are doing really

356
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,040
really incredible things and it makes

357
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,050
you feel proud to be a part of this

358
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,309
industry you know and I'm sorry but

359
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:44,740
fighting against something like

360
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:46,839
proposition 64 which is gonna let all

361
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:51,159
those people go free and lose I mean

362
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:54,129
Todd you yourself went free like what

363
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:56,139
the hell you got off did you not yes yes

364
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:57,789
they finally after four years no no they

365
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:59,710
didn't drop the case against me because

366
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:02,019
I wouldn't cooperate that's right now I

367
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,480
know I know you talk you know you're

368
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:06,189
solid guy you you talk a real game you

369
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,720
say hey jail is not the worst thing in

370
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,100
the world bla bla bla bla bla but I will

371
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,779
tell people out there who have never

372
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,420
been to jail and who are only

373
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:15,490
potentially facing jail there is serious

374
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,379
energy that goes into that it's like

375
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,269
getting audited it's like a family

376
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:22,240
member passing away sometimes if you

377
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:24,009
don't have that if you have that fear of

378
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,810
like oh no what they're taking my

379
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:28,330
freedom away their take and that's a

380
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:30,489
heavy thing to lay on someone for years

381
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,800
of their life four years of his life

382
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,240
without even getting five but but let me

383
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,309
say this the fear is worse than the

384
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,460
reality people who are through prison

385
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:43,209
get out of prison make meaning yes and

386
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:45,639
like for me I I self surrendered to it

387
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,710
way a long time back because I figured

388
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,090
I'm [ __ ] with fire and there's no way

389
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:51,430
I'm not gonna get burned at some point

390
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,500
I'm debate and guys like the DEA head at

391
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:55,059
had freaking University of Miami I'm

392
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,659
pretty much sure and there's a target on

393
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:58,419
my back

394
00:16:55,659 --> 00:17:01,870
and Joseph featuring yeah [ __ ] him but

395
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:03,789
but at the same time the reality was is

396
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,680
that you know it wasn't that hard to go

397
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:08,170
through and I tell anybody that's facing

398
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,689
any case don't don't fear it don't run

399
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,970
from it just go up show up show up on

400
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:14,860
time be polite go through it get out and

401
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,000
trust me it'll be behind you quicker

402
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,399
than you can imagine

403
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,588
I mean that I so mean that if we all

404
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,300
threw ourselves at the courts the courts

405
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:25,029
would break if we all pled not guilty

406
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:27,250
and and push them to trial they would

407
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:28,779
not be able to afford to prosecute us we

408
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,660
could break the system it's just that

409
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:33,339
fear inhibits our ability to do so most

410
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,900
of the time and it's changed the

411
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:36,549
dynamics ten years ago for the ad

412
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,530
Rosenthal trial I had to go before a

413
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:41,379
grand jury and into federal court and

414
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:42,549
declare my fifth and tenth Amendment now

415
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,160
that wouldn't be necessary

416
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:46,539
you know due to the law change and one

417
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,009
of the reasons we're also celebrating

418
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:53,289
the life and the past that was federal

419
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:54,819
that was federal McCarran that was your

420
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:56,409
and I could still go down that could

421
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:58,659
still go down and this and the stance a

422
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,279
teen took was I will not cooperate in

423
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,769
this prosecution and he was facing

424
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:06,099
rockin prison because he wouldn't

425
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:08,559
basically testify on stand he said no I

426
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:10,119
plead the fifth at that point they say

427
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,649
okay you realize you can be held in

428
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:13,750
contempt of court and the choice is

429
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,910
either ok speak or go to jail and you

430
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,859
know at that point I love you 18 you

431
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,230
chose jail and a lot of people should

432
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:22,149
choose jail you have to stand in the

433
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,740
fear you have to be there you have to

434
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,570
you can't run away from it once your

435
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,200
subpoena knew you're in with the Dragons

436
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:30,639
Claus oh yeah well you have to ride it

437
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,210
out and you have to hold your head high

438
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,190
do it right you have good lawyers don't

439
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,230
capitulate as Todd said don't cooperate

440
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,269
in any way shape or form there's no need

441
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,980
for its them to prove it against you no

442
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:43,389
need for you to give them any more

443
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,839
information that they need to to

444
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,370
prosecute you but dynamics are shifting

445
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,409
and hopefully they're they'll shift

446
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:51,759
federally but as I was saying and one

447
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,830
reason we're talking and celebrating

448
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,559
Mickie Martin's life is because he was

449
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:58,480
one of us who got busted and and when he

450
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,240
was busted after he was busted then he

451
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,309
started a toy drive every winter every

452
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,180
Christmas he started a toy drive to

453
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:10,589
raise money for toys for kids whose

454
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:14,170
parents are in jail right now for life

455
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:16,599
sentences or or less and he and I

456
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,519
donated to it every year and then he

457
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,990
started to do in the fall he did the

458
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:22,059
same thing for back-to-school so we

459
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,400
could buy them new shoes school

460
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:26,409
equipment anything you need to get back

461
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,870
to school because as you know when

462
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:32,980
somebody is in jail they lose everything

463
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:35,169
and those kids are in foster or with

464
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,930
grandparents or with the set parent and

465
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:40,000
their lives are completely upended and I

466
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,410
will forever give mad respect and I

467
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,059
think they're gonna rename the toy drive

468
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,910
for Mickey Martin and they should

469
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:48,159
because it was his instigation to never

470
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,810
forget those right now even though we're

471
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,820
celebrating our victory never forget

472
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:55,929
right now somebody is in jail right now

473
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:56,619
suffering and he never got those kids

474
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,320
and their faith

475
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:01,389
we're taking care of along the way not

476
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:04,058
just someone not just someone that that

477
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,620
is in jail either a tan but you called

478
00:20:04,058 --> 00:20:07,359
it with the children you know it's one

479
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:09,639
thing to say I'm gonna go do jail when

480
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,168
you have no children but you know Lois

481
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,059
Lane who's in the chat room right now

482
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:15,520
said her father got 10 years in the

483
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:17,200
1980s for growing cannabis he was in

484
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,269
jail he was not there to watch her grow

485
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,038
up he was not there to protect her and

486
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:23,500
when he came out of jail she was a

487
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:26,589
stranger to him and that's an extremely

488
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:29,048
serious heavy heavy thing that if you

489
00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:30,939
don't have kids you can't possibly

490
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,288
imagine the level of sacrifice that

491
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,230
you're making when you go off to prison

492
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:37,990
for 5 or 10 or 15 years and those those

493
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,210
kids just you know they don't get raised

494
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,399
the same way no and you know one thing I

495
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,769
want to say I felt like after five years

496
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:47,589
of like living in and out of a visiting

497
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:49,778
room in a US prison i watch families I

498
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:51,819
see what it does to them and one of the

499
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:54,069
reasons I was such an advocate of 64 is

500
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:55,869
because something has to stop child

501
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:58,148
protective services from destructing

502
00:20:55,869 --> 00:21:00,579
families and ripping us apart from our

503
00:20:58,148 --> 00:21:02,709
from our kids or from our parents and

504
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:04,089
putting us through hell I mean because

505
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,100
that's really what's happening because

506
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:08,288
our parents don't drink wine they smoke

507
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:10,538
a little pot that means that that their

508
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:12,429
families get ripped apart I just think

509
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:14,349
it's a horrible situation and those

510
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:16,509
those poor kids are doing time with

511
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:18,668
their parents and that's what's [ __ ]

512
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:20,829
up you know you're locking up some dad

513
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:22,809
for growing you followers and that poor

514
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:24,398
kids crying every night that kid is

515
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:26,319
missing his dad that kid doesn't have

516
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:28,778
mentoring for why because the guy grew

517
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:31,119
flowers in his backyard it's just gotta

518
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:33,220
stop you called it dude those kids are

519
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:36,009
doing time as well and there's a lot of

520
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,589
kids doing time through their parents

521
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:39,429
you know and their loved ones and

522
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:41,079
opportunities are lost they'll never

523
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:43,630
have they never know you know that

524
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:45,970
confidence lost is that affects all

525
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:49,240
throughout their lives so it destroys

526
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,890
you know it's it's sad I've seemed way

527
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,720
too many of it and I'm glad to see that

528
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,799
least there's a ripple that's started

529
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,808
and hopefully it'll spread to other

530
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:57,849
states and across into other countries

531
00:21:55,808 --> 00:22:00,278
by the way congratulations for medical

532
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:03,009
marijuana in Mexico did you see that

533
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:05,380
this week I did see that yeah [ __ ]

534
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:08,849
pretty I can't help but felt that was a

535
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,850
little like Trump jab

536
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:14,389
at present no I don't thought it wants

537
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:16,189
to be really honest I think that a lot

538
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:18,259
of countries you know what in some ways

539
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,970
that his presidency could prove to be

540
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:22,400
very positive because it will cause a

541
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,650
lot of other presidents a lot of other

542
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,570
powers that be to be proactive about

543
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:31,340
what it is they don't like and can't

544
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:32,869
stand that makes sense yeah yeah you

545
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:35,149
know people are like oh they knew the

546
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:36,859
consequences so it's like listen this

547
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,559
isn't murder this isn't robbing a bank

548
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:41,329
this is growing a [ __ ] flower the

549
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,160
fact of the matter is the consequences

550
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:48,069
shouldn't exist in civil disobedience

551
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,070
until it doesn't exist absolutely must

552
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:53,899
the kids didn't grow them I like that I

553
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,720
really I couldn't meet my mic fast

554
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,190
enough to say absolutely at most and and

555
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,110
you can't blame the kids the kids didn't

556
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,570
grow the plant the kids are the victim

557
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:05,029
of the the circumstance of the decisions

558
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:07,250
of the adults they had no sir no clothes

559
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:08,869
you know no planet in any way shape or

560
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,250
form they just have to write it out and

561
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:13,189
are the victims they've lost their

562
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,170
parents their parental unit and you know

563
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:18,380
there's stability what they knew is

564
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,880
their lives growing pot for his kids

565
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,950
what about something like my mom was

566
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,840
giving me pot when I was nine I mean a

567
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,429
lot of times the reason these people are

568
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,669
pushed to this is because they're trying

569
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:30,380
to save their health of their children

570
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:32,300
right they've got no other risk they've

571
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,890
got nothing else to lose they've lost

572
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:35,629
everything else is this is the last

573
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,280
dance I mean look at force look at

574
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,070
everyone else and many of us who have

575
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:42,379
found cannabis it was almost like you it

576
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:44,450
was the last stance your mom finally was

577
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,130
like I mean how many cancers had you

578
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,660
gone through seven to eight cancers by

579
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,360
the time she already decided to finally

580
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:53,420
give you pot you know that nine okay

581
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,919
that's kind of I might want to back that

582
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,330
up a little bit you know I'm saying I

583
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,529
mean I know you were released what you

584
00:23:56,329 --> 00:24:02,689
were to in the earlier honestly now how

585
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:06,049
I mean do you think she should have

586
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,880
given it to you at two she well now that

587
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:09,799
I know about animals but she wouldn't

588
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,660
look they were giving me [ __ ]

589
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:14,269
chemotherapy and put me on radiation at

590
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,860
age two so I don't know I mean if you're

591
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:19,099
if you're able to give me chemotherapy

592
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:21,319
at four or five six why the hell can't I

593
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:22,459
have pot I mean I wish she had given it

594
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:23,929
to me Oh

595
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,700
years earlier she didn't give it to me

596
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,560
until I was nine and I had it in soft

597
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,279
tissue between my left London my heart I

598
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:34,940
only wish but I'm glad she gave it to me

599
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:40,279
at all I mean to be honest where would I

600
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:42,110
be without it I wouldn't know yeah and

601
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:44,629
I'm glad I know yeah I'm sorry went

602
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:45,889
through it but like you said you know

603
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,900
you hate that I went through war myself

604
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:50,690
but I'm glad I went through it so I was

605
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,000
a patient so I met knew all of you I

606
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,340
don't you know sit there and wish any

607
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,349
illness on Ronnie Lee I want to say this

608
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:59,809
alone I actually embalming went through

609
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:01,669
it and ironically I've actually I I

610
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:03,710
caught a little slack to saying that I

611
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,210
wish Jeff Sessions our Attorney General

612
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,120
would get cancer so we'd have a change

613
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:10,700
of heart and you know and I'll say flat

614
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:12,889
up if it doesn't kill you if it brings

615
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,720
out compassion and people it brings out

616
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,450
empathy in people because they

617
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,549
experienced the end of life and it

618
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,190
changes your whole view and everything

619
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:23,569
so I'm really really appreciative of the

620
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,580
fact that I went through cancer as a

621
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:27,470
child I'm really appreciative of the

622
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:28,909
fact that I had to face death and I

623
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,670
learned about life and I learned about

624
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,740
passion and honesty and and everything

625
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,050
good in my life through that so I'm glad

626
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,000
I had cancer and honestly I don't even

627
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:40,000
feel bad when I meet some people that

628
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,170
have cancer because I feel like

629
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,740
something in life is gonna kill you

630
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,539
anyway

631
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,430
and I made the comment to people it's

632
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:48,230
better to die with your eyes open

633
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,610
then they hit get hit by a train and

634
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,440
live your entire life with your eyes

635
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:56,240
closed not even knowing they were closed

636
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,830
hmm yeah that's heavy dude only someone

637
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,680
that has lived through what you lived

638
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:01,909
through could really say that have that

639
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:06,650
perspective you know it's a great

640
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:09,259
perspective life is a lot of people

641
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,840
walking through life asleep zombie dried

642
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:14,420
out and it's even if it's right at the

643
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,849
end of life if you can get awoken if you

644
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,789
can see a different perspective there's

645
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:22,339
real value in that eat that red pill

646
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:24,829
we've only all on the plant panel here

647
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:27,409
you've eaten the pillow you gotta think

648
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:29,599
sessions knows some family members that

649
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,940
have cancer like you got you can't

650
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,559
imagine his entire family just like it's

651
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,450
impossible whose family doesn't have

652
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,230
cancer well you know what though I mean

653
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,819
he comes

654
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,380
part of the deep cells where things are

655
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:41,750
a little bit old-fashioned and

656
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,150
realistically the hard prejudices are

657
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,950
hard to lose and and we're dealing with

658
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:48,048
some real and green to bigotry with

659
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,558
these people going way way way way back

660
00:26:48,048 --> 00:26:53,269
and the reality is and unless it's his

661
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:55,639
loved one or his daughter or somebody

662
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:57,440
and somehow his mind is opened up hey

663
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,360
listen you know even if you watched the

664
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,730
DVD extras on the culture and you

665
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,619
listened the Annie story which is dr.

666
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,259
Lester Grinspoon talking about how

667
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:08,869
resistant he was initially to giving his

668
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:11,450
son Danny cannabis when he had cancer

669
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:13,369
and it was his wife that went behind his

670
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,769
back went to the schoolyard hit up one

671
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:17,329
of his friends got him some pot and gave

672
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:19,700
it to him without less for knowing

673
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:22,428
because Lester was worried about what

674
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,798
Harvard would think if they found out he

675
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:26,600
was breaking the law and doing this but

676
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,519
that so makes sense Todd and you know

677
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:30,949
what it's a perfect example too because

678
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:34,339
we know that Lester is a loving

679
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:38,630
empathetic man he is a good person but

680
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:41,329
the power of worry of a prestige of a

681
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,710
position of a doctorate degree all of

682
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:45,889
these things and I've met incredible

683
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:48,169
doctors out there who are terrified not

684
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:49,970
even forget about giving their son or

685
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:51,919
their daughter cannabis they're

686
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:55,370
terrified to tell people that cannabis

687
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,259
can shrink a tumor they won't even say

688
00:27:55,369 --> 00:28:00,649
it it's like a bad word they're like oh

689
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:03,589
oh no we can't say that well why not why

690
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:05,870
can't you say that it's a fact it can

691
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:07,730
doesn't mean it always will but the fact

692
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:10,099
that it can means you should be able to

693
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:12,169
say it they're scared man they got they

694
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:14,509
got a lot to lose which is crazy because

695
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:16,820
the person dying has a lot more to lose

696
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:18,470
hey let me say shout out to dr. Prince

697
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:20,808
Boone he turned to 89 years old

698
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:23,360
yesterday I saw that happy birthday

699
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:26,389
Lester but doctors became the frontline

700
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:29,149
as stated before you know when prop 215

701
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:31,100
pass the they went after the doctors and

702
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:34,759
the doctors had to physically band

703
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:37,149
together and actually push back against

704
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:39,470
the prosecution of the federal

705
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,240
prosecutor at the time or the head of

706
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:44,390
the drugs or even was coming out and

707
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:48,650
publicly shaming them and they were

708
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:50,060
taking that type of ribbing I mean that

709
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,890
that's that's huge when you

710
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:55,669
have literally the top lawmakers in the

711
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:57,710
country [ __ ] on you in the national

712
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:59,690
media that goes out back when the press

713
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,059
secretary and everybody all went in one

714
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:05,600
location and got debriefed I mean

715
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:07,639
actually really tried to destroy their

716
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:10,250
careers and they actually used Todd

717
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,400
McCurry as slides and put his quotes on

718
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:15,970
CNN in it and it was our drug czar what

719
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,519
was his name at the time barry mccaffrey

720
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:21,799
and he came out and publicly went out he

721
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,349
actually came out and named dr. todd

722
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:26,299
materia because I mean at the time in

723
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:28,519
the 90s there was a handful of these

724
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:31,039
people that you could point to all over

725
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:33,109
the country that were actually vocal

726
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,629
advocates writing books and calling for

727
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:37,129
change I mean really literally I could

728
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,660
rattle their names off the top of my

729
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:41,120
head and unfortunately a lot of them

730
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,279
have passed away you know like dr. John

731
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:46,459
Morgan who wrote the Jonas in marijuana

732
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,950
fax who was awesome what a great guy dr.

733
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:51,079
Todd McCurry ahooo the CMA California

734
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,660
Medical Association went after around

735
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:57,139
215 because he was one of the most vocal

736
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:59,300
advocates that we had he was one of our

737
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:02,240
first whistleblowers anybody listening

738
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:06,889
to this should look up his name Tod with

739
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:09,799
one D and it's mi ke you are iya is how

740
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:11,690
he spelled Nick areia and he is one of

741
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:13,700
the pioneers in this if it wasn't for

742
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,950
him in dr. Lester Grinspoon I don't know

743
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,509
what it would have looked like in the

744
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,180
70s and 80s trying to get information

745
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:23,269
about medical cannabis and fortunately

746
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:25,130
they led to then my doctor dr. frank

747
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:26,900
lucido who in berkeley became a

748
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:29,480
predominant one and actually joined in

749
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,490
suit with Tod mikuriya against the the

750
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,860
feds to actually win the right for

751
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:36,799
doctors to be able to continue to have

752
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:39,709
that confidentiality between patient and

753
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,799
doctor to discuss your medical cannabis

754
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:45,319
so and that still goes on today as each

755
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:48,169
one of these new states go on now

756
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:50,359
enlists the challenges and the fears of

757
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:52,279
now doctors to write the prescriptions

758
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:54,979
because those earlier ones that write a

759
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:57,529
lot of prescriptions like dr. Todd

760
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,870
McCrea had CMA you know those state

761
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:03,769
medical boards come after you and are

762
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:05,569
vindictive so it requires strength of

763
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:08,480
be educated then in those states to

764
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:10,879
actually ride that hind actually skate

765
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,099
on that razor's edge doing that right

766
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,520
for everyone still and that's happening

767
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:17,469
with each state's accession you know

768
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:25,369
vindictive another word for

769
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:27,589
endocannabinoid efficient so true I just

770
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:29,898
I couldn't even I smoke so much cannabis

771
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:31,428
and I've had people do me so wrong and I

772
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:33,589
just like I wish the best for them I

773
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:35,090
don't want them I don't want them to

774
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:37,579
have suffering I don't want them didn't

775
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:39,709
you know I I just vindictive is such a

776
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:42,408
strange energy it's not the energy that

777
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:45,288
if you use cannabis on a daily basis

778
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:47,299
that you want to feed that's fish but

779
00:31:45,288 --> 00:31:50,240
those medical boards are nothing but

780
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:52,308
those strict run the line line followers

781
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,730
can I just say this it was because dr.

782
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:57,648
Todd and guys like um what they were

783
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,740
such a threat and that's that's really

784
00:31:57,648 --> 00:32:02,178
the the reality of it is they knew the

785
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,370
information they were presenting was

786
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:06,620
true it was not something they could

787
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:08,028
debate so the easiest thing to do was to

788
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:10,729
attack the person presenting the

789
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:13,190
information and they did you know I was

790
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:15,558
gonna say doctor dr. William Idleman who

791
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:18,470
was one of jack harries earliest other

792
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:21,798
than doctor materia recruits into the

793
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:24,649
activism game is still an activist today

794
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:27,798
and he put his medical license on the

795
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:29,689
line to advocate medical cannabis after

796
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:32,179
meeting jock he was really a hero he

797
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,399
still is it's a great guy out of Los

798
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:35,659
Angeles and I've always had so much

799
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,058
respect for him but the California

800
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:40,429
Medical Association tried to revoke his

801
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:42,288
medical license over his stance on

802
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:43,940
medical cannabis and he fought them

803
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:46,579
tooth and nail that's what they love to

804
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,200
do I'm just talking with dr. David Allen

805
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:51,048
right now who's also been through some

806
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,610
some similar things with his license etc

807
00:32:51,048 --> 00:32:54,139
I've invited him on he doesn't have the

808
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:55,759
right computer he says he has an Apple

809
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,679
phone I said if you can figure it out

810
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,359
and put your phone down so you're not

811
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,909
moving around we would love to have you

812
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:04,329
on for discussion Alec is also going to

813
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:07,789
be at his lab in about five minutes and

814
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:09,558
from SC labs and he'll be coming in in

815
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:10,970
the next ten minutes so I have a feeling

816
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:13,190
our conversations gonna get a little

817
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,139
scientific here in the near future

818
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:17,480
well it's good it'd be great to have you

819
00:33:15,138 --> 00:33:19,579
good from a doctor's perspective

820
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,950
you know because to hear from you know

821
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:24,019
they're educated standpoint regarding

822
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,779
all the different fears that they have

823
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:28,609
to actually face you know from going

824
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:31,629
through school from doing their actual

825
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:34,279
you know I know students that actually

826
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:36,620
become going on to become doctors that

827
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:41,029
they took a very great risk by choosing

828
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:42,739
to you know research cannabis as their

829
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:44,869
thesis all the way through their

830
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,870
doctorates and we're very successful in

831
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:50,239
doing so and you know they had to

832
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:52,149
actually physically take a risk because

833
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,130
that was their financing whether their

834
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:57,230
professors would accept or reject it or

835
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,270
anywhere along the line to where they

836
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:01,610
got their you know doctor certification

837
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:03,769
much less when you step out into the

838
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:06,079
real world so there's risks all along

839
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:07,879
the way if you really want to come out

840
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,889
and be one of those that are spoken out

841
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,059
regarding cannabis well you know I'm

842
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:13,190
gonna say something because somebody

843
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:14,929
wrote in the chat on the video the other

844
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,608
day that you know I was crazy if I

845
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:18,168
didn't think that people were still

846
00:34:16,608 --> 00:34:20,148
getting the doors kicked in and and

847
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:21,799
getting raided and stuff and let me tell

848
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:23,809
you something I am all too aware of

849
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,080
what's happening everywhere else in the

850
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:29,179
world and I really still one of the

851
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:30,679
reasons I hope that we do the show and

852
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:32,329
that more information gets out was

853
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,309
because I hope people see the

854
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:36,168
normalization of cannabis that's

855
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:38,148
happening here in California and in

856
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:41,179
Colorado and in Washington and in other

857
00:34:38,148 --> 00:34:43,608
places like Oregon and and demand that

858
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:46,429
happen where they live I hope that our

859
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:49,878
stories inspire people in places that

860
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:52,668
aren't yet legal together take the step

861
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:54,139
forward and go engage and and you know

862
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:56,719
I'm not saying go to prison I'm not

863
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:58,579
saying you know go compromise your

864
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,089
families but I'm saying don't be afraid

865
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:01,369
anymore

866
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:03,710
you have so much information behind you

867
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:06,410
use it you know you know if your

868
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:08,420
smartphone get educated people like me

869
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:11,089
don't have to go to places like Kinkos

870
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,130
to hand you copies of the book that is

871
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,930
expensive and hard to get anymore you

872
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,820
can go on your phone and read every

873
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:19,129
single chapter of Jack Harris book The

874
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:21,890
Improv wears no clothes free on Jack

875
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,890
CARICOM if you want to and get inspired

876
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:27,079
it's that easy I mean and I and I

877
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:29,299
implore people to do it and when they

878
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:31,009
meet their politicians don't let them

879
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,960
escape the fact that they're carrying

880
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,640
smartphone because you're stupid if

881
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,460
you're carrying a smartphone and you

882
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,029
don't know how to look stuff up yeah for

883
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,300
real

884
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:43,280
so reopen the word ham hit enter go to

885
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,140
the Wikipedia and start learning some

886
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,090
history because this is all of our

887
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:49,129
history this is connected to all of us

888
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:51,590
it doesn't matter what color what race

889
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:53,150
what country you came from cannabis has

890
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,660
a connection to you when you need to

891
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,030
learn it

892
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:57,799
hey dr. David Alan just wrote me a

893
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,110
message saying the California Medical

894
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,480
Board targeted him because the drug task

895
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:04,579
force called the Medical Board in

896
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,710
California and I guess that was where he

897
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:08,210
was where he had his problems I think it

898
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:10,130
was in Maryland or something it was

899
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,809
definitely not in California I thought

900
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,340
it was like out east somewhere that he

901
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:16,579
originally had his problems with the

902
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:18,320
drug force just criminal unfortunately

903
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:20,230
this is gonna happen state to state this

904
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,789
is gonna happen cuz there is

905
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,650
institutionalized bureaucratic bigotry

906
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:26,840
that we are dealing with all the way

907
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,150
across the board so every single state

908
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,640
in this Union that legalizes is going to

909
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:34,070
be dealing with some jerk along the way

910
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:36,559
it's gonna resist resist resist

911
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:39,050
I think what's fortunate for us though

912
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:40,880
is that we gained momentum and as we get

913
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,650
more numbers behind us and we get more

914
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,780
wins behind us and there's more

915
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:47,030
information around us it's easier for us

916
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,900
to overcome the people that are in our

917
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:52,760
way with misinformation

918
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,440
Jeff from Aqualab says the cops came

919
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,910
into our borough two weeks ago I just

920
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,619
walked out got in my car and drove away

921
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:09,109
that's what we did to it I guess

922
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:11,029
I hope cops did the same thing yeah

923
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:13,250
seriously I hope you're okay dude I hope

924
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:14,900
all is well with everything down there

925
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:18,199
for you Jesus

926
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:20,420
cops yeah let me say this though even if

927
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:22,309
this is the beauty of California right

928
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:24,320
now there was a story that it doesn't

929
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:27,199
matter if it's 2:00 or 2000 it should

930
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,240
have been 7 or 7,000 because any number

931
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,309
over the 6 plant limit is only being

932
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:34,129
charged as a misdemeanor so there's

933
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:37,759
really so you could go girl 4,000 pot

934
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:39,829
plants 4116 park lands in your bel-air

935
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,310
home and the state of California can

936
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:44,059
only charge you with misdemeanor

937
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:44,838
manufacture I guess they're still gonna

938
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:46,489
call that I wonder

939
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:48,018
they're gonna call it cultivation yet I

940
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:50,869
wonder if they've learned that it's a

941
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:53,118
plant quite yet it doesn't seem so

942
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:55,489
because the absurdity of what they're

943
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,318
trying to do would just be so unveiled

944
00:37:55,489 --> 00:38:00,048
if they actually had the realization

945
00:37:57,318 --> 00:38:01,969
that it was like like what you said many

946
00:38:00,048 --> 00:38:05,599
shows ago these people are habitual

947
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:08,389
florists like habitual florists think of

948
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,210
how absurd that is I love growing

949
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:13,129
flowers and plants you know though can I

950
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,028
say straight up and Johanna probably

951
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,369
totally agree

952
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:18,018
and anyone who grows understands you

953
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:20,599
know I was lucky to learn how to grow

954
00:38:18,018 --> 00:38:23,358
car when I was 13 years old because it

955
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:25,369
taught me the cycle of life it taught me

956
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,469
how to plan ahead it taught me how to

957
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:30,140
use nutrients and think about what I was

958
00:38:27,469 --> 00:38:33,259
feeding living a living thing in my life

959
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:35,509
you just want me how to feed myself it

960
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:37,670
taught me the value of pH and water

961
00:38:35,509 --> 00:38:39,380
it taught me actually how to not care

962
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:41,778
too much for something and to let it

963
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,729
grow I mean growing cannabis was the

964
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:45,768
best life lesson I could have ever

965
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:48,318
experienced and and I've said this to a

966
00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:51,439
lot of people I was lucky to be grown

967
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:54,038
apart at 13 14 15 16 because mother

968
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,929
nature looking over my shoulder always

969
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:58,999
always rewarded me for my efforts

970
00:38:56,929 --> 00:39:01,278
meaning if I grew an extra hundred

971
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:03,528
plants I got an extra hundred plants

972
00:39:01,278 --> 00:39:05,329
worth of energy but my friends on the

973
00:39:03,528 --> 00:39:07,880
other hand who were working minimum wage

974
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:10,039
and and kind of doing minimum amounts of

975
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,509
work for that minimum wage in return for

976
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:13,609
getting the least amount of money they

977
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:15,920
could get a they did the least amount of

978
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:17,838
work they could do they I on the other

979
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,210
hand was learning how to like work hard

980
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:22,099
and apply myself and to like throw in

981
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,798
all my effort because I knew I would be

982
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:27,109
rewarded if this makes sense whereas my

983
00:39:24,798 --> 00:39:29,088
friends at work they could bust ask for

984
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:31,848
three months go to their boss out for

985
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:33,588
rays and get laughed at and that's a

986
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:36,769

989
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,098
different lesson taught me how to wake

unreliable in the past what happened bro

999
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:12,349
we had Tim on last Sunday he was so

1000
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:15,319
enthusiastic and then we saw the website

1001
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:19,099
on Wednesday so we'll figure we wait and

1002
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:20,630
ask you totally well last weekend for

1003
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:22,490
what it's worth I had just the day

1004
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,108
before I got back from a 16-day

1005
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:27,049
whitewater rafting trip down the Grand

1006
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:29,420
Canyon and and when I got back I didn't

1007
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:31,430
have my internet in my house no you know

1008
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:35,240
I meant the show was canceled the the

1009
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:36,980
country fair was Hollis yeah yeah could

1010
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:38,509
you just a little bit because we wanted

1011
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,880
to talk about the contest in the way you

1012
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,770
divided up the turf in categories but

1013
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,579
obviously now you have some information

1014
00:40:42,769 --> 00:40:48,079
about the show not happening yet totally

1015
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:50,030
yeah yeah and I was just going to worth

1016
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:54,349
making a shitty excuse for why I wasn't

1017
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:56,450
able to make it but but anyway yes so so

1018
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:58,309
yeah we're really excited at Kemps

1019
00:40:56,449 --> 00:41:02,739
Country Fair you know we're about to do

1020
00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:05,059
a real cool kind of interesting way of

1021
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:07,519
basically having the judging process

1022
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:09,559
take place you know taking into account

1023
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,960
kind of chemo typical profile is a

1024
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:14,420
little bit more you know and use it you

1025
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,880
and and just try and celebrate a lot

1026
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,630
more the diversity of what cannabis has

1027
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,608
to offer

1028
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:23,390
you know um through this new type of

1029
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:24,949
judging that we were gonna try out um so

1030
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:27,618
so for most worth you know that you know

1031
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:31,338
they were going full-bore and they had

1032
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:33,920
some really really interesting big

1033
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:37,699
production team backing them to help

1034
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,990
kind of make this event happen and you

1035
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:41,299
know it's it's it's interesting because

1036
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:43,759
you know just with as many events as

1037
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,710
there are now and as much as you know

1038
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,990
people that are holding events and doing

1039
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,970
promotions are vying for people's

1040
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:51,979
attention throughout the summer to try

1041
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:53,629
to come to these different events

1042
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:57,500
you know when they they just kind of saw

1043
00:41:53,630 --> 00:42:00,380
I think some early signs and early red

1044
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,480
flags on you know it possibly not

1045
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,970
getting you know the type of turnout

1046
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,940
they were looking for you know just your

1047
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:09,858
kind of the full moon eclipse kind of

1048
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:12,059
symbiosis event happening same after

1049
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:13,920
that with you know and that

1050
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:16,440
is kind of I think well okay that's the

1051
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,240
summer you know that's like sold out

1052
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,670
kind of tens of thousands of people I

1053
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,500
think from Southern Oregon but no you're

1054
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:24,659
right the logistics are doing it around

1055
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,670
other event has to be considered earlier

1056
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:28,739
on and it's yeah it's definitely a

1057
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:33,809
reality you know you're talking about

1058
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:35,489
drive oh you're cracking up on us Alec

1059
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:40,079
something something just blew with your

1060
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:43,169
mic that sounds like a death sounds like

1061
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:48,019
something actually gluten yeah hear us

1062
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:48,019
no no we can't hear you anymore we can't

1063
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:54,240
meet that mic for a second yeah it went

1064
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,200
correctly correctly bad correctly

1065
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,769
exactly correctly

1066
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:01,139
yeah his audio just went pooched it was

1067
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:02,880
that me yeah I think you're okay now I

1068
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:04,019
think it was like a weird feedback or

1069
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,030
whatever you know another thing I was

1070
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:08,099
gonna say is probably he had mentioned a

1071
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:11,040
serious production company that he had

1072
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:13,380
gotten into partnership with for this

1073
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:15,210
project and I kind of got the idea that

1074
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,640
it was them that looked at it and said

1075
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:19,650
listen like we just can't we're not

1076
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:22,559
gonna be able to get all this happening

1077
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:24,690
in any time yeah you know I think I

1078
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,840
think they're some of their insights

1079
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:30,389
kind of yo on some of the red early red

1080
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,160
flags were kind of you know I can get

1081
00:43:30,389 --> 00:43:34,109
the really big indicators that kind of

1082
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:38,909
Tim took to heart to kind of make that

1083
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:40,410
decision you know but yeah I mean it's

1084
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:43,409
for what it's worth though it's it's

1085
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:46,879
it's it's funny because you know the

1086
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:49,259
emerald cop has become such a you know

1087
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,230
logistical just like it's it's the you

1088
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,270
know where the the biggest you know

1089
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:56,730
influxes of samples that we ever see out

1090
00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:57,659
our loud and so kind of peachy earns now

1091
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:00,599
that we've been doing it for the last

1092
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:03,149
seven years you know we've we've we've

1093
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:05,969
tried to put together a team to a lot

1094
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:08,789
more early on in the year you know kind

1095
00:44:05,969 --> 00:44:11,309
of help to really work out the logistics

1096
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:13,440
and how you know the deadlines and the

1097
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:16,289
in-sample intake and stuff like that are

1098
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,119
gonna go you know to avoid this huge

1099
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:20,250
kind of collision nightmare that can

1100
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,440
very often happens you know especially

1101
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,420
when the the Emerald cup could have

1102
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,889
sampled your total amount of entries

1103
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:28,920
kind of has gone up from

1104
00:44:25,889 --> 00:44:32,069
you know five years ago around 100-150 -

1105
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,809
each year almost doubling you know and

1106
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,010
and last year with all the categories

1107
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:40,500
combined it was like I want to say

1108
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:42,510
there's like 1,300 entries and 800 of

1109
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,789
them came in in the last like two days

1110
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,800
or three days which is after Tim had

1111
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:49,259
pushed and extended the deadline trying

1112
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,320
to include more people because there's a

1113
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:54,000
lot of people up in arms and so my cups

1114
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,530
happen in this year but can you wrap a

1115
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,420
little bit because you were involved in

1116
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:00,090
the thought process that broke the

1117
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,829
contest into a new a new kind of contest

1118
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:04,350
and turned it into these five different

1119
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:05,759
turkey in categories yeah and I really

1120
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:08,730
would love to you to talk about why you

1121
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,560
selected those five terpenes and also

1122
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:15,179
what those those five terpenes are and

1123
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:16,590
also um as a lab are you you just using

1124
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,000
spikes I mean could you explain the

1125
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,940
little process a little bit talk about

1126
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,760
that because I find it so fascinating

1127
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:25,470
awesome no no but absolutely um so yeah

1128
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,540
so essentially you know for the last

1129
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:30,209
nine or ten months at here I see labs

1130
00:45:27,539 --> 00:45:32,789
we've been working with a data scientist

1131
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:36,000
a gentleman by the name Stelios who's a

1132
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:38,909
Greek dude from out he used to do a

1133
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,519
little bit of work with bedroo can and

1134
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:43,500
and are no you know kind of you know

1135
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,809
attempting to you know look at their

1136
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,730
chemometric data and kind of identify

1137
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:51,210
trends and you know interesting kind of

1138
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:53,460
you know aspects of their data and and

1139
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,949
so so you know we started working with

1140
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,630
him because we we have a lot of turkey

1141
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:59,339
data that we wanted to aggregate like

1142
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,680
look into and so and I think I might

1143
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:04,680
have potentially mentioned this before

1144
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,069
on here but we basically set out to

1145
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:08,309
create

1146
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:10,470
terpene classification system and you

1147
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:12,389
know when when we came into it we you

1148
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:14,969
know didn't really know what we were

1149
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:17,159
going to find or see but you know after

1150
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:18,750
nine months and a lot of back-and-forth

1151
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:21,059
it's kind of working with this data

1152
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,429
scientist to kind of fine-tune this

1153
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:27,509
these different statistic data tools he

1154
00:46:23,429 --> 00:46:30,119
was using things like pls da which which

1155
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:32,220
is like partial least mean square and

1156
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:34,019
analysis I want to say if I'm not

1157
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:38,250
mistaken and then like certain types of

1158
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:39,719
clustering algorithms like or clustering

1159
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,280
tools like k-means

1160
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:43,709
Kings clustering artificial neural

1161
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,940
networking we started using combination

1162
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:50,210
of these different tools to kind of

1163
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:52,650
develop a novel oh wow that was quick

1164
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:54,780
just got bumpy d boomed

1165
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:56,579
I almost thought for a second I

1166
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,619
accidentally here's a funny thing

1167
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:01,949
sometimes if I'm typing and having

1168
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:04,019
off-screen conversations and my cursor

1169
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:07,618
is on the chatroom here in the Google

1170
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:09,509
Chat it will it could dump people hey

1171
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:11,490
welcome back Alex Alec I almost thought

1172
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:13,440
I bumped you out there but I see you

1173
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:16,069
just left by accident yeah no I just

1174
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,070
dumped me

1175
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:25,220
anyway if there was a way you could send

1176
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:27,630
me the Google hangout a link to my email

1177
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:29,129
I'm gonna try to shift from my phone to

1178
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,650
my computer I think that'd be a little

1179
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:34,500
bit better oh yeah dude you tell me the

1180
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:39,240
email what is it Alec @s Sealab Sealab

1181
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:43,440
is exactly Seb Escom yeah okay so

1182
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:45,299
hatched cool but I don't know where I

1183
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,730
fell off there but essentially we've

1184
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:50,849
been working for the last nine or ten

1185
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:53,940
months now to you know basically sort

1186
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:56,789
through and cluster our terpene data to

1187
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:59,940
to type in an effort to create a terpene

1188
00:47:56,789 --> 00:48:03,449
class system and and you know what we

1189
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:07,108
found is really interesting in that you

1190
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:09,539
know with about 95 plus percent accuracy

1191
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:12,690
and predictability you know we can

1192
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:15,119
essentially send any terpene report that

1193
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:18,720
we test of any strain that comes across

1194
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:21,990
our labs and and it fits you know very

1195
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:25,289
interestingly into one of essentially

1196
00:48:21,989 --> 00:48:28,319
about four major primary buckets you

1197
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:31,019
know or clusters and then within each of

1198
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,420
the primary groups or clusters there's

1199
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:36,690
an additional you know between like two

1200
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:38,369
to three subgroups that that you know

1201
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:40,889
any strain that we pass into it

1202
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:43,320
essentially very predictably falls into

1203
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:44,460
and and it's it's what's what's

1204
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,470
interesting about the system is it's

1205
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:49,980
very intuitive if you know the smell of

1206
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:53,018
cannabis you know and and you know so so

1207
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:55,869
kind of on on you one spectrum of

1208
00:48:53,018 --> 00:48:58,988
of this of this class system you know

1209
00:48:55,869 --> 00:49:02,588
you have Turpin lean as this primary

1210
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:04,719
terpene that you know you know from from

1211
00:49:02,588 --> 00:49:06,759
from the clustering is either you know

1212
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:10,179
they're pretty significant amounts or

1213
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:12,668
it's not all there and and Turpin lean

1214
00:49:10,179 --> 00:49:14,798
is the dominant primary terpene in you

1215
00:49:12,668 --> 00:49:17,469
know such a range of the you know quotes

1216
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:20,768
sativa stimulating strains that we know

1217
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:25,418
like jacker air train wreck Durban sage

1218
00:49:20,768 --> 00:49:27,848
you know you know Dutch treat you know a

1219
00:49:25,418 --> 00:49:31,298
lot of Hawaiian stuff that you know that

1220
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:34,568
is around are still barely around but a

1221
00:49:31,298 --> 00:49:37,389
lot of those xjj one you know you know

1222
00:49:34,568 --> 00:49:39,969
that those strains all smell slightly

1223
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:43,358
different from one another but yet

1224
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:46,539
they're more closely related in

1225
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:49,989
similarity than trying to compare that

1226
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:52,119
to say Sour Diesel you know which and

1227
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:54,849
Sour Diesel you know you know kind of

1228
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:57,130
intuitively from the smell that it

1229
00:49:54,849 --> 00:50:00,338
shares probably more in common with say

1230
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:04,179
chem dogging Gorilla Glue and you know

1231
00:50:00,338 --> 00:50:05,558
oh geez and such you know although there

1232
00:50:04,179 --> 00:50:07,719
are still slight variations and

1233
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:09,909
differences and in I think the OG group

1234
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:13,688
is one of the hardest groups to get your

1235
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:15,429
full grasp on because instead of one

1236
00:50:13,688 --> 00:50:18,478
primary terpene you know typically

1237
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:22,989
making up the brunt of the terpene

1238
00:50:18,478 --> 00:50:25,408
profile OG is like almost put the most

1239
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:28,088
or the this fuel group is almost the

1240
00:50:25,409 --> 00:50:30,398
it's almost the best version I would

1241
00:50:28,088 --> 00:50:32,708
think of like what a hybrid kind of

1242
00:50:30,398 --> 00:50:35,278
terpene spectrum would look like because

1243
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:38,078
it's it's not one primary terpene site

1244
00:50:35,278 --> 00:50:40,838
three to five turkeys and and it's

1245
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,999
always predictably limey mer seen

1246
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:46,088
beta-carotene typically at almost like

1247
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:48,038
codominant amounts and depending on the

1248
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:49,838
pheno it can slightly shift to become

1249
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:53,019
more limonene dominant or missing

1250
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:56,409
dominant element but those differences

1251
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:58,148
are enough to make up you know the

1252
00:50:56,409 --> 00:51:01,179
differences between say Girl Scout

1253
00:50:58,148 --> 00:51:02,708
cookies and and and you know because you

1254
00:51:01,179 --> 00:51:05,079
know Girl Scout cookies is is a beta

1255
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:06,879
caroling dominant strain cultivar and

1256
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:09,160
the beta carotene

1257
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,990
so its share is similar to similar to

1258
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:13,210
say like Kem dog and Sour Diesel

1259
00:51:10,989 --> 00:51:15,068
it is Baedeker though it though all

1260
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:18,639
those strains are big are typically more

1261
00:51:15,068 --> 00:51:20,679
beta-carotene dominant but but in the in

1262
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:22,268
the gorilla glue is in sardis the Baker

1263
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:25,149
ethylene will just be slightly higher

1264
00:51:22,268 --> 00:51:28,689
today than the codominant Mir senior

1265
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:30,430
limonene as opposed to Girl Scout

1266
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:32,769
cookies are some you know or strains

1267
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:34,989
similar you know it'll be a appreciably

1268
00:51:32,768 --> 00:51:39,669
higher in beta-carotene compared to the

1269
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:42,068
limonene nursing etc etc and so so in

1270
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:43,960
this in this gas or fuel kind of group

1271
00:51:42,068 --> 00:51:47,139
you know you seem to have this kind of

1272
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:49,298
shifting range of you know the primary

1273
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:52,028
turkey either from like limonene to Mir

1274
00:51:49,298 --> 00:51:53,710
seem to be traveling the the secondary

1275
00:51:52,028 --> 00:51:58,028
terpenes in that group are typically

1276
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:59,289
lynn Lula and human but but anyway so so

1277
00:51:58,028 --> 00:52:01,599
that's that's kind of one group and then

1278
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:03,519
you know on the on the far other side of

1279
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:06,099
the spectrum is you know the the

1280
00:52:03,518 --> 00:52:08,979
classical near seem group you know which

1281
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:10,838
you know is is you know well it's the

1282
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,548
biggest group that you know of all the

1283
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:14,858
strains of cannabis we test you know

1284
00:52:12,548 --> 00:52:18,309
Mears cane and kind of the and the kind

1285
00:52:14,858 --> 00:52:21,630
of the fuel groups are the the most

1286
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:24,609
populated groups that we see find and

1287
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:26,680
and so in the mir same group you know

1288
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:30,460
everything all the fruity type strains

1289
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:33,009
you know kind of tangi Agent Orange you

1290
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:36,220
know kind of Callie oh you know on those

1291
00:52:33,009 --> 00:52:38,469
classic type that smell but but you know

1292
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:41,768
in that same group you also have all the

1293
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:44,798
purples purple or or GDP Grape Ape you

1294
00:52:41,768 --> 00:52:46,689
know all those types of strains but and

1295
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:48,849
and the difference is between those two

1296
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:51,940
groups like that you you know from what

1297
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:54,818
we see the the tan G's and a lot of

1298
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:58,000
those strains are in the same primary

1299
00:52:54,818 --> 00:52:59,768
group as the purples and such but the

1300
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:04,329
difference between the two is like a sub

1301
00:52:59,768 --> 00:53:06,578
grouping where the beta-carotene is you

1302
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:08,349
know maybe a third of the total strain

1303
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:10,480
as opposed to the mere seen which is the

1304
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:12,250
primary Turkey but then you know when

1305
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,130
you look at the tan G's and and you know

1306
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:17,588
even things like blue dream and stuff

1307
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:19,690
like that it's it's typically really

1308
00:53:17,588 --> 00:53:20,769
really high Amir seen very low

1309
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,139
everything else but then it's

1310
00:53:20,769 --> 00:53:25,090
like alpha pining or some of the

1311
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:27,639
chirping that's you know in some small

1312
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:29,260
secondary mouth but but you know the

1313
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:31,809
relationship between the primary and

1314
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:33,520
secondary terpenes which typically and

1315
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:36,039
and you know we just for 30-something

1316
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:38,880
terpenes and it's but we what we only

1317
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:42,880
see about five to nine terpenes ever

1318
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:45,760
really show up in any significant amount

1319
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,110
you know and and you know but you know

1320
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,720
the really cool thing about the system

1321
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:51,700
too is you know we have like an outlier

1322
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:54,489
flag you know so if something passes

1323
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:57,730
through that is you know significantly

1324
00:53:54,489 --> 00:54:00,159
off the norm you know it's flagged as

1325
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:03,340
kind of not able to any of these primary

1326
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:04,989
secondary or primary groupings or you

1327
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,390
know these you know subgroupings

1328
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:09,879
and and so so through that you know

1329
00:54:07,389 --> 00:54:11,859
we've been able to identify very

1330
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,050
fascinating novelty that's that's you

1331
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:16,269
know created and entered through say the

1332
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:20,410
mo cup like last year you know a group

1333
00:54:16,269 --> 00:54:22,030
called true humble you know kind of big

1334
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:25,269
farm kind of co-op type group up in

1335
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:27,430
humboldt Mendo they they had to strain

1336
00:54:25,269 --> 00:54:29,489
the sense in which is actually for what

1337
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:32,259
it's worth it was an in the pines cross

1338
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:34,599
and so in the pines is you know is this

1339
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:37,000
pineapple type smell strain that you

1340
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:39,839
know has has historically had had high

1341
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,380
placements and as one emerald cup in

1342
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:46,480
certain year and and certain a certain

1343
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,329
fee no it was crossed with royal cush

1344
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:52,240
called it royal pines and this royal

1345
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:54,670
pine strain was dominant in awesome mean

1346
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,289
awesome mean is a really fascinating

1347
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:58,360
interesting jerking that we don't really

1348
00:54:56,289 --> 00:55:02,500
ever see in any significant amount

1349
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:06,370
except as this as a secondary terpene

1350
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:09,099
that makes because so in this museum

1351
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:11,199
group and i'm sorry i just were rambling

1352
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:12,759
but in this mere singh group you know

1353
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:13,779
you have this is one group where it's

1354
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,090
really high mira seem very low

1355
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:18,820
everything else kind of like tangi a lot

1356
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:20,380
of typical kind of like you know fruits

1357
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,390
smelling strains blueberry a lot of

1358
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,820
stuff like that then you have this other

1359
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:26,409
subgroup where it's like higher and beta

1360
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,519
karolina is the secondary terpene and

1361
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:30,549
that all of a sudden makes up all the

1362
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:32,320
purples you know and then you have you

1363
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:34,269
know this other subgroup in the mirror

1364
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:37,510
scene of primary group

1365
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:41,489
that is the secondary terpene is awesome

1366
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:44,050
mean and awesome mean is OC IME Andy and

1367
00:55:41,489 --> 00:55:45,279
and Austin ever awesome scientist

1368
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:47,590
trained that all of a sudden makes it

1369
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,790
you know it's fall into this group that

1370
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:56,410
is is like green crack dream Queen

1371
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:57,759
papaya mango you know those you know you

1372
00:55:56,409 --> 00:56:00,009
know that smell it's like it's AI just

1373
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,450
distinct kind of but those strange smell

1374
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:02,890
similar you know same thing is like

1375
00:56:01,449 --> 00:56:05,799
super skunk if you've seen suitors come

1376
00:56:02,889 --> 00:56:07,569
it's kind of in the same world and so so

1377
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,720
so it's so awesome even whenever it

1378
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:12,280
shows is typically secondary but less

1379
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:15,339
you know typically fifty percent or less

1380
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:17,260
the primary perking and so so all of a

1381
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,570
sudden now through this outlier kind of

1382
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:23,440
flag you know we identified in the pines

1383
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:25,870
cross that was now dominant and primary

1384
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,130
can also mean and so so you know we

1385
00:56:25,869 --> 00:56:29,819
thought it was really interesting we've

1386
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:33,519
also same kind of a borneol dominant

1387
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:35,019
like Siberian ruderalis strain that

1388
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:37,420
might one of my buddies called bacon

1389
00:56:35,019 --> 00:56:42,429
that he's been breeding for a little

1390
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:43,180
while and so so just I'm sorry no

1391
00:56:42,429 --> 00:56:48,419
problem

1392
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:51,029
excuse me I have a question about

1393
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:55,360
classification you're making terpene

1394
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:59,620
groupings and are these terpenes based

1395
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:02,470
on their ability to potentiate or to

1396
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:05,230
modify the effects of the other

1397
00:57:02,469 --> 00:57:09,189
cannabinoids or they just because

1398
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:10,990
they're they're on the GC so yeah so

1399
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:14,470
pretty much I mean there's no there's no

1400
00:57:10,989 --> 00:57:16,689
kind of combines or introduced like

1401
00:57:14,469 --> 00:57:18,519
Entourage you know effects you know to

1402
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:21,610
it you know because essentially all

1403
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:24,250
we're doing is taking the raw you know

1404
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:25,120
terpene data off of the you know that

1405
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:28,059
everything around from all the

1406
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:32,289
chromatograms that we test through my DS

1407
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:35,889
yeah I understand exactly but I guess

1408
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:38,369
what I'm saying is that most of the

1409
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:43,239
terpenes we talk to you about our

1410
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:46,389
potentiating and modified tac for

1411
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:47,799
example Mir seen certainly does lie

1412
00:57:46,389 --> 00:57:52,299
Moline certainly does

1413
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:55,660
pionen does and little walk to a certain

1414
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:58,720
degree certainly does but carry ethylene

1415
00:57:55,659 --> 00:58:02,349
does not it doesn't particularly

1416
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:04,539
potentiate or modify recreational

1417
00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:06,670
effects of THC although maybe for

1418
00:58:04,539 --> 00:58:09,759
medical uses there might be all kinds of

1419
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:12,130
applications because it's basically is

1420
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,350
the the one terpene own to buying the cv

1421
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:17,369
2 as well right

1422
00:58:13,349 --> 00:58:22,420
yes that's true and so I think it's

1423
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:25,299
really interesting because if you if you

1424
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:28,599
vaporize it with THC and pure to carry

1425
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:32,260
out lean it doesn't potentiate or modify

1426
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:34,000
the THC effects that's all which-which

1427
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,800
and and that's and I think that's really

1428
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,719
fascinating and I think these these kind

1429
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,690
of things to tease out or some of the

1430
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:44,409
most interesting things that that can be

1431
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:46,150
found to help anecdotally add to

1432
00:58:44,409 --> 00:58:51,609
people's experience and take away some

1433
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:53,200
of the the you know suggestive selling

1434
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:54,910
you know because whenever a patient goes

1435
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:56,949
into a dispensary or a consumer goes

1436
00:58:54,909 --> 00:58:58,329
into a rec you know shop and they're

1437
00:58:56,949 --> 00:59:01,509
looking for a strain and they know very

1438
00:58:58,329 --> 00:59:03,699
little to nothing about say cannabis or

1439
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:07,000
the nuances of these different terpenes

1440
00:59:03,699 --> 00:59:09,579
and you know that they're looking for

1441
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,010
some effect you know so much depending

1442
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:14,019
on their metabolism their user

1443
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:15,880
experience with cannabis you know what

1444
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:17,050
you know their their food intake that

1445
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,059
day there's so many different kind of

1446
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:20,890
nuances about how strange some of the

1447
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:23,199
austrians gonna help fact one person

1448
00:59:20,889 --> 00:59:24,789
versus another and then further you know

1449
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:26,829
there's the whole idea of like biphasic

1450
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:30,340
activity which just throws a whole

1451
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:33,369
nother life you know a crazy aspect to

1452
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:34,840
it but but but what we're hoping with

1453
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:36,519
this system is you know because when you

1454
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,050
go into a collective or dispensary and

1455
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:42,039
there's you know fifty to a hundred

1456
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:43,660
mason jars on onon shelves you know it's

1457
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:46,300
almost you know incredibly

1458
00:59:43,659 --> 00:59:48,899
unapproachable is your system well is

1459
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:52,240
your system at your website or online

1460
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:54,519
no no it's I mean it's we were just kind

1461
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:59,229
of now working on kind of the graphic

1462
00:59:54,519 --> 01:00:01,420
front-end you of course seen mr. Lewis's

1463
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:06,250
nape row system yes

1464
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:08,530
yes yes at this point is at this point

1465
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:10,829
is the one that I like the best

1466
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:13,300
until somebody made a better one

1467
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:14,769
absolutely absolutely um you know and

1468
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:16,570
you know they've definitely done a lot

1469
01:00:14,769 --> 01:00:19,179
of work to kind of add different aspects

1470
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:22,059
of you know an algorithm to take and

1471
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:24,399
combine you know data about the

1472
01:00:22,059 --> 01:00:26,019
entourage effect to help kind of suggest

1473
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:30,610
what the strands gonna make you feel or

1474
01:00:26,019 --> 01:00:32,380
what have you and and you know and so I

1475
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:34,059
definitely think that's that's at yeah

1476
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:38,500
at this point you're pretty much when

1477
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:42,699
when we did test with double-blind

1478
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:44,739
patients we found that people all agreed

1479
01:00:42,699 --> 01:00:47,559
on the type of effects they were getting

1480
01:00:44,739 --> 01:00:50,859
from say THC with the people one

1481
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:53,559
particular terpene but they all had

1482
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:55,900
their differences in preferences to

1483
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:59,769
which ones they liked but some you know

1484
01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:01,889
so yeah but they all agreed that it had

1485
01:00:59,769 --> 01:01:07,900
a similar effect with each other

1486
01:01:01,889 --> 01:01:11,379
what well let's say they smoked 25

1487
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:13,960
milligrams of or baked 25 milligrams of

1488
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:16,570
THC with the tiny spike of labelling

1489
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:19,329
they all said it was stimulating

1490
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:21,340
uplifting you know whereas mere seen

1491
01:01:19,329 --> 01:01:24,179
face in large amounts they would say

1492
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:27,039
would be more couch locky for example

1493
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:28,509
right and I think that's and that's that

1494
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:30,429
I think such fascinating kind of

1495
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:32,500
insights that we can gain also from just

1496
01:01:30,429 --> 01:01:34,899
the anecdotal user response that you

1497
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:37,300
know people of naturally kind of you

1498
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:39,610
know found and in certain strains and so

1499
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:42,490
and so adding I think this level of you

1500
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:44,470
know specific terpene kind of data to

1501
01:01:42,489 --> 01:01:46,299
help empower people's user experience or

1502
01:01:44,469 --> 01:01:48,250
you know kind of bun tenders

1503
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:51,310
understanding of the smell of cannabis

1504
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:53,800
to help make recommendations I think is

1505
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:55,150
is you know one of the the coolest

1506
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:58,750
things that we could help to with kind

1507
01:01:55,150 --> 01:02:01,960
of the data that we've got cannabinoid

1508
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:05,289
level and the terpene profile levels

1509
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:07,840
then in the future people will be able

1510
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:10,420
to make a very educated guess on the

1511
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:13,329
type of effects be even before they try

1512
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:14,950
it and and and i think because

1513
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:18,069
especially to interp m

1514
01:02:14,949 --> 01:02:19,809
like what I would ask I would actually

1515
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:22,530
ask you your thoughts on pure penalty

1516
01:02:19,809 --> 01:02:25,179
mr. Pendley you know from all the

1517
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:28,390
literature is you know fit when

1518
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:30,969
vaporized is suggested to be a sedative

1519
01:02:28,389 --> 01:02:33,489
you know but but on you know contrary to

1520
01:02:30,969 --> 01:02:36,299
that what's really interesting is most

1521
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:39,969
you experience I've ever had never baked

1522
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:45,000
turtle I've never baked it by itself or

1523
01:02:39,969 --> 01:02:49,929
with pure THC like I did with the other

1524
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:53,619
the other maybe top does and terpenes I

1525
01:02:49,929 --> 01:02:54,699
did try nice because yet because Turpin

1526
01:02:53,619 --> 01:02:56,079
lien you know is the good is this

1527
01:02:54,699 --> 01:02:58,539
primary tripping you know again and all

1528
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,310
these like really typical quote kind of

1529
01:02:58,539 --> 01:03:01,960
sativa strains that people you know

1530
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:04,630
think that effect with with train wreck

1531
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:08,230
and Durbin and sage Zeta all those

1532
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:10,660
strains and you know and so so I wonder

1533
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:12,699
if kind of you know the the literature

1534
01:03:10,659 --> 01:03:15,009
out there that suggests that Turpin lean

1535
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:19,689
when vape to the sedative I wonder if

1536
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:21,970
that somehow that's mercy is reported to

1537
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:24,940
be that way too if you take a small

1538
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:27,639
amount of Mir seen its stimulating you

1539
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:29,920
take a lot about personally its couch

1540
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:34,088
lock flip there we go

1541
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:36,760
so this biphasic the way cannabis and

1542
01:03:34,088 --> 01:03:38,650
itself is in general where at first it

1543
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:42,640
stimulates and then that depresses go

1544
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:43,750
degree and yes so that's and I think

1545
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:44,980
it's really fascinating and then you

1546
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:46,389
know also just kind of what you're

1547
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:49,210
talking about with beta carolien here I

1548
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:51,190
wonder how you know so so sure beta

1549
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:54,940
carotene and what you're saying you know

1550
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:57,309
my daddy carry alkalinity HD and it

1551
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,720
didn't help it in any way I also tried

1552
01:03:57,309 --> 01:04:01,480
Barry

1553
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:05,739
Terry awfully knock side that was nasty

1554
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:07,389
but I wonder I wonder you know if you

1555
01:04:05,739 --> 01:04:10,929
had Crohn's or irritable bowel syndrome

1556
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:13,568
or colitis or sometimes no no I don't

1557
01:04:10,929 --> 01:04:20,500
I'm a really healthy guy who just smokes

1558
01:04:13,568 --> 01:04:25,150
because I like to get high you're making

1559
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:27,608
a lot of terpenes do have medicinal or

1560
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:29,200
it's true yeah and and that so I was

1561
01:04:27,608 --> 01:04:31,869
gonna ask this question is what are some

1562
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:33,578
in both to Sam and Alex what are some of

1563
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:35,880
the most beneficial terpenes that are

1564
01:04:33,579 --> 01:04:38,940
found in cannabis and what do they do

1565
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:42,369
with cannabis it's the most common ones

1566
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:46,358
you know mersin Lima lean

1567
01:04:42,369 --> 01:04:50,369
pionen Linda Lau and you were mentioned

1568
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:53,889
some of the other ones like gwil and

1569
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:56,769
never much we don't really see those

1570
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:58,900
very and very significant very large

1571
01:04:56,769 --> 01:05:07,568
amounts I agree come on what about

1572
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:09,970
awesome mean I can't talk about it other

1573
01:05:07,568 --> 01:05:12,219
than I know it exists

1574
01:05:09,969 --> 01:05:13,719
well here's a question is that is that

1575
01:05:12,219 --> 01:05:16,328
you know okay there's gonna be dominant

1576
01:05:13,719 --> 01:05:18,338
terpenes certainly but are we going to

1577
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:20,619
learn the importance of these secondary

1578
01:05:18,338 --> 01:05:22,808
terpenes and the effects they have on

1579
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:26,849
the dominant terpenes and just a tiny

1580
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:26,849
little bit being present go ahead Alec

1581
01:05:28,528 --> 01:05:32,409
throughout the process you know we've

1582
01:05:30,548 --> 01:05:34,778
been trying to kind of identity and this

1583
01:05:32,409 --> 01:05:36,730
further and kind of your whatever my

1584
01:05:34,778 --> 01:05:38,798
partner's Jeff has kind of made this

1585
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:40,960
interesting kind of you know kind of

1586
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:42,639
comparison to spices you know because

1587
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,699
it's like you take you know a dash of

1588
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:47,769
salt and throw into soup you know barely

1589
01:05:45,699 --> 01:05:50,169
affect the taste but if you take the

1590
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:52,420
same you know kind of - its throw of

1591
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:55,750
like you know cumin or something

1592
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:58,539
you just made cumin soup and so so it's

1593
01:05:55,750 --> 01:06:01,389
like the presence of certain terpenes

1594
01:05:58,539 --> 01:06:02,950
might you know substantially be you know

1595
01:06:01,389 --> 01:06:06,098
these minor terpenes that are there in

1596
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:08,199
faeries you know almost what seems

1597
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:10,088
inconsequential you know what the actual

1598
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:12,009
having you know pretty substantial

1599
01:06:10,088 --> 01:06:13,328
effects you know but but whenever you

1600
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:15,069
look at you know kind of hundreds of

1601
01:06:13,329 --> 01:06:17,230
these terpene reports and you see kind

1602
01:06:15,068 --> 01:06:19,000
of you know these Dominator bees pop up

1603
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:21,068
you know it's it's you know it's clear

1604
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,568
that you know there's these yeah like

1605
01:06:21,068 --> 01:06:24,099
just like Sam was just mentioning you

1606
01:06:22,568 --> 01:06:25,869
know these you know what we see is about

1607
01:06:24,099 --> 01:06:27,599
five to nine terpenes like the major

1608
01:06:25,869 --> 01:06:31,838
ones exactly our mayor seen

1609
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:33,160
beta-carotene limonene so you know

1610
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:35,409
missing mango hops

1611
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:38,059
you know the sedative effect you know

1612
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:41,059
beta-carotene pepper clove

1613
01:06:38,059 --> 01:06:43,039
you know cb2 receptor agonist you know

1614
01:06:41,059 --> 01:06:44,690
I'm you know so and then which gets into

1615
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:47,599
the whole idea of Canada's

1616
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:50,750
other countries also too what we found

1617
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:53,420
was that widely drug varieties in

1618
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:56,119
general have a different suite then

1619
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:58,550
narrow leaf drug varieties which have a

1620
01:06:56,119 --> 01:07:01,219
different suite then help varieties

1621
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:03,470
which have a different suite they're all

1622
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:06,259
the same terpenes a hundred and fifty or

1623
01:07:03,469 --> 01:07:10,730
so have been identified in cannabis but

1624
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:14,990
they they tend towards certain terpenes

1625
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:17,659
in certain widely narrow leaf and hemp

1626
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:19,129
varieties and yeah and that's what's

1627
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:21,859
interesting cuz you see certain things

1628
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:23,059
clustered together where you know and

1629
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:25,039
then I was bringing up earlier the

1630
01:07:23,059 --> 01:07:27,289
example chirp in lean you know you see

1631
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:30,349
you don't usually see in any of the

1632
01:07:27,289 --> 01:07:32,150
other groups like the primary groups

1633
01:07:30,349 --> 01:07:33,589
there's the pining group there's the

1634
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:35,539
mere seen group there's the kind of

1635
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:36,890
combination limonene or C beta caroling

1636
01:07:35,539 --> 01:07:38,960
group and then there's the terpene Ling

1637
01:07:36,889 --> 01:07:41,210
group and in the drilling group it's

1638
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,280
either kind of air or is not there you

1639
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:45,320
know in certain times you'll see it in

1640
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,240
summer seem dominant strains in a little

1641
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,860
tiny amount but it's you know certain

1642
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:50,959
terpenes seem to cluster together to

1643
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:52,519
whenever you know and have that might

1644
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,260
have the potential to draw certain

1645
01:07:52,519 --> 01:07:56,929
widely trucked high for an early

1646
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:59,390
prototype i think they'll be more than

1647
01:07:56,929 --> 01:08:05,440
one classification system there'll be

1648
01:07:59,389 --> 01:08:11,719
one based on sequence e or amounts and i

1649
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:14,659
think they'll also be one for ability to

1650
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:18,289
potentiate or modify in a particular

1651
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:19,909
direction right yeah and i think i think

1652
01:08:18,289 --> 01:08:22,189
that some of the most interesting ways

1653
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:23,778
to use the turbine classification system

1654
01:08:22,189 --> 01:08:26,509
is to have an effect on breeding

1655
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:29,180
potentials you know and and to be able

1656
01:08:26,509 --> 01:08:33,048
to combine you know fascinating terpenes

1657
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:34,880
that don't really ever show up and you

1658
01:08:33,048 --> 01:08:37,009
know with with other terpenes you know

1659
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,810
that you know like and and i think the

1660
01:08:37,009 --> 01:08:40,939
you know also means a great example that

1661
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:42,920
because the AUSA mean what we see it's

1662
01:08:40,939 --> 01:08:45,469
either it either shows up as a secondary

1663
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:47,720
tertiary chirping in this mere scene

1664
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:49,130
primary group which is on this one side

1665
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:51,460
of the spectrum and again that's like a

1666
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:54,390
dream clean green crack that kind of

1667
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:57,130
papaya mango all those types of smell

1668
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:59,140
yeah like yeah and then on the other

1669
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:01,119
question here if I can if I can add

1670
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:04,119
before I got to jump off I got a check

1671
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:05,649
out of a hotel but I just wanted to add

1672
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:07,630
two things first of all I think it's

1673
01:09:05,649 --> 01:09:11,409
great what you're doing but always

1674
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:13,480
comparing flower profiles to to extract

1675
01:09:11,409 --> 01:09:15,880
profiles I think is a very useful thing

1676
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:18,309
to understand the impact that the

1677
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:20,199
extraction process has on manipulating

1678
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:22,270
is a lot of these terpenes that you

1679
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:23,699
mentioned are not thermally stable and

1680
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:26,469
if you stare at and frost supply

1681
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:27,818
cross-eyed they do different things so

1682
01:09:26,469 --> 01:09:30,399
it will be really interesting to

1683
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:33,009
actually correlate would be not only

1684
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:34,809
from the flower to the expertise but

1685
01:09:33,009 --> 01:09:36,548
also what happens at a nail temperature

1686
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:40,810
so if you would actually do a

1687
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:43,838
headspace-gc measurement of an extract

1688
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:45,640
that's a nursing dominant I will bet you

1689
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:47,469
a dollar to a doughnut that at nail

1690
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,750
temperature that mayor scene does all

1691
01:09:47,469 --> 01:09:52,899
kinds of different chemistry to actually

1692
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:55,329
make other turbine turbine oils from

1693
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:58,420
just oxidation else and if we're gonna

1694
01:09:55,329 --> 01:10:03,130
do this mark then we should also get a

1695
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:08,920
sample fresh bud and GC acid terpenes

1696
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:10,690
dried bud and then extract all from Sam

1697
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:12,609
I mean I'm in the process of doing that

1698
01:10:10,689 --> 01:10:17,919
I mean I try to put together a data set

1699
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:20,199
that I could share it that's on curing

1700
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:24,609
that actually chemistry is happening you

1701
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:28,359
know based on your anecdotal results

1702
01:10:24,609 --> 01:10:29,649
good hey folks I got a jump my people

1703
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:32,309
are telling me we got to check out of

1704
01:10:29,649 --> 01:10:41,979
our room I will see you guys next week

1705
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:43,120
thanks for coming on mark just off the

1706
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:45,429
coast of Venezuela

1707
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:55,319
I used tons of people that hid their

1708
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:55,320
money there it's funny cuz it's true

1709
01:10:59,849 --> 01:11:04,500
to to to Mark's point you know it's

1710
01:11:02,908 --> 01:11:07,109
really interesting you guys like we have

1711
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,090
seen a fascinating kind of you know

1712
01:11:07,109 --> 01:11:13,289
trend in extracts and that's that

1713
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:17,340
typically most to all extracts are beta

1714
01:11:13,289 --> 01:11:19,649
care awfully dominant and in so many

1715
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:21,179
cases seems like yeah you have the the

1716
01:11:19,649 --> 01:11:23,069
monoterpenes that boil off the lower

1717
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:26,130
temperatures seem to go first in the

1718
01:11:23,069 --> 01:11:28,349
address the Lizzie true nice nice and

1719
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:30,359
and and yen so so those are the more

1720
01:11:28,349 --> 01:11:33,230
precious delicate ones that you want

1721
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:36,000
that also contributes the substantial

1722
01:11:33,229 --> 01:11:38,129
you know majority of most of the strains

1723
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,969
and so in the pursuit or effort to

1724
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:43,949
maximize your preservation of the cured

1725
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:46,050
terpene you know potential that could be

1726
01:11:43,948 --> 01:11:47,309
there and how much total put terpene

1727
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:50,250
potentially could be there you know it

1728
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:51,840
seems like you know yeah the obviously

1729
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:53,760
and everybody always knew that you know

1730
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:57,150
the heat and the purging and kind of all

1731
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:59,730
the curing process is Kim's kind of such

1732
01:11:57,149 --> 01:12:04,138
a huge way just completely have you

1733
01:11:59,729 --> 01:12:06,709
stray have you looked at the amount of

1734
01:12:04,139 --> 01:12:11,179
terpene that a fresh bud

1735
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:15,210
alive fresh bud has versus a dried one

1736
01:12:11,179 --> 01:12:17,279
versus a manicured process one versus

1737
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:19,469
extracts have you done that with the

1738
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:22,439
exact same plant material to try to

1739
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:25,739
understand because I always assume more

1740
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:28,828
than 75% of the terpenes are lost from a

1741
01:12:25,738 --> 01:12:30,569
fresh plant when you dry it yeah none

1742
01:12:28,828 --> 01:12:32,488
exactly then that makes not a sense you

1743
01:12:30,569 --> 01:12:36,328
know just by it just by smelling the

1744
01:12:32,488 --> 01:12:38,069
terpenes in the air of like a final you

1745
01:12:36,328 --> 01:12:39,689
know flowering room that's about to be

1746
01:12:38,069 --> 01:12:41,039
harvested it means that they're boiling

1747
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:44,428
off and you're you know they're getting

1748
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:46,019
if you knows that so absolutely and and

1749
01:12:44,429 --> 01:12:48,658
so I think yet everything you do from

1750
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:51,150
the moment you know throughout the

1751
01:12:48,658 --> 01:12:53,039
cultivation cycle and the the levels of

1752
01:12:51,149 --> 01:12:55,019
heat you know that you allow your room

1753
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:56,670
to get up to I think you know from the

1754
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:59,040
get-go are gonna have a huge effect on

1755
01:12:56,670 --> 01:13:01,408
on you know the overall loss and terpene

1756
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:03,599
but then yeah it's like um I mean we

1757
01:13:01,408 --> 01:13:05,339
haven't spinner asking what a terpene

1758
01:13:03,599 --> 01:13:08,309
what a tripping samples like in water

1759
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:10,860
half Alex

1760
01:13:08,309 --> 01:13:13,310
I mean you know so so what we what we

1761
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:15,839
typically see is in extra

1762
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:18,870
you know across the board

1763
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:21,449
you know like typically between three

1764
01:13:18,869 --> 01:13:24,420
see about three you know one to three

1765
01:13:21,449 --> 01:13:26,279
percent of the you know total terpene

1766
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,890
content in in the act and in extract

1767
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:32,399
whereas if you know it's you know and if

1768
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:33,900
from both water and you know kind of you

1769
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:36,389
know other types of processes whenever

1770
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:39,389
plant whenever you know that material

1771
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:41,340
has been extracted you know you with

1772
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:42,690
with care to you know and it's really

1773
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,460
good quality material and then you know

1774
01:13:42,689 --> 01:13:46,529
low temperatures are used to heat purge

1775
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:48,239
whatever I'm you know we see you know

1776
01:13:46,529 --> 01:13:50,909
put you know certain certain types of

1777
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:53,069
extracts you know up to five to nine

1778
01:13:50,909 --> 01:13:55,289
percent total terpene content you know

1779
01:13:53,069 --> 01:13:57,539
and then there's these turkey super

1780
01:13:55,289 --> 01:13:59,670
Turkey enriched processes that you know

1781
01:13:57,539 --> 01:14:01,380
we see you know like holy water and

1782
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:03,449
these different like terpene fraction

1783
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:05,640
type processes you know we see kind of

1784
01:14:03,449 --> 01:14:08,220
get up to anywhere from you know twelve

1785
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:09,630
to twenty percent total concentration

1786
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:12,920
and then you know they get to the point

1787
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:15,000
where they're just like very runny

1788
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:16,920
always thought those people are actually

1789
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,659
adding food great drippings to their

1790
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:20,520
product and it would be very easy for

1791
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:22,260
them to do so especially when they're

1792
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:25,680
getting to these you know triple that of

1793
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:28,530
a flour number of their overall terpene

1794
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:29,940
in and extract so especially when you

1795
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:31,710
consider what you're talking about that

1796
01:14:29,939 --> 01:14:34,649
almost any solvent across the board

1797
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:38,100
don't matter if it's water co2 butane

1798
01:14:34,649 --> 01:14:40,949
propane washes the terpenes down period

1799
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:42,600
and you know I'm so it's so either

1800
01:14:40,949 --> 01:14:44,550
they're not purging it or they're

1801
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:46,650
amplifying it because if they're doing

1802
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:48,570
it from a base of cannabis and they're

1803
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:50,670
getting four times as much terpenes that

1804
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:53,099
were found in the cannabis I suspect

1805
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:54,600
[ __ ] and I this is also the my next

1806
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:57,120
question what terpenes and you found

1807
01:14:54,600 --> 01:15:00,960
that are hazardous that people shouldn't

1808
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:02,369
be breathing in what just real quick to

1809
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:06,449
what you were saying you know I think I

1810
01:15:02,369 --> 01:15:11,029
mean I I have seen both with SIA both

1811
01:15:06,449 --> 01:15:13,260
done with co2 and with butane a type of

1812
01:15:11,029 --> 01:15:14,849
product you know that that's just you

1813
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:17,340
know kind of cold oftentimes like holy

1814
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:20,090
water or like Turk juice and actor

1815
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:25,230
there's there it's up for it so type of

1816
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:26,510
process you know and and and and is you

1817
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:28,159
know not adults

1818
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:30,350
and and I think that's really

1819
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:32,029
fascinating you know in the potential to

1820
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:33,679
kind of however they're doing it I mean

1821
01:15:32,029 --> 01:15:35,630
and typically in that type of extract

1822
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:36,770
you know the cannabinoids don't

1823
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:39,409
necessarily that high

1824
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:41,810
it's like forty to fifty percent overall

1825
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:44,599
cannabinoids and then you know kind of

1826
01:15:41,810 --> 01:15:45,980
up to you know fifteen plus percent you

1827
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:48,140
know terpenes what you know what have

1828
01:15:45,979 --> 01:15:50,899
you well I think all plants aren't

1829
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:53,869
created equally and you know some plants

1830
01:15:50,899 --> 01:15:55,939
are one to two percent terpene content

1831
01:15:53,869 --> 01:15:59,119
and there are ones that are four and

1832
01:15:55,939 --> 01:16:02,079
five and there are maybe the odd few

1833
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:04,849
anomaly out there that are close to ten

1834
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:10,550
if there are ten they were created by

1835
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:13,150
man sure they were bred for sure but

1836
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:15,800
imagine taking imagine taking a town

1837
01:16:13,149 --> 01:16:18,319
imagine taking a ten percent or a 9 or

1838
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:19,820
an 8 and creating an extract with it

1839
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:22,789
you're probably gonna get a higher

1840
01:16:19,819 --> 01:16:26,439
return in the terpenes than say your

1841
01:16:22,789 --> 01:16:26,439
buddy who's using the one two three

1842
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:34,940
processing is losing a lot because if

1843
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:38,659
you've got a couple percent terpenes and

1844
01:16:34,939 --> 01:16:41,988
you make the and it's twenty percent THC

1845
01:16:38,659 --> 01:16:45,909
by dry weight the plant material then

1846
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:51,169
that means you should have eight percent

1847
01:16:45,909 --> 01:16:54,380
when you've got pretty much pure product

1848
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:56,359
made for an extract made from it but

1849
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:59,300
it's not it never is

1850
01:16:56,359 --> 01:17:01,279
it's always low well you say you've seen

1851
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:03,170
a few people who have done it who are

1852
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:05,029
especially trying to capture terpenes

1853
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:08,719
and they're using really low

1854
01:17:05,029 --> 01:17:10,369
temperatures and specialized methods you

1855
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:12,409
know I want to throw this out there you

1856
01:17:10,369 --> 01:17:14,300
know I have been fortunate enough to be

1857
01:17:12,409 --> 01:17:16,460
the photographer for childless for two

1858
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:18,679
years in a row and for the secret cup

1859
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:22,539
for a few years and I have seen a [ __ ]

1860
01:17:18,679 --> 01:17:25,219
ton of really beautiful super incredibly

1861
01:17:22,539 --> 01:17:27,829
well done extracts that were not

1862
01:17:25,219 --> 01:17:30,350
adulterated and that were super Turkey

1863
01:17:27,829 --> 01:17:32,119
and no disrespect to any of those guys

1864
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:34,190
when I say this but they'll say it too

1865
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:37,130
that they know a lot of people aren't

1866
01:17:34,189 --> 01:17:38,629
really doing it like this and there are

1867
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:40,310
a lot of people trying to tell trade

1868
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:42,350
really low par stuff

1869
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:44,330
so buyer beware as I get part of my

1870
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:47,210
message you know there's there is both

1871
01:17:44,329 --> 01:17:49,789
sides of the fence here 107 but you know

1872
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:51,050
what I think we see that really

1873
01:17:49,789 --> 01:17:54,680
fascinating about your point Todd is

1874
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:56,480
like you know you know you can I mean I

1875
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:58,700
think there's so many people that test

1876
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:00,769
with us so basically like they think

1877
01:17:58,699 --> 01:18:01,819
they're gonna they have this business

1878
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:04,100
planet in their mind where they're like

1879
01:18:01,819 --> 01:18:07,130
alright we figured out short path and

1880
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:10,070
we're gonna like you know spin [ __ ] into

1881
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:12,650
gold you know and and they see this huge

1882
01:18:10,069 --> 01:18:13,939
margin kind of opportunity and they're

1883
01:18:12,649 --> 01:18:15,799
like you know and then you know come to

1884
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:17,689
the realization I mean there's so much

1885
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:19,760
intricacies to just the distillation

1886
01:18:17,689 --> 01:18:21,529
process so many people are just you know

1887
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,119
destroying so much the THC creating like

1888
01:18:21,529 --> 01:18:25,069
Delta eight another kind of like

1889
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:26,899
breakdown isomer like kind of almost

1890
01:18:25,069 --> 01:18:29,420
junk cannabinoids you know then

1891
01:18:26,899 --> 01:18:31,099
wondering well THC is for that's process

1892
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:32,779
what-have-you but then you know I mean

1893
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:37,630
it's just such a heat intensive process

1894
01:18:32,779 --> 01:18:40,399
to distill and create 95% Delta 9 THC

1895
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:42,319
you know which you know it was often

1896
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:44,059
really difficult process you know and

1897
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:46,219
and so people then will you know kind of

1898
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:47,510
have this kind of essentially single

1899
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:50,449
it's kind of like a single molecule

1900
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:52,460
isolated distillate and then you know

1901
01:18:50,449 --> 01:18:55,220
they think that they're gonna go tests

1902
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:57,949
you know the bunch of most popular

1903
01:18:55,220 --> 01:19:00,170
strains on the shelves and then recreate

1904
01:18:57,949 --> 01:19:03,829
these Turk profiles based off the test

1905
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:06,619
results and in 0.o cases I would say

1906
01:19:03,829 --> 01:19:09,380
it's ever worked I never had any success

1907
01:19:06,619 --> 01:19:11,180
which further enforces the theory

1908
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:14,779
further enforces the theory that

1909
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:16,640
potentially these very small amounts the

1910
01:19:14,779 --> 01:19:19,130
secondary and maybe even tertiary

1911
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:25,070
classes of terpenes are having a deeper

1912
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:27,260
effect than we understand the fact that

1913
01:19:25,069 --> 01:19:28,819
there's these alcohols esters and all

1914
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:31,100
these different potential kind of

1915
01:19:28,819 --> 01:19:34,130
flavonoids and I mean and it's just yeah

1916
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:38,120
it just seems like it's such a you know

1917
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:39,739
amazing complex matrix of terpenes

1918
01:19:38,119 --> 01:19:42,559
cannabinoids all these things and it's

1919
01:19:39,739 --> 01:19:44,029
it's almost unform asleep utilizable in

1920
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,010
that way or you know where you can just

1921
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:47,630
like make a mixture gonna have these 13

1922
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:49,280
synthetic see back whatever and get the

1923
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:51,529
same effect and you know because because

1924
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:53,389
for what I ended up telling a lot of the

1925
01:19:51,529 --> 01:19:54,078
clients that we work with that are doing

1926
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:56,030
that

1927
01:19:54,078 --> 01:19:58,578
I'm like dude a lot all this kind of R&amp;D

1928
01:19:56,029 --> 01:20:00,380
you're doing is almost it's almost a

1929
01:19:58,578 --> 01:20:02,509
waste of time because if you're gonna

1930
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:05,300
take if you're gonna try to add terpenes

1931
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:06,920
back you either are gonna create you

1932
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:10,219
know for the connoisseur kind of like

1933
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:12,319
flavor market where you're actually like

1934
01:20:10,219 --> 01:20:14,569
taking distill off like you almost like

1935
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:15,920
you know blue river Antonian like you

1936
01:20:14,569 --> 01:20:19,269
know my goods you guys are doing such

1937
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:22,670
awesome work in the whole world like

1938
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:24,770
natural extracts of like perfect you

1939
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:26,569
know preserved terpenes off of plant and

1940
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:29,420
then being able to add them as the

1941
01:20:26,569 --> 01:20:31,399
dilute ins you know to make a cartridge

1942
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:34,010
with distillate office it makes that

1943
01:20:31,399 --> 01:20:35,598
cartridge taste amazing or if you

1944
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:37,699
combine those turkeys with any you know

1945
01:20:35,599 --> 01:20:38,690
kind of crude cannabinoid you know that

1946
01:20:37,698 --> 01:20:41,238
you're gonna make into a vapor and

1947
01:20:38,689 --> 01:20:43,069
what-have-you one but for the people

1948
01:20:41,238 --> 01:20:44,598
that are doing trying to take limonene

1949
01:20:43,069 --> 01:20:47,389
your CV to coffee and blend it in

1950
01:20:44,599 --> 01:20:49,639
certain amounts to re-add I mean I think

1951
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:53,599
it's kind of dangerous road to go down

1952
01:20:49,639 --> 01:20:55,880
because for one all these terpenes you

1953
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:57,590
know aren't really known like you know

1954
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:59,900
the I mean there's these these aspects

1955
01:20:57,590 --> 01:21:02,179
to like toxicity and how much you're

1956
01:20:59,899 --> 01:21:04,098
adding of any one of them you know and

1957
01:21:02,179 --> 01:21:06,529
and how you might be substantially

1958
01:21:04,099 --> 01:21:08,539
deviating from what cannabis would ever

1959
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:12,158
produce of these certain terpene

1960
01:21:08,539 --> 01:21:14,658
wrestler know it's scary and and so I

1961
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:16,308
mean so what I tell people is like I'm

1962
01:21:14,658 --> 01:21:19,339
like if you're gonna if you're gonna try

1963
01:21:16,309 --> 01:21:21,559
to recreate a profile you know you're

1964
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:23,900
failing you should just go full banana

1965
01:21:21,559 --> 01:21:25,820
or you know go full watermelon you know

1966
01:21:23,899 --> 01:21:27,229
like strawberry lemonade you know it's

1967
01:21:25,819 --> 01:21:29,210
like if you're gonna do that then go

1968
01:21:27,229 --> 01:21:30,769
full for it you know and you because

1969
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:33,198
there is some type of the market that's

1970
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:34,730
gonna you possibly be interested in that

1971
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:37,250
because of the whole faith community and

1972
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:40,129
everybody just like you know shooting

1973
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:42,078
clouds of these crazy like pg/vg like

1974
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:47,389
flavor blends you know and I don't think

1975
01:21:42,078 --> 01:21:50,210
that's good I think you know there's a

1976
01:21:47,389 --> 01:21:52,670
lot not known about yeah what are those

1977
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:54,559
thinners from from a scientific

1978
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:57,020
standpoint like what the hell are those

1979
01:21:54,559 --> 01:22:01,849
strawberry watermelon bubblegum flavors

1980
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:04,040
may have I don't totally clueless as to

1981
01:22:01,849 --> 01:22:07,578
what they are but I'm asking you what

1982
01:22:04,039 --> 01:22:10,250
are they what are they paper izing

1983
01:22:07,578 --> 01:22:12,259
right well I'm not I'm not exactly sure

1984
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:13,578
you know I think maybe I don't know if

1985
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,289
them or somebody might be able to speak

1986
01:22:13,578 --> 01:22:18,049
more to that but I mean yeah there are a

1987
01:22:15,289 --> 01:22:20,029
lot of like you know compounds mixtures

1988
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:22,429
of compounds that you know probably

1989
01:22:20,029 --> 01:22:23,389
pretty hard to kind of enunciate and you

1990
01:22:22,429 --> 01:22:25,550
know it's a lot of flavoring

1991
01:22:23,389 --> 01:22:27,469
preservative you know there's just a lot

1992
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:29,539
of crazy stuff in these in these in

1993
01:22:27,469 --> 01:22:32,059
these products and and yeah and whether

1994
01:22:29,539 --> 01:22:33,649
it's like a low temp that you're hitting

1995
01:22:32,059 --> 01:22:36,579
it or you're dabbing it or whether it's

1996
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:38,988
up to you know like skulking hot nail

1997
01:22:36,578 --> 01:22:42,549
you know I mean it's like what are the

1998
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:45,078
range of compounds that are basically

1999
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:47,139
turning into other compounds when you're

2000
01:22:45,078 --> 01:22:49,368
lighting them to these heats you know

2001
01:22:47,139 --> 01:22:51,109
these different levels of heat because

2002
01:22:49,368 --> 01:22:54,529
yeah I mean you know certain things

2003
01:22:51,109 --> 01:22:55,848
might be attorney I mean like that was I

2004
01:22:54,529 --> 01:22:58,009
think that's one of the big ugly things

2005
01:22:55,849 --> 01:23:00,650
of the vape industry and people you know

2006
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:02,480
burning or vaping PG and VG all day long

2007
01:23:00,649 --> 01:23:03,558
you know it's like when you're doing

2008
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:05,839
that you know at these different

2009
01:23:03,559 --> 01:23:08,059
temperatures assess you very well

2010
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:10,400
creating other types of very harmful

2011
01:23:08,059 --> 01:23:12,260
toxic compounds like formaldehyde and

2012
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:13,670
other types of things and so it's like

2013
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:15,860
is that any better for your long-term

2014
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:18,559
and your chronic exposure than you know

2015
01:23:15,859 --> 01:23:21,679
nicotine or what have you and not not

2016
01:23:18,559 --> 01:23:24,260
nicotine but definitely like radioactive

2017
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:26,690
nucleotides that they spray on that [ __ ]

2018
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:28,670
I would have to say that that [ __ ] is so

2019
01:23:26,689 --> 01:23:31,308
bad that's the that's the comparison

2020
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:33,199
that's why this this glycol or whatever

2021
01:23:31,309 --> 01:23:34,340
it is that people are clouding out on is

2022
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:36,348
so nasty

2023
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:39,500
but people like oh it's still way better

2024
01:23:36,349 --> 01:23:41,270
than cigarettes it's like oh yeah but

2025
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:46,670
cigarettes a radioactive that's not a

2026
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:49,849
good comparison right yeah yeah and and

2027
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:52,550
so so so I think you know the idea of do

2028
01:23:49,849 --> 01:23:54,409
no harm you know in try to represent the

2029
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:56,420
cannabis plant to the highest of its

2030
01:23:54,408 --> 01:23:58,670
potential integrity you know it's like

2031
01:23:56,420 --> 01:24:00,380
you know they're people should just you

2032
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:01,730
have Wolfram a consumer and buyers

2033
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:03,590
standpoint and then from people

2034
01:24:01,729 --> 01:24:06,618
producing products it's like she like

2035
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:08,029
you know step carefully in like the

2036
01:24:06,618 --> 01:24:10,698
directions and really think them through

2037
01:24:08,029 --> 01:24:12,800
and identify you know the potential you

2038
01:24:10,698 --> 01:24:15,109
know hazards because yeah if you are

2039
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:17,779
going full strawberry banana flavor and

2040
01:24:15,109 --> 01:24:19,250
adding that to distillate or CBD crystal

2041
01:24:17,779 --> 01:24:21,269
so you can sell it in the vape stores

2042
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:25,199
you know it's like is

2043
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:26,490
any better for you than you know a lot

2044
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,869
of the other harmful products that

2045
01:24:26,489 --> 01:24:30,719
unfortunately were able to buy everyday

2046
01:24:27,869 --> 01:24:32,670
um and and NCIS I think I think from my

2047
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:36,119
personal standpoint you know I prefer

2048
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:39,829
you know the and I prefer my cherish in

2049
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:42,300
tribute artisans able to recapture and

2050
01:24:39,829 --> 01:24:46,019
preserve the natural certain expression

2051
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:48,510
of a plant so that they and is like wow

2052
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:50,340
that's that's amazing this that's like

2053
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:53,100
my favorite sage I've ever smoked in

2054
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:56,220
flower form you know probably the best

2055
01:24:53,100 --> 01:25:00,180
way to do that is the dry sim then

2056
01:24:56,220 --> 01:25:03,659
nothing is altered you do have the

2057
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:05,760
original terpene yeah I mean aside from

2058
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:08,399
the most caustic volatile ones that

2059
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:10,890
would have evaporated out in the curing

2060
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:12,149
and drying of the herb and they the time

2061
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:15,510
that it would take you to get those

2062
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:18,000
heads off whatnot but still very correct

2063
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:20,430
I mean you know Tony and I the main

2064
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,199
reason we're really doing that alik with

2065
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:24,990
you know having designed a pen that's

2066
01:25:22,199 --> 01:25:26,279
not disposable because I was like 20 was

2067
01:25:24,989 --> 01:25:28,289
like listen we got to be a part of this

2068
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:29,909
California market all these pens there's

2069
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:31,769
so much swag it would be great to offer

2070
01:25:29,909 --> 01:25:33,659
something great and then I was like well

2071
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:36,240
then we got a redesign like a pen

2072
01:25:33,659 --> 01:25:38,369
because you guys are doing great dude

2073
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:40,380
well but it's taken so long and it's a

2074
01:25:38,369 --> 01:25:43,380
you know what integrity is just like if

2075
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:45,840
you want high profits you can't have

2076
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:47,550
high integrity that's so far what I've

2077
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,980
learned in business I learned it at my

2078
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:53,909
raw food cafe which was super high

2079
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:56,069
integrity super low profits like we just

2080
01:25:53,909 --> 01:25:58,199
couldn't bring our profits up high

2081
01:25:56,069 --> 01:26:00,000
without lowering our integrity and when

2082
01:25:58,199 --> 01:26:02,579
you go into a project like the pen

2083
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,739
project that I'm doing with Tony it's

2084
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:07,649
it's very high integrity so it's great

2085
01:26:04,739 --> 01:26:09,630
work but it's you know in the meantime

2086
01:26:07,649 --> 01:26:11,399
all these distillate companies are just

2087
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:13,260
pumping hundreds of thousands of

2088
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:15,599
disposable pens that people are like

2089
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:23,970
those aren't good you know that's not

2090
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:30,650
like California needs to be more let's

2091
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:34,050
be honest that's the worst ask you this

2092
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:34,868
blood wrap have you ever tested any of

2093
01:26:34,050 --> 01:26:36,730
those the

2094
01:26:34,868 --> 01:26:39,279
whatever things that they wrapped in

2095
01:26:36,729 --> 01:26:42,519
[ __ ] right you know I would love to

2096
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:45,340
bro if you haven't you should Alex

2097
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:46,510
yeah like backwards that would be that

2098
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:54,819
would be really horrifying because I do

2099
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:57,280
enjoy use them oh my god that's not very

2100
01:26:54,819 --> 01:26:58,868
scientific sir that's not exciting you

2101
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:01,840
should been the first one that was like

2102
01:26:58,868 --> 01:27:03,908
what's in this yeah well could we

2103
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,489
request that one for the people bro you

2104
01:27:03,908 --> 01:27:08,710
just uh could you test one see cuz I

2105
01:27:06,488 --> 01:27:10,299
would love to see the pesticides I would

2106
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:12,099
love to see if there's any molds or

2107
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:17,020
fronts I would love to see what's in

2108
01:27:12,099 --> 01:27:20,199
these things we have we have been we're

2109
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:21,400
working with gentleman Roy Upton he's

2110
01:27:20,198 --> 01:27:23,229
the executive director of the American

2111
01:27:21,399 --> 01:27:24,939
herbal pharmacopoeia and he's the guy

2112
01:27:23,229 --> 01:27:26,408
that kind of helped ovo create and lead

2113
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:30,250
the whole project to create the cannabis

2114
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:32,979
monograph so it's a we've we helped him

2115
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:34,510
find some funding to help kind of

2116
01:27:32,979 --> 01:27:36,519
further develop out the cannabis

2117
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:39,300
monograph and one of the big parts of it

2118
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:41,800
was to push and substantiate more of the

2119
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:44,079
kind of questions concerns around the

2120
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:45,909
micro different aspects of microbiology

2121
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:47,920
impurities on cannabis and which ones

2122
01:27:45,908 --> 01:27:49,719
are benign which ones might be native

2123
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,300
you know and westerlyns kind of our

2124
01:27:49,719 --> 01:27:54,849
actually pathogenic hoping to only focus

2125
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:56,230
on pathogenic or I mean have to know

2126
01:27:54,849 --> 01:27:59,739
hoping to be a document to help

2127
01:27:56,229 --> 01:28:01,388
reinforce that cannabis is safe and it's

2128
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:03,789
like how much are we can go to regulate

2129
01:28:01,389 --> 01:28:05,889
all these aspects to get zero on this

2130
01:28:03,789 --> 01:28:07,719
crop of these different microbes where

2131
01:28:05,889 --> 01:28:09,639
most of them are benign there are these

2132
01:28:07,719 --> 01:28:11,500
ones of concern you know that produced

2133
01:28:09,639 --> 01:28:13,118
mycotoxins what have you but law but

2134
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,829
it's an effort to kind of substantiate

2135
01:28:13,118 --> 01:28:16,420
that further and then we're doing the

2136
01:28:14,829 --> 01:28:18,460
same thing with pesticide side of it and

2137
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:21,579
so so we one of the projects we're gonna

2138
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:24,819
do is you know so I'll add blunt raps of

2139
01:28:21,579 --> 01:28:26,738
all sorts and types to to to the list

2140
01:28:24,819 --> 01:28:29,469
but we we basically have already bought

2141
01:28:26,738 --> 01:28:31,779
a bunch of different types of tobacco

2142
01:28:29,469 --> 01:28:32,859
brand tobacco like tailor-made rolled

2143
01:28:31,779 --> 01:28:34,960
cigarettes

2144
01:28:32,859 --> 01:28:37,598
American spirit pouch tobacco a couple

2145
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,340
of things you know we in the you know

2146
01:28:37,599 --> 01:28:42,610
about six months ago we did micro

2147
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:44,560
testing on a lot of it you know you know

2148
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:47,799
is actually about a year ago now because

2149
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,700
before we have our new ABC x mass

2150
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,930
spectrometer

2151
01:28:48,699 --> 01:28:52,479
but now that we have these new math

2152
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:53,740
specs you know where the sensitivity is

2153
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:57,009
down to the single-digit part per

2154
01:28:53,739 --> 01:28:58,840
billion etc you know kind of we're about

2155
01:28:57,010 --> 01:29:01,300
to kind of do a controlled experiment

2156
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:04,810
type you know where we're able to

2157
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:07,119
identify a document yeah a wide range of

2158
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:09,340
different products that are sold

2159
01:29:07,119 --> 01:29:11,769
recreationally to the market to see kind

2160
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:13,600
of similarly what has pesticides what

2161
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:16,000
doesn't what what certain microbes are

2162
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:20,110
there what aren't on the micro topic

2163
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:23,529
what we saw is like a lot of you know

2164
01:29:20,109 --> 01:29:26,439
kind of there we see very low to no

2165
01:29:23,529 --> 01:29:27,819
yeast and mold but but in in a lot of

2166
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:28,960
cases like America spirit powered

2167
01:29:27,819 --> 01:29:31,409
Chicago and bunch of different types

2168
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:34,180
packs we would see about five hundred

2169
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:36,670
five hundred thousand plus colony

2170
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:39,190
forming units per units per gram and in

2171
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:40,600
those products so so I don't know

2172
01:29:39,189 --> 01:29:43,149
whether that's there might be some type

2173
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:50,230
of bio insecticide somebody's using them

2174
01:29:43,149 --> 01:29:51,189
et or yeah and so so you know in the in

2175
01:29:50,229 --> 01:29:52,269
the not-too-distant future and I'll

2176
01:29:51,189 --> 01:29:54,939
totally share that with you in our group

2177
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:56,170
we will have pesticide data on kind of a

2178
01:29:54,939 --> 01:29:58,539
lot of these different recreational

2179
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:59,890
smoked products you know because I think

2180
01:29:58,539 --> 01:30:02,260
those are the most interesting and

2181
01:29:59,890 --> 01:30:04,539
comparable to cannabis you know after

2182
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:06,220
that big NBC article where you know

2183
01:30:04,539 --> 01:30:08,260
pesticides kind of made this huge splash

2184
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:10,329
and you know what have you in Southern

2185
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:12,670
California you know we didn't have a

2186
01:30:10,329 --> 01:30:15,159
couple couple dispensaries we work with

2187
01:30:12,670 --> 01:30:17,409
send him like random samplings of like

2188
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:19,720
Safeway produce and vegetables you know

2189
01:30:17,409 --> 01:30:21,609
to test kind of tomatoes and grapes and

2190
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:23,260
celery and kind of all these different

2191
01:30:21,609 --> 01:30:25,269
things for pesticides you know one of

2192
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:27,220
the problems though is like you know in

2193
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:31,180
order to do like an apples to apples

2194
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:32,350
type of comparison of these pesticides

2195
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:34,150
and the concentrations of these

2196
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:35,980
pesticides you kind of need to try it

2197
01:30:34,149 --> 01:30:37,869
out similarly to cannabis would be dry

2198
01:30:35,979 --> 01:30:39,609
you know try it out because if you if

2199
01:30:37,869 --> 01:30:40,960
you're doing it wet you know the

2200
01:30:39,609 --> 01:30:42,399
concentrations gonna be that much less

2201
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,039
because that much more of the weight of

2202
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:46,960
the samples can be in water and you know

2203
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:49,119
I think that this goes back to the you

2204
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:50,800
know the question I think or you know

2205
01:30:49,119 --> 01:30:53,170
the experiment I think Sam was

2206
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:55,260
mentioning you know we haven't done kind

2207
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:58,029
of like the same plants you know kind of

2208
01:30:55,260 --> 01:31:00,940
measure to see loss and you know kind of

2209
01:30:58,029 --> 01:31:02,529
terpenes to from drying or from there's

2210
01:31:00,939 --> 01:31:04,869
different aspects but

2211
01:31:02,529 --> 01:31:06,880
we can kind of make some assumptions

2212
01:31:04,869 --> 01:31:08,140
based off what we see with they're just

2213
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:13,659
different extraction processes like

2214
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:15,220
fresh frozen live resin but yeah well

2215
01:31:13,659 --> 01:31:16,809
it's definitely interesting welcome

2216
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:19,570
Indra we were talking about some

2217
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:21,850
different terpenes I remember I remember

2218
01:31:19,569 --> 01:31:23,259
you would sent me your thing recently

2219
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:28,870
saying that you finally tested those

2220
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:31,449
terpenes that you'd been collecting so

2221
01:31:28,869 --> 01:31:40,960
we got you muted they're gonna unmute

2222
01:31:31,449 --> 01:31:45,039
your microphone that try that oh one

2223
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:45,369
more time there it is yeah that's the

2224
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:46,890
one

2225
01:31:45,369 --> 01:31:48,869
we were both unmuting your mic

2226
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:54,970
simultaneously because I have the

2227
01:31:48,869 --> 01:31:59,289
administration abilities okay well did

2228
01:31:54,970 --> 01:32:02,590
you read the list I did yeah I didn't

2229
01:31:59,289 --> 01:32:04,060
count them or anything there was I I

2230
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:05,560
didn't really understand like the

2231
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:10,120
parts-per-million and stuff like how

2232
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:11,920
small some of those amounts were like

2233
01:32:10,119 --> 01:32:14,079
which one was the primary were they in

2234
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:16,449
the most to the least list is that how

2235
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:18,189
they went your phone's making a lot of

2236
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:18,399
weird sounds right now you something's

2237
01:32:18,189 --> 01:32:23,139
wrong

2238
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:25,989
oh yeah well that's because the phone is

2239
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:30,670
the worst possible way to do this here

2240
01:32:25,989 --> 01:32:32,920
oh yeah the it doesn't go to the email

2241
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:37,060
huh

2242
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:39,130
oh yeah sorry let me try that I guess

2243
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:40,660
that's I'm amazed that people that don't

2244
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:42,760
have the phones and the computers

2245
01:32:40,659 --> 01:32:46,149
connected I never think that way but I

2246
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:48,489
can yeah yeah go go on the email I'll

2247
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:51,069
send it to you there so you can get off

2248
01:32:48,489 --> 01:32:55,719
the phone because that's terrible okay

2249
01:32:51,069 --> 01:32:58,420
all right all right yeah I mean this

2250
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:59,680
we'll head out okay good one thing I was

2251
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:01,480
gonna add real quick before kind of we

2252
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:02,980
jumped in that psycho are you familiar

2253
01:33:01,479 --> 01:33:04,899
you know cuz it kind of gets into that

2254
01:33:02,979 --> 01:33:07,119
question of like okay well terpenes are

2255
01:33:04,899 --> 01:33:08,769
toxic is it dangerous to be adding like

2256
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:10,449
unknown concentrations different to

2257
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:11,590
ravine but I also think there's

2258
01:33:10,449 --> 01:33:13,539
something really interesting to it

2259
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:16,060
because like with Ethan Russo's new

2260
01:33:13,539 --> 01:33:16,840
paper you know beyond cannabis by

2261
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:19,239
exploring

2262
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:21,690
their cannibal mimetic plants you know

2263
01:33:19,238 --> 01:33:24,218
kind of one of the plants that gets into

2264
01:33:21,689 --> 01:33:26,198
is this you know this plant that's you

2265
01:33:24,219 --> 01:33:28,960
know very near and dear to me it's a you

2266
01:33:26,198 --> 01:33:31,299
know it's copal copal is a it's this

2267
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:33,730
like an you know this is the sap from a

2268
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:36,310
tree that's you know used indigenous in

2269
01:33:33,729 --> 01:33:38,649
the you know as a smudge you know in

2270
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:40,060
ceremony spaces you know you know and

2271
01:33:38,649 --> 01:33:42,429
and and for what it's worth

2272
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:44,710
copal has a diterpene in it that by

2273
01:33:42,429 --> 01:33:47,079
that's a selective seed be juice sorry

2274
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:50,618
it's a it's a selective cb1 receptor

2275
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:53,439
agonist so it's a its binds to CB one

2276
01:33:50,618 --> 01:33:54,698
and it's a terpene that and the only

2277
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:57,098
other thing you know that we know

2278
01:33:54,698 --> 01:33:58,839
binding CB one you know any cannabis you

2279
01:33:57,099 --> 01:34:00,130
know primarily is THC so i think you

2280
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:02,529
know what's that going to do when you

2281
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:04,960
combine this terpene that binds a CB one

2282
01:34:02,529 --> 01:34:06,250
with THC that binds to CB one i think

2283
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,340
it's an interesting kind of thing you

2284
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:11,380
might there might be new effect created

2285
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:13,210
absolutely yeah no that's cool man

2286
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:15,460
that's definitely interesting i think

2287
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:17,618
we're just at the cusp of learning what

2288
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:19,239
we will learn in the upcoming ten and

2289
01:34:17,618 --> 01:34:22,899
twenty years i think it's going to be

2290
01:34:19,238 --> 01:34:24,819
vast when we have this next generation

2291
01:34:22,899 --> 01:34:27,819
of young people coming out and getting

2292
01:34:24,819 --> 01:34:31,269
their degrees getting their PhDs and you

2293
01:34:27,819 --> 01:34:33,670
know going into it with the full focus

2294
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:36,420
of working in the cannabis field is

2295
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:38,289
going to be a whole different ballgame

2296
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:40,300
it's gonna be interesting

2297
01:34:38,289 --> 01:34:42,849
i see a lot of young people excited

2298
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:44,800
about working in the cannabis sector if

2299
01:34:42,849 --> 01:34:46,420
you will and it's very it goes off in

2300
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,360
many many different directions you could

2301
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:52,149
go in a thousand different directions

2302
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:54,789
with this plants in regards to focusing

2303
01:34:52,149 --> 01:34:57,039
your life on it well there's also

2304
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:59,529
there's job descriptions and jobs things

2305
01:34:57,039 --> 01:35:04,238
in different states you know where you

2306
01:34:59,529 --> 01:35:06,880
got 28 medical states now and six to

2307
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:09,098
eight coming online for a recreational

2308
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:11,199
so it's a lot of opportunities out there

2309
01:35:09,099 --> 01:35:12,730
and i mean we're still waiting here in

2310
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:14,500
california to figure out what all the

2311
01:35:12,729 --> 01:35:16,569
regulations or all the different things

2312
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:18,880
to come on down and get solidified so

2313
01:35:16,569 --> 01:35:20,229
people can start working on their their

2314
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,779
niches because there's a lot of niches

2315
01:35:20,229 --> 01:35:25,539
for a place for people out there you

2316
01:35:22,779 --> 01:35:27,340
know science key very key we're gonna

2317
01:35:25,539 --> 01:35:29,710
need more laboratories all over the

2318
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:30,110
united states because there's going to

2319
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:32,480
have to

2320
01:35:30,109 --> 01:35:35,509
you know ring testing all that you know

2321
01:35:32,479 --> 01:35:37,459
as well as people managing you know

2322
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:39,980
greenhouse management come on that's

2323
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:42,380
gonna be major realities and working in

2324
01:35:39,979 --> 01:35:44,689
you know handling gardens and doing

2325
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:47,868
everything proper so before we're these

2326
01:35:44,689 --> 01:35:50,210
were all OJT were on-the-job training

2327
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:53,149
basically you can now actually actually

2328
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:56,448
get you know degrees and actually apply

2329
01:35:53,149 --> 01:35:58,579
them to cannabis where in the past it

2330
01:35:56,448 --> 01:36:01,158
was a little more difficult not saying

2331
01:35:58,579 --> 01:36:03,229
it's easy now but it's there's a lot

2332
01:36:01,158 --> 01:36:05,029
more opportunities now with the

2333
01:36:03,229 --> 01:36:09,229
regulation everything that's taking

2334
01:36:05,029 --> 01:36:11,779
place then there has been you you also

2335
01:36:09,229 --> 01:36:13,849
you also can't say enough about on on

2336
01:36:11,779 --> 01:36:15,139
the of the job training aspect of it

2337
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:17,389
because you know it's it's it's

2338
01:36:15,139 --> 01:36:20,389
fascinating to me kind of you know how

2339
01:36:17,389 --> 01:36:22,429
much you can't how much of this whole

2340
01:36:20,389 --> 01:36:24,500
reality you can't learn in school and

2341
01:36:22,429 --> 01:36:25,880
and how much of an advantage and

2342
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,988
headstart there's so many people that

2343
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:29,300
have been working within this industry

2344
01:36:26,988 --> 01:36:31,968
in community for so long there's such a

2345
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:34,130
depth and profound amount of knowledge

2346
01:36:31,969 --> 01:36:36,408
about this plant how to take care of it

2347
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:37,940
how to you know not be reliant on

2348
01:36:36,408 --> 01:36:40,399
pesticides whenever you treat it and

2349
01:36:37,939 --> 01:36:43,219
grow it and I mean and and although yeah

2350
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:45,559
I mean I totally get the point that you

2351
01:36:43,219 --> 01:36:47,329
know for all the new oven coming kind of

2352
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:49,460
passionate members of the cannabis

2353
01:36:47,329 --> 01:36:51,319
community you know they're added

2354
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:54,260
schooling is going to take this to a

2355
01:36:51,319 --> 01:36:55,908
whole another level but it's like such

2356
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:57,650
deep tribute and props to all our

2357
01:36:55,908 --> 01:37:00,319
mentors that helped us individually get

2358
01:36:57,649 --> 01:37:02,509
to this point of course a lot of [ __ ]

2359
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:04,460
you can school you know know know for

2360
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:08,060
sure or not well that's why those people

2361
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:09,289
will be working for our companies or our

2362
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:10,520
these people have started their own I

2363
01:37:09,289 --> 01:37:13,069
mean I can't tell you about my own

2364
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:17,230
employees who started in BPG that have

2365
01:37:13,069 --> 01:37:17,229
gone on to become doctors lawyers

2366
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:23,719
scientists laboratories also of open

2367
01:37:21,889 --> 01:37:26,389
their own dispensaries all over you know

2368
01:37:23,719 --> 01:37:28,189
it's it's a constant spreading of you

2369
01:37:26,389 --> 01:37:29,960
know and that it's as I said goes back

2370
01:37:28,189 --> 01:37:31,729
to OJT but there will always be a

2371
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:34,939
certain amount of OJT but there will be

2372
01:37:31,729 --> 01:37:37,698
a less need for OJT in the future as

2373
01:37:34,939 --> 01:37:39,439
more this becomes standardized becomes

2374
01:37:37,698 --> 01:37:41,359
you know formulas for businesses

2375
01:37:39,439 --> 01:37:42,649
standard operational procedures that you

2376
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:43,729
know like i said back in the day i

2377
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:47,000
didn't start off with

2378
01:37:43,729 --> 01:37:50,238
a book of rules we had no rules but over

2379
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,949
time after nearly 18 years now I got a

2380
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:53,659
lot of rules because there's a lot of

2381
01:37:51,949 --> 01:37:55,670
people who helped along the way that

2382
01:37:53,659 --> 01:37:58,039
showed us you know and shoutouts to our

2383
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:59,989
mentors and those that like the forest

2384
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:02,510
that showed us how to do it because back

2385
01:37:59,988 --> 01:38:02,809
in the day you know III was the quiet

2386
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:05,090
one

2387
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:06,560
doing changing the reservoirs now we

2388
01:38:05,090 --> 01:38:08,630
don't even have to change reservoirs

2389
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:11,390
we've got dosatrons and things like

2390
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:13,670
that's the technology has changed even

2391
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:15,950
what I used to get paid 25 bucks an hour

2392
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:18,710
to sit there and do now you know people

2393
01:38:15,949 --> 01:38:21,139
are getting to pay to trim now you're

2394
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:23,449
talking about the wine industry is

2395
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:26,390
worried about competing with the

2396
01:38:23,449 --> 01:38:28,579
cannabis industry because of how still

2397
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:31,010
labor-intensive cannabis is and is going

2398
01:38:28,579 --> 01:38:32,899
to be and they can't afford to pay the

2399
01:38:31,010 --> 01:38:34,930
wages that cannabis companies can

2400
01:38:32,899 --> 01:38:37,339
currently play due to the

2401
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:39,590
unsubstantiated you know false market

2402
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:42,529
that exists due to prohibition that will

2403
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:45,560
change as regulation comes online but

2404
01:38:42,529 --> 01:38:47,659
has no no not at all in any way shape or

2405
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:50,320
form it's still very inexpensive to be

2406
01:38:47,659 --> 01:38:53,599
at the tip of the arrow but we're we're

2407
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:55,789
leading the way so that you know I've

2408
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,739
always felt 7 generations to come so

2409
01:38:55,789 --> 01:38:59,569
that 7 generations from now they won't

2410
01:38:57,738 --> 01:39:03,079
know our sorrow they won't know our pain

2411
01:38:59,569 --> 01:39:04,819
we've laid the groundwork I am I am one

2412
01:39:03,079 --> 01:39:06,260
that believes that I'm planting a tree

2413
01:39:04,819 --> 01:39:08,840
that I will never sit under the shade

2414
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:12,140
butts or some reason I've been blessed

2415
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:14,569
to sit under the shade a little bit well

2416
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:17,060
that you know the the people in the

2417
01:39:14,569 --> 01:39:23,439
industry are basically are mostly good

2418
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:25,730
people I lost my wallet at the cup and

2419
01:39:23,439 --> 01:39:27,409
dropped out of my pocket when I fell

2420
01:39:25,729 --> 01:39:28,939
over on my scooter while I was going

2421
01:39:27,409 --> 01:39:31,639
around rolling over one of the many

2422
01:39:28,939 --> 01:39:33,589
bumps to keep the wires from I had quite

2423
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:36,050
a bit of money in it had my entire life

2424
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:38,000
in it I didn't realize it until last

2425
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:41,029
part of the day that it was gone

2426
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:43,520
I was kind of bummed I didn't know how

2427
01:39:41,029 --> 01:39:45,769
to feel about it and three days later a

2428
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:48,440
package arrived in the mail and I had a

2429
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:50,720
lump and I pulled it open and dumped it

2430
01:39:48,439 --> 01:39:55,099
on the table and it was my wallet would

2431
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:57,588
be all of the money and everything there

2432
01:39:55,100 --> 01:40:01,819
and the most beautiful note

2433
01:39:57,588 --> 01:40:03,828
but the guys who pawned it said hey done

2434
01:40:01,819 --> 01:40:05,659
we found your wallet and its contents

2435
01:40:03,828 --> 01:40:07,279
near the cash can right next to my booth

2436
01:40:05,658 --> 01:40:10,549
I don't know if this would reach you

2437
01:40:07,279 --> 01:40:12,378
safely but here's the wallet and call

2438
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:14,628
this number and I will get your cash

2439
01:40:12,378 --> 01:40:18,260
back to you immediately DOM and Chris a

2440
01:40:14,628 --> 01:40:21,260
couple of really sweet guys sent back

2441
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:23,208
all of it man and this was you know if

2442
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:24,469
this would've been at any other fare or

2443
01:40:23,208 --> 01:40:28,279
whatever it would have been a GaN

2444
01:40:24,469 --> 01:40:31,279
gorgonzola for sure but people at these

2445
01:40:28,279 --> 01:40:34,818
events are people like the rest of us

2446
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:38,029
that are trying to rise up and not be

2447
01:40:34,819 --> 01:40:40,309
the scenario that they're constantly

2448
01:40:38,029 --> 01:40:42,768
playing our finger at us as criminals

2449
01:40:40,309 --> 01:40:44,269
crooks nerdu wells and so forth if we

2450
01:40:42,769 --> 01:40:45,679
were nerd who else this industry

2451
01:40:44,269 --> 01:40:49,329
wouldn't have climbed to the point where

2452
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:52,418
it's at right now in the face of all

2453
01:40:49,328 --> 01:40:55,908
negativity and in the face of the

2454
01:40:52,418 --> 01:40:58,189
politicians trying to remain power in

2455
01:40:55,908 --> 01:41:02,628
the face of the people who constantly

2456
01:40:58,189 --> 01:41:05,659
talk bad pot we still risen to the point

2457
01:41:02,628 --> 01:41:07,818
where we're at I went to a big giant

2458
01:41:05,658 --> 01:41:09,648
fair lost that wallet with a couple of

2459
01:41:07,819 --> 01:41:12,739
G's and it became packed in the mail

2460
01:41:09,649 --> 01:41:15,349
tell me that the people in this

2461
01:41:12,738 --> 01:41:18,098
community aren't good people I mean it's

2462
01:41:15,349 --> 01:41:20,599
just not gonna play with me at all

2463
01:41:18,099 --> 01:41:23,418
that's pretty awesome dude that's really

2464
01:41:20,599 --> 01:41:25,458
nice to hear it's good you know those

2465
01:41:23,418 --> 01:41:27,288
are always opportunities when you find a

2466
01:41:25,458 --> 01:41:30,050
wallet full of money and unfortunately

2467
01:41:27,288 --> 01:41:32,358
often people think the opportunity is oh

2468
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:34,489
I found a bunch of money but really the

2469
01:41:32,359 --> 01:41:38,119
opportunity is to do the right thing to

2470
01:41:34,488 --> 01:41:40,388
be good and to you know send send it

2471
01:41:38,118 --> 01:41:42,799
back to where it belongs it's not yours

2472
01:41:40,389 --> 01:41:45,109
that's the whole thing about the whole

2473
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:48,019
community is exactly what you just said

2474
01:41:45,109 --> 01:41:49,639
mark we're not there accusing us of

2475
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:51,439
trying to make a bunch of money there

2476
01:41:49,639 --> 01:41:54,050
are some people in the industry doing

2477
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,668
that let's face it there are there are

2478
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:58,878
people in the industry who would steal

2479
01:41:55,668 --> 01:42:01,118
flies from a blind fighter okay and I'm

2480
01:41:58,878 --> 01:42:04,128
the first one to admit that but there's

2481
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:06,978
the majority of the people in the

2482
01:42:04,128 --> 01:42:09,668
community are good people and they're

2483
01:42:06,979 --> 01:42:11,190
trying to do the right thing and that

2484
01:42:09,668 --> 01:42:13,229
constant pressure

2485
01:42:11,189 --> 01:42:16,289
of trying to do the right thing back in

2486
01:42:13,229 --> 01:42:19,019
the face of this approach them what's

2487
01:42:16,289 --> 01:42:21,448
gonna save us now look that VA is

2488
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:24,469
starting to tremble a little bit because

2489
01:42:21,448 --> 01:42:28,289
there's so many vets right now crying

2490
01:42:24,469 --> 01:42:31,890
back to the government the that death

2491
01:42:28,289 --> 01:42:35,250
rate from suicide for PTSD is rising as

2492
01:42:31,890 --> 01:42:37,969
we speak and people who are trying to

2493
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:37,969
keep at it

2494
01:42:40,369 --> 01:42:47,279
yeah there's people trying to combat it

2495
01:42:43,890 --> 01:42:49,560
as we speak but you know you you've got

2496
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:52,889
a lot of people out there who think that

2497
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:55,050
the little tiny caveat of pot that it

2498
01:42:52,890 --> 01:42:57,810
did should I this and all the healing

2499
01:42:55,050 --> 01:43:00,449
stuff it does is driving the rest of

2500
01:42:57,810 --> 01:43:03,420
when it's crazy you know it does

2501
01:43:00,448 --> 01:43:05,579
something good and just because you get

2502
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:08,579
a little high well it's doing it people

2503
01:43:05,579 --> 01:43:11,189
don't want us to have that but they will

2504
01:43:08,579 --> 01:43:14,250
drink and they'll smoke and they'll

2505
01:43:11,189 --> 01:43:15,929
drive their cars fast and all the rest

2506
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:17,609
of the things that are truly a danger

2507
01:43:15,930 --> 01:43:19,860
they all have guns

2508
01:43:17,609 --> 01:43:21,779
I'm sick and tired of guns I got shop I

2509
01:43:19,859 --> 01:43:24,119
want to be it non so you can imagine I

2510
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:28,409
don't have one I don't want one don't

2511
01:43:24,119 --> 01:43:30,659
even one them anywhere nearly and so you

2512
01:43:28,409 --> 01:43:33,840
know and not change subjects quickly the

2513
01:43:30,659 --> 01:43:35,519
the terpenes they were listed there in

2514
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,800
parts-per-million but that wasn't the

2515
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:40,380
point the list was long and there were

2516
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:43,140
many many campaigns on that list that I

2517
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:44,130
haven't seen on other lists yeah even if

2518
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:46,640
they were just there in

2519
01:43:44,130 --> 01:43:50,460
parts-per-million it points out the fact

2520
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:53,640
as to our technology grows and were able

2521
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:57,329
to advance enough understanding we're

2522
01:43:53,640 --> 01:44:00,530
picking up new turf beans beans that we

2523
01:43:57,329 --> 01:44:05,250
previously haven't been picking up and

2524
01:44:00,529 --> 01:44:07,229
I'm going I'm just always for advancing

2525
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:09,750
this whole deal as much as possible for

2526
01:44:07,229 --> 01:44:15,809
good if you make sure you know let's do

2527
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:17,159
it on it Turpin's we enjoy if you if you

2528
01:44:15,810 --> 01:44:18,960
wouldn't mind what were some of the

2529
01:44:17,159 --> 01:44:20,639
terpenes you you were just describing

2530
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:22,109
that you were seeing that you know

2531
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:25,039
aren't kind of currently being tested

2532
01:44:22,109 --> 01:44:25,039
for by some of the labs

2533
01:44:25,179 --> 01:44:39,850
that's what's tested in a lab in Oregon

2534
01:44:30,119 --> 01:44:42,630
and did you send it to me on an email or

2535
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:47,199
something is that how you sent it to me

2536
01:44:42,630 --> 01:44:49,000
oh yeah oh yeah okay so maybe I can

2537
01:44:47,198 --> 01:44:51,219
screen share it or something I don't

2538
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,319
know I would be really psyched to see

2539
01:44:51,219 --> 01:44:56,469
that and look into it because and if I'm

2540
01:44:53,319 --> 01:44:58,869
a real quick to chime in on that and and

2541
01:44:56,469 --> 01:45:00,069
and talk to your pointer I think I think

2542
01:44:58,869 --> 01:45:02,380
it's such a huge one because you know

2543
01:45:00,069 --> 01:45:04,809
there is such you know there's you know

2544
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:07,090
the the the the terpene science and such

2545
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:10,360
is such a new frontier and and and you

2546
01:45:07,090 --> 01:45:12,190
know the alcohol esters and kind of

2547
01:45:10,359 --> 01:45:14,170
compounds that are their tiny part per

2548
01:45:12,189 --> 01:45:14,919
million mounds you know seem to you know

2549
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:16,539
and like what we're talking about

2550
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:19,539
earlier with the spice comparison and

2551
01:45:16,539 --> 01:45:22,300
how you know a certain amount of salts

2552
01:45:19,539 --> 01:45:23,859
will do some thing to a mixture and then

2553
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:26,739
steam eventually change the entire

2554
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:29,799
profile of the soup you know it's it

2555
01:45:26,738 --> 01:45:31,689
it's really into interesting and and how

2556
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:33,219
much the certain things and tiny amounts

2557
01:45:31,689 --> 01:45:35,649
are substantially affecting the overall

2558
01:45:33,219 --> 01:45:37,179
and and you know but what I would say to

2559
01:45:35,649 --> 01:45:39,819
what I would say that really complicates

2560
01:45:37,179 --> 01:45:41,469
a lot of this whole kind of conversation

2561
01:45:39,819 --> 01:45:46,689
which really sucks up to this point is

2562
01:45:41,469 --> 01:45:49,119
is the the need for Standardization of

2563
01:45:46,689 --> 01:45:51,158
laboratory data to be able to make apple

2564
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:53,679
establish comparisons because up to this

2565
01:45:51,158 --> 01:45:55,179
point unfortunately what we've seen and

2566
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:58,899
so much of the terpene testing that's

2567
01:45:55,179 --> 01:46:01,119
done is you know oftentimes you know

2568
01:45:58,899 --> 01:46:04,689
kind of complete wrong terpenes being

2569
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:07,300
you know quantified or you know or orbit

2570
01:46:04,689 --> 01:46:09,879
or reported you know from an unverified

2571
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:12,820
or unvalidated terpene kind of run on a

2572
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:14,050
GC and my greatest example of that was

2573
01:46:12,819 --> 01:46:16,479
you know one of the biggest labs in

2574
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:18,640
california you know for so long has been

2575
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:21,000
putting kind of out these terpene

2576
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:24,820
profiles you know she's showing and

2577
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:27,429
suggesting that mining alpha pining you

2578
01:46:24,819 --> 01:46:30,579
know was the terpene dominant and in in

2579
01:46:27,429 --> 01:46:34,600
all these ranged strains from Jax a

2580
01:46:30,579 --> 01:46:37,420
train wreck 2x j2j who want that street

2581
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:38,670
to dirt into you know sage and and and

2582
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:41,760
that's completely

2583
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:44,579
you know and kind of and from that from

2584
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:46,739
that unvalidated terpene run and that

2585
01:46:44,579 --> 01:46:49,140
amount of publicly display being the

2586
01:46:46,738 --> 01:46:50,968
data of this wrong terpene as the

2587
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:53,160
primary chirping in this this whole

2588
01:46:50,969 --> 01:46:55,109
class of strains you know they really

2589
01:46:53,159 --> 01:46:56,939
kind of took a hit you know and some of

2590
01:46:55,109 --> 01:46:59,369
their scientific integrity you know and

2591
01:46:56,939 --> 01:47:00,809
and and unfortunately you know in in

2592
01:46:59,369 --> 01:47:02,609
most states including california

2593
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:05,219
including Oregon

2594
01:47:02,609 --> 01:47:08,460
you know there unfortunately terpene

2595
01:47:05,219 --> 01:47:11,609
testing isn't yet the test that is being

2596
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:14,579
required to go through you know a

2597
01:47:11,609 --> 01:47:16,738
further accreditation proficiency

2598
01:47:14,579 --> 01:47:18,390
testing process you know to be able to

2599
01:47:16,738 --> 01:47:20,399
do that test so and because in Oregon

2600
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:21,630
the Oregon really set a standard an

2601
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:23,789
amazing standard in California is

2602
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:25,050
following it and it was that okay if

2603
01:47:23,789 --> 01:47:27,779
you're gonna have if you're gonna

2604
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:30,029
regulate I have strong kind of you know

2605
01:47:27,779 --> 01:47:31,679
limits and regulations on the producers

2606
01:47:30,029 --> 01:47:33,719
and processors and products and these

2607
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:36,119
regulated markets you actually have to

2608
01:47:33,719 --> 01:47:38,130
have an even stricter level of scrutiny

2609
01:47:36,119 --> 01:47:40,619
and regulation of the laboratories that

2610
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:43,219
are doing the testing and and so so and

2611
01:47:40,619 --> 01:47:44,760
so so Oregon was the first state to

2612
01:47:43,219 --> 01:47:46,198
substantiate that through their

2613
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:48,210
regulations California's following them

2614
01:47:46,198 --> 01:47:50,460
and what they're requiring is that you

2615
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:52,890
know an Oregon a lab has to go through

2616
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:55,500
basically this this group called or lap

2617
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:58,289
the Oregon laboratory assessment program

2618
01:47:55,500 --> 01:48:03,659
and and and they have to go through or

2619
01:47:58,289 --> 01:48:06,750
to go through all out basically and do a

2620
01:48:03,659 --> 01:48:10,010
proficiency testing process to show and

2621
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:12,840
substantiate this laboratory evaluation

2622
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:14,070
program that they can do the levels of

2623
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:16,500
testing that are going to be required

2624
01:48:14,069 --> 01:48:18,389
for them to do and to pick up these

2625
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:23,569
compounds in these amounts in these

2626
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:27,150
mixtures and Spike matrices

2627
01:48:23,569 --> 01:48:28,469
well I this one particular lab that I

2628
01:48:27,149 --> 01:48:35,729
used I don't know if you've heard of

2629
01:48:28,469 --> 01:48:37,739
them or not but it's MRX labs and they

2630
01:48:35,729 --> 01:48:40,439
did a pretty thorough testing of it they

2631
01:48:37,738 --> 01:48:43,669
came up with alpha pining camping mersin

2632
01:48:40,439 --> 01:48:48,839
beta finding preparing alpha

2633
01:48:43,670 --> 01:48:52,560
serpentine lemony sameen gamma 13 Turpin

2634
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:57,390
alene little lu i so peel ago there

2635
01:48:52,560 --> 01:49:00,600
now beta-carotene humulin Norrell idle

2636
01:48:57,390 --> 01:49:03,950
transfer like dog while and alpha busy

2637
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:09,600
ball visit doorway which was a fairly

2638
01:49:03,949 --> 01:49:11,939
live vocalist of a lot of terpenes yeah

2639
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:13,860
absolutely the greenest I learned a lot

2640
01:49:11,939 --> 01:49:17,129
from these guys I learned a lot about

2641
01:49:13,859 --> 01:49:20,329
the terpenes for one if you're not

2642
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:24,260
careful when you store your terpenes

2643
01:49:20,329 --> 01:49:26,369
different stuff happens to distribute

2644
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:31,680
next thing you know you start finding

2645
01:49:26,369 --> 01:49:33,390
isopropanol and acetone Peter terpenes

2646
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:36,020
and that's because some of the terpenes

2647
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:39,270
thermally degrade into those compounds

2648
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:41,040
and you keep them in a amber bottle and

2649
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:42,540
you got to keep them cool otherwise they

2650
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:45,119
start going off that's no problem with

2651
01:49:42,539 --> 01:49:46,710
shelf-life warning one of the bottles

2652
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:48,720
that I carried around with me at the cup

2653
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:51,230
in my pocket and for four days was in

2654
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:54,090
the heat I sent him to them and

2655
01:49:51,229 --> 01:49:56,809
immediately it came back and it had all

2656
01:49:54,090 --> 01:50:00,000
these this other garbage in it which

2657
01:49:56,810 --> 01:50:01,830
blew my mind I was like isopropanol

2658
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,470
there's no way that that could possibly

2659
01:50:01,829 --> 01:50:08,239
because I collected these terpenes using

2660
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:10,800
our new machine the blue meanie and it

2661
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:13,050
refrigerates down to minus 20 pretty

2662
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:15,900
easy and so we were getting a copious

2663
01:50:13,050 --> 01:50:18,270
amounts of terpenes but when I sent that

2664
01:50:15,899 --> 01:50:20,009
in it came back with a little bit of

2665
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:21,900
tiny tiny amount of acetone and

2666
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:26,100
isopropanol in it and that just blew my

2667
01:50:21,899 --> 01:50:27,809
mind and so I did it over again and then

2668
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:31,520
I set that back into him when it came

2669
01:50:27,810 --> 01:50:34,530
clean and then I talked a lot with

2670
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:37,620
Clancy of Callahan the guy at scientific

2671
01:50:34,529 --> 01:50:40,500
7/10 where they they make the machine

2672
01:50:37,619 --> 01:50:42,599
and they had the same thing and I found

2673
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:47,250
a number of people now that I've been

2674
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:49,560
looking that have come up with the same

2675
01:50:47,250 --> 01:50:51,869
info about the terpenes that you got to

2676
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:55,800
be careful how you keep them you've got

2677
01:50:51,869 --> 01:50:57,809
to click look into the ones that you've

2678
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:59,340
got you know we found a couple of

2679
01:50:57,810 --> 01:51:01,200
terpenes that are very interesting we've

2680
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:02,520
been separating them out as best as

2681
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:05,670
possible we've come up with a

2682
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:06,449
vasodilator all you have to do a smelly

2683
01:51:05,670 --> 01:51:07,708
he's sticking

2684
01:51:06,448 --> 01:51:09,748
your nose and take like three or four

2685
01:51:07,708 --> 01:51:12,139
deep breasts you can feel your face get

2686
01:51:09,748 --> 01:51:14,698
warm you can feel your hands get warm

2687
01:51:12,139 --> 01:51:18,109
it's opening the blood flow all over

2688
01:51:14,698 --> 01:51:20,728
your body we found a bronchial dilator

2689
01:51:18,109 --> 01:51:23,880
3-4 breaths of it and I have two friends

2690
01:51:20,729 --> 01:51:25,619
who are who are on these asthma things

2691
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:27,449
and they're using this bronchial dilator

2692
01:51:25,618 --> 01:51:29,098
curtain up and they think it's the

2693
01:51:27,448 --> 01:51:31,859
hottest thing since sunburn they don't

2694
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:34,319
want to be removed from it and I think

2695
01:51:31,859 --> 01:51:36,839
if we can get start getting a really

2696
01:51:34,319 --> 01:51:38,639
complete feed out on these thirteen's

2697
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:42,239
one of the things that I was doing that

2698
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:44,279
somebody wasn't happy about but when I

2699
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:45,988
get card for people occasionally and

2700
01:51:44,279 --> 01:51:47,788
when they wanted to stuff the card but I

2701
01:51:45,988 --> 01:51:50,939
always put the turkey collector between

2702
01:51:47,788 --> 01:51:55,408
the vacuum oven which is what I use for

2703
01:51:50,939 --> 01:51:58,888
D carving and the vacuum pump in at

2704
01:51:55,408 --> 01:52:02,399
around 75 or 80 milliliters of gold and

2705
01:51:58,889 --> 01:52:04,618
terpenes but when in those terpenes are

2706
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:07,078
the ones that will thermally be great so

2707
01:52:04,618 --> 01:52:09,359
you have to be very careful with it I've

2708
01:52:07,078 --> 01:52:12,179
been on a aggressive program separating

2709
01:52:09,359 --> 01:52:15,319
him as much as possible

2710
01:52:12,179 --> 01:52:17,940
I found one method of gaining the

2711
01:52:15,319 --> 01:52:20,219
isopropanol and acetone artists put

2712
01:52:17,939 --> 01:52:22,558
three or four drops of water in with the

2713
01:52:20,219 --> 01:52:24,179
vial of Turkey and shake it up good put

2714
01:52:22,559 --> 01:52:26,219
in a scepter i final drain the water off

2715
01:52:24,179 --> 01:52:30,300
because both the acetone isopropanol

2716
01:52:26,219 --> 01:52:32,788
will go into the water phase of that and

2717
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:36,510
then you can separate them and have your

2718
01:52:32,788 --> 01:52:38,399
terpenes clean but I'm pretty sure that

2719
01:52:36,510 --> 01:52:40,739
it's gonna take a lot of time and effort

2720
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:44,638
to find out how to combine these

2721
01:52:40,738 --> 01:52:48,839
terpenes with the various oils to come

2722
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:50,519
up with the effects and I can try work

2723
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:52,349
on that somewhat this year now that I

2724
01:52:50,519 --> 01:52:54,929
know that I've got a source to collect

2725
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:57,420
terpenes the way I need and want to

2726
01:52:54,929 --> 01:52:59,760
collect them you know what's unique

2727
01:52:57,420 --> 01:53:01,288
about these degradation of terpenes is

2728
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,539
they're probably not only going to

2729
01:53:01,288 --> 01:53:05,219
happen on their own when collected but

2730
01:53:03,538 --> 01:53:07,408
they could potentially also happen in

2731
01:53:05,219 --> 01:53:10,529
the gland heads while they're you know

2732
01:53:07,408 --> 01:53:13,170
in cured bud or old bud you know these

2733
01:53:10,529 --> 01:53:14,488
are mad that that's such an awesome

2734
01:53:13,170 --> 01:53:17,939
thing you said because that really

2735
01:53:14,488 --> 01:53:20,158
connected for me kind of this this

2736
01:53:17,939 --> 01:53:21,989
interesting kind of you know we

2737
01:53:20,158 --> 01:53:24,238
thing that we've been seeing that might

2738
01:53:21,988 --> 01:53:27,629
be adding to both your points and that's

2739
01:53:24,238 --> 01:53:30,779
that you know in certain flour and and

2740
01:53:27,630 --> 01:53:34,289
and and extracts you know oftentimes we

2741
01:53:30,779 --> 01:53:38,279
will see these small kind of trace

2742
01:53:34,289 --> 01:53:41,550
residual solvent levels that are present

2743
01:53:38,279 --> 01:53:43,859
that are not used or should be there

2744
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:45,929
kind of in general and so so kind of

2745
01:53:43,859 --> 01:53:48,000
yeah fascinating you kind of work in

2746
01:53:45,929 --> 01:53:49,380
drawing on what you're doing and seeing

2747
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,238
because yeah that's from what we see

2748
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:52,469
absolutely the for the analytical

2749
01:53:51,238 --> 01:53:53,879
reference standards that we have with

2750
01:53:52,469 --> 01:53:56,460
these different turbines it's so

2751
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:58,440
important how they're stored and and and

2752
01:53:56,460 --> 01:54:00,929
and how the calibration ladders are

2753
01:53:58,439 --> 01:54:02,519
built and and and the runs developed

2754
01:54:00,929 --> 01:54:03,869
because it's so they're so sensitive

2755
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:05,070
that they kind of seem to break down

2756
01:54:03,869 --> 01:54:07,319
really quickly in these different

2757
01:54:05,069 --> 01:54:09,119
conditions you know and then and then to

2758
01:54:07,319 --> 01:54:11,069
to you know what you were just saying

2759
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:13,198
Marcus with the flower there might be

2760
01:54:11,069 --> 01:54:15,059
these weird and doggedness levels of

2761
01:54:13,198 --> 01:54:16,079
certain compounds that are there you

2762
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:18,690
know that might be happening from

2763
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:21,539
different you know overheat overheated

2764
01:54:18,689 --> 01:54:23,939
kind of you know rooms or you know just

2765
01:54:21,539 --> 01:54:26,340
different kind of you know in processes

2766
01:54:23,939 --> 01:54:29,189
that are being done you know and then

2767
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:31,350
the extraction I like let me ask you a

2768
01:54:29,189 --> 01:54:32,759
question one of the things I've been

2769
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:34,620
thinking about for a long time we

2770
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:37,110
they've talked about it on the church

2771
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:39,420
air quite a bit about what's in the stem

2772
01:54:37,109 --> 01:54:41,369
of the plant what's in the leaf and then

2773
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:45,090
how it goes into the little factory of

2774
01:54:41,369 --> 01:54:48,210
the trichrome and manifest ultimately in

2775
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:50,819
the head of the Trico all of that while

2776
01:54:48,210 --> 01:54:53,550
i was listening to it made me realize

2777
01:54:50,819 --> 01:54:55,380
that that must mean that when you

2778
01:54:53,550 --> 01:54:58,170
extract the planter when you separate

2779
01:54:55,380 --> 01:55:03,119
that up that there's going to be a race

2780
01:54:58,170 --> 01:55:07,050
mix in there of the pre stuff the stuff

2781
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:11,550
and the after stuff going on and it's

2782
01:55:07,050 --> 01:55:14,880
going to be as we start using finer and

2783
01:55:11,550 --> 01:55:18,000
finer equipment to analyze what's coming

2784
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:21,060
out in these expansions we're gonna

2785
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,969
you're gonna start seeing little ticks

2786
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:25,530
here and there I know that that recently

2787
01:55:23,969 --> 01:55:28,260
somebody pointed out at one of the

2788
01:55:25,529 --> 01:55:32,679
research labs that there's a bit of

2789
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:35,920
butane naturally in the helix

2790
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:38,230
and so there there must be a mix of

2791
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:41,050
things that we haven't entirely paid

2792
01:55:38,229 --> 01:55:43,750
attention to yet and I'm hoping that

2793
01:55:41,050 --> 01:55:45,880
would the new lab certifications and the

2794
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:47,350
new requirements for people working in

2795
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:49,690
the lab will start getting some real

2796
01:55:47,350 --> 01:55:53,590
information it's awesome absolutely

2797
01:55:49,689 --> 01:55:56,079
can't agree more so Alec do you think

2798
01:55:53,590 --> 01:55:58,329
now with the I know you were trying to

2799
01:55:56,079 --> 01:56:01,359
with this new competition with the

2800
01:55:58,329 --> 01:56:04,659
cannabis County Fair going with that

2801
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:06,189
type of you know terpene classification

2802
01:56:04,659 --> 01:56:09,939
where you know grouping them together

2803
01:56:06,189 --> 01:56:12,009
etc how did you were you involved in

2804
01:56:09,939 --> 01:56:14,919
that decision-making process to arrive

2805
01:56:12,010 --> 01:56:17,560
at that point or was that something that

2806
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:19,390
was brought forth by the cannabis count

2807
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:22,150
country fair because I can see

2808
01:56:19,390 --> 01:56:24,579
competition it was largely me okay well

2809
01:56:22,149 --> 01:56:26,469
I can see by by having that type of

2810
01:56:24,579 --> 01:56:29,050
classification you can start to drive

2811
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:31,800
other labs into other competitions into

2812
01:56:29,050 --> 01:56:34,119
raising their standards so that they can

2813
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:35,350
speak of this competition because even

2814
01:56:34,119 --> 01:56:38,529
less such as when I was over in

2815
01:56:35,350 --> 01:56:39,970
Barcelona this year for spannabis I

2816
01:56:38,529 --> 01:56:42,219
talked to them and of course you know

2817
01:56:39,970 --> 01:56:43,930
they were testing their cannabis that

2818
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:46,840
was in the competitions that I was

2819
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:50,920
involved in but they're only testing of

2820
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:52,690
course for THC content or CBD they did

2821
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:54,399
write of any type of anything else

2822
01:56:52,689 --> 01:56:56,589
beyond that is like well what are you

2823
01:56:54,399 --> 01:56:58,059
guys looking to step your game and

2824
01:56:56,590 --> 01:56:59,500
they're like yes absolutely by seeing

2825
01:56:58,060 --> 01:57:01,539
what's happening in the United States it

2826
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:03,880
causes them to put pressure on their

2827
01:57:01,539 --> 01:57:06,579
laboratories they're awesome pushing

2828
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:08,050
them to that they can be at the

2829
01:57:06,579 --> 01:57:10,300
standards because I have to give you

2830
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:12,400
know Barcelona props their quality is

2831
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:14,949
grown exponentially as well as their

2832
01:57:12,399 --> 01:57:17,289
testing ability but it also shows that

2833
01:57:14,949 --> 01:57:19,479
there's still holes in the system so but

2834
01:57:17,289 --> 01:57:21,189
it also shows through what you know the

2835
01:57:19,479 --> 01:57:23,679
cannabis Country Fair was trying to do

2836
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:28,479
with its competition I hope it spreads

2837
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:30,520
into a potentially mo cup and into I

2838
01:57:28,479 --> 01:57:32,529
take it that cannabis Country Fair will

2839
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:35,050
happen then next year next summer on a

2840
01:57:32,529 --> 01:57:37,659
more reasonable date and time and with

2841
01:57:35,050 --> 01:57:39,420
more time planned and kind of effort put

2842
01:57:37,659 --> 01:57:42,069
into it yes

2843
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:43,720
and I pre I really appreciate those

2844
01:57:42,069 --> 01:57:44,670
words you know because um you know it's

2845
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:46,710
such a large array I mean I

2846
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:49,590
such deep love and admiration respect

2847
01:57:46,710 --> 01:57:50,899
for Tim Blake Blake's tailor Blake and

2848
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:53,640
how much they personally have been

2849
01:57:50,899 --> 01:57:56,250
mentors involved in my life and why I'm

2850
01:57:53,640 --> 01:58:00,240
with an in the cannabis community and

2851
01:57:56,250 --> 01:58:01,949
why I see labs exists and and and so

2852
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:04,039
being involved you know I mean I've been

2853
01:58:01,949 --> 01:58:07,439
work with the mo couple s 10 years and

2854
01:58:04,039 --> 01:58:10,079
since I moved out here and we you know

2855
01:58:07,439 --> 01:58:12,419
Taylor and I we're living up at your

2856
01:58:10,079 --> 01:58:14,789
area 101 and involved you know kind of

2857
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:16,859
organic farming and life changing in

2858
01:58:14,789 --> 01:58:17,399
every way that was wishers after I got

2859
01:58:16,859 --> 01:58:19,949
of the Navy

2860
01:58:17,399 --> 01:58:21,869
but um being involved in the cup and

2861
01:58:19,949 --> 01:58:23,130
seeing it grow and seeing it gets the

2862
01:58:21,869 --> 01:58:24,989
point where there's no you know eight

2863
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:26,670
hundred plus flower entries you know

2864
01:58:24,989 --> 01:58:29,309
last year I mean it gets to the point

2865
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:32,159
where all of a sudden the the integrity

2866
01:58:29,310 --> 01:58:34,710
of the overall judging what might be you

2867
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:37,619
know even like a really strong kind of

2868
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:39,600
plan you know from the top you know and

2869
01:58:37,619 --> 01:58:42,029
how the judges gonna be done it really

2870
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:43,920
kind of you know brings a lot of

2871
01:58:42,029 --> 01:58:45,809
questions overall to help people can

2872
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:47,460
even judge that and and how people can

2873
01:58:45,810 --> 01:58:50,070
kind of make similar you know kind of

2874
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:51,960
judging criteria if there is smoking

2875
01:58:50,069 --> 01:58:54,239
that many strains a day and and so you

2876
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:55,829
know in so many ways kind of just you

2877
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:58,319
know the judging process is involved in

2878
01:58:55,829 --> 01:59:00,960
just like the the overall quality of the

2879
01:58:58,319 --> 01:59:02,759
look feel the bag appeal you know the

2880
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:05,189
trim kind of you know how you know it's

2881
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:06,930
if it's sticky and still cured you know

2882
01:59:05,189 --> 01:59:08,789
and just all these different aspects

2883
01:59:06,930 --> 01:59:11,400
kind of go into judging but but you

2884
01:59:08,789 --> 01:59:13,470
can't deny the importance of the

2885
01:59:11,399 --> 01:59:17,339
chemometric data cannabinoids and

2886
01:59:13,470 --> 01:59:20,100
hurricanes and and and and in in in in

2887
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:21,449
so many ways you know with what we felt

2888
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:23,730
with this turbine classification system

2889
01:59:21,449 --> 01:59:25,380
I was really kind of you know going to

2890
01:59:23,729 --> 01:59:27,209
Tim you know hoping that you know with

2891
01:59:25,380 --> 01:59:29,220
you're hoping that eventually it can

2892
01:59:27,210 --> 01:59:30,720
kind of evolve into the Emerald cup but

2893
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:32,159
you know with with the cannabis Country

2894
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:34,320
Fair there's gonna be a lot smaller but

2895
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:37,079
total data sample set so that we could

2896
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:39,299
try this you know try this out for you

2897
01:59:37,079 --> 01:59:41,039
know for just in general try it out just

2898
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:42,539
to as an experiment to see how well it

2899
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:45,539
works in the judging because the idea

2900
01:59:42,539 --> 01:59:47,789
was gonna be you know besides micro

2901
01:59:45,539 --> 01:59:49,319
gonna be run residual solvents and if

2902
01:59:47,789 --> 01:59:51,149
anything's out of spec then it was gonna

2903
01:59:49,319 --> 01:59:53,219
get disqualified anything else that was

2904
01:59:51,149 --> 01:59:55,079
qualified you know basically was gonna

2905
01:59:53,220 --> 01:59:56,699
get sent through this algorithm for

2906
01:59:55,079 --> 01:59:58,619
terpenes cannabinoids and then sorted

2907
01:59:56,699 --> 02:00:00,689
into these different primary

2908
01:59:58,619 --> 02:00:02,849
subgroups and then they were hopefully

2909
02:00:00,689 --> 02:00:06,689
going to be given to the the entrance

2910
02:00:02,850 --> 02:00:09,000
you know in these already sorted groups

2911
02:00:06,689 --> 02:00:12,529
so that you can make similar judging

2912
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:15,630
against similar smelling or similar

2913
02:00:12,529 --> 02:00:17,759
profiled bud you know hoping that the

2914
02:00:15,630 --> 02:00:20,310
the data wouldn't necessarily bias all

2915
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:21,989
the other judging attributes but it

2916
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:24,600
hopefully would help inform you know

2917
02:00:21,989 --> 02:00:26,609
well it definitely helps inform because

2918
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:28,770
it separates the wheat from the chaff it

2919
02:00:26,609 --> 02:00:30,839
means we saw everybody who used to oh

2920
02:00:28,770 --> 02:00:32,310
look at the size of my bud I got a great

2921
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:35,310
donkey dick well that's great and all

2922
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:37,350
but what is the data displayed right so

2923
02:00:35,310 --> 02:00:40,080
now we can see what's actually inside

2924
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:43,050
there so you know it no longer size that

2925
02:00:40,079 --> 02:00:46,229
matters it's what are your Terps say and

2926
02:00:43,050 --> 02:00:49,949
what's their retention and you know on

2927
02:00:46,229 --> 02:00:53,399
top of the THC content CBD and looking

2928
02:00:49,949 --> 02:00:55,260
for you know to you know all those

2929
02:00:53,399 --> 02:00:59,189
things you're going to find that you

2930
02:00:55,260 --> 02:01:00,329
know yeah and I think and I'm sorry just

2931
02:00:59,189 --> 02:01:02,159
to finish the point also it's like I

2932
02:01:00,329 --> 02:01:04,590
think also you know why the big efforts

2933
02:01:02,159 --> 02:01:06,899
was like hoping to you know celebrate by

2934
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:08,369
you know through using or identifying

2935
02:01:06,899 --> 02:01:10,199
these different categories and giving

2936
02:01:08,369 --> 02:01:12,390
awards these different small groups you

2937
02:01:10,199 --> 02:01:14,460
know you'll be able to in a way help to

2938
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:17,160
celebrate and bring out the diversity of

2939
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:18,600
cannabis because so many times what

2940
02:01:17,159 --> 02:01:21,420
we've seen in the Emerald Club is people

2941
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:25,050
would enter some like really interesting

2942
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:27,329
and unique kind of novel strains that

2943
02:01:25,050 --> 02:01:28,860
you know what actually they would there

2944
02:01:27,329 --> 02:01:31,170
would be complete outliers to the entire

2945
02:01:28,859 --> 02:01:33,719
dataset and should probably get an award

2946
02:01:31,170 --> 02:01:35,940
but because nobody even knew what it was

2947
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:37,770
you know couldn't even get it judged and

2948
02:01:35,939 --> 02:01:40,109
so a couple of examples of this would be

2949
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:41,250
some weird Landry strains that we're

2950
02:01:40,109 --> 02:01:45,000
like one to one

2951
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:46,859
THC one to it you know - 101 THC th t

2952
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,090
v-- you know there's this like Black

2953
02:01:46,859 --> 02:01:50,759
Beauty strain out right now in

2954
02:01:48,090 --> 02:01:53,069
California one to one you know and a lot

2955
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:56,880
of the Baron strains kind of our bread

2956
02:01:53,069 --> 02:01:58,619
around from that and and so you know at

2957
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:00,869
the time nobody even knew to judge it or

2958
02:01:58,619 --> 02:02:02,729
what have you and so just kind of slip

2959
02:02:00,869 --> 02:02:04,319
through the cracks and so so you know

2960
02:02:02,729 --> 02:02:06,329
with with being able to kind of put

2961
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:08,789
things into these buckets and then give

2962
02:02:06,329 --> 02:02:11,239
awards in place you can also then to you

2963
02:02:08,789 --> 02:02:12,809
know identify these really unique novel

2964
02:02:11,239 --> 02:02:14,760
aspects that

2965
02:02:12,809 --> 02:02:17,219
my enter and then you know through that

2966
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:19,590
help to breed out that overall kind of

2967
02:02:17,219 --> 02:02:21,630
terpene into the broader market and

2968
02:02:19,590 --> 02:02:23,969
elevate it and elevate it to the public

2969
02:02:21,630 --> 02:02:26,340
as well as which of course causes

2970
02:02:23,969 --> 02:02:28,260
further market saturation of the

2971
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:31,130
diversity of products that have since

2972
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:33,960
come out of me look since CBD has been

2973
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:36,719
synthesized resynthesized and look at

2974
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:38,489
the plethora of products on the market

2975
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:40,828
that have spilled forth just off that

2976
02:02:38,488 --> 02:02:43,500
one compound alone not saying it's good

2977
02:02:40,828 --> 02:02:46,349
or bad etc I'm just poison cutting out

2978
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:48,569
causality well what about what about

2979
02:02:46,349 --> 02:02:49,380
guys when it goes up and they will

2980
02:02:48,569 --> 02:02:52,529
believe me

2981
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:54,750
constructive concentrates that is

2982
02:02:52,529 --> 02:02:58,319
concentration constructed from really

2983
02:02:54,750 --> 02:03:00,359
extremely fine oils and terpenes

2984
02:02:58,319 --> 02:03:02,788
collected separately but mixed back in

2985
02:03:00,359 --> 02:03:04,828
and offered as in the concentrate

2986
02:03:02,788 --> 02:03:06,658
contest what you guys do about that when

2987
02:03:04,828 --> 02:03:08,308
that stuff that's already been showing

2988
02:03:06,658 --> 02:03:10,379
up it's happened already people have

2989
02:03:08,309 --> 02:03:13,860
been kicked out of the cups because of

2990
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:15,449
that at least why and Indra also you

2991
02:03:13,859 --> 02:03:17,339
know you know and I was making this a

2992
02:03:15,448 --> 02:03:20,250
point kind of earlier before you jumped

2993
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:21,328
on and and and I mean if anybody that

2994
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:24,059
might figure it out

2995
02:03:21,328 --> 02:03:27,029
I would imagine you probably would be

2996
02:03:24,059 --> 02:03:29,190
one of them but from what we see mostly

2997
02:03:27,029 --> 02:03:32,309
like whatever people are attempting to

2998
02:03:29,189 --> 02:03:35,129
take all these you know other flounder

2999
02:03:32,309 --> 02:03:37,260
I've terpenes and then re-add them or

3000
02:03:35,130 --> 02:03:39,929
reintroduce em in certain concentrations

3001
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:41,760
to you know a distillate or some other

3002
02:03:39,929 --> 02:03:43,739
type of product typically it doesn't

3003
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:47,639
work out well for them you know and if

3004
02:03:43,738 --> 02:03:49,888
you compare that besides you saw us live

3005
02:03:47,639 --> 02:03:52,170
resin holy water national trip

3006
02:03:49,889 --> 02:03:54,989
extraction kind of preserve you know

3007
02:03:52,170 --> 02:03:57,868
extract or you know rose in with like

3008
02:03:54,988 --> 02:04:00,419
natural Terps we added like I mean it's

3009
02:03:57,868 --> 02:04:02,880
crazy how how much natural games getting

3010
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:05,190
and the synthetic kind of a reintroduced

3011
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:07,650
game doesn't seem like it's it's it's

3012
02:04:05,189 --> 02:04:09,238
quite as perfected yet and and you can

3013
02:04:07,649 --> 02:04:10,828
usually typically pull it out side by

3014
02:04:09,238 --> 02:04:16,019
side and immediately kind of be like oh

3015
02:04:10,828 --> 02:04:18,569
that's you know not well probably 99.9%

3016
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:20,400
of them don't know their ass from a hole

3017
02:04:18,569 --> 02:04:22,679
in the ground and they're overdoing it

3018
02:04:20,399 --> 02:04:25,229
and they're pouring too much stuff in

3019
02:04:22,679 --> 02:04:25,800
and they don't really understand the

3020
02:04:25,229 --> 02:04:27,569
rules

3021
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:30,449
around combining something back together

3022
02:04:27,569 --> 02:04:33,659
anyway so they're never gonna figure it

3023
02:04:30,449 --> 02:04:36,029
out they're gonna always tip the thing

3024
02:04:33,659 --> 02:04:38,849
and Darrin there's two of you it's just

3025
02:04:36,029 --> 02:04:40,769
means it's twice as good but hey but

3026
02:04:38,850 --> 02:04:42,840
anyway these people will mix these

3027
02:04:40,770 --> 02:04:46,590
things and they're greedy and the greed

3028
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:48,000
is the universal blindfold and yeah I

3029
02:04:46,590 --> 02:04:50,520
don't want to let the cat out of the bag

3030
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,560
but is it can it be done you bet I

3031
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:55,260
already did it and if I want it to I

3032
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:57,840
could I don't want to play that man you

3033
02:04:55,260 --> 02:05:00,449
know that's not it I think we should

3034
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:03,900
have a category being judged there of

3035
02:05:00,449 --> 02:05:06,659
just pure terpenes you know I know when

3036
02:05:03,899 --> 02:05:09,029
Tony when I bumped into him at the cup

3037
02:05:06,659 --> 02:05:10,979
he just wanted to dab the Serbians he

3038
02:05:09,029 --> 02:05:13,259
didn't want any the oil he just stuck in

3039
02:05:10,979 --> 02:05:15,539
and dabbed the terpenes are in fact

3040
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:18,810
about 30 or 40 people just wanted to

3041
02:05:15,539 --> 02:05:20,130
push that's a good call you know I think

3042
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:23,130
I think there's a need actually for that

3043
02:05:20,130 --> 02:05:25,890
I mean there's yeah I know what's the mo

3044
02:05:23,130 --> 02:05:27,900
comping with and even even you know the

3045
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:29,700
Hitman crew I mean I think they hit man

3046
02:05:27,899 --> 02:05:32,399
crew with like chalice and stuff I would

3047
02:05:29,699 --> 02:05:34,109
I need to go back and look but they

3048
02:05:32,399 --> 02:05:36,960
might actually be having a certain

3049
02:05:34,109 --> 02:05:39,839
terpene category this year in their

3050
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:41,250
event in July but you know you know

3051
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:42,420
that's it's it's it's one of the

3052
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:44,369
fascinating things I think a lot of the

3053
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:46,859
really novel innovations within the

3054
02:05:44,369 --> 02:05:48,930
community are kind of almost pushing the

3055
02:05:46,859 --> 02:05:51,569
need for these novel you know unique

3056
02:05:48,930 --> 02:05:53,520
categories to be populated but it's only

3057
02:05:51,569 --> 02:05:55,619
once there's enough of that demand

3058
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:57,630
within the kind of cups or within the

3059
02:05:55,619 --> 02:05:59,069
market or the judging I think that that

3060
02:05:57,630 --> 02:06:00,449
you know begets the need for that we

3061
02:05:59,069 --> 02:06:02,840
created in the event but I mean

3062
02:06:00,449 --> 02:06:04,769
absolutely I think that time is now I

3063
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:07,380
don't think there's anything wrong with

3064
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:10,380
creative concentrates

3065
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:13,980
I mean I've one of my favorite ones is I

3066
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:20,550
could Jack and I make Tony and

3067
02:06:13,979 --> 02:06:24,649
bubbleman's banana star manna goo and I

3068
02:06:20,550 --> 02:06:27,659
mix that with Jack and I put that in my

3069
02:06:24,649 --> 02:06:31,710
dabber and dab it and it's a delightful

3070
02:06:27,659 --> 02:06:34,380
combination man I mean I think you know

3071
02:06:31,710 --> 02:06:37,439
this should be a room for combining

3072
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:39,659
things the terpenes and oils or whatever

3073
02:06:37,439 --> 02:06:41,669
and judging them because there's

3074
02:06:39,658 --> 02:06:44,879
fantastic ones out there you know III

3075
02:06:41,670 --> 02:06:52,829
I'm just in love with some of the stuff

3076
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:54,300
I picked up while I was there but going

3077
02:06:52,829 --> 02:06:56,819
back to what you were saying I like it

3078
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:59,100
was our demand of testing in labs in the

3079
02:06:56,819 --> 02:07:00,719
first place that started you know we

3080
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:04,139
started going in those directions so

3081
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:06,719
right there's a Kassala T of demand you

3082
02:07:04,139 --> 02:07:08,850
know so we can then propagate you know

3083
02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:10,500
that's the reality is that we have to

3084
02:07:08,850 --> 02:07:12,870
spend our hard-earned money and it costs

3085
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:16,260
you know people don't realize how much

3086
02:07:12,869 --> 02:07:19,469
it costs the Emerald cup to test those

3087
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:22,050
800 flowers or the a thousand plus and

3088
02:07:19,469 --> 02:07:24,869
now add then at any type of other

3089
02:07:22,050 --> 02:07:27,750
testing as you know cost you more to do

3090
02:07:24,869 --> 02:07:30,719
which means it costs me more to get done

3091
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:32,639
by you however the more that gets out

3092
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:36,480
there the more the questions that are

3093
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:38,340
asked and get out there and then these

3094
02:07:36,479 --> 02:07:40,619
other laboratories start ring testing

3095
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:44,610
and next thing you know you've got a

3096
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:47,460
community that is well tested and you

3097
02:07:44,609 --> 02:07:50,339
can feel very good about taking those

3098
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:52,710
next steps so that we can add because as

3099
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:54,150
you know just we start off with THC and

3100
02:07:52,710 --> 02:07:56,010
now we're stepping into all these

3101
02:07:54,149 --> 02:08:03,988
complete and other boundaries that are

3102
02:07:56,010 --> 02:08:09,060
opening up even more doorways and know

3103
02:08:03,988 --> 02:08:15,529
your point 3 where you having a little

3104
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:18,739
construction done in their lab so I

3105
02:08:15,529 --> 02:08:21,179
appreciate your point probably because

3106
02:08:18,738 --> 02:08:23,339
you know I think I think not enough

3107
02:08:21,179 --> 02:08:26,730
tribute is given to some of these events

3108
02:08:23,340 --> 02:08:29,190
and and and how much they are actually

3109
02:08:26,729 --> 02:08:31,500
influencing and affecting you know the

3110
02:08:29,189 --> 02:08:34,049
culture and the industry and then and

3111
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:36,840
you know it was until the Emerald cup

3112
02:08:34,050 --> 02:08:39,210
took on its level of burden and testing

3113
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:41,639
and money to do the testing so that they

3114
02:08:39,210 --> 02:08:44,100
could help substantiate their event that

3115
02:08:41,639 --> 02:08:45,960
some of these interesting realizations

3116
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:48,780
about pesticides and extraction

3117
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:49,679
processes and and all this was actually

3118
02:08:48,779 --> 02:08:51,929
even an issue

3119
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:55,078
you know going back a couple years in

3120
02:08:51,929 --> 02:08:58,170
California and I'm you know then kind of

3121
02:08:55,078 --> 02:09:00,299
hitmen crude with shallots and having

3122
02:08:58,170 --> 02:09:01,889
place you know and did something very

3123
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:03,748
similar and I was commitment to doing

3124
02:09:01,889 --> 02:09:05,458
that level of testing to help qualifier

3125
02:09:03,748 --> 02:09:07,618
this bowl of likes apples but in the

3126
02:09:05,458 --> 02:09:09,840
process of people in the sprawl being

3127
02:09:07,618 --> 02:09:12,929
disqualified and and having somewhat a

3128
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:15,150
public shaming you know or Instagram

3129
02:09:12,929 --> 02:09:17,458
trolling of their brand because they

3130
02:09:15,149 --> 02:09:20,279
failed for pesticides in this public

3131
02:09:17,458 --> 02:09:24,498
event you know it since I have so many

3132
02:09:20,279 --> 02:09:27,899
of the for my you know kids incite

3133
02:09:24,498 --> 02:09:29,998
biggest players or biggest kind of you

3134
02:09:27,899 --> 02:09:34,708
know brands within California canvas

3135
02:09:29,998 --> 02:09:36,708
community you know evolve their ways cut

3136
02:09:34,708 --> 02:09:39,389
things out in their program like

3137
02:09:36,708 --> 02:09:41,309
phospholipid master or or certain

3138
02:09:39,389 --> 02:09:42,958
systemic fungicides and pesticides you

3139
02:09:41,309 --> 02:09:45,779
know because they took it so personally

3140
02:09:42,958 --> 02:09:49,260
from failing the mo Cup or failing

3141
02:09:45,779 --> 02:09:51,569
chalice and so I think you know yeah but

3142
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:53,760
not enough for the props is given to you

3143
02:09:51,569 --> 02:09:55,558
know the judges and the people you know

3144
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:57,150
helping with the events pushing the

3145
02:09:55,559 --> 02:09:59,429
boundaries in a lot of ways you know

3146
02:09:57,149 --> 02:10:01,888
that getting people ready for place calm

3147
02:09:59,429 --> 02:10:04,498
with regulation well the emissions the

3148
02:10:01,889 --> 02:10:06,510
people want they they want the truth

3149
02:10:04,498 --> 02:10:08,760
they want to know what they're what

3150
02:10:06,510 --> 02:10:11,039
they're seeing is proper and they want

3151
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:13,139
people to follow the right things and it

3152
02:10:11,038 --> 02:10:15,929
is shown because you've seen a whole

3153
02:10:13,139 --> 02:10:18,239
different sociological experiments crop

3154
02:10:15,929 --> 02:10:21,208
up in our community because of social

3155
02:10:18,238 --> 02:10:23,698
media and testing and failures or

3156
02:10:21,208 --> 02:10:25,769
successes or successes that were

3157
02:10:23,698 --> 02:10:27,988
successes until the tests came out and

3158
02:10:25,769 --> 02:10:29,670
then came that and that they failed then

3159
02:10:27,988 --> 02:10:31,438
those types of public shaming these are

3160
02:10:29,670 --> 02:10:33,179
things that we've never really seen in

3161
02:10:31,439 --> 02:10:36,389
our community because we never had a

3162
02:10:33,179 --> 02:10:39,029
standard there was never a shelf that we

3163
02:10:36,389 --> 02:10:42,118
could say hey that THC is actually that

3164
02:10:39,029 --> 02:10:43,679
so it has changed a discussion it really

3165
02:10:42,118 --> 02:10:46,078
goes back and I got it out forever give

3166
02:10:43,679 --> 02:10:47,609
props to you know the first ones to

3167
02:10:46,078 --> 02:10:51,688
really put out well they were Harborside

3168
02:10:47,609 --> 02:10:54,328
to see an Oakland to really put out THC

3169
02:10:51,689 --> 02:10:55,800
and it caused an initial stir because it

3170
02:10:54,328 --> 02:10:57,268
caused a problem because I started to

3171
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:59,279
see vendors coming my way saying hey

3172
02:10:57,269 --> 02:11:01,769
what I was getting for this amount of

3173
02:10:59,279 --> 02:11:03,779
money for I can't get anymore because

3174
02:11:01,769 --> 02:11:05,820
the testing says it's

3175
02:11:03,779 --> 02:11:07,380
this number down here were in the past

3176
02:11:05,819 --> 02:11:09,420
they were getting in at this amount of

3177
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:11,038
money with no problem at all going off

3178
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:13,109
of their organoleptic which is their

3179
02:11:11,038 --> 02:11:17,189
visual cues etc etcetera they could see

3180
02:11:13,109 --> 02:11:19,319
where as science has literally separated

3181
02:11:17,189 --> 02:11:22,710
the wheat from the chaff because we are

3182
02:11:19,319 --> 02:11:25,979
now have a standard that we can look to

3183
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:28,260
and hold on to and grasp on to and thank

3184
02:11:25,979 --> 02:11:31,408
you for being a pioneer in that and

3185
02:11:28,260 --> 02:11:33,750
thank you for holding yourself to the

3186
02:11:31,408 --> 02:11:39,629
scientific standards so that we can all

3187
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:43,020
rise together equally hey you guys

3188
02:11:39,630 --> 02:11:45,840
posted all your lab test results on the

3189
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:50,550
public board and if you don't would you

3190
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:52,520
consider doing so you know for the last

3191
02:11:50,550 --> 02:11:56,610
few years actually you know we have this

3192
02:11:52,520 --> 02:12:00,599
tested tested button on our website and

3193
02:11:56,609 --> 02:12:02,339
you click that and any dated that client

3194
02:12:00,599 --> 02:12:04,710
had that we worked with or a collective

3195
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:06,809
that we work with have done if they if

3196
02:12:04,710 --> 02:12:09,270
they click and made this animal public

3197
02:12:06,809 --> 02:12:11,090
you know then it was basically viewable

3198
02:12:09,270 --> 02:12:13,770
in this on this aspect of the website

3199
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:15,599
within the last few months for what it's

3200
02:12:13,770 --> 02:12:17,190
worth we temporarily kind of took it

3201
02:12:15,599 --> 02:12:19,409
down until we could figure out a better

3202
02:12:17,189 --> 02:12:21,509
way to do it because what we found is

3203
02:12:19,408 --> 02:12:23,658
there's about there's like three groups

3204
02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:26,130
that were from different parts of like

3205
02:12:23,658 --> 02:12:27,899
United States and one part you know one

3206
02:12:26,130 --> 02:12:30,750
from outside of the country that were

3207
02:12:27,899 --> 02:12:33,988
basically mining or a website and just

3208
02:12:30,750 --> 02:12:36,149
like they had kind of I guess they had

3209
02:12:33,988 --> 02:12:40,439
just like some scripts written to where

3210
02:12:36,149 --> 02:12:43,078
they were basically just taking every

3211
02:12:40,439 --> 02:12:45,118
data point and just mining it from from

3212
02:12:43,078 --> 02:12:46,948
our site had like news trackers that

3213
02:12:45,118 --> 02:12:49,229
were just basically anytime so we make

3214
02:12:46,948 --> 02:12:53,399
us our public there basically be pulling

3215
02:12:49,229 --> 02:12:55,408
the data and and so you know yeah we

3216
02:12:53,399 --> 02:12:57,839
just you know basically took that down

3217
02:12:55,408 --> 02:12:59,698
in an effort to try to reach figure out

3218
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:00,960
how we can long relaunch the public

3219
02:12:59,698 --> 02:13:03,779
display without basically getting

3220
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:05,368
pirated for the data you know because

3221
02:13:03,779 --> 02:13:08,929
for what it's worth I mean that in so

3222
02:13:05,368 --> 02:13:12,359
many ways the data is like not as

3223
02:13:08,929 --> 02:13:14,908
valuable I guess a lot of people think

3224
02:13:12,359 --> 02:13:15,779
you know and and and the project we've

3225
02:13:14,908 --> 02:13:16,559
been working on this turkey

3226
02:13:15,779 --> 02:13:18,929
classification

3227
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:20,940
you know there's gonna be many systems

3228
02:13:18,930 --> 02:13:22,200
that are launched you know there's

3229
02:13:20,939 --> 02:13:24,689
already a couple out there you know

3230
02:13:22,199 --> 02:13:26,849
marquees this is the best there is at

3231
02:13:24,689 --> 02:13:28,619
this point and then you know and we're

3232
02:13:26,850 --> 02:13:30,539
not looking to replace it we're looking

3233
02:13:28,619 --> 02:13:33,659
just at how the system that we can

3234
02:13:30,539 --> 02:13:35,069
basically you know have all our clients

3235
02:13:33,659 --> 02:13:37,559
and people that we work with be able to

3236
02:13:35,069 --> 02:13:39,509
use to better you know further help them

3237
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:45,090
understand and value the data that we

3238
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:47,070
provide you know I love old color

3239
02:13:45,090 --> 02:13:47,670
graphics you had about the terpenes it

3240
02:13:47,069 --> 02:13:49,229
was great

3241
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:50,789
but we were just kind of hoping you were

3242
02:13:49,229 --> 02:13:55,250
gonna bring something like that back

3243
02:13:50,789 --> 02:13:57,810
that is absolutely you know there we are

3244
02:13:55,250 --> 02:14:00,239
taking kind of our current graphic

3245
02:13:57,810 --> 02:14:02,970
displays of terpenes and charts and

3246
02:14:00,239 --> 02:14:05,760
colors and you know launching that to a

3247
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:07,590
new level and a new it Ben should have

3248
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:10,230
that launched in the next couple you

3249
02:14:07,590 --> 02:14:12,470
know in the next month or two with the

3250
02:14:10,229 --> 02:14:15,959
with a turkey classification system and

3251
02:14:12,470 --> 02:14:17,789
hoping that they know colors can help us

3252
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:20,340
to you know to ative ly bring out some

3253
02:14:17,789 --> 02:14:22,859
of these complex kind of serving you

3254
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:24,739
know data points like because it's

3255
02:14:22,859 --> 02:14:27,149
really hard for a lot of subsets of the

3256
02:14:24,739 --> 02:14:28,739
community to you know start to really

3257
02:14:27,149 --> 02:14:30,539
understand that you can be able to

3258
02:14:28,739 --> 02:14:32,130
pronounce choke Emmaline or Bittaker

3259
02:14:30,539 --> 02:14:33,989
awfully mean these different terpenes

3260
02:14:32,130 --> 02:14:37,350
and then let alone kind of understand

3261
02:14:33,989 --> 02:14:39,300
how certain ones might be affecting you

3262
02:14:37,350 --> 02:14:41,640
know working with JC to affect strained

3263
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:43,110
a certain way or another so hopefully

3264
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:45,420
you know what you know this is a means

3265
02:14:43,109 --> 02:14:47,189
to add a little bit more clarity and and

3266
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:49,609
then just you know bring word you don't

3267
02:14:47,189 --> 02:14:52,259
like to the rainbow of effects and and

3268
02:14:49,609 --> 02:14:54,659
variants that cannabis has you know and

3269
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:56,670
also addendum last point of that you

3270
02:14:54,659 --> 02:14:58,260
know to understand how unique certain

3271
02:14:56,670 --> 02:15:00,420
things are because you know whenever

3272
02:14:58,260 --> 02:15:02,880
it's the most strains of cannabis that

3273
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:04,980
we haven't passed through and most of

3274
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:06,900
the groups and so everything there's a

3275
02:15:04,979 --> 02:15:09,419
primary but most of the subgroups within

3276
02:15:06,899 --> 02:15:11,460
you know the nursing class because

3277
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:12,569
that's the biggest in most primary class

3278
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:15,420
you're seeing these things be most

3279
02:15:12,569 --> 02:15:17,460
dominant or and around them but but you

3280
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:19,710
know there's there's other primary group

3281
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:22,649
that has you know a tenth of the total

3282
02:15:19,710 --> 02:15:25,680
data points but is there's enough

3283
02:15:22,649 --> 02:15:28,319
samples to just to signify the need for

3284
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:30,469
its own primary groupings and that's

3285
02:15:28,319 --> 02:15:32,569
alphap I mean you know you vary

3286
02:15:30,469 --> 02:15:44,029
see also finding this dominant routine

3287
02:15:32,569 --> 02:15:45,948
but you know is look we lose ELQ yeah I

3288
02:15:44,029 --> 02:15:48,768
don't you see did we lose yeah I didn't

3289
02:15:45,948 --> 02:15:50,109
catch him oh well I'm sure he'll be back

3290
02:15:48,769 --> 02:15:52,309
in a flash

3291
02:15:50,109 --> 02:15:54,859
yeah you know one of the things I wanted

3292
02:15:52,309 --> 02:15:56,840
to mention was you know we're just okay

3293
02:15:54,859 --> 02:15:58,908
for twenty years or so there's been some

3294
02:15:56,840 --> 02:16:02,420
terpene talk a little bit less thanks to

3295
02:15:58,908 --> 02:16:06,109
Sam and his experiment in early 2000 but

3296
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:08,149
I wonder how you know beta carry off

3297
02:16:06,109 --> 02:16:11,569
Elena's the is the terpene that drug

3298
02:16:08,149 --> 02:16:13,129
dogs are tested for correct well that

3299
02:16:11,569 --> 02:16:14,868
they smell the most or that they test

3300
02:16:13,130 --> 02:16:16,699
for that might I thought they were -

3301
02:16:14,868 --> 02:16:21,198
they were trained with it I thought that

3302
02:16:16,698 --> 02:16:22,879
they trained drug dogs with true okay

3303
02:16:21,198 --> 02:16:24,948
right so I heard this as well so that's

3304
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:26,599
interesting that like probably when most

3305
02:16:24,948 --> 02:16:29,149
people in the cannabis world didn't even

3306
02:16:26,599 --> 02:16:31,069
know what beta carry awfully was somehow

3307
02:16:29,149 --> 02:16:33,709
the police knew what it was and knew to

3308
02:16:31,069 --> 02:16:36,799
trade their truck bugs with it they had

3309
02:16:33,709 --> 02:16:41,750
terpene knowledge before us well that's

3310
02:16:36,799 --> 02:16:43,369
the closed market ethylene Empire and in

3311
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:45,379
those days they probably were only

3312
02:16:43,370 --> 02:16:47,029
measuring I don't know Sam will probably

3313
02:16:45,379 --> 02:16:49,339
tell me I'm wrong on this but I think

3314
02:16:47,029 --> 02:16:54,380
they were only measuring for a few of

3315
02:16:49,340 --> 02:16:57,019
the terpenes by the police labs went to

3316
02:16:54,379 --> 02:16:58,909
the other labs and asked them hey what

3317
02:16:57,019 --> 02:17:01,700
should we look into and they said well

3318
02:16:58,909 --> 02:17:04,549
alpha PI named beta carry alpha Lane

3319
02:17:01,700 --> 02:17:06,790
Leno loop any of those might be good

3320
02:17:04,549 --> 02:17:13,420
candidates because there's a lot of them

3321
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:15,460
present in the 13 count on that but

3322
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:19,638
[Music]

3323
02:17:15,459 --> 02:17:23,978
carry on went blank no worries I'm not

3324
02:17:19,638 --> 02:17:26,598
sure what happened with Alec there a

3325
02:17:23,978 --> 02:17:31,938
little bit Todd said he's out for the

3326
02:17:26,599 --> 02:17:33,439
day and will see us next week with beta

3327
02:17:31,939 --> 02:17:35,059
carry awfully and there you go yeah

3328
02:17:33,439 --> 02:17:36,920
yield extract said we should give all

3329
02:17:35,058 --> 02:17:38,750
the car window washers at the Mexican

3330
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:42,590
border spray bottles with beta carry

3331
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:44,898
awfully yeah

3332
02:17:42,590 --> 02:17:46,880
that was the joke on the ferry here

3333
02:17:44,898 --> 02:17:48,978
actually for some years one year they

3334
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:52,188
just on the BC ferry from the Sunshine

3335
02:17:48,978 --> 02:17:54,558
Coast they did this big thing where they

3336
02:17:52,189 --> 02:17:55,189
just like brought drug dogs on the Conn

3337
02:17:54,558 --> 02:17:57,768
the ferry

3338
02:17:55,189 --> 02:18:00,469
walked through the area and like busted

3339
02:17:57,769 --> 02:18:02,780
a few people with pounds and so the big

3340
02:18:00,468 --> 02:18:05,148
joke was to take you know five gallon

3341
02:18:02,780 --> 02:18:11,389
batches of bubble water and just like

3342
02:18:05,148 --> 02:18:14,148
pour it on your down the ferry floor yet

3343
02:18:11,388 --> 02:18:15,949
dive up by the cop cars with a spray

3344
02:18:14,148 --> 02:18:18,978
bottle roll your window down spray the

3345
02:18:15,950 --> 02:18:21,200
tires on the street side of it and every

3346
02:18:18,978 --> 02:18:23,629
time that the police cars go back in the

3347
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:25,189
compound and the k9 dogs come out to get

3348
02:18:23,629 --> 02:18:28,699
in I'm gonna go [ __ ] nuts over the

3349
02:18:25,189 --> 02:18:30,109
tires on the police cars mmm you know

3350
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:32,359
what I'm just glad to slowly but surely

3351
02:18:30,109 --> 02:18:33,620
be moving away from even having to fit

3352
02:18:32,359 --> 02:18:36,590
like you know you're definitely not

3353
02:18:33,620 --> 02:18:38,389
figuring out valuable like say terpene

3354
02:18:36,590 --> 02:18:40,189
profile and how it interacts with the

3355
02:18:38,388 --> 02:18:42,888
endocannabinoid system and how to like

3356
02:18:40,189 --> 02:18:45,590
put your body better at ease if you're

3357
02:18:42,888 --> 02:18:47,659
focused on how to smuggle how to get

3358
02:18:45,590 --> 02:18:49,969
away from the police how to evade how'd

3359
02:18:47,659 --> 02:18:52,189
it like this is insane court costs

3360
02:18:49,968 --> 02:18:56,108
lawyers like this is these two things

3361
02:18:52,189 --> 02:19:00,739
need to be disconnected forever because

3362
02:18:56,109 --> 02:19:02,659
what's that somebody voted for it I

3363
02:19:00,739 --> 02:19:04,429
don't know I'm not one of those people

3364
02:19:02,659 --> 02:19:06,829
that believes voting actually gets

3365
02:19:04,429 --> 02:19:10,370
anyone into power yeah I think

3366
02:19:06,829 --> 02:19:12,228
politicians believe in the old you can

3367
02:19:10,370 --> 02:19:15,079
fool some of the people some of the time

3368
02:19:12,228 --> 02:19:17,750
you can fool all of the people some of

3369
02:19:15,079 --> 02:19:20,808
the time but they don't like to believe

3370
02:19:17,750 --> 02:19:26,599
in you can't fool all the people all the

3371
02:19:20,808 --> 02:19:29,388
time right well that's the system that

3372
02:19:26,599 --> 02:19:31,728
we seem to be living in anyway well they

3373
02:19:29,388 --> 02:19:33,379
fixed that Sam the way they fix that is

3374
02:19:31,728 --> 02:19:38,808

3396
02:20:37,789 --> 02:20:42,409
to do his best out there on the East

3397
02:20:39,709 --> 02:20:45,168
Coast with the draconian laws that are

3398
02:20:42,408 --> 02:20:47,180
there but I'm hearing that New Jersey

3399
02:20:45,168 --> 02:20:50,568
has a governor somebody running for

3400
02:20:47,180 --> 02:20:52,789
governor against chris Christie who is

3401
02:20:50,568 --> 02:20:55,368
cannabis friendly and this wants to

3402
02:20:52,789 --> 02:20:57,199
legalize cannabis in New Jersey and look

3403
02:20:55,369 --> 02:20:59,989
I went to West Virgina University as

3404
02:20:57,199 --> 02:21:02,060
people used to say it's the New Jersey

3405
02:20:59,988 --> 02:21:04,128
University because it's just far enough

3406
02:21:02,059 --> 02:21:05,208
away for the kids from New Jersey to get

3407
02:21:04,129 --> 02:21:08,119
away from their parents their parents

3408
02:21:05,209 --> 02:21:09,770
couldn't sneak up on them but they could

3409
02:21:08,119 --> 02:21:12,709
all say it was a partying school as well

3410
02:21:09,770 --> 02:21:15,109

jailers it doesn't necessarily have to

3454
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:23,579
be the prisoners that beat him up the

3455
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:27,239
same people who beat people up all the

3456
02:23:23,579 --> 02:23:30,930
time hang them in themselves mysterious

3457
02:23:27,239 --> 02:23:32,789
hangings of course and people die in

3458
02:23:30,930 --> 02:23:35,190
their cells from lack of water not too

3459
02:23:32,790 --> 02:23:37,560
long ago the black guy who was gonna

3460
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:40,530
join Homeland Security it came out that

3461
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:42,750
a pregnant woman died of thirst in his

3462
02:23:40,530 --> 02:23:45,440
jail and so then he said well I'm not

3463

3464
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:52,950
Jesus Ike you could get it in the first

3465
02:23:48,690 --> 02:23:56,460
place and killing people I mean the

3466
02:23:52,950 --> 02:24:00,000
torture State yeah what goes on here in

3467
02:23:56,459 --> 02:24:03,509
this country anymore passes for civility

3468
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:05,790
and we call ourselves civilized and

3469
02:24:03,510 --> 02:24:08,100
Mahatma Gandhi when they asked him what

3470
02:24:05,790 --> 02:24:09,690
do you think about a civilization in

3471
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:12,130
America and he said I think it would be

3472
02:24:09,690 --> 02:24:16,899
a good idea

3473
02:24:12,129 --> 02:24:18,549
and Jesus damn yeah well that's crazy

3474
02:24:16,898 --> 02:24:22,949
that we were talking about New Jersey

3475
02:24:18,549 --> 02:24:24,279
and then that's where young Tosh got

3476
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:26,710
beat

3477
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:27,850
I don't think Mahatma Gandhi ever went

3478
02:24:26,709 --> 02:24:30,959
to America

3479
02:24:27,850 --> 02:24:33,870
I know he went to London and he wasn't

3480
02:24:30,959 --> 02:24:36,938
they they just asked him in an interview

3481
02:24:33,870 --> 02:24:38,500
what he actually what it was was they

3482
02:24:36,939 --> 02:24:41,200
said what do you think about the West

3483
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:43,450
which is claims to be civilized and he

3484
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:45,490
said I think it would be good idea you

3485
02:24:43,450 --> 02:24:47,050
can find it online if you look enough he

3486
02:24:45,489 --> 02:24:50,139
didn't have to come to America to say

3487
02:24:47,049 --> 02:24:55,389
that either by the way I'm sure enough

3488
02:24:50,139 --> 02:24:58,750

a great design pipe shout out to do

3515
02:26:25,898 --> 02:26:30,578
who did the design on the outside and

3516
02:26:27,879 --> 02:26:32,559
yeah Dougie and M do design some good

3517
02:26:30,578 --> 02:26:35,260
pipes and that one hits like a [ __ ]

3518
02:26:32,559 --> 02:26:38,198
champ so I'm glad it's being used all

3519
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:41,859
the time every day includes ten hours a

3520
02:26:38,199 --> 02:26:45,130
day I miss you guys at the cup but I got

3521
02:26:41,859 --> 02:26:46,600
a bottle of terpenes for you guys inside

3522
02:26:45,129 --> 02:26:51,688
that I've been keeping in the freezer

3523
02:26:46,600 --> 02:27:00,760
and I want to later get it because

3524
02:26:51,689 --> 02:27:02,738
everybody tried it so I think it's

3525
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:04,840
pretty good it's always more effective

3526
02:27:02,738 --> 02:27:10,510
to let those who have complimented you

3527
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:11,949
be the ones who complement you I know

3528
02:27:10,510 --> 02:27:13,568
but that's what I'm saying when you blow

3529
02:27:11,949 --> 02:27:15,459
your own horn it sounds like twenty

3530
02:27:13,568 --> 02:27:17,559
percent but if Tony was in here saying

3531
02:27:15,459 --> 02:27:19,989
that you'd get the full hundred percent

3532
02:27:17,559 --> 02:27:25,299
out of the value of that comment I'm

3533
02:27:19,988 --> 02:27:27,340
just saying I got you heard I've invited

3534
02:27:25,299 --> 02:27:29,049
him a bunch of times today I wanted him

3535
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:31,658
to come in for the terpene conversation

3536
02:27:29,049 --> 02:27:33,158
but he's busy I think Sunday's like one

3537
02:27:31,658 --> 02:27:35,109
day he can actually probably get a

3538
02:27:33,158 --> 02:27:37,238
little bit of a rest although I wouldn't

3539
02:27:35,109 --> 02:27:38,680
even be surprised if he's [ __ ] moving

3540
02:27:37,238 --> 02:27:42,100
or doing you know not even in the

3541
02:27:38,680 --> 02:27:45,340
country or something also to you were

3542
02:27:42,100 --> 02:27:50,680
talking about Marcus you were talking

3543
02:27:45,340 --> 02:27:54,430
about you know the effects of minor

3544
02:27:50,680 --> 02:27:56,139
terpenes as on the effect of the major

3545
02:27:54,430 --> 02:28:00,220
terpenes how they're affecting

3546
02:27:56,139 --> 02:28:04,778
cannabinoids and that's absolutely true

3547
02:28:00,219 --> 02:28:07,568
when when I did analysis of scourge

3548
02:28:04,779 --> 02:28:11,408
number one I found over 50 different

3549
02:28:07,568 --> 02:28:15,430
terpenes and there was a few Peaks that

3550
02:28:11,408 --> 02:28:18,189
I didn't wasn't able to ID but so I mean

3551
02:28:15,430 --> 02:28:20,199
that there might have easily been 60

3552
02:28:18,189 --> 02:28:24,850
including minor terpenes

3553
02:28:20,199 --> 02:28:26,260
that's quite a sweet smell there must

3554
02:28:24,850 --> 02:28:28,238
have been certain ones that were just

3555
02:28:26,260 --> 02:28:30,609
constantly there or was it more in the

3556
02:28:28,238 --> 02:28:31,988
cannabinoid spikes because I remember

3557
02:28:30,609 --> 02:28:34,988
you saying in the past that you were

3558
02:28:31,988 --> 02:28:36,818
able to sort of distinguish by seeing a

3559
02:28:34,988 --> 02:28:39,189
GC test of something whether it had

3560
02:28:36,818 --> 02:28:42,519
system that's because

3561
02:28:39,189 --> 02:28:48,279
had a particular profile it was I am

3562
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:51,699
mayor scene Lima lean and I don't know

3563
02:28:48,279 --> 02:28:55,390
if everyone else right now but and you

3564
02:28:51,699 --> 02:28:59,078
could very easily if you had a DC of a

3565
02:28:55,389 --> 02:29:02,828
tie and the GC of a skunk and the GC of

3566
02:28:59,078 --> 02:29:06,309
an Afghan and then you crossed them eat

3567
02:29:02,828 --> 02:29:09,728
in some way the offspring you could

3568
02:29:06,309 --> 02:29:12,158
easily easily tell what families they

3569
02:29:09,728 --> 02:29:15,549
were originating from what progeny they

3570
02:29:12,158 --> 02:29:19,930
were grown because the profiles of the

3571
02:29:15,549 --> 02:29:22,389
GC dispelled it out really clearly well

3572
02:29:19,930 --> 02:29:24,369
if you on the test that I had done the

3573
02:29:22,389 --> 02:29:30,818
things that were in there in greater

3574
02:29:24,369 --> 02:29:33,609
quantity was alpha pi name my scene a

3575
02:29:30,818 --> 02:29:36,519
little beta beta Kari awfully and by the

3576
02:29:33,609 --> 02:29:38,619
way pronouncing these things I found the

3577
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:40,149
key to it is simply get a clothespin and

3578
02:29:38,619 --> 02:29:46,149
put it on your bottom lip and you can

3579
02:29:40,148 --> 02:29:47,889
pronounce them correctly mmm all good

3580
02:29:46,148 --> 02:29:51,488
questions guild extracts we'll have to

3581
02:29:47,889 --> 02:29:52,958
get him in here next next week he's got

3582
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:55,600
lots of good things to say he's talking

3583
02:29:52,959 --> 02:29:58,180
about how we can you know discover

3584
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:59,680
different pesticides and terpenes

3585
02:29:58,180 --> 02:30:01,630
peaking at the same time as some

3586
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:02,309
pesticides and giving false positive

3587
02:30:01,629 --> 02:30:04,778
negatives

3588
02:30:02,309 --> 02:30:06,430
fortunately Alex no longer here we

3589
02:30:04,779 --> 02:30:08,498
didn't get marks skull dome today so

3590
02:30:06,430 --> 02:30:10,809
I'll try to line up Alec again get

3591
02:30:08,498 --> 02:30:14,949
killed in the room have mark maybe get

3592
02:30:10,809 --> 02:30:16,328
chimera and have a nice good longer

3593
02:30:14,949 --> 02:30:19,869
conversation about these particular

3594
02:30:16,328 --> 02:30:23,439
things for sure it's definitely a point

3595
02:30:19,869 --> 02:30:26,560
of interest you know as well forward a

3596
02:30:23,439 --> 02:30:29,770
little work we've been doing is the

3597
02:30:26,559 --> 02:30:33,448
silicon gel filter properly configured

3598
02:30:29,770 --> 02:30:38,189
in the extraction unit will pull

3599
02:30:33,449 --> 02:30:38,189
insecticides out of the extraction

3600
02:30:43,579 --> 02:30:51,751
excellent I'm not sure if that's a good

3601
02:30:48,931 --> 02:31:00,601
thing that you're cleaning up extract

3602
02:30:51,751 --> 02:31:02,159
with insecticides part of that game what

3603
02:31:00,601 --> 02:31:06,870
the [ __ ] are they put new check beside

3604
02:31:02,159 --> 02:31:09,390
target well I look I just am mentioning

3605
02:31:06,870 --> 02:31:12,511
it because it's a fact

3606
02:31:09,390 --> 02:31:15,060
I'm not advertising we have it within

3607
02:31:12,511 --> 02:31:17,579
our system which goes unnamed and

3608
02:31:15,060 --> 02:31:20,819
unmentioned hereabouts anyway but I

3609
02:31:17,579 --> 02:31:23,550
discovered that that does that and so I

3610
02:31:20,819 --> 02:31:25,860
always say to people well you before you

3611
02:31:23,550 --> 02:31:27,479
extract you should have the stuff tested

3612
02:31:25,860 --> 02:31:29,909
so you know whether or not you have to

3613
02:31:27,479 --> 02:31:33,329
defeat like the site or not because I

3614
02:31:29,909 --> 02:31:35,700
wouldn't do it as a regular thing and I

3615
02:31:33,329 --> 02:31:38,220
wouldn't advertise that you should do it

3616
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:40,079
as a regular thing people should start

3617
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:41,609
testing from the moment the plant comes

3618
02:31:40,079 --> 02:31:43,771
out of the ground or it gets harvested

3619
02:31:41,610 --> 02:31:46,051
you know by the time it gets to the

3620
02:31:43,771 --> 02:31:47,820
concentrate maker it should already have

3621
02:31:46,050 --> 02:31:49,710
a clean bill of health because

3622
02:31:47,819 --> 02:31:51,829
everything that goes to the concentrate

3623
02:31:49,710 --> 02:31:56,010
Metro will do exactly what that says

3624
02:31:51,829 --> 02:31:57,810
concentrated that is how it works

3625
02:31:56,011 --> 02:31:59,790
concentrate the good with the bad

3626
02:31:57,810 --> 02:32:01,649
unfortunately best to make sure that he

3627
02:31:59,790 --> 02:32:03,961
just got the good in the first place

3628
02:32:01,649 --> 02:32:06,149
have a little bit of integrity have a

3629
02:32:03,960 --> 02:32:08,340
lot of integrity actually have a lot of

3630
02:32:06,149 --> 02:32:10,109
integrity it's worth it

3631
02:32:08,341 --> 02:32:12,780
it doesn't affect quality it doesn't

3632
02:32:10,110 --> 02:32:18,631
affect quality like integrity does not

3633
02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:20,251
infect a new way it just you spray it on

3634
02:32:18,630 --> 02:32:22,739
it's really fast

3635
02:32:20,251 --> 02:32:24,001
oh nice like just that at the end of

3636
02:32:22,739 --> 02:32:31,921
flowering you just spray it everywhere

3637
02:32:24,001 --> 02:32:33,181
yeah you spray it everywhere I don't

3638
02:32:31,921 --> 02:32:35,819
even know we're just being sometimes

3639
02:32:33,181 --> 02:32:37,739
Sam's humor will just I don't even

3640
02:32:35,819 --> 02:32:41,520
understand it but I laugh anyway cuz

3641
02:32:37,739 --> 02:32:45,329
it's funny though and I don't understand

3642
02:32:41,521 --> 02:32:47,641
it always alien humor it's alien humor

3643
02:32:45,329 --> 02:32:50,671
for certain we're definitely an alien I

3644
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:56,159
would say that much it's a lovely Sunday

3645
02:32:50,671 --> 02:32:59,398
afternoon maybe maybe that's humor of

3646
02:32:56,159 --> 02:33:03,319
off on him to say some of these things I

3647
02:32:59,398 --> 02:33:07,289
know that jokes are decidedly different

3648
02:33:03,319 --> 02:33:10,439
some of the world's top comics are from

3649
02:33:07,290 --> 02:33:15,750
Holland oh wait no they're not make

3650
02:33:10,439 --> 02:33:17,819
Canada I don't know I think we have like

3651
02:33:15,750 --> 02:33:22,439
I don't think we're the funniest I think

3652
02:33:17,819 --> 02:33:24,299
we got a few we got we got a few yeah a

3653
02:33:22,439 --> 02:33:30,710
lot man there's a ton of funny people

3654
02:33:24,299 --> 02:33:33,898
from Canada yourself included John Candy

3655
02:33:30,709 --> 02:33:35,239
he was pretty funny John Candy Jim

3656
02:33:33,898 --> 02:33:39,989
Carrey

3657
02:33:35,239 --> 02:33:42,289
he's just a piloto Mike Meyers Mike

3658
02:33:39,989 --> 02:33:42,289
Meyers

3659
02:33:42,409 --> 02:33:46,799
anyway proportionately Canada comes up

3660
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:48,960
with more funny people than they do here

3661
02:33:46,799 --> 02:33:50,938
in the USA they're funny people they

3662
02:33:48,959 --> 02:33:59,000
come up here in the USA are people like

3663
02:33:50,939 --> 02:34:01,739
Jeff Sessions who recently lauded the

3664
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:04,770
Filipino dorte a guy who's been killing

3665
02:34:01,739 --> 02:34:08,780
people like crazy doing sessions Laden

3666
02:34:04,770 --> 02:34:12,720
his efforts to clean up the Philippines

3667
02:34:08,780 --> 02:34:14,579
Jesus that's [ __ ] ominous man yeah

3668
02:34:12,719 --> 02:34:18,170
it's not too good when you got someone

3669
02:34:14,579 --> 02:34:24,209
like basically going for the mass murder

3670
02:34:18,170 --> 02:34:26,219
record and then you did it it's pretty

3671
02:34:24,209 --> 02:34:28,500
pretty crazy that was some disturbing

3672
02:34:26,219 --> 02:34:30,799
imagery that came out of that of people

3673
02:34:28,500 --> 02:34:33,659
just getting blown away on the streets

3674
02:34:30,799 --> 02:34:39,359
that's that's a level of prohibition

3675
02:34:33,659 --> 02:34:40,709
that Wow I mean holy might even have

3676
02:34:39,360 --> 02:34:42,329
been drug users

3677
02:34:40,709 --> 02:34:43,919
you know you've spoiled when you're

3678
02:34:42,329 --> 02:34:46,110
worried about like what's written in the

3679
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:47,728
proposition or the latest release of the

3680
02:34:46,110 --> 02:34:50,390
federal licensing and people are

3681
02:34:47,728 --> 02:34:52,799
literally getting like shot in the back

3682
02:34:50,389 --> 02:34:55,889
did you know that the Philippines

3683
02:34:52,799 --> 02:34:58,769
legalized medical marijuana at the same

3684
02:34:55,889 --> 02:35:00,869
time I did indeed hear that I remember

3685
02:34:58,770 --> 02:35:02,520
hearing a friend of mine saying that he

3686
02:35:00,870 --> 02:35:07,399
was gonna be going there for a meeting

3687
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:08,579
and I said what now I said what now

3688
02:35:07,398 --> 02:35:10,379
thanks

3689
02:35:08,579 --> 02:35:12,539
I sure wouldn't be going for that

3690
02:35:10,379 --> 02:35:14,879
meeting I'll tell you I'll stick with

3691
02:35:12,540 --> 02:35:16,380
Jamaica you know what even when it was

3692
02:35:14,879 --> 02:35:18,059
illegal and they were bashing them over

3693
02:35:16,379 --> 02:35:20,478
the skulls they were still fighting for

3694
02:35:18,059 --> 02:35:23,189
it those are my people

3695
02:35:20,478 --> 02:35:25,318
hey didn't they just the Chinese just

3696
02:35:23,189 --> 02:35:27,389
built about a twenty billion dollar new

3697
02:35:25,318 --> 02:35:29,309
highway system in Jamaica Oh

3698
02:35:27,389 --> 02:35:32,389
the Chinese are always building crazy

3699
02:35:29,309 --> 02:35:34,500
highway systems in Jamaica they they

3700
02:35:32,389 --> 02:35:35,818
yeah they definitely I don't know how

3701
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:38,818
much they spent on it but there's

3702
02:35:35,818 --> 02:35:41,068
definitely one that goes from like close

3703
02:35:38,818 --> 02:35:43,170
to Kingston like all the way into ochi

3704
02:35:41,068 --> 02:35:44,969
and it's quick compared to how it used

3705
02:35:43,170 --> 02:35:46,859
to be I have to do this real crazy thing

3706
02:35:44,969 --> 02:35:49,170
and in fact Joe and I can tell you a

3707
02:35:46,859 --> 02:35:51,829
story that while Tony and I were driving

3708
02:35:49,170 --> 02:35:55,680
with our partners from Kingston to a

3709
02:35:51,829 --> 02:35:57,209
property just passed Oh Jose Rios we

3710
02:35:55,680 --> 02:36:00,420
ended up on that Highway late at night

3711
02:35:57,209 --> 02:36:02,728
and we ended up getting to a point where

3712
02:36:00,420 --> 02:36:04,409
it was blocked off there was a guy

3713
02:36:02,728 --> 02:36:07,739
standing there like a flag guy and it

3714
02:36:04,409 --> 02:36:09,478
was late like dark late and so we pull

3715
02:36:07,739 --> 02:36:10,949
up and we're like I'm like damn we're

3716
02:36:09,478 --> 02:36:12,809
gonna have to go back this is gonna be

3717
02:36:10,950 --> 02:36:15,180
so long and Tony and I are kind of

3718
02:36:12,809 --> 02:36:17,250
huffing and puffing a bit and our

3719
02:36:15,180 --> 02:36:18,840
partners like don't worry he gets out he

3720
02:36:17,250 --> 02:36:21,689
kind of pays this guy off a little bit

3721
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:24,420
the guy moves the the cone and we drive

3722
02:36:21,689 --> 02:36:26,489
through this like rubble and worked like

3723
02:36:24,420 --> 02:36:29,000
fully under construction highway we're

3724
02:36:26,489 --> 02:36:31,409
now driving through the construction

3725
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:33,600
driving driving driving for about 20

3726
02:36:31,409 --> 02:36:35,579
minutes and we end up at a dead end it's

3727
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:37,800
all rubble and this little car we're in

3728
02:36:35,579 --> 02:36:40,680
can't drive over the rubble maybe a big

3729
02:36:37,799 --> 02:36:43,318
truck could but the car can't so we so

3730
02:36:40,680 --> 02:36:45,750
we try to figure out turning around we

3731
02:36:43,318 --> 02:36:47,818
go back to where the flag guy is and my

3732
02:36:45,750 --> 02:36:51,540
business partner who's driving the car

3733
02:36:47,818 --> 02:36:53,279
basically does a u-turn on to the other

3734
02:36:51,540 --> 02:36:57,450
side of the highway which is the wrong

3735
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:59,280
side of the highway and we drive the

3736
02:36:57,450 --> 02:37:01,380
rest of the way down the wrong side of

3737
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:05,120
the highway going like a hundred and 20

3738
02:37:01,379 --> 02:37:08,250
kilometers an hour it was definitely a

3739
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:10,829
pretty wild experience that was before

3740
02:37:08,250 --> 02:37:11,219
that highway got finished it was it was

3741
02:37:10,829 --> 02:37:18,329
nuts

3742
02:37:11,219 --> 02:37:19,709
I went on once Sally it was they recall

3743
02:37:18,329 --> 02:37:21,059
me they were just like listen it's not a

3744
02:37:19,709 --> 02:37:21,810
problem and in the end it really wasn't

3745
02:37:21,059 --> 02:37:23,189
but we did

3746
02:37:21,810 --> 02:37:25,171
understand that we were kind of like

3747
02:37:23,190 --> 02:37:27,751
this seems like this is a problem like

3748
02:37:25,171 --> 02:37:29,220
I'm sorry but going down the highway the

3749
02:37:27,751 --> 02:37:31,710
wrong way but you know what lo and

3750
02:37:29,220 --> 02:37:33,770
behold they were right and they got us

3751
02:37:31,710 --> 02:37:37,590
there totally safety safely without any

3752
02:37:33,771 --> 02:37:38,311
weird experiences but holy [ __ ] that was

3753
02:37:37,591 --> 02:37:41,131
insane

3754
02:37:38,310 --> 02:37:45,149
only in Jamaica I loved Jamaica honestly

3755
02:37:41,130 --> 02:37:47,819
I loved Jamaica can you take taxis for

3756
02:37:45,149 --> 02:37:50,729
super long distance rides there KP

3757
02:37:47,819 --> 02:37:53,011
oh yeah well any car will be a taxi and

3758
02:37:50,729 --> 02:37:54,689
it's just a matter of knowing the prices

3759
02:37:53,011 --> 02:37:57,181
because obviously if you're just a

3760
02:37:54,690 --> 02:37:59,280
tourist well then that's a you know

3761
02:37:57,181 --> 02:38:01,560
you're a valuable opportunity for people

3762
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:03,091
who don't make a lot of money to maybe

3763
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:05,610
make a little bit of money off of you

3764
02:38:03,091 --> 02:38:07,800
because that's that's what tourism is in

3765
02:38:05,610 --> 02:38:09,511
Jamaica it's extremely uh I think it's

3766
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:13,109
one of them the biggest ways that money

3767
02:38:09,511 --> 02:38:14,700
comes to the island so you'd have to

3768
02:38:13,110 --> 02:38:16,921
probably be there for a while and really

3769
02:38:14,700 --> 02:38:20,101
understand how to jump into a cab and

3770
02:38:16,921 --> 02:38:23,729
just go like you know an hour and a half

3771
02:38:20,101 --> 02:38:26,610
up the road or whatever for a few bucks

3772
02:38:23,729 --> 02:38:30,751
hey did you see the new IAC M that came

3773
02:38:26,610 --> 02:38:36,329
out today about CBD reduces blood

3774
02:38:30,751 --> 02:38:39,091
pressure and healthy people I I

3775
02:38:36,329 --> 02:38:41,130
swallowed two huge capsules of it every

3776
02:38:39,091 --> 02:38:43,261
single day I've been doing that for

3777
02:38:41,130 --> 02:38:46,260
about seven months now and my blood

3778
02:38:43,261 --> 02:38:49,530
pressure I used to be on four blood

3779
02:38:46,261 --> 02:38:51,301
pressure medicines because my atrium is

3780
02:38:49,530 --> 02:38:53,610
enlarged and I have an enlarged heart

3781
02:38:51,300 --> 02:38:56,489
and now I'm down to two plus an

3782
02:38:53,610 --> 02:39:00,329
occasional other one and I can tell you

3783
02:38:56,489 --> 02:39:03,841
that the only real thing that constantly

3784
02:39:00,329 --> 02:39:07,171
consuming CBD though I'm I'm all with

3785
02:39:03,841 --> 02:39:08,700
that particular study I believe in it

3786
02:39:07,171 --> 02:39:11,159
but well the great

3787
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:13,980
it's Oxford it's not just anyone this is

3788
02:39:11,159 --> 02:39:14,851
that done at Oxford so this is not not

3789
02:39:13,979 --> 02:39:17,430
messing around

3790
02:39:14,851 --> 02:39:19,409
so his well my study of nine healthy

3791
02:39:17,431 --> 02:39:21,421
male volunteers a single dose of six

3792
02:39:19,409 --> 02:39:22,619
hundred milligrams of CBD significantly

3793
02:39:21,421 --> 02:39:25,140
reduced blood pressure

3794
02:39:22,620 --> 02:39:29,761
researchers at Nottingham and Oxford

3795
02:39:25,140 --> 02:39:33,690
discovered I did this one in my own ass

3796
02:39:29,761 --> 02:39:34,950
which is even more important to me than

3797
02:39:33,690 --> 02:39:36,870
Oxford

3798
02:39:34,950 --> 02:39:46,670
understand this is for the other people

3799
02:39:36,870 --> 02:39:54,391
not your ass thank you first you know

3800
02:39:46,670 --> 02:40:05,101
literally backing it up my entire body

3801
02:39:54,390 --> 02:40:07,739
but okay yes sorry I yeah I'm a firm

3802
02:40:05,101 --> 02:40:11,521
believer in human lower humour lowers

3803
02:40:07,739 --> 02:40:13,560
your blood pressure as well alright

3804
02:40:11,521 --> 02:40:15,840
update on Tasha's son from young

3805
02:40:13,560 --> 02:40:17,729
visionary in 1985 he says he's been in a

3806
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:19,409
coma for four months was attacked by

3807
02:40:17,729 --> 02:40:21,560
another inmate he was in jail for having

3808
02:40:19,409 --> 02:40:26,899
65 pounds in his trunk

3809
02:40:21,560 --> 02:40:30,750
supposedly in 2013 supposedly supposedly

3810
02:40:26,899 --> 02:40:32,819
damn that sucks I'm bummed out for the

3811
02:40:30,750 --> 02:40:36,351
65 pounds and I am bummed out that he

3812
02:40:32,819 --> 02:40:39,181
had to spend even a day in jail for that

3813
02:40:36,351 --> 02:40:41,101
Florist you know imagine if that was 65

3814
02:40:39,181 --> 02:40:46,860
pounds of roses how absurd that would

3815
02:40:41,101 --> 02:40:49,521
sound i if the cops turned in 65 pounds

3816
02:40:46,860 --> 02:40:53,250
I wonder how much was accident there

3817
02:40:49,521 --> 02:40:55,891
I've never seen them do anything honest

3818
02:40:53,250 --> 02:40:59,219
with regards to seizing pot and

3819
02:40:55,890 --> 02:41:03,529
arresting somebody yet and I don't think

3820
02:40:59,219 --> 02:41:03,529
I don't expect them

3821
02:41:05,360 --> 02:41:09,900
true-true well you know what I'm telling

3822
02:41:08,069 --> 02:41:11,789

3832
02:41:33,299 --> 02:41:37,319
