Hey guys, welcome to Bowman's World. Um

3
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,160
today we're heading downtown and we're

4
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,839
going to go meet up with um well

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,278
hopefully we'll see Dana Larson from

6
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:34,238
Sensible BC and Original Cannabis

7
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:36,079
Culturer. Um we will see maybe Jody and

8
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,000
Jeremiah down at Pot TV along with

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,079
Marijuana Man. I'm definitely going to

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,399
be seeing Matt the Great Gardener and

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,799
John Burfellow. Uh we were supposed to

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,799
maybe do a little bit of a show on Paw

13
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,558
TV with Jeremiah there, but today I

14
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,959
wanted to actually talk to you guys a

15
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,599
little bit about, you know, we show you

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,160
a lot of this uh the main stuff with how

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,079
the the cannabis is grown, how it's

18
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,558
processed, how the hash is made, how the

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,719
hash is cleaned, but I've never really

20
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,558
shown you a simple thing like how do I

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,879
get the hash back to the great gardener

22
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:10,079
without it turning into a giant puck of

23
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:12,798
grease. So, this is how ridiculous you

24
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,280
got to roll when you're rolling with

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,880
full melt dry sift, particularly of the

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,519
caliber of the great gardener um full

27
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,679
melt dry sift, which

28
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:26,239
is it's insane. It's just so greasy. You

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,600
literally have to do this. So, I have

30
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:32,239
multiple ice

31
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:34,478
packs. I have the three containers. Um

32
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,000
the seconds's on top, the first on the

33
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,000
bottom, and this is I guess what you

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,159
call thirds. couple of different grades

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,719
and then a a cooking grade. I've got

36
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,118
another giant thing of ice here and I've

37
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,519
got an ice pack that it's all sitting on

38
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,159
and it's inside a cooler. So, this is

39
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,280
what you have to do if you want to hope

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,719
to have a chance on on getting I want to

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,200
be able to give this to Matt and I want

42
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,158
it to be powder, perfect powder. I don't

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,320
want it to be all clumped up and greasy

44
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,680
and I just prefer it like that. So, this

45
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,679
is what you got to do. Get yourself a

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,360
cooler. Get yourself some ice packs.

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,679
Make sure you get that sift into a

48
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,598
container that's sealed in every way.

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,759
You don't want any moisture getting into

50
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,759
your dry sift. One of the great things

51
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,280
about dry sift is you don't have to dry

52
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,759
it. So, it would be a shame to get

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,120
moisture uh in your dry sift and then be

54
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,799
forced to dry it.

55
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,280
So, on that note, I think we're going to

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,480
have a dail rib. Got a tiny bit of the

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,719
barb dry sift here.

58
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,799
Just rolled it into kind of a little

59
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:41,400
puck. Should be able to dab that quite

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,280
nicely. Little mini hit

61
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,280
there. Hitting it through the D- nail.

62
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:18,959
Very nice. So, we'll clean that dabber

63
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:20,719
up and we'll hit a little of the Astro

64
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,519
Boy fresh frozen that John and I made

65
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,000
the other day. I think that's always in

66
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,439
order. Nice little Astro Boy Chaser to

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,199
my 99% barb dry sift

68
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,280
rip. I was able to go out into town the

69
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,479
other day and just give a few key

70
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,519
friends um a taste of this. My my friend

71
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:44,158

74
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,840
got to share with John B.

75
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:14,400
Oh, yeah.

76
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,399
Anyway, I'm going to head downtown and

77
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,239
we'll catch up with you guys down there.

78
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,918
Peace. All right. I've just arrived down

79
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,279

How's it going? Yo, I showed up. You

101
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,879
did, Jeremiah. We got quite the [ __ ]

102
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,720
show today, too. Are you working hard? I

103
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,319
am working hard. You're [ __ ] right,

104
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
dude. I'm working damn hard. It's good

105
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,280
to see. I see the on the phone with Mr.

106
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,120
Enrico Buchard. How's Enrico doing? He's

107
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,559
going to call in the show live from jail

108
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,800
today. Yeah, he's doing okay. Um they're

109
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,160
not the bail's high. Uh well, he hasn't

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:46,560
had that hearing yet, but um they have

111
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,039
uh put the charges on him for seeds.

112
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,600
Now, they're saying basically that he

113
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,839
sold a couple packs of seeds to an

114
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,800
undercover officer and he also sold a

115
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,318
couple packs to see of seeds to these

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,478
people who started this grow operation

117
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,639
apparently. Jeez. And that's how they

118
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,359
got him. And now he Enrio isn't a seed

119
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,280
seller. He's the inventor of the

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,038
sublimator. He has a restaurant. Um the

121
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,399
seed thing was just that a friend called

122
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,800
him and was wondering if he could get

123
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,279
some seeds for these people and he just

124
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,598
did a favor. Got the friend was a narc.

125
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,279
The friend I guess somebody narked and

126
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:22,719
there was an undercover officer involved

127
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:25,198
somehow and uh and somehow Enrico got it

128
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,120
all pinned on him, dude. That he was

129
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,759
selling seeds to this big grow

130
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,280
operation. And but Enrico beforehand had

131
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,038
had verified that they were medical

132
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,239
patients that they were using this for

133
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:35,680
their sickness. They were going to

134
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,519
supposedly to take it home and grow it

135
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,959
in their own garden. It wasn't meant to

136
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,478
be some big grow operation where people

137
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,000
were selling it. So he's going to call

138
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,120
in while we're on the show. Call during

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,279
the show. Now the crazy thing is that uh

140
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,598
they've been using our video that we

141
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,359
shot on Paw TV of Enrico in the Strain

142
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,240
Hunters vehicle and stuff like playing

143
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,840
it on the TV. Yeah. And so this seems

144
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,199
like kind of one of those things, you

145
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,279
know, why do people when do the cops

146
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,919
ever go after seed dealers? There's sea

147
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,279
companies on every [ __ ] block. We I

148
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,719
have there's like several sea companies

149
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,559
out here on the street right in front of

150
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,080
us here. Yeah. I always think that it's

151
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,680
a specific thing, right? It probably

152
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,000
fell right into their lap and then they

153
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,400
decided, well, let's just uh let's get

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,800
80 different cops to work on this for

155
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,439
the next 6 months. We'll spend like, you

156
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,439
know, like 400k. Exactly. And uh we'll

157
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,279
make a big news story. And that's really

158
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,120
what it is. And Enrico happens to be a

159
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,239
guy who's gaining some notoriety in the

160
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,918
pop movement. He's probably becoming

161
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,759
more popular out there in Quebec. His

162
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,198
name's making it around. You know, they

163
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,440

167
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:44,158
this is I was told this is uh what is

168
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,479

169
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,000
the bud. And I have a little bit of

170
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,320
butter that was given to me as a gift

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,278
sprinkled on top. Rip it up. Boom.

172
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,278

176
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,720
BCMP, the vapor lounge here, and bumped

177
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,360
into Melwin, who uh was at the booth at

178
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,360
420, and he's got his buddy Johnny here,

179
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,519
and uh Sarah, who's hiding kind of

180
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,959
behind him there. There we all are.

181
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,480
We're about to do some D nail rips,

182
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:26,359
guys. It's got a nice

183
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,320
clean tattoo. Yeah. Straight

184
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,320
fab that you may have thought was

185
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,000
remove. Let's clean this. You get lazy

186
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,040
with the Gmail on the cleaning of the

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,278
piece. Yeah.

188
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,759
Today I just thought that's nasty. You

189
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,919
can't take that out. It's always nice to

190
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,240
have clean piece.

191
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,159
That's what I'm saying. So, first up,

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,759
bit. Peace. So, look who just got here.

237
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,519
Mr. Matt is in the house. The great

238
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,319
gardener. What's up, everybody? How's it

239
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,078
going? And my responsibility is almost

240
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,399
complete. Uh-huh. I'll tell you, people

241
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,559
have no idea about this aspect, how

242
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,799
ridiculous this is. It is ridiculous. I

243
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,518
showed them earlier on the the start

244
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,159
part of this video of how many ice packs

245
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,519
I had to put into

246
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:45,759
here to keep this

247
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,839
hash from greasing up. I only have two

248
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,759
ice packs. I'm going have to borrow one.

249
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,800
Yeah, these are the ice packs that I

250
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:56,159
brought knowing that the grease up

251
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:58,319
factor within 5 minutes happened. It's

252
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,240
really that one that you're that you're

253
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,959
going to want to be. Uh Although I'd be

254
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,560
surprised if it was

255
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,278
nice. I did things a little bit

256
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:12,479
differently this time. So I got less

257
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:14,958
seconds and it's nicer.

258
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,959
And then

259
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:22,320
surprisingly lost gets to get lost.

260
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,278
Yeah, it's pretty nice. I couldn't

261
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,480
believe it personally.

262
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,799
So yeah, while while the one is out,

263
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,200
just put it in into the ice. It's just

264
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,278
that easy because it really is just a

265
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,600
moment of getting nice and stone. Oh,

266
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,439
let's do a rib sitting out there. The

267
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,360
sun shifts, comes through, the shade

268
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,720
goes away, the sun beats on it for like

269
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,560
18 seconds. It's a brick block. It's

270
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
never you're never going to be There's

271
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,518
something nice about the way he's

272
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,039
shaking it right now. It's just moving

273
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,560
around. This is the way this is the way

274
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,799
I wish all the people in Spain and all

275
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,479
over the place when I when I have it. I

276
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,799
always talk I wish you guys could come

277
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,240
here and experience it when it's in

278
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,919
powder form. This

279
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,440
is right and we're doing everything we

280
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:13,838
can to invent ways of getting that

281
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:18,160
getting it powder form out to the world.

282
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:21,519
Um the numbers um it was about 135 g

283
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:26,078
when this tub was full and I cleaned it

284
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:31,600
and I cleaned uh 23 g of seconds. I

285
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:37,759
cleaned 40 g of thirds and I cleaned 66

286
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:41,120
g or 66.7 g of first you know 99% head.

287
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:44,720
So that ratio is 50%. So, that was some

288
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,720
pretty clean sit that was already 50%

289
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,800
heads before I got a hold of it. So, I

290
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,959
cleaned out 50% of that material. And

291
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:56,000
now, uh now Barbara is truly able to

292
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:58,719
show her quality when she's combined

293
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,360
with with the proper purity. Oh, the

294
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:06,079
flavors. It's the fl It's the flavor.

295
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:09,120
Even the smell. My whole house reeks

296
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,278
like bar 99% right now. And I was being

297
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,039
religious about like keeping it cool and

298
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,958
going into the freezer right away. And

299
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,879
in fact, my whole freezer also smells

300
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,799
like 99%.

301
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,278
It's pretty awesome. I would get It's

302
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,319
going to be great. A colder freezer for

303
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,519
that. Oh, no. It lives like in Yeah, it

304
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,680
literally But I mean, at certain

305
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,480
temperatures like 3 or whatever, I swear

306
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:33,078
to God, you can still smell it. You can

307
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,440
still smell the tarpen evaporating at

308
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:39,198
minus4. Can I roll a couple? Those are

309
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,360
some volatile oils. Of course.

310
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,599
You want the ice?

311
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,600
My backpack.

312
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,679
Yeah, makes sense. You want that, too?

313
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,440
Pack it up for travel.

doctor's prescriptions and how they're

407

educating doctors across Canada to

408
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,798
prescribe cannabis for different

409
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,320
conditions and stuff like that, which

410
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:18,480
was a good show. Talked about champs,

411
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,359
talked about Enrico.

412
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,679
Yeah, poor guy getting messed up with a

413
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,798
bunch of [ __ ] Yeah, we've all been

414
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,960
there.

415
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:31,798
Maybe not. Maybe not in that

416
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:34,960
level. Yeah,

417
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:38,480
but what are we hitting there? Um,

418
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,200
whatever it is, he left me none. He took

419
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,640
it all. It was a tiny little rip. Wow.

420
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,240
But I have a whole other jar of hash for

421
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,520
John. See, he left me the

422
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,839
best. I never mess around when it comes

423
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,079
to John. In fact, how is the hash that I

424
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,399
uh gave you last time? Is it still I

425
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,399
actually after you know he's like here

426
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,919
I'll give you a little bit of hash and I

427
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,120
had a good story. He filled up the

428
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,880
container like really it was nice. It

429
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,719
lasted me like a month and everybody

430
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,400
knows how much I puffed. So there's

431
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,960
actually hash left in here. Totally.

432
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,960
What are you talking about? It was just

433
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,880
like you're

434
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,798
silly. You

435
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,960
know. So I'm going to heat up this side.

436
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:23,119
Yes. And I

437
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,038
will help dab a friend up. Oh, that's a

438
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,759
very nice thing. We drove around the

439
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,359
block here for about a couple of rounds

440
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,759
before we realized there's some huge

441
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,240
movie or TV show filming and they've

442
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:37,200
literally got every parking spot blocked

443
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,720
off as not a parking spot right now. For

444
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,480
the last 6 minutes, we've been parked

445
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,600
illegally. So, we thought, what better

446
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,159
thing to do while you're parked

447
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:47,158
illegally in Vancouver but to smoke some

448
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,159
hash.

449
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,679
Well, people walk by and look in the

450
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,879
vehicle and think, "What the [ __ ] are

451
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,759
those guys doing in there?" Take a look.

452
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Was that bad looking?

453
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,519
No. No. It was kind of just like I think

454
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:08,960
those guys are dabbing.

455
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:11,279
I see us smoking um full milk. Oh, that

456
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,400
smells nice. So tasty, too. Oh my

457
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,079
goodness. See, see where the difference

458
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,759
is? Nice to have a dessert hit after.

459
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,158
It's that beautiful dessert hash like

460
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,000
that is so tasty. No coughing, no

461
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,080
nothing. There's no moisture in there.

462
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,359
It's very tasty. Just beautiful. Yeah,

463
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:27,519
we did it. We did it. Job well done.

464
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,000
Well, I'm going to head my way. John's

465
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:33,679
got some rush hour. No, worse than rush

466
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,159
hour. Um rush hour long weekend traffic.

467
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,919
Traffic and rush hour, though. Yeah. Oh,

468
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,159
no. I guess that's over. You never know.

469
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,120
I might it might take me a while. I I

470
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,200
