7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,439
bit of problems with my phone I'm

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,689
finding that the encoder with the phone

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,689

12
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:29,579
phone

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,909
vertical which is not something I want

14
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:34,649
personally so I'm back I'm back and

15
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:36,058
we're making it work for those of you

16
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,649
that were wondering what I was holding

17
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,589
up in the last photo that was of course

18
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,989

20
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:48,449

21
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,968
got some Congolese rosin so all made

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,340
from some lovely hashes although maybe

23
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,489
God's green crack was made from herb I

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,750
don't have that information but I

25
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:58,769
figured we'd open up a little and have

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,070
some pop puffs

27
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,079

00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:51,250
working with those guys so far very

104
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:53,020
happy I know Tony was happy as well even

105
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,410
while we wouldn't even consider grabbing

106
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:59,409
trim from just anyone as we really

107
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,570
mostly deal with with buzz but they had

108
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,830
some really really nice trim trim that I

109
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,310
haven't seen in a while you know like

110
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:09,779
that we haven't seen in a long time

111
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:13,569
when you get people you know focused on

112
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:16,179
taking care being OCD really making sure

113
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:17,918
you're paying attention I mean back in

114
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,500
the day I used to make the top top

115
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,569
quality with trim but the trim was

116
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,639
basically like Nugget it was the tiny

117
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:27,519
little leaves just chopped off the buds

118
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,860
nothing else so that trim produced

119
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:33,089
incredible quality as well as yield

120
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,710
there was a large surface area on such

121
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:38,168
such materials that you would get a lot

122
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:41,469
of resin you would get yields comparable

123
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:43,120
to bud for that matter while green

124
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,789
dragons been doing work for a long time

125
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,949
they're 20-plus years around so they're

126
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:49,089
growers for certain I don't know if

127
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,750
they're breeding but they're definitely

128
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:53,379
grow

129
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,790
I just don't want to bother Carsten

130
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,339
honestly every little bit that I've

131
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,410
broken my rule and been like oh I'll

132
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:02,199
send some and then it gets lost and then

133
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,570
it's a nightmare or the VAT is 18% and

134
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,219
everyone cries like a baby or they say

135
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:08,170
oh don't put the real value because the

136
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,670
VAT is so high and then we send it

137
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,290
without the real value and it gets lost

138
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,180
and it's uninsured and they want me to

139
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,460
pay for it these are some of the reasons

140
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:19,030
why I'm not saving terpenes to Europe

141
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:21,579
from Canada I wish it was easier I wish

142
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:24,309
this wasn't the case but this is exactly

143
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:27,250
the case it's exactly what happens and

144
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:30,069
it's just not worth the energy the the

145
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:35,639
stress of getting all choked and pissed

146
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:38,829
off but it is what it is this beggar

147
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,110
will David for kur you are getting me

148
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:45,069
live right now bro and so there we go

149
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:47,139
I know woody woody I know but trust me

150
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,060
the UK was the same way people sending

151
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,159
it to the UK complaining about the VAT

152
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,899
or when it gets lost and the right and

153
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,330
the real amount isn't on there and they

154
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:57,250
spent a thousand bucks you don't owe me

155
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:59,740
an apology Kyle I'm not even sure why

156
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,418
you would say that but you would ever do

157
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,910
if you feel like you've done me wrong

158
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:05,709

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:17,598
four or five of them sitting on the

182
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:20,419

together when you told me I put it

185
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,409
together once you told me I'm going to

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,360
be filming at the karma cup you know

187
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,039
last year I got very busy and here's the

188
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,750
thing I'll try to film at the karmic up

189
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,788
the best that I can I think I'm speaking

190
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,509
so I'll probably film that just put a

191
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:40,458
camera up on a tripod but I'm not sure

192
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:42,229
how much else I'll get to film maybe

193
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,539
some sessions maybe a quick walk around

194
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,100
and some interviews with the with the

195
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:50,059
people that are around or at least Sarah

196
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,250
who's throwing it and I am going to

197
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:54,109
Jamaica prior to the karma cup so I will

198
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,159

00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:04,429
process facility of bottling plants and

201
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,370
a packaging facility we'll be visiting

202
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:08,629
the doctors conference so we'll get to

203
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,879
talk to a lot of the different doctors

204
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:12,708
about how they view cannabis as a

205
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,549
medicine in Jamaica and what the future

206
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:19,879
is going to bring and hey do you still

207

209
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,110
I might still do videos with Dan but

210
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,778

212
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:33,649

information with his x-rays and all the

218
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,690
doctors I think he's got like a 21 page

219
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,088
thing that explains exactly everything

220
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,190

221

and operating it back in the day and so

253
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:23,830
he's an exceptional grower and then we

254
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,430

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,750
grower

267
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:00,159
I'm like as a hash maker those are the

268
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,200
kind of growers that I want to make hash

269
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,909
for I don't want to have to go through a

270
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,460
hundred people that think they're good

271
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:09,189
and need me to explain through the bags

272
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,019
and the hash that I make that that in

273
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,060
fact that they're not people don't want

274
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:16,149
to hear that [ __ ] if they get aggressive

275
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:17,619
about it and the reality is the bags are

276
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:20,019
the Word of God when it comes to the

277
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:24,269
quality of what you've created because

278
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:25,860
it's producing a purity that

279
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:29,509
is the only way you could tell that

280
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:32,070
quality of product by purifying it I

281
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:33,809
don't know what I see the evolution of

282
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,300
weed in North America in the next 20

283
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:38,519
years I mean I have you know I'd love to

284
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:39,719
see it available everywhere I'd love to

285
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,850
see it available everywhere and if

286
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,660
that's the case a lot will happen to it

287
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:47,430
it might get pigeonholed down to three

288
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:50,100
different things but it might expand

289
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:52,319
even more than it is today and be you

290
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,330
know be hemp was always about being

291
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,220
about fifty thousand commercial products

292
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,170
we always bragged about hemp because it

293
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,399
had 50,000 commercial products well

294
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:04,709
cannabis will easily have 50,000

295
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:08,610
cultivars 50,000 terpene profiles I mean

296
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:10,320
the amounts that the ratios exist in and

297
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,940
how they change and how many terpenes

298
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,310
there are and rare ones that barely

299
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,200
exist anymore and in the ratios with the

300
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:17,369
cannabinoids there are endless

301
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,430
possibilities

302
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:23,580
way more than 50,000 so it really

303
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:26,129
becomes about who wants to go into that

304
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,920
mystery and find something unique and

305
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:31,259
amazing because there's a lot to be

306
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:32,610
found you know let's be honest not that

307
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:35,730
many people have focused their

308
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:40,889
attentions on breeding cannabis it's

309
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:44,460
true man the pump the hammer translating

310
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:46,679
over big squirrel nuts you always put a

311
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,540

00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,950
male's quick enough some just sneak up

327
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:21,480
on them so some are very good it's just

328
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,520
like anything the people who are hyper

329
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,710
aware the people who are paying more

330
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,689
attention they do a better job and

331
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,759
that's just like obviously even if it's

332
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,370
something as simple as cleaning a window

333
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,809
if you don't pay that much attention and

334
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,279
you don't go tie it into the corners

335
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:37,009
you'll leave water droplets in the

336
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,289
corners maybe if you

337
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,090
using not a rag but an actual window

338
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:42,709
cleaner and you leave too much of a

339
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,050
space between cleans you'll actually

340
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:47,420
leave a strip of water people do that

341
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:49,909
but then there's other people that can't

342
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:52,370
do that because all they see are the

343
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:54,379
imperfections they're looking so hard

344
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,629
and they're so focused that they would

345
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:59,450
never leave an imperfection like that

346
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:02,120
imperfections are screaming to them and

347
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:05,210
the cleaner they get it the louder the

348
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,100
imperfection screams under screams you

349
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,650
understand screams is kind of like a

350
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,600
little Freudian slip there as I'm doing

351
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:14,959
a metaphor for cleaning resin but

352
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,790
talking about cleaning on window anyway

353
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,570
squeegee there you go

354
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:23,719
the squeege imperfections they should

355
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,310
use DC glass cleaner right and that's

356
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,870
what's happened in Samuel bench if you

357
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:29,689
check every plant it depends on how OCD

358
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:36,289
you are it depends on how much attention

359
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:38,300
your pain - to do this just another day

360
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:39,309
getting better here my friend welcome to

361
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:41,569
the party

362
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:43,909
yeah I wish I could get my boss to

363
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,970
understand that I'm not even sure how to

364
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:49,069
test how to figure out how to convince

365
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,950
people to understand anything I think

366
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:54,980
you can just repeat things and then live

367
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:56,780
things and then eventually it'll be

368
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,460
written in the in the newspaper and then

369
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:59,839
those people will come to you and be

370
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,980
like hey did you hear about this and

371
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,420
you'll be like yeah I've been telling

372
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,430
you that and living that for twenty

373
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,990
years and they're like oh [ __ ] well I

374
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:08,000
just saw it in the paper so it's real

375
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,360
now it's kind of how some people are

376
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,309
living it is what it is probably not the

377
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:20,509
best idea anyone have a good strain for

378
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:24,339
bipolar - it's a tough one tough one you

379
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:27,200
know any type of those as anxiety or

380
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,879
mental you know where they're where it's

381
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,270
a feeling where it's in your head where

382
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,970
you're like I'm sure cannabis could be

383
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:36,769
good for bipolar or manic depression all

384
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,649
those things but I would definitely be

385
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:42,289
like be careful and be wary and of

386
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:44,059
course don't particularly with bipolar

387
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:45,860
because one of the things bipolar does

388
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:47,359
is you want to have a really good

389
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,980
support system and you want to have

390
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,579
people that you trust and believe so

391
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,739
that when you go

392
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:55,828
no potentially if you go manic if you go

393
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:57,540
really this high-end energy it's good to

394
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:58,888
have some people that you can trust and

395
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:01,289
believe who are saying hey you got to

396
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:03,298
come down that's not the right and so if

397
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:04,859
you have those people in your life and I

398
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:07,109
think it's safe to try all sorts of

399
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,938
forms of cannabis and find the one

400
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,818
that's right for you but make sure that

401
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:13,500
you don't get lost in it and that you

402
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:16,818
know I'm sure you know yourself better

403
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:20,009
than anyone that's just it's a tough one

404
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:23,338
mental illnesses are always a tough one

405
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:29,009
because they're there so in the head

406
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:33,509
I need another rape let's have another

407
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:36,119
rib I mean [ __ ] I won't say no to

408
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:40,558
another rib maybe a rip in a Turk dip

409
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:42,119
why not yeah yeah for sure Chris tank so

410
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,769
you want to make sure that you have good

411
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:46,528
people around you that you're able to do

412
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:48,980
that in and definitely we know one thing

413
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:51,619
and I would not normally say this but

414
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,720
you know my father-in-law

415
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:58,109
was was sick with mental illness most of

416
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,360
his life and a lot of those pills that

417
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:02,849
were prescribed to him I don't really

418
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:05,459
feel you know it and I would never

419
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:07,408
really tell anyone to not take

420
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,120
pharmaceutical pills because to each

421
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:10,889
their own we have to look at all the

422
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,509
options that we have but make sure that

423
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:15,359
you do your research and look at all the

424
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,679
options and make sure that that it's

425
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,558
good for you and it's good for the

426
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,870
people around you because it is some

427
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,190
scary [ __ ]

428
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:35,179
father mother lovers

429
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:46,190
as dean 420k would say we've got 236

430
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:47,480
people that's pretty good I'll send a

431
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,600
little message out we'll see what

432
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,450
happens I need you to peens on your

433
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:58,399
plant well I mean one of the easiest

434
00:18:53,450 --> 00:19:00,080
ways for sure is to extract them that

435
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,330
really shows you what you've got just

436
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:08,689
like anything just like the hash making

437
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:09,319
its gonna let oh yeah POV and how did

438
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:27,920
that go

439
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:30,109
what would I like to know do I like Star

440
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,570
Wars and F yeah fes who was my favorite

441
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:33,769
character I swear to god I must have

442
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:41,750
been like five or six years old the

443
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:43,309
first time I saw Star Wars and now that

444
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,009
has gotten so complex and there's so

445
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:49,429
many different levels to it to me first

446
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:53,809
of all Star Wars was the four five and

447
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:57,230
six Star Wars Empire Strikes Back Return

448
00:19:53,809 --> 00:20:00,769
of the Jedi that is Star Wars to me all

449
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:05,360
this other stuff I don't know it trips

450
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:07,009
me out I'm old and who my favorite

451
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,219
character is well come on it's got to be

452
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:11,450
Han Solo man he was smuggling [ __ ] he

453
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,069
was getting people ship the ship they

454
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:18,289
needed that you know the the rule makers

455
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:20,389
had decided that they they couldn't have

456
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:23,149
so you gotta like of course he was

457
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:25,340
classic but Han Solo was smuggling [ __ ]

458
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:28,720
in the Millenium folk I thought the

459
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:32,480
Millennium Falcon what was the wasn't

460
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,400
what's the name of his ship

461
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,009
yeah well it's true ramen kaolin I mean

462
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,019
it's a it might sounds funny by saying

463
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:43,200
that mental illness that's tough there

464
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:45,599
so in the head but it's what I meant by

465
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,420
that is that because it's in your head

466
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:53,399
and people can't see it and it's not

467
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:56,279
quite diagnoseable like a tumor right or

468
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,290
something visual on your skin or in your

469
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,359
body holding yourself a certain way

470
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:03,569
skeletal whatever it's it's tough

471
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:07,019
because people don't have the same level

472
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:10,789
of compassion and empathy for people who

473
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:13,829
are sick with bipolar or manic or other

474
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:15,809
mental illnesses so that's what I'm

475
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:18,210
saying about that it might sound like

476
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:19,919
funny the way you wrote it but really I

477
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,569
wasn't meaning it to sound funny at all

478
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,269
I was meaning it to sound very sort of

479
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:25,889
serious in the sense that if maybe we

480
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:28,049
had a little more empathy and compassion

481
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,730
for those suffering with mental illness

482
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:32,579
the way we would if someone had a giant

483
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:35,099
tumor growing out of their neck I think

484
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:37,470
it might be easier on people who are

485
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:39,779
suffering with mental illness so that's

486
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,089
what I think I don't think that I think

487
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:44,069
people are afraid of mental illness and

488
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:49,109
because they're afraid of it they tend

489
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:52,980
to sometimes be angry instead of

490
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:57,719
compassionate but I don't I mean that's

491
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:59,430
just my opinion I'm not too sure Bowman

492
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,350
even if I have to pay can I set up Skype

493
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,630
to talk to you well I mean I'm sure we

494
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:05,219
could probably do a Skype talk it really

495
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,930
depends look I don't like to try and be

496
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,759
like the guy who tries to charge people

497
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:11,820
to talk to them but I have an enormous

498
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,920
amount of people writing me messages and

499
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:15,480
stuff and one-to-one it's fine and

500
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,789
people who are wanting to learn and

501
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,410
educate I feel like that's always going

502
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:21,240
to be something I spend my time on

503
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,980
however when I realize that it's a

504
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,450
company a commercial enterprise

505
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,210
something that they're doing for a

506
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:29,279
living well then it seems like it's fair

507
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:32,910
that it's a consulting gig in that we

508
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:37,710
that there's there's pay being involved

509
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:39,450
so do you make most your decisions out

510
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,490
of intuition or gut feeling well

511
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,529
intuition and gut feeling are definitely

512
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,450
there i watch for the coincidences i

513
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,710
watch for these experiences that I

514
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,710
myself have for sure

515
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,380
manifested that in my brain are like

516
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,360
well that's weird I just had this happen

517
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,399
you know like things that align in a

518
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,819
weird sort of coincidental manner

519
00:22:56,398 --> 00:23:02,699
I see great value in and I never ignore

520
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:04,648
meeting anyone so you know that's

521
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,710
another kind of key thing that if you're

522
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:10,168
only trying to meet people who you think

523
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,028
can help your agenda and you look at

524
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:13,590
them as a certain level of person and

525
00:23:12,028 --> 00:23:16,048
the people who are below that you're

526
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:18,359
ignoring you're gonna miss a great deal

527
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:20,668
of stuff because personally I find the

528
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:23,699
majority of the the really magic that

529
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:26,520
happens in my life happens from random

530
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,019
people that are not known or with wood

531
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,730
you could never think of them at a

532
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:31,679
certain level they're just a neutral

533
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,690
person you've never met when you give

534
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,220
these people the time you'll see that

535
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,830
there are actually people you manifest

536
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,860
it into the ten to your life and now

537
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:46,079
it's up to you to recognize that it's

538
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:47,969
kind of hard to put into words but well

539
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,009
that's it I pet Maddy and I want to

540
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,450
share my truths with people that's why I

541
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:53,129
do this all the time but then people

542
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,798
have specific questions that they want

543
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,450
to ask me for their time and it's like I

544
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,788
said if it's like oh I'm helping my dad

545
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:02,038
try to beat his cancer or something I'll

546
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:04,379
spend hours with that person but if it's

547
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:08,250
for a commercial enterprise it just

548
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:10,409
seems fair that I'm pretty comfortable

549
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:13,319
talking about guarding gardening big

550
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:15,510
squirrel nuts you remind me of my best

551
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:17,369

552
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:19,200

00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:21,928

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,179

555
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:25,798

556
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:27,570

557
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:32,148
feel like wherever I'm getting my

558
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:35,220

with me and not thinking I was just some

637
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:30,240
whacked-out tourist is because I was

638
