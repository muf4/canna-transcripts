00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:37,620
end of June and so I figured it was time

59

to make another one couldn't give a

60
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,519
shirt away today but I don't know if I

61
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:44,399
should give a small a medium a large an

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,060
extra large double XL or a triple XL oh

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,180
we're going Jack Frost we're going

I say it's gonna be a large I say it's

70
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,599
gonna be a large I saw a lot of largest

71
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:18,699
popping up the screen and I think that's

72
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:20,560
what it's gonna be it's gonna be a large

73
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:23,348
I'm not sure exactly how I'm gonna go

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,128

to you guys how amazing that is the

87
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:34,330
terpenes are so incredibly tasty from a

88
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,060
taste point from a from a from its taste

89
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:39,370
standpoint without anything else if it

90
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,848
wasn't even modulating and creating a

91
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:48,610
stronger effect for me I would still hit

92
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:51,819
that what is so tasty it's just [ __ ]

93
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:55,960
insane Jack Frost man holy Christ you

94
00:04:51,819 --> 00:05:00,038
are the real deal Jackie Frost I'm just

95
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:08,469
cleaning up the the mild dirt and the

96
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:11,288
banger whoo I just cannot believe how

97
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,330
delicious that really Mike atomic skier

98
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:15,579
that's that's old-school for sure that's

99
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:17,560
only uh well the company had only really

100
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:22,329
existed for about three years at that

101
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,689
point in time so that is very [ __ ]

102
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:29,469
cool that you've been on it since then

103
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:32,529
you're an OG my man you're an OG all

104
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:35,470
right let's get this bowl clean such a

105
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:37,599
big big banger that it's really a job to

106
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,930
get all around and clean it out you can

107
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,210
see we got some pretty decent

108
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:46,120
cleanliness going on there what do I

109
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:48,489
think of kif Rosen well kif is dry sift

110
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,709
and what I think about it depends on two

111
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,470
things the quality of the dry sift head

112
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:55,479
ie how well was it groaned and how well

113
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,120
was it able to express itself both on

114
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,030
the cannabinoid and terpene profile and

115
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,730
then the purity of said head is the

116
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:07,750
purity of the Dreyse if 20% heads 40%

117
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:10,180
heads 99.9% heads these are the two

118
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,980
factors even when pressing rosin taking

119
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,100
rosin our dry sift that has been

120
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,629
contaminated or not sorry decontaminated

121
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,970
so it's just maybe 20 or 30 percent

122
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:21,579
heads you're going to have some effect

123
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,710
come in from the non glandular material

124
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:25,419
I don't know exactly what it is but it

125
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:27,789
will affect the quality of the resin you

126
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,740
will not get as nice of a resin as if I

127
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,920
were to clean it out and then squish it

128
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,139
but if you clean dry sift - 99.9 percent

129
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,650
heads and you get your purity and the

130
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:40,810
quality is unveiled to be a nine very

131
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,489
few people are gonna consider squishing

132
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,560
that don't get me wrong there are people

133
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,660
who will there's always going to be

134
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,430
people who will but for the most part

135
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:53,439
you really don't have to that's true

136
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,050
Jay Hendricks eighty-six percent of

137
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,829
statistics are false and that's only in

138
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:03,490
43 percent of the statistical analysis

139
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:05,680
that they've set up and done in 21

140
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,870
percent no I'm just joking let's have a

141
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,360
bolo shall we

142
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:13,060
what's 3-star sift I don't know I

143
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,759
honestly don't know what 3-star sift is

144
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:19,899
I I know that I would try to stay away

145
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,759
from it whatever it is can I make this

146
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:23,259
can I make a tiny request if I may can

147
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,930
you do a wake and bake making a batch of

148
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:28,300
bubble hash you know one day possibly or

149
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,740
in the very near future hopefully we'll

150
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,569
be making some bubble hash here in

151
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,769
Jamaica and I'll be able to do some

152
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:35,810
videos it's just that I haven't had

153
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:38,418
real material that I want to run to show

154
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,788
if I get the greenhouse going with Ron

155
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:42,799
in the backyard here of course we'll be

156
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:45,019
doing many many batches of bubble hash

157
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,000
imagine every morning doing a different

158
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:48,529
show from like the building of the

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,050
greenhouse over the course of a week

160
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:54,439
from foundation to structure to

161
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,340
everything lights and light depth the

162
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,538
whole nine yards

163
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:02,060
then the cloning then the the planting

164
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:03,949
and the soil making and the bacteria so

165
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,379
like all the whole nine yards just to

166
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:09,080
show on every single aspect now remember

167
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:10,908
we're we would just be sharing and kind

168
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:12,379
of learning as we go along we're not

169
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:17,120
trying to pretend that we're greenhouse

170
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:19,579
experts ron has a lot of growing history

171
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,288
he knows a lot about growing but by no

172
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:22,879
means would we it would be a learning

173
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:24,889
experience you guys would get to be

174
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,199
there with us for the entire learning

175
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:29,750
experience get to see our mistakes get

176
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,460
to see our successes and sort of that's

177
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,070
kind of the vision that I have I just

178
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:37,129
want to do that right from the start of

179
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,930
the grow right down to the end of the

180
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:41,389
grow where we're processing it after

181
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:45,169
hanging and drying it I think it'd be a

182
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:46,778
pretty cool show I think it would you

183
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:49,159
know for this greenhouse we would be

184
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:51,649
creating living soils we would be using

185
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:54,439
the soil balance Pro the bacterias on

186
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,720
the roots and we would go for as an

187
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,800
organic option as we can you know

188
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,230
potentially using biodynamic gardening

189
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:04,669
methods and tips yeah exactly Pharmacy

190
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,879
and Ron and I are no strangers to

191
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:09,949
mistakes ie learning people often say oh

192
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:12,049
geez you shot your sound fairly

193
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,959
intelligence did you go to university

194
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:18,679
and I'll say or college and I'll say no

195
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:21,019
I just made a lot of mistakes what I'm

196
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:23,569
like yeah yeah I ate a lot of mushrooms

197
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:26,208
I smoked a lot of herb made a lot of

198
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:28,879
mistakes and between those three things

199
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:32,299
right there brilliance can and will be

200
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:36,708
attained let me tell you ganja

201
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:37,759
University the school of hard knocks it

202
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,078
would be awesome everyone wants a

203
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,399
forever flowering greenhouse in their

204
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,948
backyard well that's for sure not gonna

205
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,429
be a forever flowering greenhouse mash I

206
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:47,528
hope that it is I've talked to Eric

207
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:49,109
but I've talked to some other companies

208
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:52,210
and some other people who represent

209
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,550
green house including Brian from vital

210
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,560
garden supplies so we'll see what

211
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:58,599
happens we'll see what green house we're

212
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,939
kind of like listen should we just go

213
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,680
blow 50 G's on a green house or should

214
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,080
we see the value that this particular

215
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,359
show could have how much advertising

216
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,670
that it'll be for this particular green

217
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,019
house depending on which one we buy and

218
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:13,000
we just figured there could be some

219
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,649
reciprocity there we're not trying to

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,570
say that we deserve a free green house

221
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,419
although you never know there might be a

222
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,459
company out there that feels that

223
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:24,429
fingers crossed we'd like to take the

224
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:26,949
money that we have for investment put it

225
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:29,079
into the surrounding area well you know

226
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,509
what we're gonna give a lot if this if

227
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,759
this green house is the one and it's

228
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:35,769
really really you know amazing and

229
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:39,819
useful I would say that they will be

230
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:41,319
making a lot of sales through green

231
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,790
house sales through these videos and I

232
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,620
would think these videos over the course

233
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:47,528
of time would probably gather up

234
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,060
millions of hits you know even if each

235
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:51,309
one was only getting ten or fifteen

236
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:52,659
thousand like a hash Church if you go

237
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:55,689
through the hundred and forty six hash

238
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:59,259
churches there's well over a million

239
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,150
views there already so well no we're not

240
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:03,850
haggling at all can of stones and it's

241
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:05,500
uh it's I was very ready to go and just

242
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,028
do that and someone had mentioned why

243
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,980
would you do that you have so much to

244
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:11,950
offer in return maybe you could work out

245
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,990
a deal and so that's what we're doing

246
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,120
work and ideal we're just trying to get

247
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,889
a good price we certainly haven't asked

248
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,839
for a free one three one would be

249
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:21,669
amazing but I'm not one to ask for free

250
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,650
ones at the same time I do have people

251
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:25,269
contact me on the regular and when it

252
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,519
works out and when I see the value of

253
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:30,970
their social media or so or or you know

254
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:35,578
where they're sharing I've been known to

255
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:38,079
give away free free bags and stuff oh

256
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:39,578
yeah sorry I didn't know what canna

257
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,469
stones was talking about I'm trying to

258
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:42,879
read everyone's stuff and but thank you

259
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:46,180
for letting me know and keeping me on

260
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,950
the right track I'm trying to talk to

261
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:51,669
Eric and what Eric actually said was

262
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:55,028
that he would try to match the best deal

263
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:56,620
that we found I wish he would have just

264
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:58,399
said here this is the deal we can offer

265
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,080
we could have decided whether

266
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,639
something for us and then I could have

267
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,220
already ordered the greenhouse and have

268
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,319
it on its way here I know that Ron has

269
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,149
already taken the cuts from the Congo

270
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,600
plants so the greenhouse cuts are

271
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:12,529
already vegging and you know while

272
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,600
rooting as we speak

273
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:16,339
so I would like to get on it sooner than

274
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,470
later probably hit him up in the near

275
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,660
future I want to have him back on hash

276
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:23,420
Church maybe in the next two weeks I'd

277
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:26,089
like to have Eric I'd like to have Brian

278
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:28,819
from vital garden supply I'd like to

279
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:32,060
have Peter from soil balance Pro come

280
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,300
back and then you know some of the

281
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:41,059
regular panelists and maybe even a few

282
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:42,649
new ones yeah now you know Jordan I'm

283
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:44,419
not interested in ending the market that

284
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,159
way entering the market now I could help

285
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:48,049
with my distribution to help sell

286
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,120
greenhouses if I found one that I really

287
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:53,329
loved I generally do that with all

288
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,490
things if I love something I'll try to

289
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,160
promote it and let people know about it

290
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,200
I mean the the glass cleaner I don't get

291
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,659
paid from the glass cleaner there's no

292
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,480
you know I've gotten a few free bottles

293
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:07,669
really and I guess I could have kept the

294
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,379
14 that he sent for giveaway if I really

295
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:11,120
wanted to but of course I I was giving

296
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:13,850
those away and I have I think I have

297
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,590
maybe one left today I'm definitely

298
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,810
given a t-shirt away but I haven't

299
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:22,370
figured out how it's going to come to be

300
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:27,759
just yet yeah Peter's very good Cuban he

301
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:30,259
impressed me I like his vibes and yeah

302
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,389
we'll see if we do greenhouses in

303
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:34,370
Jamaica natural alternatives Jamaica can

304
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:36,470
just do fields and they're so good it'll

305
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,230
really be dependent upon where we did

306
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:43,310
where our grows are and what kind of

307
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:45,560
weather and insect variables happen so

308
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:46,699
we'll learn those things as we have been

309
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,229
learning them over the course of the

310
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,870
last few years with the small research

311
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:53,810
and development projects but yeah we'll

312
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,950
see we'll see what happens what do you

313
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:56,949
need my help for Richard Campbell

314
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:03,368
is the greenhouse going to be just

315
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:07,259
Congolese I'm thinking it might be

316
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:09,670
sticks we haven't decided that yet oh

317
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,079
yeah yeah exactly

318
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:15,009
now you're talking pharmacy that's

319
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:16,058
exactly what we'll be doing oh goodness

320
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:18,789
gracious

321
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:21,759
a nice early wake-and-bake only 904 I'm

322
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:23,498
yawning I've had what if I had one rip I

323
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,778
have only had one rip we need to have

324
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:29,319
another rip I think we're gonna go into

325
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:33,759
the Bruce Banner this time little Bruce

326
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:36,998
Banner Terps left in there why congolese

327
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:40,058
cuz i love it why do you grow what you

328
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:41,350
grow I mean honestly I hope the answer

329
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:44,048
is not because that's what the market

330
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,298
dictates not that that's the worst

331
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:49,119
answer don't get me wrong the markets

332
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:52,539
important I think it's good that people

333
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:54,129
have an interest in cultivars but I also

334
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:56,618
think that the markets been so

335
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:59,769
controlled by the monopoly that is

336
00:14:56,619 --> 00:15:02,129
prohibition ie only people really

337
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:06,039
willing to break the law play the game

338
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:09,039
that doesn't really bring you know the

339
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,969
best of the best of the best of the best

340
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,759
of the best

341
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:15,489
all the people who could listen I some

342
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:17,048
people are worried about these new fresh

343
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:18,850
people that are coming into the scene

344
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:20,499
and getting on cannabis because they

345
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,720
weren't involved for the last 20 plus

346
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:25,089
years I'm welcoming it personally I

347
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,189
can't wait to see the excitement from

348
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:29,799
the new group of young people that come

349
00:15:27,188 --> 00:15:32,860
up and get degrees and go and study

350
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:34,989
agriculture and botany and Sciences and

351
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,509
go and travel around the world to you

352
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:41,379
know countries that are now legally

353
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:44,308
producing cannabis that to me is awesome

354
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:46,720
I am very much so looking forward to

355
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:48,999
just all of that how that's going to

356
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,239
play out in the next 10 to 20 years it's

357
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:54,459
gonna be very interesting trust me some

358
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:57,939
exceptional people are going to come

359
00:15:54,458 --> 00:16:01,149
into this with exceptional minds and the

360
00:15:57,938 --> 00:16:02,980
ability to execute their ideas and I

361
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:04,778
think it's all going to benefit us a

362
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,839
great deal obviously we don't have to

363
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:09,970
deny the fact that prohibition did not

364
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,769
benefit all of us it was quite the

365
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,019
opposite

366
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:15,389
so removing prohibition should benefit

367
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:20,720
the the scene in a very very good way

368
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:20,720
it's the way I see it Bruce Banner

369
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:27,960
oh [ __ ] and a pussy's in the house you

370
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,959
know

371
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:34,220
that seems like I might have to

372
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,419
banhammer that I don't know I don't know

373
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,019
we'll see we'll see

374
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:39,949
I look like Adam West's stuntman all

375
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:42,500
right cool

376
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,540
I don't even Adam West like Batman like

377
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,029
Adam West or is this like a new Adam

378
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:56,120
West I'm old I'm thinking Batman from

379
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:58,549
the 1960s boof bap Kapow Oh your bubble

380
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,470
hash won't bobble well that's easy

381
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:03,559
and teach you bro you just need to grow

382
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,120
better weed it's on I'm not even being a

383
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:18,259
dick like you have to grow better weed

384
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:20,149
that's it you called fresh head ease

385
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:21,069
left an email because your bubble hash

386
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:27,350
won't melt

387
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:31,220
dude all bubble hash does all bubble

388
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:33,859
bags does it isolates the glandular

389
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:38,529
trichomes heads from the rest of the

390
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:40,849
plant matter your quality is up to you

391
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:45,799
that happens in the grow room that

392
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:48,769
happens with the genetics and with how

393
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,669
well you've offered those genetics what

394
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:54,470
they require

395
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:58,130
yes collars are narrow leaf but somewhat

396
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:01,460
not the super super narrowest that's it

397
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:04,310
that's it I tried to say so many people

398
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,110
ask that question well you know do some

399
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:08,409
googling on micro planing there's micro

400
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:11,449
planing is simple freezing the bubble

401
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:13,070
freezing your tools breaking the pieces

402
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,870
into small little squares so when your

403
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:17,089
micro plane in the warmth of your hands

404
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:18,979
don't melt the paddy and kind of become

405
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:21,049
a nightmare you are gonna be shredding

406
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,329
heads generally when you do that which

407
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:25,700
will give the effect of a more melty

408
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:26,809
hash even when the hash is not melty I

409
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,569
see it as a cheat

410
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:32,359
I see fresh frozen microplaned hash as a

411
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:33,259
cheat and I see that if I take that hash

412
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:35,599
and I leave it out at room temperature

413
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:37,990
it's gonna butter out it's probably not

414
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:49,089
gonna melt as nice towards the end

415
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:51,519
I just like to sieve really is that the

416
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:54,609
truth but half of you [ __ ] are only

417
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,650
here for the giveaways sometimes when

418
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:58,389
you read someone's like just even like

419
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,280
cuz you might not have said it like in a

420
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,500
kind of hateful way but when you read it

421
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,389
it's like oh my goodness like he just

422
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,319
called half the people in the room [ __ ]

423
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:10,660
it's funny right hey you know what

424
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,480
whatever you're here for bottom line is

425
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,160
no judgments you're here and that's

426
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,049
awesome and if you're here because you

427
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,759
want to get some winsome [ __ ] well

428
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:20,859
that's fine too you know what I mean

429
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,539
you're still hearing what said you have

430
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,939
to be because at any point in time the

431
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:27,940
question could come that could lead to

432
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,220
the carrot I mean the t-shirts that I'm

Russian accent it could have come out

487
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:14,519

528
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,650
that I thought I can't remember exactly

529
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,480

00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:12,859
yes yes Fatih Mike I am the pub man hash

533
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,740
dude well that is important you know

534
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:18,319
what more than being a hero I will take

535
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:21,289
that compliment which is you helped me

536
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:24,168
not [ __ ] up my hash perfect that's

537
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:26,149
exactly what I'm here for to help people

538
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:28,490
not [ __ ] up their hash and really maybe

539
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,259
it's for a personal agenda I might be

540
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,269
greedy and selfish in the sense that

541
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:34,669
when I bump into you I want your hash to

542
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:36,740
be the best hash possible so that when

543
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:39,020
you share it with me the enjoyable

544
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,589
experience is that much the bar is that

545
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:45,650
much higher set and so perhaps it's a

546
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:47,569
little bit greedy of me but I feel like

547
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,980
give that information away it's gonna

548
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:53,839
come back not just to me but to anyone

549
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,819
to anyone it can come back I mean [ __ ]

550
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,109
when someone makes great hash and then

551
00:24:55,819 --> 00:25:00,009
they smoke it with you

552
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:02,959
the only thing let's talk about the

553
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:05,150
responsibility factor of growing great

554
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,610
weed and making great hash I'm talking

555
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:10,340
about that next-level [ __ ] above a nine

556
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:11,379
it's so next-level that it could cause

557
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:13,119
anxiety

558
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,910
caused discomfort in people and when you

559
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:19,299
have hash or oil of that quality I think

560
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:21,990
it's very important to when turning

561
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:24,730
someone on new when it's you know

562
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:29,289
showing them concentrate for the first

563
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:31,509
time not to try and destroy them not to

564
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:33,279
be like a childís immature high school

565
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:34,809
kid and I apologize if you're in high

566
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,579
school right now watching this not all

567
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:38,740
high school kids are immature but I was

568
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:40,299
a bit immature and you know we you know

569
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,700
we thought it was funny like Oh give him

570
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:44,559
a big glob give him a you know like we

571
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,910
don't want to hurt people we don't want

572
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,589
to turn people off and these are

573
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,720
powerful substances in the sense that

574
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:52,599
when taking a concentrate for the first

575
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:56,710
time in a larger dose than is necessary

576
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:59,799
you can get really really really stoned

577
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,720
and that's not our intention when we're

578
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:04,659
trying to turn the mainstream on to

579
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,220
cannabis we could show them that listen

580
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,529
yes this is very strong if you ate

581
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,630
enough I can probably do a surgery on

582
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:13,149
you if you smoked enough you could

583
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,910
potentially create an uncomfortable or a

584
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,560
level of discomfort that is maybe more

585
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,140
than you have experienced in the past

586
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:22,059
and so with that said it's also a

587
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,180
powerful medicine and when using like

588
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:26,619
micro micro micro amounts especially for

589
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,870
newbies for people who have never done

590
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:32,679
this before you know for people that we

591
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:35,169
want to be able to enjoy cannabis but if

592
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,630
we come at them and destroy them with

593
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:41,080
something so powerful and I see it

594
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:43,660
happen all the time to me you're doing

595
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:46,349
the work of prohibition you are not on

596
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,970
the right side of things it's not cool

597
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:51,579
destroy yourself destroy your friends

598
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,380
that request it but don't destroy people

599
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:56,949
who are who are have never had a rip

600
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:59,110
ever in their life really try to turn

601
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,150
turn them on in a proper way which is in

602
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:04,059
my opinion a micro dose something so

603
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:06,610
small that first of all when they see it

604
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:08,349
versus the the ones they've seen you

605
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:11,349
give all the other people in the room

606
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:14,139
including yourself it's like a tenth or

607
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:15,879
twentieth of what you took maybe even a

608
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,430
fiftieth if you're taking really big

609
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,850
dabs I don't take overly huge dabs I

610
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:23,160
mean even this right here would probably

611
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,899
be a little bit bigger than

612
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,120
what I would take now don't get me wrong

613
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,180
I could take a huge dab I just find it

614
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,519
wasteful and I don't enjoy it quite as

615
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,920
much as I enjoy you know a really nice

616
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:38,400
proper sized dab that I can finish in

617
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,230
one rep yes you did Rick fondle er but

618
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,690
do not worry we will be giving more

619
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,519
things away in the near future right now

620
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,019
we're talking about etiquette we're

621
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,879
talking about when someone is going to

622
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:50,400
smoke their concentrator hashish with

623
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,380
someone for the first time someone that

624
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,550
has maybe never been exposed to it maybe

625
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,960
they have a bit of experience with

626
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:57,019
joints maybe they have no experience

627
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,819
with joints so we're talking about

628
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:03,809
really showing people how to micro dab

629
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:06,329
and and get them the smallest amount so

630
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:08,039
that if they request another one they

631
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:10,079
can have another one no problem but if

632
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:12,000
you give them too much it's hard to now

633
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,639
say can you get rid of this feeling I'm

634
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,319
having an anxiety attack and I was just

635
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,330
kind of saying that we don't really want

636
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,000
to be turning people on that way that's

637
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:23,009
not that's not the way to show someone

638
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,539
into the wonderful world of cannabis by

639
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:27,059
producing a really uncomfortable

640
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:30,389
experience exactly cartwheel that as

641
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:35,940
well super low temp micro dose not like

642
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:40,710
super huge rip hot as [ __ ] like man so

643
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:42,539
many people putting that so many people

644
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:46,259
putting that on the nail it's not even

645
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:48,480
funny like unbelievable like rippling

646
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:51,690
hot ribs this creates an effect of

647
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,240
burning and harshness and coughing that

648
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:56,960
in itself is an experience that is not

649
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,269
really enjoyable now combine that with

650
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,190
extremely high someone for the first

651
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:04,529
time just taking a huge dab like that

652
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:06,440
it's just not a good combination I think

653
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:08,639
that cannabis deserves better

654
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:12,330
representation and I hope that you all

655
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:19,290
can respect that when turning new people

656
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:20,369
on to cannabinoids and terpenoids aren't

657
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:21,629
too bad for sure

658
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:23,039
you know there's that's a kind of a

659
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,460
great way but you know what I like to

660
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,230
show them dabbing I like to wood you

661
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,940
know why oil would taste like sulfur yes

662
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,650
I would absolutely know why your oil

663
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,029
would taste like sulfur you're not going

664
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,050
to like it it's a product called

665
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:36,329
defender

666
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:40,169
has a couple of other names it's a

667
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:42,960
smoker and they spray it kind of fog or

668
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:45,000
they spray it kind of for powdery mildew

669
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,440
it's when you have massive amounts of

670
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,720
powdery mildew and I say that because

671
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,630
when you can see powdery mildew

672
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,150
generally you'll have a lot so a good

673
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:56,340
way to find out this and I do it before

674
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:59,000
I run anything because of back in the

675
00:29:56,339 --> 00:30:02,220
day in the 90s oh it's nasty pharmacy I

676
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,279
made 28 grams of Renee bubble hash like

677
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:07,500
full melt the most beautiful blonde it

678
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,470
would have turned to an Amber golden

679
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:13,200
amazingness smelt like pounds of weed

680
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:15,509
like just the most beautiful hash and

681
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,100
it's it had sulfur I hadn't checked I

682
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:19,890
was learning about this so I hooked it

683
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:22,379
right off my deck and just said goodbye

684
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:24,480
to it no need for that it's contaminant

685
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,760
it's not good it needs to go there's no

686
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,009
way to get it out and yeah powdery

687
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:31,049
mildew powdery mildew is a nightmare

688
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:34,440
from hell this is a problem when you

689
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:37,649
have people grilling cultivars that have

690
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:40,500
never had to fight mildews because they

691
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:42,920
grew up in dry arid mountain ranges not

692
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,450
in the jungle or in the in the

693
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,340
rainforests of the Pacific Northwest

694
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:49,710
you know the temperate rainforest we

695
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:52,379
have a lot of humidity and a lot of rain

696
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,870
here so these are the wrong cultivars to

697
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:58,440
be growing and because of it you get a

698
00:30:54,869 --> 00:31:01,529
lot of powdery mildew that grows on

699
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,420
these plants congolese for instance is

700
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:06,119
resilient to powdery mildew because it

701
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,610
grew in a jungle it's used to moisture

702
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:11,009
in humidity and so over the course of

703
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:13,829
time that that plant was was bred and

704
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:15,960
selected by humans it chose to build

705
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:18,449
itself resilience ease now whether

706
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,240
that's the terpene profile I don't know

707
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,620
it's likely which is one of the reasons

708
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,049
we grow it right because we want that

709
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:27,059
unique terpene profile I don't want to

710
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:30,269
plant a bunch of coaches in a greenhouse

711
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:33,240
behind my house and have powdery mildew

712
00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:36,389
come in and take out the whole the whole

713
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:40,980
crop yeah exactly Pharmacy that's why

714
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:42,900
people do breed their own cultivars the

715
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,819
sulfur comes from the product it's a

716
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,750
powdery mildew it's like I think what it

717
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:48,179
really does is it

718
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:50,190
is the pH of the leaf it attacks powdery

719
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,590
mildew in some way but it's not in any

720
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,809
way Anna you're still going down today

721
00:31:52,589 --> 00:31:56,519
you know what I'm just gonna go poopoo I

722
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:59,759
don't know maybe it's a little bit harsh

723
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:05,609
but you've got to keep that banhammer on

724
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:07,140
the fresh fresh hammer route still can't

725
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:08,819
get the image of those mites and webs on

726
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,830
those plants oh my god are you kidding

727
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:12,750
me dude don't even listen for real I'll

728
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:15,899
tell you something that gave me like an

729
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:17,400
anxiety attack when I saw that like I

730
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,410
got dizzy and my heart started beating

731
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,000
and I could feel blood pumping much the

732
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,710
way you would if you were getting say

733
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,319
pulled over with a trunk full of herb

734
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:29,250
very much like that feeling just looking

735
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:31,349
at that whoo-hoo those mites all over

736
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,240
that plant like what a bummer there's

737
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:36,149
just nothing good about that I would

738
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,430
never go in that room I wouldn't even

739
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:41,610
film his phone I would be worried about

740
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:44,430
cross-contamination even over the

741
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:49,619
Internet oof gross is right thanks for

742
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:51,779
bringing it up my god whoo well 32

743
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:52,259
minutes and 47 seconds I think we did

744
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:55,109
pretty good

745
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:58,410
I see herb the herb gardener has sent me

746
00:32:55,109 --> 00:33:00,029
his email so I'll probably head down to

747
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:03,120
the post office and get this stuff off

748
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:05,879
to all of you and in the meantime I hope

749
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:08,969
everyone has a great day I hope they all

750
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,070
have oh it's not a pic Matthew it's

751
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:13,620
located on hash Church when Tony showed

752
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:16,049
his phone with a video of mites it was

753
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:19,500
the video that made it so much worse it

754
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:22,950
really was it has been 33 minutes

755
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:25,170
actually did I ever get my email from

756
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:27,569
episode 81 I believe I did I don't know

757
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:31,590
what your email was about or what but if

758
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:33,389
it was an email that said your address

759
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:35,189
and you won something that I would

760
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,930
suspect it's been shipped off just

761
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:40,830
recently I shipped off like eight or

762
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:42,509
nine things that I had saved up so sure

763
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:48,059
Alex do you see why not have a bond

764
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:51,410
right before before we leave why not do

765
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:53,889
a little Ripper put that right there

766
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:59,710
get this party

767
00:33:53,890 --> 00:34:02,759
if this party started boom long ripped

768
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,759
and trim jail

769
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:06,750

771
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:13,489
I seem to recall you saying don't be

772
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:17,909
nervous I take rips it with purchase I

773
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:22,739
was just being funny I'm not like ego

774
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:24,809
competitive in my dabbing at all I don't

775
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,158
claim to take the biggest drips I just

776
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:28,110
felt like that was kind of a comedic

777
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,079
thing to say didn't you didn't you kind

778
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:35,669
of enjoy it on a comedian level on a

779
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:44,569
comic level comical level that would

780
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:49,319
crush your soul all right violator

781
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:51,360
yeah never stop being funny it's all

782
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,250
about being funny I was a class clown if

783
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,720
you can imagine it was like making

784
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,000
people laugh I thought it was like a

785
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:00,029
noble pursuit to put a smile on

786
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,460
someone's face just seemed like the good

787
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:04,460
thing to do let's do this

788
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,629
[Music]

789
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,340
can still taste the Terps from the last

790
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:33,280
dip

791
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,900
I didn't even dip that how the hell is

792
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,900
that possible like the ball is just

793
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:47,440
fully chirped quite delicious when are

794
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:49,239
they just gonna leave us alone hey when

795
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,909
are they just gonna leave us alone let

796
00:35:49,239 --> 00:36:03,759
us have this point one thing after

797
00:35:51,909 --> 00:36:07,710
another it would seem fully turbed dee

798
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,240
jazzed a little bit dark here where it's

799
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:13,030
reclaiming but that'll clean out real

800
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:16,569
nice as long as the banger itself the

801
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:20,730
dish is clean have I ever had my rig

802
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:23,710
turn blue from Terps no no I have not

803
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,539
what is that - Celine or Hugh I can't

804
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:28,210
remember the name of it Jim frere posted

805
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:30,009
it a few times Bobby man ribs would

806
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,630
[ __ ] me only I only baked flowers

807
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,680
well you know what that's why we all get

808
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,840
this is the beautiful thing about

809
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:36,549
cannabis that the bioassay and that's

810
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,070
why I say be respectful for people

811
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,510
because when they don't know what level

812
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,550
they sit out when they're coming in

813
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:45,310
fresh it's best for you to bring them in

814
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:50,620
smooth and nice not to like yank them in

815
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:53,860
in a way that that is discomforting for

816
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:55,480
them so cannabis can be powerful is the

817
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,510
oil that tastes like sulfur dangerous to

818
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,360
consume well you know what I'm not gonna

819
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:03,640
say that it's deuteride I wouldn't say I

820
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,559
trust inhaling it like what was the

821
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:09,779
sulfur sprayed for is it was a mildew

822
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:12,940
obviously so you have mildew and Pat and

823
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,550
sulfur that you're inhaling least to me

824
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,900
don't seem to be like I don't think

825
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,789
people have been inhaling them for

826
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,300
thousands of years safely the way they

827
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:21,340
have

828
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,970
cannabis I have faith in cannabis

829
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:26,650
cannabis produces terpene profiles and

830
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:28,389
cannabinoid profiles that seem to have

831
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:31,780
been over the course of this last

832
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:36,339
several thousands of years safe for

833
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:38,980
human consumption so sulfur it's bad man

834
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,990
it's bad you know and if I know it's a

835
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,250
hard thing because but it's education

836
00:37:40,989 --> 00:37:43,809
right I know I know

837
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,389
so what you got to do is you got to

838
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:48,519
educate the people around you to stop

839
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,650
purchasing herb from this guy who's

840
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:52,780
selling sulfur aidid herb you also have

841
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:55,300
to educate him first and foremost so you

842
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:59,110
give him the chance to stop on his own

843
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,730
if he doesn't stop then you just have to

844
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,260
sort of convince the people around you

845
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,250
that are your friends at least that that

846
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,560
is no bueno

847
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:08,820
and to try and seek out a better source

848
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:12,250
because you know it's supply and demand

849
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,620
it's your your the demand so he produces

850
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,360
it the grower if this guy continues to

851
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:19,389
sell it we'll keep spraying his [ __ ]

852
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,340
with powdery with sulfur powdery mildew

853
00:38:19,389 --> 00:38:23,589
is horrible it's like spores so if his

854
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,720
grow has it he's gonna have to [ __ ]

855
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:29,140
strip everything down and clean that

856
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:31,149
[ __ ] with a nuclear bomb in order to rid

857
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:34,329
himself of those spores they really are

858
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,950
hard to kill Spore we talked about it on

859
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:37,840
hash Church a couple of weeks ago or

860
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:39,939
maybe even last week I think it was

861
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,730
Peter from soil balance probe talking

862
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:45,940
about the powdery mildew Spore and how

863
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:49,559
intense it is like a bowling ball

864
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:54,099
actually is what he referrin stit - so

865
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:55,690
yeah troubles troubles hate - it makes

866
00:38:54,099 --> 00:39:00,150
me feel a little dirty talking about it

867
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:00,150
I'm not gonna lie a little bit dirty oh

868
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:08,170
wow that's insane wow that's crazy isn't

869
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,789
that the power of cannabis you know

870
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,349
laughed for the first time since the

871
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:13,349
Holocaust that's a pretty serious

872
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:15,730
statement when you think about it

873
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:17,769
ideally I picture that the woman has

874
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,539
been through hell during the Holocaust

875
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:22,150
has not laughed for the rest of her

876
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:23,650
entire life and then 78 tries cannabis

877
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,809

function laughter and happiness have you

883
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:44,559
ever had to throw a crop away bubbleman

884
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,659
um I have thrown a crop away yes Andrew

885
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,789
Driscoll I did right before Johnny bee

886
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:50,108
went through his house that's why I

887
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:51,970
actually stopped growing for quite a

888
00:39:50,108 --> 00:39:53,920
while Johnny bee gave me some clones and

889
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:56,259
I had been to his Grove before and

890
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,960
everything was fine but he gave me some

891
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,119
clones and it had some mildew on it and

892
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,369
the minute I saw it like and I saw just

893
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,990
one little kind of leaf had a circle on

894
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:07,329
it I just killed everything now it

895
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:09,189
wasn't a huge crop but I just got rid of

896
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:11,200
it and I cleaned all the tents and I

897
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:14,409
stopped growing it's been over a year

898
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:15,909
since I grew anything so I'm just kind

899
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:17,679
of safe like that I'll be very very

900
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:19,538
confident when we bring the greenhouse

901
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:20,919
in that there's no powdery mildew here

902
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:23,049
and that you know people who have

903
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,420
gardens will also kind of go through a

904
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:27,219
specific sop before they're allowed

905
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,139
anywhere it's not gonna be like an open

906
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:31,058
like hey you know come on over to the

907
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:34,288
greenhouse I'm gonna have to do a little

908
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:36,609
bit stronger on the SOP than that but

909
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:38,140
we'll see how it plays out you know Ron

910
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:39,940
and I are learning and it's gonna be a

911
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:41,769
fun experience I just want to have Ron

912
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,079
back in my life that's one of the things

913
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:46,259
I'm most excited about having him back

914
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,359
in my life and back in my family's life

915
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,940
super super excited about it so I can't

916
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,519
let this one fall to the wayside it has

917
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:57,309
to happen and I'm gonna keep talking

918
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:59,679
about it until it does so with that said

919
00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:02,859
may the full-mouth bless your bowls

920
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:05,519
sooner than later bubble man is out

921
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:05,519
peace
