00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,079
known for over 15 years a bubble

5
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:30,359

Shannon Archer Memorial bench it's just

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,120

8
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:36,718
that I'll just have my sessions next to

9
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:38,320
the bench not to offend anyone and uh

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,840

our

14
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,320
motorcycles and uh we thought we would

15
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,679
stop and I would tell you a little bit

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,439
about this Apex electronic cigarette

17
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,960
that I recently got turned on to in uh

18
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,079
Jamaica so I realize the camera angle is

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,840
pretty dark but uh I wanted to show you

20
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,480
this we're going to have a little

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,760

22
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,558
this unit

23
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:05,719

guy and so he uh gifted me this and said

28
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,438
check it out see what you think I was

29
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,239
hitting one in Jamaica and I was quite

30
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:23,239
impressed with it so we've got this uh

31
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:26,599
really big uh strong metal he always

32
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:28,640
bangs it to show how strong it is and uh

33
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,478
you know you've got your dome right here

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,000
he's got the ceramic dish fish with the

35
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:35,478
um Titanium element it's a little bit

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,879
bigger and deeper than most that I've

37
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,719
seen it gives a real serious rip um it

38
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,399
also comes with a charger a little

39
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:47,319
silicone case for your hash uh a steam

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,478
version a vaporizer version for herb

41
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:53,438
that screws on and then the oil version

42
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:55,519
as well although any pen will fit on the

43
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,038
um Apex battery because it's the same I

44
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,679
don't know if it's 10 mil or what the

45
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,960
size is exactly but it's the same as the

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,280
majority 99% % of all the pens out there

47
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,919
so I figured how long does the battery

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,879
last 4 days wow dude that's what I'm

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,318
saying now that's what he says I told

50
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,479
him dude I bet you I kill it in a day

51
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,919
and he says I bet you don't

52
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,759
so let's put it to the test I'll give

53
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,159
you two days watch us kill it right now

54
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,159

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,760
hits the bugs is it brand new with a

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,640

yep big enough to house that battery

104
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,039
that's what I'm saying and the way it

105

116
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,359
you have to do is lean it up against

I are now at I guess we're at brtan

167
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,160
beach yeah brania mines are right there

168
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:49,359
yeah so if you've ever driven uh home

169
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,240
from Whistler this is the Sea to Sky

170
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,759
Highway Pacific Ocean on the right we're

171
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,199
right in front of a giant mine they used

172
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,919
to film X Files and such things in there

173
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,598
yeah yeah it's an old copper mine yeah

174
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:01,519
exactly kids have gone and done the tour

175
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,639
with their school yeah Scooby-Doo was

176
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,918
shot down all right that as well so

177
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,199
we're sitting next to the ocean we

178
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:11,198
thought we haven't dabbed yet so I got

179
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,919
the Hitman out put a little water in it

180
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
and yes uh Mike said is it okay that

181
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:16,318
it's salt water it's going to have to be

182
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:20,279
for

183
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,160
now sea water sea water oh I actually

184
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:26,359
got to get one more piece of the puzzle

185
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,199
which is a very important factor it is

186
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,960
the

187
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,720
nail I thought thought I should bring

188
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:35,719
this Seaside Nails Seaside Nails get the

189
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,759
nail out see what's going on Torch to

190
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,000
bring our temperatures up to

191
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,759
nail yes yes

192
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,120
yesing what temperatures do you need for

193
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,759
the nails work uh we just heat it up

194
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,519
orange and then wait for a few minutes

195
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,879
and then dab it or wait for a few

196
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,000
seconds usually just heat up the right

197
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,879
side which you can get on doing just

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,120
like

199
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,759
this you want to kind of hear that sound

200
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,439
to make sure you know the T there that

201
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,919
sound this is great for portability it's

202
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,120
my first torch

203
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:08,198
nail you got the sound that sound right

204
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,240
there so we're hitting some full melt

205
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,840
dry sift that I made about a month back

206
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,720
I think it was uh an OG cush cross from

207
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:18,478
uh a friend up in Prince George A friend

208
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,680
of d420 K shout out to Jay for uh for

209
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,918
this dry

210
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,079
sift man it's got to be like 95° right

211
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:31,279
now yeah and a little even more with

212
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:32,679
this torch next here yeah right

213
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,399
all right let's see we'll give that a

214
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,399
little bit more of a

215
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,479
hit all right I think she's a

216
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,479
girl I think she's a girl

217
00:08:54,039 --> 00:09:00,078
Mike that was a real nice

218
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,879
rip real nice

219
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:02,879
look at that quality

220
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,480
too clean ends very

221
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,200
pure it's definitely good funny thing uh

222
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,519
to tell you guys we climbed a gnarly

223
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,360
fence to get in

224
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,679
here thinking it's just you know it was

225
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,800
tough we got to climb in we got to get

226
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,679
in here there's this huge fence right

227
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:26,919
here we're not supposed to be in here

228
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:29,439
and uh there's not a fence like 30 ft

229
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,519
back so we won't be jumping the fence

230
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,000
necessarily this heat up the other end

231
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,000
the other side the opposite side

232
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:41,439
yeah

233
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,440
perfect

234
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,278
sound oh yeah I see your oranging

235
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:53,759
out tempted to go for a

236
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,320

Pitman rips by the Pacific Ocean I wish

239
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,278
you guys could see exactly how much that

240
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,278
was bubbling in here almost overflowing

241
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,278
like magma melted up quite nice didn't

242
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,519
it well done so I guess we're about 15

243
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,759
to 20 minutes away from uh the home

244
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,600
station so it shouldn't be too far for

245
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,480
us to get back the highway is quite busy

246
