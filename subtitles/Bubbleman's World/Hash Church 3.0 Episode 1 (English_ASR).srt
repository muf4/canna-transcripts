is certainly not new to me jack and I go

38
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:58,798
back fought far like 20 20 plus years we

39
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,560
worked in the cannabis industry together

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,350
I came out from Winnipeg and I met him

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,109
and we just kind of clicked right away

42
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:09,750
he was kind of a bit of an aggressive

43
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:11,759
character at the time but I really liked

44
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,489
it it was kind of Winnipeg

45
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,719
and made me feel like I was at home and

46
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:17,400
give him a little lowdown on what you've

47
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,259
been up to you know obviously for the

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,230
last five years but also a little bit in

49
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:25,348
regards to how you got there okay okay

50
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:28,229
well thanks for the thanks for the intro

51
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:30,869
Marcus definitely yeah where Marcus and

52
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:34,378
I met was was definitely the nineties in

53
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:38,599
Vancouver when there was that that time

54
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:41,039
when all of us were busy from there I

55
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:43,560
like a lot of people in the business I

56
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:47,878
had my own my own personal difficulties

57
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,609
and through those I ended up leaving

58
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:53,878
Vancouver and coming over here to the

59
00:02:50,609 --> 00:03:01,230
island and I did that quite a while back

60
00:02:53,878 --> 00:03:05,699
and in trying to you know heal myself

61
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:07,828
you know I did a lot of things that did

62
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:11,578
involve cannabis and at the same time I

63
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:14,840
ran a volunteer-based mobile needle

64
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:17,760
exchange in the streets of Victoria so

65
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,039
tell them a little bit about kind of how

66
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,899
you went down the road and got into drug

67
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:24,060
addiction and where you ended up because

68
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,319
that really sets the story and I'm sure

69
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,769
it might be a little bit sensitive to

70
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:31,078
talk about get into that a little bit

71
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,269
because dude you lived some serious [ __ ]

72
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,280
that really in my opinion led you to do

73
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,530
the work that you're doing today yeah

74
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,169
your your right ear right Marcus um I

75
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:44,430
mean for me just like a lot of people I

76
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:48,989
think I came out to to be see from from

77
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:52,949
Ontario and I got a new cannabis scene

78
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:55,669
like like any twenty-year-old who wants

79
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:59,099
to go out and make their own way and I

80
00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:02,489
became very successful at that is how I

81
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:04,018
how Markus and I met and once you kind

82
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,870
of get to a certain level in the

83
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,519
cannabis world you're no longer just

84
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,349
dealing with people who are only in the

85
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:16,470
cannabis business and and through that I

86
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:18,269
found that I was just not a happy person

87
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,859
you know I got all the things in life

88
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,968
that I was supposed to get you know

89
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,370
physical things things that I was taught

90
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:27,079
that would help me to

91
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,389
to feel better when I didn't feel better

92
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:32,569
when I had those things I turned then to

93
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:35,199
the other drugs that did I was involved

94
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:38,389
with the the business of and and that

95
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:43,759
for a long time that made me stronger

96
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:45,860
that made me seem like a like my average

97
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,860
friends you know and and nobody really

98
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,860
knew about it because you know I was

99
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,319
making enough money to to to hide what

100
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,800
that was and and I went on that way for

101
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:08,569
probably you know a solid a solid decade

102
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:10,520
and you know I guess in that world I

103
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:15,620
just experienced even even further

104
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:17,899
traumas you know it made me want to do

105
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,350
the things that I do now to try to

106
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:23,560
challenge what what drug policy exists

107
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,419
because I always felt like it was the

108
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,000
criminalization of cannabis that ended

109
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:31,609
me up meeting into a world that I really

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,829
had no exposure to I grew up as a little

111
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,500
hippie kid selling hash to university

112
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:40,000
students and eventually that became such

113
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,139
a big thing that I was involved in the

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
smuggling business and then that

115
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:48,848
involved of course all the other things

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,399
that that that come with that and so

117
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:54,259
yeah well for me I always felt like

118
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,579
cannabis was always a healthy part of my

119
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:58,909
life it was always something that I came

120
00:05:55,579 --> 00:06:04,728
back to when I needed to to gather

121
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:10,520
myself so I mean I don't know what else

122
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:12,529
you want to but it leads into so listen

123
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,180
Jack had some problems he got addicted

124
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:15,079
to some drugs and when I say he got

125
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,060
addicted to drugs

126
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:23,990
Jack excelled at being a when I saw him

127
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,720
at the end he was literally on main in

128
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,220
Hastings like in the worst situation I'm

129
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,229
telling you it's a death sentence when

130
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,010
you end up down there very very very few

131
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:37,699
people go down there okay so not only

132
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:39,168
did Jack come back from that he started

133
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:40,878
doing what he's doing in Victoria

134
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:42,408
right now and that's that's what I was

135
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,789
getting to wanting you to tell us about

136
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:46,129
what the work that you're doing now

137
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:48,589
based on the experiences that you had

138
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:51,699
using cannabis to help other people who

139
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:56,498
are in your current situation get back

140
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:59,180
okay great because that's that's an easy

141
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:03,620
story you know what I mean I I basically

142
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,908
I came over here I was real quiet and in

143
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,769
order to kind of get my own head back

144
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:09,620
together I wanted to learn what it was

145
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:12,709
to do something for nothing you know so

146
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,528
I volunteered my time in a in a in a

147
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:17,239
needle exchange that served food and

148
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:19,968
[ __ ] you know because I wanted to find

149
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:24,249
out what a what what it was why people

150
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:28,240
were nice to each other I think and

151
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:30,409
through that experience it led me to

152
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,180
that was in a different Health Services

153
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,959
Agency and then I was called by this

154
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:38,060
group called solid which at the time

155
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:40,489
only had one staff member in a shit-ton

156
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,319
of volunteers and their story was like a

157
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:47,379
lot of their members were their story

158
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:50,960
was very similar to mine you know we're

159
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:52,639
so so for four years I just we just did

160
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,370
them a while needle exchange we went out

161
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,278
and ended that and as everybody knows

162
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:02,810
the opioid crisis is a is a real problem

163
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:06,439
and so I ran an agency of people with

164
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,588
lived experience of either current or

165
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:11,060
past experience with drug use and

166
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:13,939
through that we started doing overdose

167
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,978
prevention work we started the very

168
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:22,639
first temporary overdose prevention site

169
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:25,248
here in Victoria and we can and we kept

170
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,649
doing more of the same thing now we run

171
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:29,210
the harbor the that's the equivalent of

172
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:32,269
what do you guys have in Vancouver is

173
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:36,110
insight and through running deeps types

174
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:38,870
of projects I've been able to show

175
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:42,528
people how cannabis is an effective tool

176
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:45,278
in a harm reduction toolbox so when I'm

177
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:48,289
running a needle exchange and giving you

178
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:51,379
clean needles when I'm giving you narcan

179
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:52,699
kits in case with the worst case

180
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:54,019
scenario I

181
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,240
so always wanted to be able to give

182
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,919
people cannabis because for me that was

183
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,269
the thing that always kind of I never

184
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:04,459
succeeded it at government detox or

185
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:06,500
rehab centers but I always succeeded

186
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,590
when I gave myself time and space and

187
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,899
time to reflect in the plant you know so

188
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:16,730
I wanted to be able to do that for

189
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:20,779
others and so we started just giving

190
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,850
away edibles and joints on a weekends

191
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:26,539
here so I started out with maybe only

192
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:29,210
about 80 people they were all Street

193
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:31,969
entrenched drug users in the downtown

194
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,860
core and so I would always say to them

195
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,580
you know I probably know that you won't

196
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,950
try this until that day when your dealer

197
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,080
wasn't turn on his phone you know and

198
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,090
you're really sick in the in it and then

199
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,830
when that happens I really want you to

200
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:50,210
take the edible and I want you to tell

201
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:54,590
me what happens and so we just gave out

202
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:56,210
joints and in edibles within the within

203
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,950
the scene and we started doing a

204
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,170
secondary stream research with the

205
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:03,379
University of Victoria so if I was to

206
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:05,360
say Marcus tell me about your drug abuse

207
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:09,470
and you tell me hey I do an eight ball

208
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,139
of cocaine a day so then you would check

209
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:15,259
in weekly to let me know after a week of

210
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:18,409
me giving you 80 milligrams of as edible

211
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:21,740
and a joint or two how that impacted

212
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:24,169
your patterns of behaviour and we got a

213
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,950
lot of very positive feedback from that

214
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:30,519
so we expanded the program we reached

215
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:34,850
out to people who are large online

216
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:37,850
vendors and they started to give us more

217
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,700
product to give to people and so we got

218
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,040
up to having about 200 members and five

219
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:47,840
days a week four hours a day where the

220
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:49,579
service was running and about six months

221
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,769
ago we were able to move and get a

222
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,629
storefront that was separate from our

223
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:55,429
administrative office so now I have a

224
00:10:53,629 --> 00:11:00,679
service open seven hours a day

225
00:10:55,429 --> 00:11:03,199
it's an at cost cannabis service for

226
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,149
members only you either have to be a

227
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,259
person of lived experience with illicit

228
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:08,958
drug use

229
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:12,048
or on government assistance like a

230
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:15,018
disability or old age or of Aboriginal

231
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:16,938
descent those lonely people 11 to the

232
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:19,220
program because those are the people who

233
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:24,108
are most disproportionately affected by

234
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:25,970
opioid deaths totals so I know that the

235
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:31,038
community safety unit has a complaint

236
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:32,569
and has had from before over the last

237
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:34,548
month and a half but they still haven't

238
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:37,159
come to us to give us the lecture about

239
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:39,889
shutting down because I am working in

240
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:42,788
conjunction with the chief medical

241
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:45,048
officer here who is working as a kind of

242
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:48,859
lobbyist with us with the Ministry of

243
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:51,350
Health because the harbor and the other

244
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:53,538
injection services that I run have

245
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,418
government exemptions that allow for

246
00:11:53,538 --> 00:12:00,109
drug use in those areas obviously heroin

247
00:11:56,418 --> 00:12:03,528
is still illegal but where we were it's

248
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:04,879
accepted that that we have to pass drugs

249
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:09,159
back and forth there has to be an

250
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:11,389
exemption that allows for that and I'm

251
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:15,528
negotiating with the problem is to

252
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:17,928
extend that exemption over our cannabis

253
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:21,109
programs to recognize that our cannabis

254
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:23,838
programs are an element of our

255
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:27,199
life-saving services that we provide we

256
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:30,230
also do other things like run a drug

257
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:32,618
checking project so any a person who

258
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:36,739
does casual drugs on the weekend or any

259
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:38,569
you know hardened addict has access to

260
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:42,769
mass spectrometry and real information

261
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:45,469
about what's in their drugs I've run all

262
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:47,119
these services together in one place and

263
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,249
I feel like that's the main reason that

264
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:52,869
my cannabis service has not been shut

265
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:55,428
down yet is because I'm not a dispensary

266
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:57,889
you can come in and see that the same

267
00:12:55,428 --> 00:13:02,078
thing there's $20 in the dispensaries

268
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:06,168
all over the city is $5 where we are I

269
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:07,969
have 8 or 9 staff that work for me just

270
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:11,389
in the cannabis programs in the

271
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:15,199
production attaining and distribution of

272
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:17,480
those things so the only money that we

273
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:19,849
make off cannabis is that to pay the

274
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,180
salaries of the people who were there

275
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,340
and everything else we give away so I've

276
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:26,750
gone to where I've only when we started

277
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,759
we made it maybe you know a hundred

278
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,830
dollars a day because there is no price

279
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,629
it's just a donation when you come in

280
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,450
Marcus maybe one day you have no money

281
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:37,100
maybe one day you have four dollars some

282
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,420
days you leave me money some days you

283
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,250
don't but in the end you leave the

284
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:47,779
service with something every day so

285
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:50,000
that's that's kind of the the the loose

286
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:52,159
parts of how it works you know

287
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,690
I wanted you to come and share this

288
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,250
story because I know there's a lot of

289
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,290
good people in the community that will

290
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,570
want to get behind it and support it and

291
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:01,519
I know I've you know tried to facilitate

292
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,629
and do whatever I can for it because it

293
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,250
really is the good good work and you are

294
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:08,990
such a unique person to be doing it

295
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,669
you're literally I just love you like I

296
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,460
wanted to see why people were nice to

297
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:15,709
each other like how people knew who you

298
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,560
were 20 plus years ago they would just

299
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:20,360
be like wow this guy has matured he has

300
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,119
like grown as a human being he's been

301
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,940
through hell and back and then back to

302
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,409
hell and back again and you're just kind

303
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,910
of shining you're doing super good

304
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:31,759
things you're helping people and you can

305
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:33,769
tell that your experience is directly

306
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,899
effective in the efficiencies of the

307
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:37,759
program because you know what it's like

308
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:38,899
to be a drug user you know when you talk

309
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,090
to them look I know you're not going to

310
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:42,439
eat this edible but you know at one

311
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,759
point in time they're dealers not gonna

312
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,320
answer their phone that dealers gonna

313
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,929
get busted he's gonna lose that phone's

314
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,160
gonna happen and that is the moment when

315
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,689
those drugs are not going to be

316
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:53,120
available and that is the moment when

317
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,030
you get that edible and that joint into

318
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,860
their hands and it's just such a nice

319
00:14:55,029 --> 00:15:00,110
it's just such good work dude I'm proud

320
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,779
of you like I'm really proud of you I

321
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,940
really appreciate that man and and

322
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:08,329
you're right like the reason that I do

323
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:11,180
those things is because if I give you a

324
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:14,450
joint in an edible today and next week

325
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:16,039
you're you end up in jail and you get

326
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,870
out and you have no idea your welfare

327
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:20,990
has been cut off I can help you with

328
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:23,299
that too you know and that way when you

329
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,129
get those things back together you get

330
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:27,889
another put a little bit more stable and

331
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:30,230
maybe you need some other kind of help

332
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:31,639
you feel like then you can ask us for it

333
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,289
and it will deliver it and I think

334
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,439
that's the strength of the service and

335
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:36,169
it

336
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,060
why did I connected like primarily we

337
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:40,309
work from the health authority contracts

338
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:42,409
that's kind of what protects me in the

339
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:44,959
services that I run is that I work

340
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:50,899
essentially for the man in a lot of ways

341
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:54,379
but then this I love I love the

342
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:56,090
opportunity about how I don't know if

343
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:57,590
anybody's ever been a drug user you know

344
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,570
how it is like there's a point when

345
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,910
you're ready to tap out and if people

346
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:04,670
aren't ready to help you at that point

347
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:06,949
you kind of miss that opportunity and

348
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:08,959
sometimes months or years can go by

349
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,759
before somebody feels like they're in a

350
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,950
position again where they want to make

351
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,710
changes you know and recognizing that

352
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,870
time is the key right like who but a

353
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:22,220
drug user who's gotten out of it can

354
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:24,769
recognize it's the time yeah and this is

355
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,590
like a tool that allows us to have that

356
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:28,879
conversation every day with people you

357
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,280
know when they come in for their joint

358
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,019
they're at a bowl you can really have a

359
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,529
chance to check in with them you can

360
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:38,269
really have a chance to to make changes

361
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,279
in their lives like the ones that I've

362
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:42,049
been able to make for myself you know I

363
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:44,089
just try to offer the supports that I

364
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:47,539
wish would have been there for me a

365
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:50,629
decade ago and this is why today for

366
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:54,740
2020 I wanted to start with a story

367
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:57,559
about realness and truth and and not get

368
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:00,080
right into a cannabis 2.0 and licensed

369
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:02,389
productions and regulations and blah

370
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,770
Bloo Blee blah bluh because I know that

371
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,318
the majority of the people that I invite

372
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:07,879
into these rooms although some of us

373
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,188
many of us are going down these pathways

374
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,350
and checking out alternative pathways we

375
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:15,319
still all come from the foundation from

376
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:18,289
the place that you are in right now so

377
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:20,659
know that in the hash Church panelists

378
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:23,359
and the hash church congregation you

379
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:26,390
have an incredible amount of support and

380
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,789
with that I would like to introduce the

381
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,280

454
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,170
lot of people here in the downtown

460
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,919
same thing here in town with the canvas

461
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:40,559
substitution project and I was killing

462

and courage and he's really really doing

464
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:47,609
the same focus or what you're doing here

465
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,019
in Vancouver and we're seeing this in

466
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:51,089
different parts of the world actually to

467
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:53,099
overseas or some other people we've

468
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:55,379
talked about capping the name right now

469
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:57,029
but you know it's just great work that

470
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,000
you guys are doing like we all support

471
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:02,069
so thanks oh thanks thanks for bringing

472
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,950
up Neal actually the reason that we

473
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:07,679
started our program the cannabis

474
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:11,819
substitution project because we hired a

475
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:14,100
person from Vandu Howard Howard dezhong

476
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:17,490
and he came over and told us about Neal

477
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:19,529
and that's how it really started is

478
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,259
moved to sitting like this you know

479
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:24,480
puffin on my couch and he was telling

480
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:26,640
the story and I just decided you know I

481
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,829
think I'll stop selling weed and let's

482
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,830
just start giving it away instead you

483
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:35,669
know and that's that's honestly how it

484
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:39,269
how it began and what we're trying to do

485
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:42,060
is make it so that Neal and Sara and

486
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:43,920
other people who are doing the same what

487
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:48,299
we've done is we've actually built a

488
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:51,240
society it has a board I have a staff I

489
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:55,319
have managers I can show on paper how

490
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:58,170
that you create cannabis it's such a

491
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:00,689
cause that you can employ people but

492
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,690
still give out hundreds of donations

493
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,370
into the community a day and that's the

494
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,650
thing the chief medical officer here

495
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:10,379
really wants to make the program my

496
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,809
Grabeel you know to migrate it to places

497
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,210
so I want to take all these extra tools

498
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:18,178
that I have with research connections

499
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,639
that I have and hand them over to people

500
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:22,470
like Neil and Sarah so they can expand

501
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:24,599
their services so instead of like once a

502
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,788
week having 700 people line up on

503
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,668
Hastings to come get their thing from

504
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:32,700
Neil I want to give Neil my playbook and

505
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:34,499
say dear Neil this is this is you know

506
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:39,360
this is what I do this is what we did

507
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:41,639
and and actually make it so that there

508
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,069
is this subsidized area of the market as

509
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:47,398
as Marcus said there's there's people in

510
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:49,648
this forum who have the access to go and

511
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:51,808
investigate the lp world as it sits

512
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:53,339
right now the people who I serve they

513
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:56,490
just know a way that they could be

514
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:58,558
served by that so I I'm gonna say like

515
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,118
when I volunteered the Green Cross I was

516
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:01,710
a member of stuff like that and then

517
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:03,898
words worked on donations and when

518
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,028
people come with 50 cents and then we

519
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:07,439
get them suddenly and with me bottom on

520
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:09,749
the bag whatever we always made sure

521
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,759
that and and that is knows the beginning

522
00:23:09,749 --> 00:23:13,379
stages of working and it was basing harm

523
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,669
reduction in those first clubs and stuff

524
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:17,038
like that yeah that's what they all were

525
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:18,629
based around yeah and we saw on that and

526
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,249
it was really good and then and we saw

527
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:22,048
it kind of fade away with all the legal

528
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:23,308
dispensaries opening up and stuff like

529
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:26,128
that but now we're starting to see that

530
00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:29,038
come back because truly it needs to give

531
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:33,778
back and yeah I'm just sitting here on

532
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:36,028
memory I know because it is kind of like

533
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:38,368
what Hilary did in the beginning and and

534
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:41,339
the kind of sense that Marcus and others

535
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:43,408
in the community gave but there was no

536
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:47,699
way that Hilary could afford the massage

537
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:50,309
therapists kind of listen I want to

538
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,110
soften their stuff like that yes I went

539
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:53,519
through those whole programs because you

540
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:55,138
know I was injured I was hooked on

541
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,798
pharmaceutical drug same thing no

542
00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:58,288
difference

543
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,819
went through the whole stages of the

544
00:23:58,288 --> 00:24:01,710
whole harm reduction learn the four

545
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:03,028
pillars that's all went through through

546
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,528
Samsung and stuff like that with the

547
00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:05,519
Downtown Eastside what you're doing at

548
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,169
that do and all that

549
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,558
so there's a big better than that

550
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:12,720
between 86 and 88 89 90 and I think you

551
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,999
need touch bases on that yeah and that's

552
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,490
we started seeing that explosion so yeah

553
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:20,368
because as you know like it's just

554
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:24,118
natural that people kind of corrupted

555
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:26,579
the model that that was brought forward

556
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:28,558
like a in a true medical access because

557
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:30,839
obviously if the plant is a medicine and

558
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:35,788
access not giving access is ridiculous

559
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:39,778
but every day yeah I just exactly I just

560
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:43,048
wanted to make sure that in the changing

561
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:44,849
landscape that is the lp world that

562
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:47,099
people that I work with wouldn't be

563
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:49,558
forgotten and there would be space given

564
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:53,009
to people like yourselves like myself

565
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:54,778
people like how did you like when people

566
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:58,109
would say to me you know how did you

567
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:59,369
help solve the opioid epidemic this is

568
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:01,168
what I would want to say I brought

569
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:02,908
people who understand that drug policy

570
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:06,028
is garbage you know and I mean and

571
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:07,919
understand that problems are solved from

572
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:12,509
within community dude and when there's

573
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,850
no solution to the system you require a

574
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:16,769
new system and that's why what you're

575
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:18,990
doing is so cool man because you're

576
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:21,500
you're you're just doing something

577
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:24,149
completely different that actually works

578
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,919
and I knew people like yourselves would

579
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:28,859
agree and get on board and that's why I

580
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,049
did it my biggest supporters so far I

581
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:34,168
hope they don't mind me saying has been

582
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:36,418
the NCC the National compassion Club and

583
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:38,700
twisted extracts they're both those have

584
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:41,700
been two companies which have made it

585
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,679
possible for me to have staff make it

586
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,048
possible I give me it when I could say

587
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,179
you know what ID double the donations

588
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:50,879
you give me so that's what I'm to do

589
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,889
though it isn't is it the adversity that

590
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,260
you faced that made it so like why don't

591
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:57,689
you just do what 90% of people do and

592
00:25:55,259 --> 00:26:00,058
just go online and [ __ ] and moan and

593
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,009
and cry about the system and how it's

594
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:05,190
not really taking care of you like I

595
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:07,919
just find it amazing why people choose

596
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:10,019
that over just like you can make change

597
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,909
by doing little things not that what

598
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:13,859
you're doing is little but it started

599
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:16,909
little and it's growing bigger and now

600
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:19,319
no one can deny it it's like the most

601
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:22,470
ridiculous thing to try and deny that

602
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:24,269
drug users can be helped on a and and

603
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,889
not just helped on the level of like how

604
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:27,808
we used to say Oh cannabis will increase

605
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:29,308
the quality of your life you know while

606
00:26:27,808 --> 00:26:31,470
you're doing chemo and while you're

607
00:26:29,308 --> 00:26:33,210
passing away no it can actually shrink

608
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,100
the tumors out of existence it can

609
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:38,159
actually help you rid yourself of these

610
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:39,869
addictions Johnny be how much oxycodone

611
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,990
where you taking every day

612
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:45,329
280 milligrams a day of oxycontin fast

613
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,039
acting super dolls of another 40 on and

614
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:49,199
then I had ten milligrams my

615
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,210
prescription drugs for 1,400 maybe eight

616
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,670
dollars a month I was hooked on heavy

617
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,769
pharmaceutical drugs that led in there I

618
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,000
went through these whole stages and

619
00:26:55,769 --> 00:26:58,500
that's why it was easy when I started

620
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,970
talking with Jack I started doing this

621
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,710
home about a couple years I mean we

622
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,600
touch bases try doing things with the

623
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,058
getting feature while trying to get all

624
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,709
these different little mechanism set up

625
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:11,149
so he can actually supply generates to

626
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:14,910
all these people that were in need yeah

627
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:16,650
this is yet it it's it's a great feeling

628
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,150
to see when people actually give back

629
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,470
and stuff like that like myself I'm

630
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,880
always trying to help people I want I

631
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,049
don't know how to help people so I want

632
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,520
people to just grow their own how do I

633
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:25,649
do that by starting a YouTube channel

634
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,839
and working with everybody and just kind

635
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:30,780
of giving back as much as you can to

636
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,490
keep to the plan that's the only thing

637
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:35,490
that doesn't create a gaping hole in

638
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,710
your life Jack said he had everything he

639
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,870
had he had every physical kind of thing

640
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:42,960
he required and he was left feeling

641
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:45,149
empty you know because that's not what

642
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,100
makes you feel great in life please

643
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,200
please catch this I might even make it

644
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:54,058
fullscreen just for this one thing okay

645
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:56,640
is is your I lost my train of thought

646
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:59,549
that sucks that was an important one too

647
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,160
connection to other people well it's oh

648
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:05,730
sorry is the true value of life is not

649
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,040
is not taking it is giving and doing for

650
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:11,308
other people it's it's giving and doing

651
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:15,480
and helping that is where you start to

652
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:18,210
feel that warm glow inside and the more

653
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,670
you do it the better you feel sure you

654
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,750
have to be careful in this world

655
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:24,179
navigating because there are you know

656
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,220
literally sharks out there that will

657
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:28,559
consume you whole but that's not to say

658
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,600
you can't surrounded by them yeah you

659
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,200
can you can help I mean look at the work

660
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:36,990
that this do and it's it's incredible

661
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,269
honestly my next where the next thing

662
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:42,839
that I'd love to do that I think will be

663
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:44,819
of the greatest benefit for both

664
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,369
communities the community I serve and

665
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:50,879
the community at large is to start what

666
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:53,519
what I would call a therapeutic space

667
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,270
which is actually a grow area

668
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,589
because we like this many Center now you

669
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,670
can have a place where you can grow your

670
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:01,289
order you have a place where you can

671
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,120
actually learn about cannabis education

672
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:04,799
I didn't get officers like this there's

673
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,509
there's got to be more of a place where

674
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,609
there's a place where people who truly

675
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:10,500
want to learn and need and and and and

676
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:12,389
can't get it better like there are

677
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,220
certain times like I was saying like I

678
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:16,200
mean we have legalization that's gonna

679
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,509
be nice to me so seeing those those

680
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,590
forms of extracts that I use every day

681
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:21,359
that are going to be offered to patients

682
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:23,159
this is gonna be the biggest thing is

683
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,619
really is gonna be those extracts as

684
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,080
high concentrations of THC that you know

685
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:30,709
that we need right that are needed for

686
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,240
businesses stuff like that so I mean

687
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,279
yeah I agree Johnny what do you win we

688
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,009
do cannabis education classes that I

689
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,599
think heaven the physical garden there I

690
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:42,269
mean everybody here has been a garden

691
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,849
you know 100 percent the value of

692
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:46,589
standing in your room when the lights

693
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:49,500
turn on and all the plants are praying

694
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:51,269
like you know what that does for you as

695
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,819
a human and I think to give them that

696
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:56,849
experience instead of just teaching

697
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:58,500
people to come and be needy and here's a

698
00:29:56,849 --> 00:30:00,990
joint and here's an edible that's not

699
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,380
what I want to do I want to create a

700
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,849
community where they can come in in the

701
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,680
days they feel good enough to water a

702
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:09,599
plant or pull some leaves or whatever

703
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,160
whatever task it is that they're

704
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,119
contributing to the medicine that

705
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:17,759
they're getting and then also for the

706
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:20,639
community it wide right for the grannies

707
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,379
who who think I can grow four plants and

708
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,550
I could do that for those people well

709
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,860
then Jesus come into our community

710
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:27,750
garden and I could show you how to take

711
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:29,549
a cutting and I we can talk about how

712
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,230
you we can give those cuttings away we

713
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:34,589
get people growing their own and be safe

714
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:37,140
for so long it's a safe this is no go

715
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:39,419
for just grow yeah this is our way to

716
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:42,330
overcome some of the shitty rules that

717
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:45,150
exist in LP system I think of if we band

718
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:51,389
together as a community to solve a

719
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:53,580
problem that exists cannabis is a its

720
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:57,210
health services you know and if we could

721
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:59,490
use the money from bat to help stem the

722
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:02,279
tide the tide of the opioid epidemic

723
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:06,069
then we can look at ourselves and and

724
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:08,649
know well yeah that that we help do that

725
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:10,689
with the plant it just seems like that

726
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:13,030
that's something that I could really get

727
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:15,610
behind and and that's why I hope the

728
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:17,529
next steps will be will we get ahead

729
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:19,719
with a little bit enough money that

730
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:23,049
we'll be able to get this therapeutic

731
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,150
area growing I'm gonna help you out too

732
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:29,259
because I I'm all about people growing

733
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,970
therefore and we got your 4.com I just

734
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:32,049
want people who grow their own form and

735
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,220
yeah yeah I'm gonna hook you up with

736
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:35,019
every I want to make sure you about you

737
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,759
on four go to your hydroponic stores buy

738
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:38,920
your stuff go to your bond shops like

739
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:40,509
people need to start growing their own

740
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,150
because it gets you out of bed it makes

741
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:44,650
you feel better you see that life come

742
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,030
out of it and the problem was I got a

743
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,620
lot of people were so discouraged with

744
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,779
it because you're over water doing

745
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:51,639
certain things but you know with with a

746
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:54,129
few good people we came up with a good

747
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,630
little system that for plants with LED

748
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,160
lighting you don't need AC units you

749
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,750
don't need D Huez you might need to put

750
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,330
in the humidifier stuff like that but

751
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,819
education is the key and Canada can grow

752
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:05,349
for you go on Amazon go to grow store

753
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:06,939
pretty sure Walmart all these places

754
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:09,219
will start carrying different systems

755
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,100
and stuff like that is legal grow your

756
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,779
own you know like we we have twelve to

757
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:16,000
fourteen hundred members and growing

758
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:17,529
every day so I just think that times for

759
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,960
if you give me a five thousand plant

760
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:21,460
count and I'm pretty sure that we can

761
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,100
pull in an industrial space in the

762
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,170
middle of downtown Victoria and and

763
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:27,819
there you go bang you're doing it you

764
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,680
know and therefore per household but

765
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:31,149
when you come down to say like apartment

766
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,640
buildings or people I was looking at and

767
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:35,290
see how people are living with doings I

768
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,410
flew with HIV or different conditions

769
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:40,960
then you can have one in every damn

770
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:43,090
apartment I think that we can we can

771
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,160
manhandle rules you know what I mean

772
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:47,829
like I would I would love to challenge

773
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,540
the for plant in each household because

774
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:51,609
you know I have fourteen hundred members

775
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:53,019
who don't have household so where the

776
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:54,519
[ __ ] you think you're supposed to put

777
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:56,559
listen ass that's the whole thing like

778
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:57,789
were you gonna grow their wholeness the

779
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,759
whole household

780
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:05,289
not everyone has a house I drove around

781
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:07,240
in nineteen it was 2007 or 2008 when

782
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:08,769
they tore down my house I had no place

783
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,420
let live in my truck and all I had was

784
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:11,859
my one plant Medi coach and they would

785
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,810
drive around that in my truck and

786
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:15,099
there's pictures of it to you I had

787
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:16,629
nowhere to go with the plan but I kept

788
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:18,429
them alive that I'm willing to someone's

789
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,210
bathroom estate in there for a few days

790
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,429
I carry this plan

791
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:24,379
with me and then I did a video on it and

792
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:26,769
that was like yeah it's like where do

793
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:29,628
you go like what do you do

794
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:31,159
amazing yeah was actually here it was a

795
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:32,719
part of my life when I just got my

796
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,549
license from Health Canada they tore

797
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,980
down my house I was protesting fighting

798
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:38,298
WCB and I kept that plant with me

799
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,360
because it was the only strain that

800
00:33:38,298 --> 00:33:43,278
helped me so much and I and I remembered

801
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,469
being behind a cop I'm putting it up on

802
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:47,509
the desk so you could see it and they

803
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,788
just kind of signs on my truck fight

804
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:51,649
works ABC and they kind of though you

805
00:33:49,788 --> 00:33:53,450
know what I mean but always standing up

806
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:55,339
for the plant not plant that plant got

807
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,499
me through it took me to so many

808
00:33:55,339 --> 00:34:00,109
different places the cannabis community

809
00:33:57,499 --> 00:34:01,669
that joins and hold you together it was

810
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:04,278
probably the biggest rewarding thing and

811
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:07,460
and walking into that lab yeah you know

812
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:09,318
what memories yeah 2020 is gonna be

813
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,449
explosive you know what I mean what

814
00:34:09,318 --> 00:34:14,148
we've seen happen over the last decade

815
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:15,828
in 2019 with legalization and

816
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:18,378
everybody's you know complaining about

817
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:21,829
it let me say grow your own you know 2.0

818
00:34:18,378 --> 00:34:26,088
is gonna be a different year 2020 we got

819
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:27,530
it before we just wanted to say you know

820
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:30,529
we really appreciate the work that

821
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:32,269
you're doing and we're backing you up so

822
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:35,419
what we're doing right now is we're

823
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:37,849
gathering the dem collective which is a

824
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:39,408
whole lot of farmers internationally we

825
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:41,088
just gathered as a meeting of the minds

826
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:43,490
at heartwood Institute in Garberville

827
00:34:41,088 --> 00:34:46,429
California and this was a really big

828
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:49,818
topic of conversation on how growers

829
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:52,159
producers extractors distributors

830
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:54,798
wherever you are in the world how can we

831
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,170
touch compassionate care how can we

832
00:34:54,798 --> 00:34:59,480
touch children who need help people who

833
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,608
you know are financially struggling to

834
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,099
be able to to reach the plant to be able

835
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:07,719
to get a hold of it so we're with you we

836
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:10,390
need to hook up and amazing amazing

837
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:12,618
conversations I really appreciate

838
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:14,779
meeting you in this format I've watched

839
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:17,358
you lots of times you know on the on the

840
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:20,660
church and I just feel privileged that

841
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:22,848
that Marcus would would have me in

842
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:25,969
because you know usually this is a

843
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:30,230
pretty high level tech of weed you know

844
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:32,598
type of format conversation and so I was

845
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,590
a little bit nervous too even though

846
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:35,900
this is the kind of [ __ ]

847
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,360
I have to do all the time for work you

848
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,570
know and it's just it's nice to hear

849
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,700
back from the people who've watched

850
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:45,680
thinking like I know this can work

851
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:48,730
because when I watch you talk when I

852
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:51,589
don't know who you are I feel like that

853
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:55,010
did you wouldn't want to help with this

854
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:58,510
and and when that comes to fruition it

855
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:58,510
gives me confidence that

856
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,568
ideas I had five years skulking around

857
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:06,179
picking up needles on you exchange and

858
00:36:03,568 --> 00:36:08,789
how to incorporate people in the

859
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:10,798
cannabis business into the unfolding

860
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:14,279
landscape of change in drug policy and

861
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:16,400
you know how we could use the opioid

862
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,400
epidemic

863
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:30,050
you believe them

864
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:30,590
we lost them yeah I think we did he'll

865
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,970
be back

866
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:34,220
that was pretty good timing nonetheless

867
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:36,309
like he thought to say almost anything

868
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:39,519
it's really important it's really

869
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:42,679
important I mean it's it's kind of like

870
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,840
when there's hungry people you can give

871
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:47,089
them a fish and feed him for a day or

872
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,130
you can teach them how to fish and give

873
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:53,390
them a fishing pole and they can be

874
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:54,860
self-sufficient growing it's true it's a

875
00:36:53,389 --> 00:36:56,539
nice thing to teach people I mean

876
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,280
there's no doubt about it it's just a

877
00:36:56,539 --> 00:37:01,340
nice thing and I found over the years

878
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:04,760
just from growing cannabis especially as

879
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:06,800
you know my kids grew up around it it

880
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,720
gave them not as much interest in

881
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,090
cannabis but it gave them interest in

882
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:15,439
growing they were just like hey can we

883
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:17,539
grow like food so we'd start buying

884
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,220
seeds and planting peppers and cucumbers

885
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:21,409
and lettuce and all these other

886
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:22,909
different things and it's definitely a

887
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:24,679
good thing I mean you always kind of

888
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:26,179
hear the stories of what would happen if

889
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:29,359
you know you just couldn't go to Safeway

890
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:30,649
anymore and buy food well what would

891
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,120
happen would be that you would

892
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,769
definitely want to have a seed

893
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:37,159
collection and start being able to grow

894
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:39,829
some food and the best thing you can do

895
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:41,809
is help out others that can do nothing

896
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:42,289
for you and that is the best feeling in

897
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:44,360
the world

898
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:46,849
passing on passing on knowledge and

899
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,620
educating people that will only help

900
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:51,469
them better themselves it's the best

901
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:53,869
feeling ever it is true it's really

902
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:56,539
amazing what an incredible catalyst this

903
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:59,150
plant is you know it continues to

904
00:37:56,539 --> 00:38:02,360
catalyze and point in directions and it

905
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:04,369
you know is illuminating areas that have

906
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:07,700
been dark for a really long time it's

907
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:09,889
illuminating big a big pharma you know

908
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:11,750
all of the problems politics poly

909
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:14,059
corporate X is what you know the word

910
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,980
that I've been using lately and I just

911
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:17,659
think that this plant is here to save

912
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,190
the world and I think we are the

913
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:21,079
medicine makers and we are the people

914
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,329
that need to talk about it and bring

915
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:26,539
this plant out into you know regular

916
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:28,309
mainstream world so that everybody can

917
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:29,840
jump on because I know that you all know

918
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:32,299
that this cannabis culture is

919
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,910
international and we connect on a very

920
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:38,750
very deep level only because of this

921
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:40,670
plant and I think it's phenomenal so

922
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:44,570
it's a unique plant in the sense that

923
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:47,809
there is this underlining like it seems

924
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:51,440
to affect compassion and humanity and

925
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:53,210
empathy and really sort of produce it in

926
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,550
people and that's one of the reasons why

927
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:57,800
when everyone's so concerned about like

928
00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:00,380
I don't know evil cops and lawyers and

929
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,870
judges all because you know taking over

930
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,150
the cannabis industry I'm like bro they

931
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:07,159
are messing with a power that is so much

932
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,349
more powerful than any they fought it

933
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:11,839
for for decades they spent billions of

934
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:13,610
dollars they destroyed tens of thousands

935
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:17,059
hundreds of thousands millions of lives

936
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:18,200
and they lost to a plant and so now

937
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:19,610
they're gonna lose again they're gonna

938
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:21,169
try and make it corporate they're gonna

939
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,789
try and be greedy they're gonna try and

940
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,230
do all of these different things but

941
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:25,849
what they're not gonna understand is

942
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:28,219
that while you're handling this plant

943
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:31,630
and breathing it in and being around it

944
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:35,659
it's going to affect the way you think

945
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:37,550
promise that's what I'm looking forward

946
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:39,409
to we said it years ago my partner

947
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,940
actually said it to me years ago Martin

948
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:43,609
Roth chick who was one of the founders

949
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,829
of Manitoba harvest before Manitoba

950
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:48,500
harvest was started we were growing a

951
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:53,380
5-acre Hempfield just experimentally in

952
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:56,869
1995 in just outside of Winnipeg and I

953
00:39:53,380 --> 00:40:00,019
was quite young at the time I remember I

954
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:03,289
was maybe 21 one years old or something

955
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:05,210
21 or 22 and he said to me as we left

956
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:07,070
the field in my van and we kind of

957
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,929
looked back and we had to hide the field

958
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:11,930
also it was not right on the highway but

959
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:13,669
he said you know this is gonna change

960
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:15,559
the way people think and that wasn't

961
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:18,740
even anything medical that was just

962
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:21,739
cannabis growing in acres in the

963
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:23,299
prairies and it truly did change the way

964
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:25,429
people think they started seeing it at

965
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,260
the grocery store they started consuming

966
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:29,359
it you know they're putting it into

967
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:32,720
their bodies is that affecting them of

968
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:36,170
course it is absolutely it's just a very

969
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:37,849
unique plant that is like it's viral in

970
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,139
the sense that it just gets out there

971
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:42,259
and these people that think they're

972
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:44,329
going to cage it and control it I think

973
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:47,300
that they'll see it'll it'll work about

974
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:49,759
as well as their prohibition did the

975
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,000
Mayan Prophecy also states that a flower

976
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,520
is what is going to save this modern

977
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,699
culture these modern people a single

978
00:40:54,519 --> 00:41:00,460
flower and it makes a whole lot of sense

979
00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:01,480
to me that this is going to be the thing

980
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:09,220

992
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:52,030
trying to put dry cyst on well I'm just

993
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:58,050
gonna say Aloha and Happy New Year's

994

everyone happy 2020 are you

995
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:10,780
come on Maui yes I'm jealous I was able

996
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:13,360
to get medical cannabis here too because

997
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:17,170
I have a I have a California cannabis

998
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,700
card and if you submit to cap to Hawaii

999
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,309
which I did last Saturday night and on

1000
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:23,679
Monday I had my card so I actually went

1001
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:28,119
to the dispensary and bought cannabis

1002
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:30,099
and carts and all kinds of stuff just to

1003
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:34,389
see what their program is like here on

1004
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:36,429
the island I mean does that as well just

1005
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:39,549
north of me and it's really nice because

1006
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:40,809
it allows people to to check out

1007
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,400
different growers and different

1008
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:44,170
processors and really learn about what

1009
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,930
everybody is doing it's really quite

1010
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:55,059
nice yeah I would say the cannabis here

1011
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:56,019
is circa 2004 2005 California it's it's

1012
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:58,059
got a ways to go

1013
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:59,650
the they don't have many people coming

1014
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:01,779
so the cannabis seems to sit around a

1015
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:03,550
while so the church and everything are

1016
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,680
gonna be stored in these bottles that

1017
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:12,849
are have a lot of oxygen and air and

1018
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:14,828
so like me we exactly like all of it I

1019
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:17,230
was like I would sit bone dry in a

1020
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:21,970
container that just yeah sounds familiar

1021
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:24,429
up here oh not bone dry the prices are a

1022
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:27,308
little high you know because they have

1023
00:43:24,429 --> 00:43:29,739
to grow it and produce it on top of that

1024
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:32,140
such as their oil here is a black sludge

1025
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:35,108
because they can't use BHO or anything

1026
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:40,420
else so they use alcohol Sonya is that

1027
00:43:35,108 --> 00:43:43,449
wonderful 2003 sludge flavor on top of

1028
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:45,818
it on that there's a bubbles as well or

1029
00:43:43,449 --> 00:43:48,219
black sludge because again they can't

1030
00:43:45,818 --> 00:43:50,469
use BHO that's a class three felony here

1031
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:53,078
so in Hawaii you need to work on your

1032
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:56,939
laws here to get better medicine but it

1033
00:43:53,079 --> 00:44:02,079
was really just got a you can actually

1034
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:05,710
use alcohol and do a really fast wash in

1035
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,930
an ultrasonic machine for 30 seconds or

1036
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:24,639
less than a minute and you come out with

1037
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:29,500
absolutely did you hear that Hawaii such

1038
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:31,960
a boring problem what's that Mike I know

1039
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,028
it's such a boring problem making light

1040
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,900
colored oil yeah there's plenty of ways

1041
00:44:34,028 --> 00:44:38,559
of doing that

1042
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:40,599
just fill your solvent down right you

1043
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:43,599
could use filtration there's lots of

1044
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:46,778
ways of making nice or alcohol right

1045
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:51,670
make dark oil it just says that yeah a

1046
00:44:46,778 --> 00:44:52,900
little behind bootstrapping it so I mean

1047
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:55,150
they're they still haven't caught up

1048
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,130
their technology as well as I don't

1049
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:59,048
think they get out to the shows to see

1050
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:02,260
what technologies out you know much less

1051
00:44:59,048 --> 00:45:04,028
what of roto vape is the actual cannabis

1052
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,130
culture there at chann like you must

1053
00:45:04,028 --> 00:45:07,838
know people that are like born and bred

1054
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:10,660
living there like that are growing

1055
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:12,578
beautiful herbs and life and I have

1056
00:45:10,659 --> 00:45:14,078
beautiful herb that is much better than

1057
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:16,809
what's grown there and I've known people

1058
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:19,099
living here for decades so I get good

1059
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:22,069
herb here and get a good hash

1060
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:23,838
but it's just the system itself there's

1061
00:45:22,068 --> 00:45:25,639
two dispensaries on the island so

1062
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:27,798
there's only two groves and they have to

1063
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,420
grow and produce what they produce so

1064
00:45:27,798 --> 00:45:30,829
not only they're going to produce that

1065
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,838
they have to extract it they have to

1066
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:35,269
package it they have to put it in the

1067
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:37,639
bottles and then you know get a show so

1068
00:45:35,268 --> 00:45:41,298
it's still very limited in supply I

1069
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:44,538
would say ten types of herb three types

1070
00:45:41,298 --> 00:45:47,088
of hash three types of partridges

1071
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:48,920
they're not allowed edibles here which

1072
00:45:47,088 --> 00:45:51,920
is different from when I got married in

1073
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,719
Alaska they now are allowed to have

1074
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,519
concentrates where they start off with

1075
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:57,829
edibles couldn't have concentrates now

1076
00:45:55,518 --> 00:46:00,828
they have concentrates whereas here in

1077
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:02,539
Hawaii there are no edibles and that's a

1078
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:05,449
problem for people they do have pills

1079
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:08,329
which are popular but no edible they

1080
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:11,420
also do allow home growing though a

1081
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:15,170
certain number of clients correct yes I

1082
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:17,719
think it's for plants we wanted to take

1083
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:21,920
a minute to to Hawaii

1084
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:23,809
cannabis Expo Dana CG Oni and he just

1085
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,380
invited us to come and we're gonna be

1086
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:30,048
doing a presentation on preserving Aloha

1087
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,660
the regenerative cannabis agriculture

1088
00:46:30,048 --> 00:46:35,088
and it's just amazing like we've been

1089
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:37,399
having unbelievable conversations and

1090
00:46:35,088 --> 00:46:39,558
we've seen some beautiful weed from

1091
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,680
Hawaii we were just at the Emerald cup

1092
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:44,599
and the pakalolo farmers and a lot of

1093
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:46,998
the cooperatives that are going on there

1094
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:50,690
and all of the islands we're gonna be

1095
00:46:46,998 --> 00:46:52,639
doing a demo here Aloha love tour coming

1096
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:54,528
up we're gonna go visit a whole bunch of

1097
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:57,798
farms and that outreach is just massive

1098
00:46:54,528 --> 00:47:00,018
and we're gonna go kama ina style we're

1099
00:46:57,798 --> 00:47:01,699
going to the farms we're just gonna go

1100
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:03,409
and visit we're gonna hang out we're

1101
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:07,400
gonna share some knowledge of the Hawaii

1102
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:09,409
and some of our original inspiration you

1103
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:13,068
know was going to Kauai and being in the

1104
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:15,798
islands and natural farming is a huge

1105
00:47:13,068 --> 00:47:17,420
explosion and a wave of consciousness

1106
00:47:15,798 --> 00:47:19,759
that's happening through cannabis right

1107
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:23,088
now and a lot of that came into America

1108
00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:25,579
from Hawaii so there there are a lot of

1109
00:47:23,088 --> 00:47:28,068
amazing people on Hawaii growing it's

1110
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:30,528
the system that's really kind of bunk so

1111
00:47:28,068 --> 00:47:31,880
like you know having to be able to it's

1112
00:47:30,528 --> 00:47:32,400
actually kind of a blessing to be able

1113
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,890
to have an

1114
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,050
grated system where you grow and produce

1115
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:38,789
all your own stuff but if there's more

1116
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:41,340
people involved you know so you can get

1117
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:43,440
some you know different products on the

1118
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,809
table that was yeah idea like never

1119
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,659
before that community is reaching out to

1120
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:51,750

00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:46,858
up mmm I'm gonna get down to the u.s.

1139
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:48,449
one of these days it was definitely a

1140
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:50,219
Hawaii especially I mean that's just

1141
00:48:48,449 --> 00:48:51,289
like a hop skip and a jump from

1142
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:54,358
Vancouver

1143
00:48:51,289 --> 00:48:58,170
well fellow named Chris Cole took my

1144
00:48:54,358 --> 00:49:01,139
class couple years ago and he's the I

1145
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:04,199
think product manager at a place called

1146
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:06,139
Maui grown or something like that he

1147
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:08,519
seems to be pretty knowledgeable on

1148
00:49:06,139 --> 00:49:09,298
extraction but yeah it sounds like their

1149
00:49:08,518 --> 00:49:12,748
hands are tied

1150
00:49:09,298 --> 00:49:13,829
based on what regulation allows be

1151
00:49:12,748 --> 00:49:16,139
interesting to see if they could

1152
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:18,089
actually get decent rosin because I

1153
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:21,838
would certainly think that that would be

1154
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:24,900
something that that BHO isn't allowed so

1155
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:28,438
the next best sort of flavorful extract

1156
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:30,838
that's that high you know Terp extract

1157
00:49:28,438 --> 00:49:32,879
you can get and in a pretty safe process

1158
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:36,498
that doesn't involve flammable solvent

1159
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:39,059
would be would be bubble rosin now I

1160
00:49:36,498 --> 00:49:41,488
mean it's probably more of an opinion

1161
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:43,859
than anything I mean I'll tell you some

1162
00:49:41,489 --> 00:49:46,409
of the tastiest Terr pious loudest [ __ ]

1163
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:48,478
I ever put in a pike was Sam's dry sift

1164
00:49:46,409 --> 00:49:50,608
and I think just because other people

1165
00:49:48,478 --> 00:49:52,528
have never have never seen it they don't

1166
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:55,828
think it exists so they say things like

1167
00:49:52,528 --> 00:49:57,900
Oh alive resins the loudest well just

1168
00:49:55,829 --> 00:50:00,028
the for commercial production note can

1169
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:02,519
that actually be something that's viable

1170
00:50:00,028 --> 00:50:04,829
can you actually make a product that way

1171
00:50:02,518 --> 00:50:09,178
reliably and well I mean Cuban grower

1172
00:50:04,829 --> 00:50:11,278
did he seems to have a version of 99.9

1173
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:13,559
percent it's all relative to what your

1174
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:15,659
customers are willing to pay sure very

1175
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:18,059
limited supply though I mean like what

1176
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:19,768
you want to have a you know a more

1177
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:21,340
robust process kind of like what you

1178
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:25,069
guys run

1179
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:27,550
yeah I don't know the main difference

1180
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:31,760
between dry cept and water hash and

1181
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:35,019
flour rosin is rice if we get a very

1182
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:38,960
small yield from the plant with water

1183
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:40,519
you get a much higher you okay but the

1184
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,150
thing that we haven't mentioned is that

1185
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:47,090
the way you grow Sam and your

1186
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:50,300
understanding of grown growing your like

1187
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:52,220
a plant whisperer the your your plant

1188
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,260
express themselves little frightening

1189
00:50:52,219 --> 00:51:02,449
way to grow in the ground

1190
00:50:54,260 --> 00:51:06,290
I know organically in the ground there's

1191
00:51:02,449 --> 00:51:08,869
some with some with some yeah and in

1192
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:11,690
white they have a longer season you can

1193
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:15,139
grow outdoors and why you grow really

1194
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:18,079
late Merilee drug varieties they produce

1195
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:20,269
fantastic product but it's not

1196
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,980
mass-produced people are growing small

1197
00:51:20,269 --> 00:51:26,509
amounts of it because it's not

1198
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:28,699
mass-produced yeah yeah we'll see one

1199
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:31,280
day maybe hey Sam I got a question

1200
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:33,319
around Island produced weed you know

1201
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,350
like a lot of the Caribbean islands have

1202
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:39,430
very high calcium levels in the soil

1203
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:41,750
because they're basically coral or

1204
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:44,000
volcanic but there's still a lot of

1205
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:47,059
calcium is there ways that you can

1206
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:51,050
counteract all the calcium richness in

1207
00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:56,269
Island soils so yeah what do you want to

1208
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:58,760
do you want to raise the pH or is it the

1209
00:51:56,269 --> 00:52:00,650
pH because I think it's just a high

1210
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:04,640
preponderance of calcium in the soil

1211
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:07,160
just totally screws up some varieties

1212
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:20,809
and and they're trying to solve that

1213
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:23,809
down in the Caribbean yeah I think it's

1214
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:26,029
because to make them I'm not sure if it

1215
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:30,079
has to do whether it's a coral island or

1216
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:32,860
a volcanic island the Caribbean islands

1217
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,829
are coral based

1218
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:37,650
so that it has a higher coral coral

1219
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:41,440
reefs which then turn into limestone

1220
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:43,660
calcite carbonate so that's generally

1221
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,090
gonna make more basic but one of the

1222
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:49,750
nice things about the tropics is you can

1223
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:53,440
there's world ruin world around in the

1224
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:56,349
tropics is coco coir one of the things

1225
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,840
that is a big issue with cars the salt

1226
00:52:56,349 --> 00:53:04,139
ratio but it is core does act as a good

1227
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:06,910
buffer for calcium but I generally

1228
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:10,629
Dragonfly hit the head on the nail when

1229
00:53:06,909 --> 00:53:12,789
you look at fungal dominant soils in

1230
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:15,789
general fungal dominant soils tend to be

1231
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:18,429
slightly more acidic so you know

1232
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:21,279
throwing compost would a lot of Coco

1233
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:22,960
Coco pith or cocoa husk is going to help

1234
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:34,540
kind of buffer some of the calcium

1235
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:40,539
chloride mulch mulch like your life

1236
00:53:34,539 --> 00:53:42,099
depends on it become a mound farmer when

1237
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:45,130
you think you have too much on there

1238
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:48,339
throw 10 times more of stuff on top of

1239
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:49,059
it and create a mound and yo-you mulch

1240
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:54,660
mulch

1241
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:54,659
there's not oh it's called compost

1242
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:02,560
because you're just putting the compost

1243
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:05,769
on top of the beds on top of the plants

1244
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:11,590
you know cold compost is mulching layer

1245
00:54:05,769 --> 00:54:13,179
there yeah that's true and you know even

1246
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:15,400
on Jimmy there's a lot of different

1247
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:17,949
kinds of soil so I mean you got red dirt

1248
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:21,010
you got the black dirt you got the hard

1249
00:54:17,949 --> 00:54:23,379
coral dirt in wet side of the island dry

1250
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:25,510
side so you know if you're on an island

1251
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:27,130
you have to really use if you need to

1252
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:30,220
you know different parts of the island

1253
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:32,289
for my favorite thing about Jamaica and

1254
00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:34,480
generally any island and watching new

1255
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:37,509
people be like I'm gonna go and grow

1256
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,889
herb like in Jamaica or st. Lucia and

1257
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:44,350
wherever and I'm just like we'll have

1258
00:54:38,889 --> 00:54:46,389
you ever for my prior life is an

1259
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:48,818
industrial scientist we did a

1260
00:54:46,389 --> 00:54:50,288
a wood decay study on the Island of

1261
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:53,768
Hawaii as it turns out

1262
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:56,500
Hawaii is an ideal place to study wood

1263
00:54:53,768 --> 00:54:58,689
preservatives because of the fauna there

1264
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:02,260
and what I noticed is that from one side

1265
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:04,838
of the island to the other the the

1266
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:06,490
stratigraphy or the geography or the

1267
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:10,088
geology I guess that's the word I'm

1268
00:55:06,489 --> 00:55:12,729
looking for changed immensely on one

1269
00:55:10,088 --> 00:55:16,630
side of the island we basically needed a

1270
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:20,380
chisel to put stakes into the ground the

1271
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:22,750
island dirt or the soil was like so hard

1272
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:25,630
and almost impenetrable and on the other

1273
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:29,230
side of the island it was like floral

1274
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:31,750
and swampy and lush it was just it was

1275
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:34,599
just so different that it was just only

1276
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:37,000
literally I think maybe about like 20 or

1277
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:40,000
30 miles from each other it was just a

1278
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,880
completely different geology so is that

1279
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,900
to known as the leeward and the

1280
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,940
essentially in sailing in sailing mini

1281
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:52,119
it has to do with where the prevailing

1282
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:53,980
wind is right exactly so obviously if

1283
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:55,690
you're an island you get you get hit

1284
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:57,250
from a prevailing wind side generally

1285
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:59,079
it's you know in the Atlantic Ocean

1286
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:01,509
Caribbean it's going to be facing the

1287
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:02,619
Atlantic that wind is that side of the

1288
00:56:01,509 --> 00:56:05,409
mountain is going to have most of the

1289
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:08,440
moisture picked up and then deposited on

1290
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:16,028
on the leeward side I think it is where

1291
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:18,579
the rain or the rain shadow says that's

1292
00:56:16,028 --> 00:56:20,798
wrong straws and the toothbrushes and

1293
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:25,269
the tampon wrappers and all the other

1294
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:26,768
disgusting [ __ ] ends up now - sorry it's

1295
00:56:25,268 --> 00:56:29,379
sittin Sam what were you about to say

1296
00:56:26,768 --> 00:56:32,439
it's like I thought I was saying that

1297
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,250
when an island has a mountain like

1298
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,400
Hawaii

1299
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:39,869
it's got the north side in the south

1300
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:45,750
side the north side is much wetter than

1301
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:45,750
for example exactly what it was Sam

1302
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:50,170
interesting so in terms of the islands

1303
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:53,890
you know

1304
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:55,750
let's take you know Antigua for instance

1305
00:56:53,889 --> 00:56:59,469
you who's got an interesting thing on

1306
00:56:55,750 --> 00:57:00,400
unraveling their you know coral has a

1307
00:56:59,469 --> 00:57:04,089
lot of calcium

1308
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:06,119
would it be best to to dig up that soil

1309
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:08,320
and and amend it

1310
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:10,809
you know what would your your thoughts

1311
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:14,230
on on going directly in the dirt and and

1312
00:57:10,809 --> 00:57:16,329
using amendments the I wouldn't a

1313
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,920
thousand percent just build mounds on

1314
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:19,360
top of it and forget about what's

1315
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,789
happening below it because what's

1316
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:24,970
happening below it's gonna transform as

1317
00:57:21,789 --> 00:57:27,340
soon as every worm in the area comes and

1318
00:57:24,969 --> 00:57:31,149
all the micro but nothing changes

1319
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:33,910
earth-like microbiology so it's it's

1320
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:35,380
kind of just like oh especially in

1321
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:36,789
Jamaica I mean there's every kind of

1322
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,559
vegetation in the world so what you'd

1323
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:42,099
want to do it was just crap you know get

1324
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,650
a machete and just go and just start

1325
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:47,019
getting all the different kinds of you

1326
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:48,460
know leaves and stuff that you can you

1327
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:51,130
know and then you find some you know

1328
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:52,900
it's around for some go do we're on

1329
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,180
there a lot less sticks there's lots of

1330
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:57,730
sticks around and and the sticks or are

1331
00:57:55,179 --> 00:58:00,489
incredibly important and and banana

1332
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:02,139
trees are always constantly shedding and

1333
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:06,069
banana trees are you know really

1334
00:58:02,139 --> 00:58:08,529
prolific around any tropical area and

1335
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:11,680
when we were injured we chipped up all

1336
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:13,540
the banana and the bamboo that was down

1337
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:15,309
on the ground that was fresh and the

1338
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:18,849
brown so you get a mixed green and brown

1339
00:58:15,309 --> 00:58:22,360
and within two weeks we were directly

1340
00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:25,480
planting inside of that shipped you know

1341
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:29,289
mass and the plants just took right off

1342
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:31,840
and most most have little deposits on

1343
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:34,449
the land somewhere pretty decent soils

1344
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:37,570
so you can kind of layer that on the top

1345
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:39,099
of whatever you've prepared as a bed you

1346
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:42,010
can kind of use that as a starting off

1347
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:43,839
point for your transplanting or even you

1348
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:46,000
know get some of the topsoil off and

1349
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:49,150
kind of pull it on top of the bed and

1350
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,280
sort of cap off what you've created or

1351
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,990
organic matter wise and then you know

1352
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,490
the plant grows and you just keep doing

1353
00:58:52,989 --> 00:58:57,069
it over the course of the year or you

1354
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:59,619
could just take Uriel and make like a

1355
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:02,080
hole like this inside of the material

1356
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:04,569
fill it with some nice dirt that you

1357
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,299
feel like has you know a good proper

1358
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:09,760
ratio good balance and then plant a seed

1359
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:12,370
directly into there and by the time that

1360
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,700
the plant matures it's actually ready to

1361
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:14,699
come

1362
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:20,289
breakdown material so so the

1363
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:22,269
microbiology is breaking down over time

1364
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:24,069
and and it's interesting you said I only

1365
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:26,469
have experience in Costa Rica growing

1366
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:28,538
actually crops in that particular

1367
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:30,459
climate and it's similar but it's

1368
00:59:28,539 --> 00:59:32,499
different because the soil down there is

1369
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:35,170
very the biology is very different but

1370
00:59:32,498 --> 00:59:36,728
it's it has its own challenges so it's

1371
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:38,798
really it's great to hear that the

1372
00:59:36,728 --> 00:59:41,018
layering technique is working for you

1373
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:42,460
guys in in terms of Jamaica because that

1374
00:59:41,018 --> 00:59:43,959
you know I've gotten a lot of questions

1375
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:46,210
for people in Antigua and things like

1376
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:48,519
that and I don't have enough experience

1377
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:51,900
so this is it's great we can have this

1378
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:51,899
dialogue here to share that information

1379
00:59:56,610 --> 01:00:02,200
[Music]

1380
00:59:58,018 --> 01:00:05,228
next crop on the ground cover them with

1381
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:08,108
about 3 feet of mulch and the potatoes

1382
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:10,808
would root into the ground and just from

1383
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:12,639
right through the mulch and then

1384
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:14,859
afterwards I didn't have to dig up the

1385
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:18,548
tomatoes I just had to pull the mulch

1386
01:00:14,858 --> 01:00:20,469
off hmm well that's kind of what I'm

1387
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:22,778
talking about with Mound life I mean

1388
01:00:20,469 --> 01:00:24,849
it's it's kind of a man mentality it's

1389
01:00:22,778 --> 01:00:26,798
almost like you're just a mob gardener

1390
01:00:24,849 --> 01:00:29,170
you're just you'd plant as much as you

1391
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:32,018
can on the mound and and use it to your

1392
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:33,670
advantage it also saves water and and

1393
01:00:32,018 --> 01:00:36,848
these are not just techniques that work

1394
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:39,880
in Jamaica of course like we you've gone

1395
01:00:36,849 --> 01:00:42,519
to Bali Thailand South East Asia

1396
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,318
different places Hawaii all the islands

1397
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:46,118
we're going again to Hawaii like we said

1398
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:50,409
so we're really excited but these

1399
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:52,900
techniques are not really they work

1400
01:00:50,409 --> 01:00:55,598
everywhere we're in British Columbia we

1401
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:58,568
do it we are walking looking all down

1402
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:00,489
the west coast to Michigan tomato I'm in

1403
01:00:58,568 --> 01:01:02,920
Jamaica I'm in Bali it's it's working

1404
01:01:00,489 --> 01:01:04,298
everywhere it does change what you're

1405
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,579
layering you know I mean the

1406
01:01:04,298 --> 01:01:09,699
biodiversity of your bio region is what

1407
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:11,979
you're gonna use so I were just not

1408
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:13,659
really needing to bring men mints all

1409
01:01:11,978 --> 01:01:16,179
over the place we're using what we have

1410
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:18,759
there and also plastic culture I mean

1411
01:01:16,179 --> 01:01:21,248
mark mentioned the word plastic and

1412
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:23,710
plastic is is really killing the earth

1413
01:01:21,248 --> 01:01:26,079
and its really stab looking at modern

1414
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:28,710
agriculture use plastics so much

1415
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:32,380
and again layering and using mulch is

1416
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:34,449
the answer to to plastic it stops weeds

1417
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:36,309
from growing and it builds soil I could

1418
01:01:34,449 --> 01:01:38,529
go on forever about we're super

1419
01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:41,019
solutions orientated but I just wanted

1420
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:43,840
to take one one second to talk about a

1421
01:01:41,019 --> 01:01:47,590
major problem and can save the world

1422
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:49,390
but plastic culture had cannot so it's

1423
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:51,789
really important that we become

1424
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:54,699
intelligent on how we're planting this

1425
01:01:51,789 --> 01:01:56,559
incredibly sacred plant that is what we

1426
01:01:54,699 --> 01:01:58,299
were talking about earlier going to save

1427
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,130
the world is going to change people's

1428
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:05,080
minds you need to do it in a way that's

1429
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:09,010
respectful to the earth will stop

1430
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:12,610
plastic is for oil to get too expensive

1431
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:15,610
to make single-use plastic until it oil

1432
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:21,849
is expensive we will have plastic or

1433
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:23,579
never damn it's so sadly true but we'll

1434
01:02:21,849 --> 01:02:26,829
see

1435
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:28,809
well dr. mark had some interesting

1436
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:31,360
thoughts on plastic I think last time we

1437
01:02:28,809 --> 01:02:32,739
were on the show and and if Mark if you

1438
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:35,320
can elaborate a little bit more on the

1439
01:02:32,739 --> 01:02:40,029
on the knowledge you have with with

1440
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:41,200
using hemp you know the last time we

1441
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:43,630
talked you had some really interesting

1442
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:47,469
thoughts about that and I was wondering

1443
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:50,050
if you could share some more that it

1444
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:56,289
looks like mark is not with us at the

1445
01:02:50,050 --> 01:03:00,580
moment oh no I thought he was the one

1446
01:02:56,289 --> 01:03:01,960
talking about how plastic is not he felt

1447
01:03:00,579 --> 01:03:03,400
like it was viable he had some very

1448
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,920
interesting thoughts that are different

1449
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,869
than what I've heard I don't know enough

1450
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:11,470
about and plastics to speed on it but I

1451
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:13,029
I'm so fascinated in its the problem

1452
01:03:11,469 --> 01:03:16,449
that we've seen is that there's no

1453
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:18,730
conventional recycler that will take the

1454
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:21,399
current hemp plastic that's being made

1455
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:23,409
that's out there or at least like I

1456
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:26,050
think it's Cerner who is pushing that

1457
01:03:23,409 --> 01:03:28,480
currently so the problem is we can get a

1458
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:30,460
hand plastic to the problem is you can't

1459
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:34,090
recycle it no recycling place would take

1460
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:37,119
it so there's a whole problem of the

1461
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:39,460
supply chain still that these products

1462
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:43,119
are created but the they haven't figured

1463
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:46,650
how to break it down right a pet plant

1464
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:49,960
is biodegradable you don't have to

1465
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:54,160
recycle it you can you know put it in

1466
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:57,610
compost piles these are not compostable

1467
01:03:54,159 --> 01:04:04,269
though right so that then answers the

1468
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:05,680
question and the thing that makes you

1469
01:04:04,269 --> 01:04:08,199
know the way that it's tucked together

1470
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:11,019
you know what is emulsified not together

1471
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:13,089
which is polymers and a half-life of

1472
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:15,400
these polymers you know just because you

1473
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:17,410
can't meet it with a naked eye doesn't

1474
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,820
mean that it's not just lying there in

1475
01:04:17,409 --> 01:04:22,329
the soil and what they call

1476
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:25,240
biodegradable which definitely you know

1477
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:29,009
severely changes microbiology in the

1478
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:32,229
soil if you're having residual polymers

1479
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:35,500
sure yeah

1480
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:37,389
we're uh we're pretty messed up we we

1481
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:41,489
start using our heads to start trying to

1482
01:04:37,389 --> 01:04:44,889
fix problems and three new problems and

1483
01:04:41,489 --> 01:04:47,409
I mean the intention was good however

1484
01:04:44,889 --> 01:04:52,289
it's still not done we still have to

1485
01:04:47,409 --> 01:04:59,529
what do they say what the road to hell

1486
01:04:52,289 --> 01:05:05,670
good intentions my friend I know that

1487
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:08,050
Donna packaging sa na Colorado is making

1488
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:10,360
different biodegradable plastics and

1489
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:14,890
hemp plastics and there are really heavy

1490
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:18,550
good packaging company and packaging is

1491
01:05:14,889 --> 01:05:21,940
a really important issue to talk about

1492
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:24,370
and even with hemp cultivation I mean do

1493
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:26,409
we need and in New York I know it's like

1494
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:29,409
there's a few classification perhaps

1495
01:05:26,409 --> 01:05:31,299
there's cannabinoid and industrial hemp

1496
01:05:29,409 --> 01:05:34,089
and if you add or again you might think

1497
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:36,100
industr does the enemy you know and you

1498
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:37,870
can't have male and female plants around

1499
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:40,420
but when you're talking about a food

1500
01:05:37,869 --> 01:05:43,480
source or you're talking about plastics

1501
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:44,619
instead of you know polymers and and

1502
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,550
maybe there's polymers in the hemp

1503
01:05:44,619 --> 01:05:51,339
plastic I don't know where's mark but

1504
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:52,869
yeah we are needing to move forward with

1505
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:55,390
intelligent

1506
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:57,640
culture decisions and having industrial

1507
01:05:55,389 --> 01:06:00,009
hemp growing on earth is extremely

1508
01:05:57,639 --> 01:06:02,440
important for fibers I mean we're

1509
01:06:00,009 --> 01:06:04,838
wearing cotton and cotton this still

1510
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:06,909
slave laborers being used to produce

1511
01:06:04,838 --> 01:06:09,759
cotton all over the place and if we had

1512
01:06:06,909 --> 01:06:12,159
him more hemp textiles we would know

1513
01:06:09,759 --> 01:06:14,289
where it came from and the supply chain

1514
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:17,588
of where it came from so it's all part

1515
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:20,619
of that see I don't think anybody's

1516
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:22,058
producing hemp fiber they need to Canada

1517
01:06:20,619 --> 01:06:24,789
or America

1518
01:06:22,059 --> 01:06:30,690
yeah exactly and I wish that that you

1519
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:34,660
know we could somehow see be instead

1520
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:37,630
Taylor so one gate for you know big

1521
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:39,818
wide-open Prairie is that are you know

1522
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:43,180
growing canola are growing corn or

1523
01:06:39,818 --> 01:06:45,608
brochure you know alfalfa it would be

1524
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:48,848
really amazing to see a lot of textile

1525
01:06:45,608 --> 01:06:52,480
going on in Canada it's all about the

1526
01:06:48,849 --> 01:06:55,210
machinery well it's a quick oh go ahead

1527
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:58,449
like no this is Colin oh I was just

1528
01:06:55,210 --> 01:07:00,130
saying that there's a couple mills in

1529
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:03,669
New York State that are very interested

1530
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:06,910
in the material itself I think for them

1531
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:09,460
it's about is there a market for them

1532
01:07:06,909 --> 01:07:11,230
and how do they learn to work within

1533
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:14,199
that market and that's what I know from

1534
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:15,998
from talking to them but a you know I

1535
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:17,798
would love to see more fabrics and

1536
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:19,808
things like that and Marcus you had

1537
01:07:17,798 --> 01:07:21,998
mentioned M Taylor that was hoodlum and

1538
01:07:19,809 --> 01:07:24,548
I wear their jackets all the time and

1539
01:07:21,998 --> 01:07:28,118
you know it's not a hundred percent damp

1540
01:07:24,548 --> 01:07:29,440
but it's a it's a very nice brand that's

1541
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:34,170
been around for a while that's been

1542
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:37,450
really embracing Hampton and t really is

1543
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:39,430
processing and and the factories that

1544
01:07:37,449 --> 01:07:44,818
you have to build for processing

1545
01:07:39,429 --> 01:07:44,818
spinning wheat multi-million dollar

1546
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:53,949
fifty miles of the where it's meeting

1547
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:57,789
grown you can't be trucking the hemp all

1548
01:07:53,949 --> 01:08:00,068
over the universe sure well I know a

1549
01:07:57,789 --> 01:08:03,250
Taylor is working on a project in the

1550
01:08:00,068 --> 01:08:05,739
u.s. to produce fibers grow them in the

1551
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:07,840
us and produce fibers and and you know

1552
01:08:05,739 --> 01:08:08,979
make make products for sale that's one

1553
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:12,700
of the things that they're trying to do

1554
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:14,800
in 2020 yeah ultimately when you look at

1555
01:08:12,699 --> 01:08:18,460
the evolution and deployment of hemp in

1556
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:21,759
North America the a lot of Europe as

1557
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:24,220
well as they didn't ban hemp as heavily

1558
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:27,279
as North America did during Prohibition

1559
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:30,338
so many of the many of the European

1560
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:32,890
clothing designers continued to have

1561
01:08:30,338 --> 01:08:36,359
access to hemp in forms of different

1562
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:40,480
forms of canvas or silk or soap blends

1563
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:43,210
now that hemp has slowly been regulated

1564
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:46,509
here in North America we're starting to

1565
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:48,880
see a lot of brands focusing on CBD but

1566
01:08:46,509 --> 01:08:52,899
there are some brands working on either

1567
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:57,220
food or fiber or plastic prod products

1568
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:59,858
the issue is is like mentioned you know

1569
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:02,470
you need to have you know your supply

1570
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:05,048
relatively close you know within two to

1571
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:08,380
three hundred kilometres and enough

1572
01:09:05,048 --> 01:09:11,350
acreage being cultivated in order to you

1573
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:13,539
know process and run that facility that

1574
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:17,350
lumber mill that fiber plant the quartic

1575
01:09:13,539 --> 01:09:19,810
ating line or even seed line for seed

1576
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:22,359
oil processing and operate that plant

1577
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:29,819
for 300 to 320 days a year

1578
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:34,329
in order to you know anybody who

1579
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:42,039
processes any factory primary processor

1580
01:09:34,329 --> 01:09:44,159
that processes him no no I don't it all

1581
01:09:42,039 --> 01:09:48,220
has to be within 50 kilometers right

1582
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:51,309
exactly yeah that makes sense

1583
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:51,699
all right I'm back okay where do we

1584
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:58,270
begin

1585
01:09:51,699 --> 01:10:00,519
oh my gosh yeah I don't know my i think

1586
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:02,620
the russians hacked my computer in

1587
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:04,320
fashion they didn't want to be telling

1588
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:09,569
the truth

1589
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:12,309
let's see here so yeah have plastic so

1590
01:10:09,569 --> 01:10:15,789
the people out selling hemp plastic

1591
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:16,789
right now are you know hemp is a is a is

1592
01:10:15,789 --> 01:10:20,479
a source

1593
01:10:16,789 --> 01:10:26,779
of cellulose but so is switchgrass and

1594
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:29,949
so is trees so it has to be economical

1595
01:10:26,779 --> 01:10:32,750
if it's not economical it's difficult to

1596
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:35,119
convince people to put capital

1597
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:37,130
investment into a business that's not

1598
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:39,500
going to make money so it has to be able

1599
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:41,090
to make money and Sam hit the nail on

1600
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,520
the head in fact I'll go back to

1601
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:46,520
something that Sam I just said which is

1602
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:49,550
as long as we have cheap oil and cheap

1603
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:52,100
petrochemical sources we will continue

1604
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:56,409
to create and make and use single-use

1605
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:59,990
plastic the other thing that cheap oil

1606
01:10:56,409 --> 01:11:02,389
unfortunately handicaps is the cost of

1607
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:07,279
all alternative energy whether it's

1608
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:10,539
windmills dams wave catchers whatever

1609
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:14,359
you use in to generate energy ultimately

1610
01:11:10,539 --> 01:11:17,420
the cost of that alternative energy is

1611
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:20,299
pegged to the price of fossil fuels

1612
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:23,659
because of the infrastructure that

1613
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:26,510
currently exists today and that's you

1614
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:29,500
know Walmart Amazon the industrial

1615
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:31,789
manufacturing base which uses a lot of

1616
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:34,850
petrochemical fuel because that's the

1617
01:11:31,789 --> 01:11:37,539
cheapest form of fuel on the planet you

1618
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:46,039
know the notion that we can somehow turn

1619
01:11:37,539 --> 01:11:48,769
have into fuel is is really not based in

1620
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:54,829
reality at all because it actually

1621
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:58,490
consumes more fuel to convert have into

1622
01:11:54,829 --> 01:12:01,130
ethanol than it then it creates so

1623
01:11:58,489 --> 01:12:04,069
you're actually it's a negative it it

1624
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:06,140
actually uses more petrochemicals and

1625
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:09,619
the only reason why they can pull that

1626
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:14,420
stunt off down in Brazil and places that

1627
01:12:09,619 --> 01:12:16,369
are growing sugarcane is because they

1628
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:19,069
have a lot of cane juice which is

1629
01:12:16,369 --> 01:12:21,289
enriched with sugar which all you do is

1630
01:12:19,069 --> 01:12:23,840
you throw yeast in there and then the

1631
01:12:21,289 --> 01:12:26,390
yeast makes the sugar poop out ethanol

1632
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:29,630
and yeah you could put ethanol in as a

1633
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:30,650
liquid fuel down in places where there

1634
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:33,140
already is

1635
01:12:30,649 --> 01:12:36,619
investment made into an infrastructure

1636
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:40,280
to grow sugar cane on a shit-ton [ __ ]

1637
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:43,250
scale right and so that's why Ethan all

1638
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:46,729
can make a solution down there but

1639
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:49,279
turning happen to ethanol I always see

1640
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:51,559
all these memes about all the things

1641
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:55,460
that hemp can do and turning it into a

1642
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:58,880
liquid biofuel is absolutely crazy and

1643
01:12:55,460 --> 01:13:01,698
and and and nuts and and and you can get

1644
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:05,230
the seed oil seed oils can be burned but

1645
01:13:01,698 --> 01:13:08,210
it has such a more higher value as a

1646
01:13:05,229 --> 01:13:11,509
nutritional product and what you can do

1647
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:13,969
with seed oils as opposed to the lowest

1648
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:16,699
value of something that you just put

1649
01:13:13,969 --> 01:13:20,060
into an internal combustion engine or

1650
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:22,689
some generator to burn just for its fuel

1651
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:25,969
value I mean it's just absolutely

1652
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:28,639
ridiculous in fact the analysis has

1653
01:13:25,969 --> 01:13:30,619
already been done on biofuels and this

1654
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:34,909
is why you don't see cellulosic ethanol

1655
01:13:30,619 --> 01:13:38,000
being produced today is that if you take

1656
01:13:34,908 --> 01:13:39,769
the same amount of cellulose and rather

1657
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,560
than you know cellular think of

1658
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:47,929
cellulose is it's it's high molecular

1659
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:50,719
weight glucose it's a glucose molecule

1660
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:52,760
which is a sugar which it's a many many

1661
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:56,090
different copy so it sees high long

1662
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:58,250
chains and so think of that as storage

1663
01:13:56,090 --> 01:14:00,079
sunlight right so it took a lot of

1664
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:03,408
energy by the plant through

1665
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:06,439
photosynthesis to convert those photons

1666
01:14:03,408 --> 01:14:08,539
into this long molecule so the wonderful

1667
01:14:06,439 --> 01:14:11,299
thing about cellulose and Cellular's

1668
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:13,640
derived from heme is it's amazingly

1669
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:15,409
strong you know depending on how you

1670
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:18,380
measure its strength it could be as

1671
01:14:15,408 --> 01:14:22,670
strong as super high-strength fibers

1672
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:28,310
like Kevlar so it really it makes sense

1673
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:32,480
to use the heme not to digest it down to

1674
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:34,820
a sugar to feed to a yeast to poop it

1675
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:38,089
over into ethanol we're there's a

1676
01:14:34,819 --> 01:14:41,119
tremendous capacity that exists today in

1677
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:43,380
the world for grain derived ethanol we

1678
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:45,359
don't need ethanol from half

1679
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:47,640
that's stupid and it doesn't make sense

1680
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:48,719
and because it can't you can't make

1681
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:51,360
money doing it

1682
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:53,159
you'll never be capital investment into

1683
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:55,229
it but what there will be capital

1684
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:58,920
investment into is where you could use

1685
01:14:55,229 --> 01:15:02,429
the strength of the hemp fibers to

1686
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:03,840
reinforce composite materials and I

1687
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:07,260
think that that's sort of like where

1688
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:09,210
have plastic is going the current if you

1689
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:11,640
google have plastic and you go to that

1690
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:14,460
site what you'll see is that they're

1691
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:16,980
taking regular plastics like poly

1692
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:18,659
carbonate that's what my computer's made

1693
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:20,129
out that's what my I think that's what

1694
01:15:18,659 --> 01:15:22,949
my glass frame is made out of

1695
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:26,119
polycarbonate plastic it's what CD ROMs

1696
01:15:22,949 --> 01:15:30,029
are made out of polypropylene

1697
01:15:26,119 --> 01:15:32,279
polyethylene these are all petrochemical

1698
01:15:30,029 --> 01:15:34,319
derived polymers and what they're doing

1699
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:38,279
is they're taking a petrochemical

1700
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:41,759
derived polymer that cost about 25 cents

1701
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:45,409
to 75 cents a pound they're adding hemp

1702
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:49,380
fiber right in terms of either heard or

1703
01:15:45,409 --> 01:15:52,590
actually elongated fibers or oriented

1704
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:55,980
fibers right to get the inherent

1705
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:59,520
strength that those fibers give to the

1706
01:15:55,979 --> 01:16:02,459
material so now you can use say rather a

1707
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:05,190
2-inch piece of plastic in that support

1708
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:07,260
versus a you know five inch piece of

1709
01:16:05,189 --> 01:16:09,599
plastic so you're using less plastic

1710
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:12,170
because you're using the strength of the

1711
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,550
hemp fibers to be enforced of plastic

1712
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:17,720
but the problem is is that they're

1713
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:20,010
trying to sell that plastic in

1714
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:24,300
competition with the 20 cent a pound

1715
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:27,600
plastic at like 2 or 5 bucks a pound so

1716
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:28,800
who's gonna buy an incumbent at 2 or 5

1717
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,060
dollars a pound

1718
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:35,220
it still has petrochemical derived

1719
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:37,310
plastic in it right but it has happen it

1720
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:40,079
which I guess is cool right because it's

1721
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:42,630
and they're lightweight again again

1722
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:45,659
you're used the world will use less

1723
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:47,940
plastic but you know basically what

1724
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:50,269
they're competing with is one of the

1725
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:53,789
ingredients that's in their product

1726
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:55,920
right and and so there's other fibers

1727
01:16:53,789 --> 01:16:56,689
that you could use you know jute is used

1728
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,730
quite a bit

1729
01:16:56,689 --> 01:17:01,849
there's a lot of other fibers that can

1730
01:16:58,729 --> 01:17:03,919
be used other than ham I so this is what

1731
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:05,989
I've said on hash Church a few times and

1732
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,880
thanks for bringing it up because again

1733
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:09,589
it's just a reoccurring theme and I

1734
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:11,810
don't think that things have changed a

1735
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:15,100
whole lot what's really going to change

1736
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:18,140
I think and have is is not necessarily

1737
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:19,969
going to be the CBD aspect I think it's

1738
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:21,770
going to be the fact that we have to

1739
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:25,399
feed more people

1740
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:28,370
unless irritable farmable land in the

1741
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:32,269
future and so if you have to raise

1742
01:17:28,369 --> 01:17:35,079
protein per acre to feed livestock right

1743
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:40,160
now soybean delivers somewhere between

1744
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:42,559
360 to 380 pounds of soluble protein per

1745
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:45,109
acre with hemp they believe the

1746
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:48,080
estimates are somewhere north of a

1747
01:17:45,109 --> 01:17:51,049
thousand pounds an acre so when it comes

1748
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:54,319
to how do you use an acre of land most

1749
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:57,110
efficiently raise a plant that produces

1750
01:17:54,319 --> 01:18:00,198
protein that humans need and animals

1751
01:17:57,109 --> 01:18:02,988
need in their diet it will be half hands

1752
01:18:00,198 --> 01:18:05,929
down as as the winner but now you're

1753
01:18:02,988 --> 01:18:08,809
taking on the likes of Syngenta and

1754
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:11,210
Monsanto and DuPont and Cargill and

1755
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:14,620
Bungie and archers Daniel Midland

1756
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:19,880
you're taking on the large corporate

1757
01:18:14,619 --> 01:18:24,050
machine that exists and that have put

1758
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:29,869
genetically modified crops into our diet

1759
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:35,090
and into Commerce so yeah it's all up to

1760
01:18:29,869 --> 01:18:38,420
mark that hemp will not give you that

1761
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:42,650
much protein per acre I mean most

1762
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:45,289
probably they don't really know I I can

1763
01:18:42,649 --> 01:18:49,698
tell you because I was out on Hempfield

1764
01:18:45,289 --> 01:18:52,550
this this past year um ahem produces a

1765
01:18:49,698 --> 01:18:55,609
[ __ ] ton of [ __ ] seeds man I mean

1766
01:18:52,550 --> 01:19:00,289
holy [ __ ] we had a couple a couple areas

1767
01:18:55,609 --> 01:19:03,229
go out to seed Sam and believable this

1768
01:19:00,289 --> 01:19:07,519
is a growing heresy for years and years

1769
01:19:03,229 --> 01:19:10,638
and years you get ton per acre is tough

1770
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:14,219
you know well

1771
01:19:10,639 --> 01:19:19,710
right now in the world is finola that's

1772
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:22,739
a variety I develop okay that'll give

1773
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:25,889
you to fund and that way what's gonna

1774
01:19:22,738 --> 01:19:29,879
happen is that food is gonna be the main

1775
01:19:25,889 --> 01:19:32,420
driver for him to oversee bean and at

1776
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:35,550
that point there will need to be

1777
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:38,429
infrastructure to process all of this

1778
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:42,090
available hemp fiber which is a

1779
01:19:38,429 --> 01:19:45,449
byproduct and as you know Marcus hemp

1780
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:48,599
oil creates a heart healthy oil that

1781
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:50,399
should be more prevalent in humans diets

1782
01:19:48,599 --> 01:19:52,920
I think that that's gonna be the

1783
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:56,009
ultimate driver that's gonna create all

1784
01:19:52,920 --> 01:20:00,000
this hat biomass that you're gonna start

1785
01:19:56,010 --> 01:20:02,820
seeing you know paper products cardboard

1786
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,149
craft paper craft papers just think of

1787
01:20:02,819 --> 01:20:08,579
like brown paper bag or brown cardboard

1788
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:10,549
that's called craft paper which is

1789
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:13,500
nothing more than just ground up trees

1790
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:15,690
newsprint you know what newspaper is

1791
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:18,149
printed on is nothing more than just

1792
01:20:15,689 --> 01:20:20,969
ground-up trees so you know they're

1793
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:23,848
taking basically the waste off of the

1794
01:20:20,969 --> 01:20:25,859
sawmill floor after they've gone through

1795
01:20:23,849 --> 01:20:29,010
and lumbered as much as they possibly

1796
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:31,889
can out of the trees bring it across the

1797
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:34,530
street to the paper mill and use the old

1798
01:20:31,889 --> 01:20:36,329
craft process which requires sulfur

1799
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:40,170
that's why it always smells like rotten

1800
01:20:36,329 --> 01:20:42,719
eggs in and around the the paper mill

1801
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:45,929
which is right next to thee right next

1802
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:47,189
to the right next to the maybe in the

1803
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:49,618
future what you'll see is you'll see a

1804
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:51,839
ham farm and then next to the hemp farm

1805
01:20:49,618 --> 01:20:54,238
because they're processing oil and

1806
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,069
crushin seeds and and making that

1807
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:59,189
beautiful oil that Marcus has showed

1808
01:20:56,069 --> 01:21:02,279
pictures of and ultimately next door

1809
01:20:59,189 --> 01:21:05,098
will be a hemp fiber processing plant

1810
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:08,399
that'll press that [ __ ] into boards and

1811
01:21:05,099 --> 01:21:10,380
and cardboard and paper and fiber and

1812
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:13,289
all the other stuff is that going to

1813
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:18,389
replace plastic now the unfortunately

1814
01:21:13,289 --> 01:21:20,460
you can't make plastic moldable plastics

1815
01:21:18,389 --> 01:21:22,449
like polyethylene and polypropylene

1816
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:25,958
which are used

1817
01:21:22,448 --> 01:21:28,238
and processed they usually come in these

1818
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:31,359
huge barrels and they're just these

1819
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:33,129
small little beads and they melt and in

1820
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:35,948
the melt they can be processed and

1821
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:38,769
formed into the screen of your laptop or

1822
01:21:35,948 --> 01:21:41,529
the case of yourself you can't do that

1823
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:43,360
with cellulose based polymers when you

1824
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:46,179
when you heat up cellulose based

1825
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:50,339
polymers they they degrade in the melt

1826
01:21:46,179 --> 01:21:54,630
and so the cellulose based polymers like

1827
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:57,849
cellophane which is just xanthate 'add

1828
01:21:54,630 --> 01:22:01,059
cellulose just to make it soluble has to

1829
01:21:57,849 --> 01:22:03,219
be solvent based and cast and films and

1830
01:22:01,059 --> 01:22:07,860
they don't have an engineering modulus

1831
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:10,538
so they can't be used like more

1832
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:13,420
thermoset polymers which you know again

1833
01:22:10,538 --> 01:22:15,630
flowin to melt set up in the mouth make

1834
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:19,389
high molecular weight strong plastic

1835
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:21,819
components were things like marine you

1836
01:22:19,389 --> 01:22:24,880
know aeronautical and and and

1837
01:22:21,819 --> 01:22:26,558
transportation we can't rid ourselves

1838
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,510
from plastic I don't think I think

1839
01:22:26,559 --> 01:22:30,579
plastics is going to be around we just

1840
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:37,739
got to try to get away from single-use

1841
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:40,899
plastic for cellulose wasn't

1842
01:22:37,738 --> 01:22:45,129
biodegradable we would be choking in the

1843
01:22:40,899 --> 01:22:48,118
forest so cellophane could be used for a

1844
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:51,760
lot of things but clear plastic as well

1845
01:22:48,118 --> 01:22:54,969
Sophie yeah is used to wrap candy bars

1846
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:57,190
and I mean cellophane was actually I

1847
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:59,708
think it wasn't invented in DuPont I

1848
01:22:57,189 --> 01:23:02,379
think the Germans invented it but DuPont

1849
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:05,078
stole it I think and they you know again

1850
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:07,389
that was a big advance to be able to

1851
01:23:05,078 --> 01:23:09,788
keep bread fresh you know these to say

1852
01:23:07,389 --> 01:23:11,650
oh that's greater than sliced bread I

1853
01:23:09,788 --> 01:23:14,738
think that came back from the fact that

1854
01:23:11,649 --> 01:23:17,799
you could make sliced bread put it in a

1855
01:23:14,738 --> 01:23:20,738
cellophane wrapped package and it could

1856
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:23,889
actually maintain its freshness that was

1857
01:23:20,738 --> 01:23:30,368
a that was a real advance many years ago

1858
01:23:23,889 --> 01:23:35,690
better than sliced bread okay so can we

1859
01:23:30,368 --> 01:23:38,119
shift a little bit into this th CP paper

1860
01:23:35,689 --> 01:23:47,210
that was that's a great topic I was

1861
01:23:38,119 --> 01:23:49,309
gonna you had to almost predict it right

1862
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:53,359
because the smaller homologs were known

1863
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:55,850
right like tcv was known no this is just

1864
01:23:53,359 --> 01:24:01,939
you know so it's got a couple extra

1865
01:23:55,850 --> 01:24:04,970
carbons on the on the output a love of

1866
01:24:01,939 --> 01:24:07,369
the molecule and if you know about the

1867
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:09,500
biosynthetic pathway the way that's put

1868
01:24:07,369 --> 01:24:11,569
together through the polyketide synthase

1869
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:14,539
you'll know that you could change the

1870
01:24:11,569 --> 01:24:17,869
substrate on which that enzyme acts on

1871
01:24:14,539 --> 01:24:21,409
and it just extends the Tinkertoys just

1872
01:24:17,869 --> 01:24:23,180
two more carbon atoms so yeah i mean i

1873
01:24:21,409 --> 01:24:25,819
think it's really cool that they found

1874
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:29,150
it and then they they came up with a

1875
01:24:25,819 --> 01:24:31,250
synthesis of it too which is italians

1876
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:33,439
are noted for their synthetic work so

1877
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:35,329
it's beautiful to see nice piece of

1878
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:37,939
synthesis come out on how to make the

1879
01:24:35,329 --> 01:24:40,369
molecule so they can identify it and

1880
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:43,819
then they showed a little bit of data in

1881
01:24:40,369 --> 01:24:46,640
mice right i I got the paper open on my

1882
01:24:43,819 --> 01:24:50,929
desktop and look at can you can you send

1883
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:52,700
the link so I can send it in Marcus or

1884
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:55,700
send it into the YouTube chat room

1885
01:24:52,699 --> 01:24:57,590
either or no one my computer crashed I

1886
01:24:55,699 --> 01:25:04,010
lost the whole I'll just take a second

1887
01:24:57,590 --> 01:25:07,220
no problem any human being taken DHCP

1888
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:09,710
yet have you heard of any human beat I

1889
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:12,730
don't need a tiny tiny amount right

1890
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:17,149
might be found in the planet I mean

1891
01:25:12,729 --> 01:25:21,559
signaling even a 90% or 100% pure like

1892
01:25:17,149 --> 01:25:23,509
wow I have no earthly idea I mean I've

1893
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:26,780
just read about the molecule for the

1894
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:28,550
first time I think a week ago today on

1895
01:25:26,779 --> 01:25:31,550
my birthday I think I found out about

1896
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:36,199
this is just like you know just read

1897
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:37,640
about it so I have no [ __ ] clue but

1898
01:25:36,199 --> 01:25:39,649
you know there's a tie and who knows

1899
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:42,380
what the [ __ ] they're up to right in

1900
01:25:39,649 --> 01:25:44,689
fact I think from what I remember from

1901
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:47,840
reading I think on a thread on a

1902
01:25:44,689 --> 01:25:49,579
facebook chat someone told me that this

1903
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:55,250
was actually

1904
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:57,409
owned by the Italian Army you know see

1905
01:25:55,250 --> 01:26:01,100
that's what I'm payin along I think that

1906
01:25:57,409 --> 01:26:03,409
governments and and high-powered people

1907
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:05,660
have known about crazy cannabinoids in

1908
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:08,380
cannabis for you there's an as part of

1909
01:26:05,659 --> 01:26:11,539
why they squashed it because it can't be

1910
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:13,970
GMO and then there's these things that

1911
01:26:11,539 --> 01:26:17,060
keep people alive forever and and things

1912
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:21,500
in there I certainly can be GMOs you're

1913
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:23,720
wrong well anyway it also breaks rules

1914
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:26,180
so we'll see what happens when you GMO

1915
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:31,100
it I want to hear what happens when the

1916
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:36,650
human being tries it remember pure THC

1917
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:41,289
is the ultimate whatever yes twenty

1918
01:26:36,649 --> 01:26:46,219
years ago and it wasn't as strong as 90%

1919
01:26:41,289 --> 01:26:49,220
resin head hash from skunk because skunk

1920
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:52,930
had the terpenes and that potentiated

1921
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:56,869
the pure THC even stronger than pure THC

1922
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:59,180
so this is this is one curiosity that I

1923
01:26:56,869 --> 01:27:01,880
think a lot of people are interested in

1924
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:04,220
this particular molecule because they

1925
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:07,850
did some dockings you know we all know

1926
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:09,980
that the the active site of cb1 is now

1927
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:12,829
known right there's a crystal structure

1928
01:27:09,979 --> 01:27:16,189
of it right and the promise of having a

1929
01:27:12,829 --> 01:27:18,949
crystal structure of your receptor is

1930
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:21,769
think of it as like the photographic

1931
01:27:18,949 --> 01:27:24,920
negative for what you want the molecule

1932
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:27,260
to look like right key to fit in the

1933
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:29,600
lock right so if you know what the

1934
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:32,119
receptor looks like well [ __ ] you should

1935
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:34,970
be able to design the perfect lock

1936
01:27:32,119 --> 01:27:37,130
that's called rational drug design well

1937
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:40,130
rational drug design doesn't always work

1938
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:42,279
as well as it should however it's awful

1939
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:46,369
good at making predictions around

1940
01:27:42,279 --> 01:27:49,069
potency and and relative potency and and

1941
01:27:46,369 --> 01:27:54,229
the molecular mechanic calculations come

1942
01:27:49,069 --> 01:27:59,779
out that this thing has 30 x times the

1943
01:27:54,229 --> 01:28:02,289
binding energy by extending the alkyl

1944
01:27:59,779 --> 01:28:03,380
chain by two carbons which is a

1945
01:28:02,289 --> 01:28:06,319
fascinating

1946
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:09,529
Oshin because you know the question is

1947
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:11,719
is how long does that hydrophobic

1948
01:28:09,529 --> 01:28:14,630
channel and the active site of the

1949
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:16,430
enzyme it is I mean maybe you could

1950
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:17,840
extend it a little bit more maybe every

1951
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:20,030
time you extend it or maybe there's a

1952
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,920
sweet spot and have to extend it too

1953
01:28:20,029 --> 01:28:25,550
much it won't fit in there anymore or

1954
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:28,940
maybe like a lot of alkyl chains they

1955
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:32,420
end up actually not sort of wagging out

1956
01:28:28,939 --> 01:28:35,089
in a straight fashion like you would

1957
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:36,890
draw it on the molecular structure but

1958
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:39,980
what they end up actually doing is

1959
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:42,760
curling back on the molecule itself and

1960
01:28:39,979 --> 01:28:45,889
creating some kind of three-dimensional

1961
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:48,619
you know topography on the molecule that

1962
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:53,869
just gives a better fit into the

1963
01:28:48,619 --> 01:28:56,479
receptor site so I'll finish by just

1964
01:28:53,869 --> 01:28:59,840
saying the molecular mechanics predict

1965
01:28:56,479 --> 01:29:02,529
that there's going to be a 30x increase

1966
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:06,140
in binding now again that's just a

1967
01:29:02,529 --> 01:29:08,149
computer model and docking this thing on

1968
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:11,420
the computer this is what the computer

1969
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:19,009
says ultimately how potent it is I think

1970
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:23,119
needs to be fleshed out in take pure T C

1971
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:26,030
and you smoke it then delivers THC to

1972
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:31,220
the bloodstream in the brain if you eat

1973
01:29:26,029 --> 01:29:34,969
it it delivers 11 hydroxy to the brain

1974
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:38,119
and the bloodstream so after a pass

1975
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:41,360
through the liver now I'm wondering the

1976
01:29:38,119 --> 01:29:43,460
same thing about this G HCV I mean if

1977
01:29:41,359 --> 01:29:45,710
you eat it and you smoke it are there

1978
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:48,800
different potencies different effects

1979
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:50,739
because 11 hydroxy GHC don't have

1980
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:55,010
identical effects

1981
01:29:50,739 --> 01:29:57,319
no I think part of the 1100 C issue is

1982
01:29:55,010 --> 01:30:00,230
that when you increase the polarity of

1983
01:29:57,319 --> 01:30:01,840
the molecule it decreases its ability to

1984
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:04,250
cross the blood-brain barrier

1985
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:07,069
blood-brain barrier is a very very

1986
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:09,439
hydrophobic kind of passage and

1987
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:12,319
certainly changing the polarity of the

1988
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:14,839
molecule even changing from THC a the

1989
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:17,099
THC even though there's a lot of arguing

1990
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:24,059
and speculation on this

1991
01:30:17,099 --> 01:30:26,250
a lot of belief is is that that change

1992
01:30:24,059 --> 01:30:28,050
in and of itself is affecting it's

1993
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:29,698
promiscuity across the blood-brain

1994
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:31,199
barrier not everything that's in the

1995
01:30:29,698 --> 01:30:33,388
blood makes it into the brain and vice

1996
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:36,479
versa so there has to be some

1997
01:30:33,389 --> 01:30:39,239
compartment and an understanding on what

1998
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:42,029
types of properties of molecules make

1999
01:30:39,238 --> 01:30:43,678
make that happen I think I mentioned

2000
01:30:42,029 --> 01:30:46,859
this last year we're working with a

2001
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:51,359
group in Minnesota that has a liposomal

2002
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:53,549
delivery to sneak things across the

2003
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:57,299
blood-brain barrier and wouldn't it be

2004
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:59,429
great to find out that again like you

2005
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:02,400
say Sam by the time it gets in there

2006
01:30:59,429 --> 01:31:04,949
it's the 11 hydroxy and oh it's a whole

2007
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:09,689
lot less because it doesn't cross as

2008
01:31:04,948 --> 01:31:12,658
readily as THC but it also has I think a

2009
01:31:09,689 --> 01:31:15,538
higher affinity for cb1 receptor in and

2010
01:31:12,658 --> 01:31:20,069
of itself I mean that's I think what

2011
01:31:15,538 --> 01:31:24,149
most interests me is that if you can

2012
01:31:20,069 --> 01:31:26,670
increase this alkyl chain maybe again

2013
01:31:24,149 --> 01:31:29,279
the decrease in the alkyl chain is one

2014
01:31:26,670 --> 01:31:32,819
of the reasons why you see differential

2015
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:35,099
activity with THC v so the longer that

2016
01:31:32,819 --> 01:31:38,189
alkyl chain comes the more potent it is

2017
01:31:35,099 --> 01:31:40,739
and and maybe again that's something

2018
01:31:38,189 --> 01:31:43,379
that could be potentiated by terpenes or

2019
01:31:40,738 --> 01:31:45,299
something maybe that's not but I'd like

2020
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:47,699
to think and I don't know I have no data

2021
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:52,380
to support this at all but this is just

2022
01:31:47,698 --> 01:31:54,868
one of those ghost cannabinoids that has

2023
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:58,770
been in cannabis forever we're just

2024
01:31:54,868 --> 01:32:07,348
discovering it now right now he has a

2025
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:12,270
couple like this so this would so just

2026
01:32:07,349 --> 01:32:16,250
like they all have like a c3 analog like

2027
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:16,250
the variants they all have them

2028
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:26,239
much cutting out Russians keep freezing

2029
01:32:25,639 --> 01:32:28,880
mark

2030
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:32,000
oh I'm sorry there's no reason to

2031
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:37,239
believe that if the c9 is there and the

2032
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,238
c7 is there that the c11 and the C

2033
01:32:37,349 --> 01:32:42,010
a13 all these different alkyl chains

2034
01:32:40,149 --> 01:32:44,320
might be there because again it may just

2035
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:46,119
be the promiscuity of the polyketide

2036
01:32:44,319 --> 01:32:48,788
synthase that's in that particular

2037
01:32:46,118 --> 01:32:53,799
strain that determines what of those

2038
01:32:48,788 --> 01:32:56,498
minor metabolites are made but I find

2039
01:32:53,800 --> 01:33:00,429
really interesting is it's found in the

2040
01:32:56,498 --> 01:33:07,748
plant so that's yeah I can breed what

2041
01:33:00,429 --> 01:33:09,458
one that's 90% th e e yeah I mean I

2042
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:20,349
think it's always been there we just

2043
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:29,368
never knew it yeah yeah GDP GDP CD c BD

2044
01:33:20,349 --> 01:33:32,168
p CB you know right exactly

2045
01:33:29,368 --> 01:33:37,658
there's no reason to believe that's

2046
01:33:32,168 --> 01:33:39,398
unique to the c5 commander so yeah it's

2047
01:33:37,658 --> 01:33:41,288
really cool I love the fact that they

2048
01:33:39,399 --> 01:33:43,119
synthesized it too right isn't that just

2049
01:33:41,288 --> 01:33:45,518
so great shows you how easy these

2050
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:47,438
molecules are to make you know plant

2051
01:33:45,519 --> 01:33:49,510
does a really great job in synthesizing

2052
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:52,510
them but you know that they're probably

2053
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:55,479
going to put that try to express that

2054
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:59,019
the genes that code for that enzyme in

2055
01:33:55,479 --> 01:34:03,360
yeast and and and and and and and try to

2056
01:33:59,019 --> 01:34:05,860
make it in bacteria and algae and other

2057
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:07,630
things through heterologous expression

2058
01:34:05,859 --> 01:34:10,779
that turns out to be another real

2059
01:34:07,630 --> 01:34:13,719
exciting field and cannabinoids today is

2060
01:34:10,779 --> 01:34:29,859
you know the ability to make them

2061
01:34:13,719 --> 01:34:40,090
outside of the plant for the pineapple

2062
01:34:29,859 --> 01:34:42,219
Sam so in terms of breeding I you know

2063
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:45,038
Sam in all your years that you know

2064
01:34:42,219 --> 01:34:47,590
since this is a new cannabinoid do you

2065
01:34:45,038 --> 01:34:50,380
believe that you know a lot will be

2066
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:52,329
revealed in terms of a

2067
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:54,010
isolating this and and you know a

2068
01:34:52,329 --> 01:34:58,269
genetic selection and is this something

2069
01:34:54,010 --> 01:35:00,340
you think that we will be able to you

2070
01:34:58,270 --> 01:35:03,670
know exploit the same ways we've been

2071
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:06,429
able to you can pretty for it but right

2072
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:10,750
now the levels are extremely extremely

2073
01:35:06,429 --> 01:35:14,139
extremely my new so right you what you

2074
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:18,369
need to do is get a population that has

2075
01:35:14,139 --> 01:35:20,560
a significant amount whether that 25 or

2076
01:35:18,369 --> 01:35:23,500
you know just half of one percent even

2077
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:26,139
and then by stuffing and breeding that

2078
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:31,179
you can you know quickly give it up to

2079
01:35:26,139 --> 01:35:33,429
boy above 10 percent and then from there

2080
01:35:31,179 --> 01:35:44,739
you take it into the program and then

2081
01:35:33,429 --> 01:35:48,340
select DHCP but do people take it like I

2082
01:35:44,738 --> 01:35:48,789
said everybody care tht was a catch me

2083
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:53,260
out

2084
01:35:48,789 --> 01:35:57,760
well it's only half as strong as 50% of

2085
01:35:53,260 --> 01:36:02,310
THC it resin with the right Derby's so

2086
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:02,310
what about THC P with the right terpenes

2087
01:36:09,448 --> 01:36:22,299
no I don't know discovery so these

2088
01:36:20,198 --> 01:36:24,698
people have found it in these varieties

2089
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:26,350
of cannabis it may be in all the

2090
01:36:24,698 --> 01:36:38,019
varieties of cannabis that we've ever

2091
01:36:26,350 --> 01:36:41,350
smoked we also might be in their

2092
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:46,080
standard food see it it's the third

2093
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:46,079
shallow and and the file in and it's

2094
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:56,710
right but I don't you know like hey the

2095
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:59,050
underdog could pull through - you never

2096
01:36:56,710 --> 01:37:01,359
know what I always said it that things

2097
01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:03,680
that we might not recognize or have

2098
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:06,979
discovered that are present in the

2099
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:09,250
smallest amounts may have very profound

2100
01:37:06,979 --> 01:37:12,289
effects on these on these these

2101
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:17,840
entourage effects do it is finding the

2102
01:37:12,289 --> 01:37:19,850
peaks when they analyze this either high

2103
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:25,029
pressure liquid chromatography or maybe

2104
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:28,940
even mass spec or mass spec man that's

2105
01:37:25,029 --> 01:37:33,139
right it's a molecular weight is that

2106
01:37:28,939 --> 01:37:35,149
molecular weight and to figure it out

2107
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:37,670
and then what they did is they went back

2108
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:40,939
and synthesized the decarboxylated

2109
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:43,699
I understand exactly and if you look at

2110
01:37:40,939 --> 01:37:46,039
it but peak that they found was so

2111
01:37:43,699 --> 01:37:48,649
[ __ ] minut it's a they've already

2112
01:37:46,039 --> 01:37:51,079
identified all the bigger piece now the

2113
01:37:48,649 --> 01:37:53,509
finding really minut ones

2114
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:55,489
yeah the concentrations that they

2115
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:59,530
reported if I remember correctly I

2116
01:37:55,489 --> 01:38:02,960
thought my head was about 60 milligrams

2117
01:37:59,529 --> 01:38:05,149
per gram so it's it's it's very very my

2118
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:07,850
name I think the CBD one was like maybe

2119
01:38:05,149 --> 01:38:11,420
about half that like 30 milligrams per

2120
01:38:07,850 --> 01:38:14,210
gram so yes very very minut amount but I

2121
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:18,529
think what what I I think what this

2122
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:21,649
demonstrates is the promiscuity of the

2123
01:38:18,529 --> 01:38:26,479
polyketide synthase which puts together

2124
01:38:21,649 --> 01:38:33,079
that building block in the in the

2125
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:35,989
cannabinoid biosynthesis it you should

2126
01:38:33,079 --> 01:38:40,430
be exactly the same with all the minor 1

2127
01:38:35,989 --> 01:38:44,449
2 3 4 5 it was not a large amount now

2128
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:46,820
this is recall in science of a football

2129
01:38:44,449 --> 01:38:50,630
team paper because you look at look at

2130
01:38:46,819 --> 01:38:54,229
how many authors 12 authors holy [ __ ] I

2131
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:57,079
wish I had 11 scientists in my lab all

2132
01:38:54,229 --> 01:38:58,629
with Italian last name running around

2133
01:38:57,079 --> 01:39:02,869
doing this kind of work

2134
01:38:58,630 --> 01:39:11,900
holy [ __ ] football in size paper

2135
01:39:02,869 --> 01:39:14,930
here this is huh

2136
01:39:11,899 --> 01:39:17,539
this is significant I mean I'm again

2137
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:20,270
this is a very significant finding

2138
01:39:17,539 --> 01:39:23,689
certainly a wonderful thing to see in

2139
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:25,280
the literature now the question is is

2140
01:39:23,689 --> 01:39:27,259
like when we've characterized our

2141
01:39:25,279 --> 01:39:33,880
extracts before and we can characterize

2142
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:36,680
say 95 or 96 percent is the remaining 2%

2143
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:39,650
molecules like this that again now now

2144
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:42,470
we could really try to quantify

2145
01:39:39,649 --> 01:39:44,779
everything that we're extracting out of

2146
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:47,150
the plant there's going to be several

2147
01:39:44,779 --> 01:39:49,639
more discoveries like this I think that

2148
01:39:47,149 --> 01:39:52,460
are gonna help understand what those

2149
01:39:49,640 --> 01:40:02,060
minor third and fourth cellos in the

2150
01:39:52,460 --> 01:40:08,539
orchestra are thanks for sharing your

2151
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:11,360
green mic yeah I love that the plant is

2152
01:40:08,539 --> 01:40:14,300
offering this chemistry to us and I love

2153
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:16,789
that the scientists including folks on

2154
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:21,140
the panel today are trying to understand

2155
01:40:16,789 --> 01:40:24,590
what this plant is doing and I loved

2156
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:26,570
Mark's suggestion we might have we might

2157
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:29,119
have been consuming this cannabinoid all

2158
01:40:26,569 --> 01:40:34,399
along it's why I think the whole plant

2159
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:36,439
thing is so important and meantime happy

2160
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:40,909
new year everyone and sorry my camera's

2161
01:40:36,439 --> 01:40:44,839
not working but yeah this is this is a

2162
01:40:40,909 --> 01:40:47,300
really great church this morning I among

2163
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:52,100
other things the conversation about

2164
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:55,579
Hawaii and how to restore soil on

2165
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:59,150
Islands it would apply to urban

2166
01:40:55,579 --> 01:41:01,100
landscapes and places where mining

2167
01:40:59,149 --> 01:41:04,909
activity has happened and whatnot you

2168
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:07,130
can you can use the use the material you

2169
01:41:04,909 --> 01:41:10,269
got and and really a lot I've been

2170
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:14,170
fascinated lately by reading up on

2171
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:16,910
what's called Korean natural farming and

2172
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:20,239
kind of stunned at how much of it I'm

2173
01:41:16,909 --> 01:41:23,840
already doing in my practices here and

2174
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:25,429
the dim pure family really defined

2175
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:30,420
beautifully a lot of what's going on

2176
01:41:25,430 --> 01:41:32,850
there I really do think that it's it's

2177
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:35,250
in the genetics of the plant as well as

2178
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:36,929
in the practices of how we share with

2179
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:39,929
people how to work with this plant

2180
01:41:36,929 --> 01:41:41,699
everything from in the garden - when

2181
01:41:39,929 --> 01:41:43,889
you're offering it to an end user for

2182
01:41:41,698 --> 01:41:50,669
its therapeutic effects the whole plant

2183
01:41:43,889 --> 01:41:52,529
is the real story and that's all I got

2184
01:41:50,670 --> 01:41:54,868
at the moment I just love the church

2185
01:41:52,529 --> 01:41:56,519
thank you all of you for coming it's so

2186
01:41:54,868 --> 01:41:59,399
beautiful to see you and like I said I'm

2187
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:01,440
gonna figure out I might have to replace

2188
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:03,809
my computer to get this camera issue

2189
01:42:01,439 --> 01:42:05,488
fixed but much love and happy new year

2190
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:06,210
and I think 2020 we're gonna be able to

2191
01:42:05,488 --> 01:42:09,928
see better

2192
01:42:06,210 --> 01:42:11,279
ciao yeah thanks for sharing wait I was

2193
01:42:09,929 --> 01:42:15,239
hoping we'd hear from you at one point

2194
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:18,329
in time we've had oh we've had some some

2195
01:42:15,238 --> 01:42:19,649
long long dominated conversations with

2196
01:42:18,329 --> 01:42:21,630
specific people which have been

2197
01:42:19,649 --> 01:42:23,899
absolutely incredible and amazing but I

2198
01:42:21,630 --> 01:42:25,920
love to hear from some of you guys that

2199
01:42:23,899 --> 01:42:38,039
haven't said anything we haven't heard

2200
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:40,980
from Dee we haven't heard from Sabo it's

2201
01:42:38,039 --> 01:42:42,840
true yeah I've been drinking deep as

2202
01:42:40,979 --> 01:42:45,349
well Marcus this is so beautiful thank

2203
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:49,590
you for making this happen this morning

2204
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:51,989
yeah well a new year a new a new energy

2205
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:54,719
available so the last year was very busy

2206
01:42:51,988 --> 01:42:58,618
for me and I sort of was unable to focus

2207
01:42:54,719 --> 01:43:00,989
on I'm really making videos on on really

2208
01:42:58,618 --> 01:43:05,039
posting on YouTube and a couple of key

2209
01:43:00,988 --> 01:43:06,750
things YouTube sort of closed my channel

2210
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:09,238
but they definitely made some changes to

2211
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:10,710
my channel on their end where I was I

2212
01:43:09,238 --> 01:43:12,959
wasn't even sure if I was even gonna be

2213
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:14,639
able to still live stream so I'm glad

2214
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:16,529
that we're able to do that that's kind

2215
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:19,340
of a blessing and it's always good to be

2216
01:43:16,529 --> 01:43:22,769
able to send out a link and actually get

2217
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:24,389
you know get some of you just to say

2218
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:26,100
yeah I'll come in cuz that's the key

2219
01:43:24,389 --> 01:43:30,300
right if I show up by myself it's not

2220
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:33,300
it's not a show so we're gonna it's good

2221
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:38,219
I'd love to talk about cannabis hash

2222
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:40,659
everything 2020 everybody in chat to

2223
01:43:38,219 --> 01:43:44,319
write the chat is just chat

2224
01:43:40,659 --> 01:43:46,750
it takes on its own right and it

2225
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:54,670
police's itself right when someone gets

2226
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:57,489
out of line just a bunch of peaceful

2227
01:43:54,670 --> 01:44:00,399
cannabinoids universal bong rip with

2228
01:43:57,489 --> 01:44:02,739
everybody in the chat online in the

2229
01:44:00,399 --> 01:44:04,809
video all of it it's always nice to do

2230
01:44:02,739 --> 01:44:08,920
that on a Sunday morning all right

2231
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:12,100
Ashley reliving that bong rip that Santa

2232
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:22,480
Claus came and had with us that one time

2233
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:27,100
there that's why I had to stay from

2234
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:28,449
children yeah you teeth will be hammered

2235
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:31,660
on me too I wasn't able to do anything

2236
01:44:28,449 --> 01:44:33,550
for months like you can upload you

2237
01:44:31,659 --> 01:44:34,869
couldn't even they can only comment on

2238
01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:36,940
stuff so people are always asking you

2239
01:44:34,869 --> 01:44:39,430
can't upload videos on but people be

2240
01:44:36,939 --> 01:44:43,210
getting slapped with all these new rules

2241
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:45,789
and I hate doing videos saying that hey

2242
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:48,310
if you're 19 please don't be on my

2243
01:44:45,789 --> 01:44:53,050
channel there's it's it's I think really

2244
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:54,580
come on oh it's a setting John it's a

2245
01:44:53,050 --> 01:44:56,409
setting you don't have to say that you

2246
01:44:54,579 --> 01:44:59,319
can't have people under 19 there's a

2247
01:44:56,409 --> 01:45:01,689
there's an adult setting I do that

2248
01:44:59,319 --> 01:45:04,029
analyst for not this is not for children

2249
01:45:01,689 --> 01:45:06,489
and then they won't the algorithm won't

2250
01:45:04,029 --> 01:45:08,739
allow it to get into zones where you

2251
01:45:06,489 --> 01:45:10,239
know maybe people that are younger are

2252
01:45:08,739 --> 01:45:13,359
gonna be I don't think they need to be

2253
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:21,399
polish you have to do is claim that it's

2254
01:45:13,359 --> 01:45:24,789
Russian that's about it well here's that

2255
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:35,889
universal bond wrap that D 420k said

2256
01:45:24,789 --> 01:45:37,689
everyone's ready mother lovers a few

2257
01:45:35,890 --> 01:45:41,860
interesting things in the processing

2258
01:45:37,689 --> 01:45:44,789
world are happening there seems to be a

2259
01:45:41,859 --> 01:45:49,439
lot of interest in this whole CRC

2260
01:45:44,789 --> 01:45:49,439
business and a lot of people reached out

2261
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:58,460
is a color remediation chromatography I

2262
01:45:55,250 --> 01:46:02,020
think that's what the I think that's

2263
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:06,039
what the acronym stands for mm-hmm but

2264
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:08,929
if you all know who Murphy Marie is

2265
01:46:06,039 --> 01:46:12,170
she's working with Santo Gardens and

2266
01:46:08,929 --> 01:46:14,059
those folks and Colorado I just saw say

2267
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:16,730
I'm at the fish show about tomorrow so

2268
01:46:14,059 --> 01:46:20,329
it's good to see those guys but Mike

2269
01:46:16,729 --> 01:46:23,379
Mike from hi Dolph you see him - yes you

2270
01:46:20,328 --> 01:46:26,179
know I did I saw Mike it at the biz con

2271
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:29,118
but it did not see Mike at the fish

2272
01:46:26,179 --> 01:46:31,158
shows I'm gonna shout out to Mike yeah

2273
01:46:29,118 --> 01:46:33,529
shout out to Mike for sure big Matt

2274
01:46:31,158 --> 01:46:37,848
shout out to Mike man our mutual friend

2275
01:46:33,529 --> 01:46:40,368
Mike Bishop yeah Mike's a man friend of

2276
01:46:37,849 --> 01:46:42,440
mine he's yeah I like the hide off sales

2277
01:46:40,368 --> 01:46:44,839
guy from out west right

2278
01:46:42,439 --> 01:46:48,319
originally from Delaware not too far

2279
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:50,569
from here but I guess the CRC things

2280
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:53,420
really get a lot of attention because a

2281
01:46:50,569 --> 01:46:55,479
lot of people have different techniques

2282
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:58,908
and different methods and different

2283
01:46:55,479 --> 01:47:05,919
packing materials and it's just really

2284
01:46:58,908 --> 01:47:09,319
interesting to see people using good

2285
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:10,880
chromatography techniques to you know

2286
01:47:09,319 --> 01:47:14,299
there's the old saying which is you

2287
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:19,849
can't make you can't make good oil from

2288
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:21,440
batter and typically vice versa or you

2289
01:47:19,849 --> 01:47:23,690
like to think that if you have really

2290
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:26,868
good herb if your if your extraction

2291
01:47:23,689 --> 01:47:29,029
methods really good but I guess this was

2292
01:47:26,868 --> 01:47:30,710
originally brought up not just for color

2293
01:47:29,029 --> 01:47:33,649
remediation I think it was really

2294
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:37,039
brought up for remediating hot material

2295
01:47:33,649 --> 01:47:38,779
or pesticide material but it's just it's

2296
01:47:37,039 --> 01:47:41,059
really cool to see that again you're

2297
01:47:38,779 --> 01:47:43,519
seeing a lot of high quality product out

2298
01:47:41,059 --> 01:47:47,360
there and I don't think it gives growers

2299
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:49,099
the license to spray whatever they want

2300
01:47:47,359 --> 01:47:52,029
just because you can clean it up later

2301
01:47:49,099 --> 01:47:55,400
in a chromatography step but

2302
01:47:52,029 --> 01:47:58,219
chromatography is certainly a sort of a

2303
01:47:55,399 --> 01:48:00,920
trend and I see a lot of instrument

2304
01:47:58,219 --> 01:48:02,630
manufacturers now making columns and

2305
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:03,319
hardware to do that kind of work

2306
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:05,719
the

2307
01:48:03,319 --> 01:48:08,539
other trend I saw at bisque on is that

2308
01:48:05,719 --> 01:48:11,868
you know for we were talking about this

2309
01:48:08,539 --> 01:48:14,988
earlier about doing extraction and and

2310
01:48:11,868 --> 01:48:16,809
the dark oil that ATM showed us which

2311
01:48:14,988 --> 01:48:20,328
typically means you've extracted

2312
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:22,489
pigments and other crap or somewhere

2313
01:48:20,328 --> 01:48:25,819
along the line things turned dark due to

2314
01:48:22,488 --> 01:48:29,059
oxidation well you know certainly you

2315
01:48:25,819 --> 01:48:30,549
can do and I've seen this where you can

2316
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:32,900
do a low-temperature

2317
01:48:30,550 --> 01:48:36,289
extraction with ethanol and actually

2318
01:48:32,899 --> 01:48:38,929
make a product that social Shh you know

2319
01:48:36,289 --> 01:48:41,988
pure that it'll shatter out just like a

2320
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:45,380
butane extract would so you can get a

2321
01:48:41,988 --> 01:48:48,408
low selective alcohol pull that makes a

2322
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:52,340
really golden colored extract it's not

2323
01:48:48,408 --> 01:48:55,009
dark at all and it's it's dabble and it

2324
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:57,980
tastes really good I know that Chris

2325
01:48:55,010 --> 01:49:00,590
Bukowski of the folks that move have

2326
01:48:57,979 --> 01:49:02,149
been using ethanol extract and they're

2327
01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:06,199
crushing it they're doing really well in

2328
01:49:02,149 --> 01:49:08,509
the markets they're serving but a big

2329
01:49:06,198 --> 01:49:12,469
trend that I see now is that people are

2330
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:15,650
moving away from cryogenic extraction of

2331
01:49:12,469 --> 01:49:18,770
ethanol and just doing an extraction at

2332
01:49:15,649 --> 01:49:21,738
room temperature and then processing the

2333
01:49:18,770 --> 01:49:23,360
room-temperature extract to remove what

2334
01:49:21,738 --> 01:49:24,979
you're extracting out at room

2335
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:28,759
temperature that you don't want so like

2336
01:49:24,979 --> 01:49:32,029
the fats waxes lipids any sugars or any

2337
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:35,440
other water soluble that are coming out

2338
01:49:32,029 --> 01:49:37,849
you could remove by again either

2339
01:49:35,439 --> 01:49:39,649
chromatography or one of the new

2340
01:49:37,849 --> 01:49:43,630
techniques of something called

2341
01:49:39,649 --> 01:49:45,589
lenticular filtration lenticular

2342
01:49:43,630 --> 01:49:48,289
filtration is what it's called it's

2343
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:49,900
similar to the filtration apparatus if

2344
01:49:48,289 --> 01:49:52,639
anyone's ever looked inside like a

2345
01:49:49,899 --> 01:49:55,368
swimming pool filter you know you

2346
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:58,730
basically have all of these discs that

2347
01:49:55,368 --> 01:50:01,488
have filtered meat material in it and

2348
01:49:58,729 --> 01:50:06,609
basically the material the stuff flows

2349
01:50:01,488 --> 01:50:06,609
from in inside these radial distance

2350
01:50:07,699 --> 01:50:12,380
flows out in through the filtration

2351
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:14,590
process and again it was really news to

2352
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:18,319
me that you can basically do a

2353
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:21,470
room-temperature extraction with ethanol

2354
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:24,099
and the right processing of that ethanol

2355
01:50:21,470 --> 01:50:26,960
such that you didn't need to winterize

2356
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:29,360
the extract cuz winterization is just

2357
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:32,109
really ugly and messy and sloppy and

2358
01:50:29,359 --> 01:50:34,579
it's real nice to be able to have a

2359
01:50:32,109 --> 01:50:38,449
selective extract that you don't have to

2360
01:50:34,579 --> 01:50:41,059
winterize so to just to sort of trends

2361
01:50:38,449 --> 01:50:42,800
that I see happening in extraction you

2362
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:47,360
know there's still a lot of work going

2363
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:50,510
on in in scaling up of of hamp

2364
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:53,979
operations that bisque on this year yeah

2365
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:58,010
it was kind of like you know the biggest

2366
01:50:53,979 --> 01:51:00,949
shiniest stainless steel tank farms you

2367
01:50:58,010 --> 01:51:03,530
could wheel into that room to try to get

2368
01:51:00,949 --> 01:51:06,170
you know people who were spending lots

2369
01:51:03,529 --> 01:51:09,710
of money to put large hemp processing

2370
01:51:06,170 --> 01:51:11,119
facilities uh tends to be something

2371
01:51:09,710 --> 01:51:14,000
that's happening is so you would think

2372
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:19,760
again with the increase in the amount of

2373
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:22,100
have processing infrastructure what's

2374
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:25,520
now happened you know be careful what

2375
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:31,700
you wish for is the price isolate has

2376
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:36,370
refreshed and it's Marya finish this

2377
01:51:31,699 --> 01:51:40,340
thought before it dies of loneliness so

2378
01:51:36,369 --> 01:51:46,010
so a lot of people who invested in

2379
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:47,480
growing hemp in in 2019 with the notion

2380
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:50,570
that they were going to be able to

2381
01:51:47,479 --> 01:51:53,689
convert and get like you know anywhere

2382
01:51:50,569 --> 01:51:56,229
between five to maybe ten thousand

2383
01:51:53,689 --> 01:51:59,149
dollars a kilo for their isolate are

2384
01:51:56,229 --> 01:52:03,379
really bumming because right now that

2385
01:51:59,149 --> 01:52:05,420
you know exchange price isolate is just

2386
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:09,319
a little north of two thousand bucks a

2387
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:12,470
kilo so the CBD market is crashed and

2388
01:52:09,319 --> 01:52:15,920
and and what seems to really be taking

2389
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:19,250
off are the other cannabinoids like CBG

2390
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:21,250
and CBN so those are couple trends that

2391
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:25,149
are happening here in the States

2392
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:29,409
cbn prices are through the roof and and

2393
01:52:25,149 --> 01:52:31,929
you see more and more CBG stuff coming

2394
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:34,930
online and I see a couple growers over

2395
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:38,110
in Italy Swiss guy in the north of Italy

2396
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:40,740
who's got a CBG variety that shows

2397
01:52:38,109 --> 01:52:44,229
somewhere about 14 to 15 percent

2398
01:52:40,739 --> 01:52:45,729
CBG based on dried wait so just a couple

2399
01:52:44,229 --> 01:52:48,489
of trends just wanted to share with

2400
01:52:45,729 --> 01:52:51,519
everyone go ahead Sam what do you think

2401
01:52:48,489 --> 01:52:54,039
about remediation we have been cleaning

2402
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:56,350
up pesticide sprayed

2403
01:52:54,039 --> 01:52:59,229
herb what do you think of that because I

2404
01:52:56,350 --> 01:53:01,150
don't have proven all yeah I know to

2405
01:52:59,229 --> 01:53:03,339
prove you I don't think you know if it

2406
01:53:01,149 --> 01:53:08,649
grown right you know cannabis doesn't

2407
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:13,960
need pesticides and III haven't I hate

2408
01:53:08,649 --> 01:53:21,039
to enable that by coming up with ways of

2409
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:24,399
cleaning up tainted oil but I I don't

2410
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:27,359
want my well I was gonna say I don't

2411
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:31,420
want my kids I don't want my my my

2412
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:34,179
friends kids dying of a vape pen that's

2413
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:37,359
got you know you know pesticide

2414
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:39,520
contamination in oil from a black market

2415
01:53:37,359 --> 01:53:44,500
card that they bought out a dead company

2416
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:48,670
show you know really bad I feel really

2417
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:52,810
bad for the folks who feel that the last

2418
01:53:48,670 --> 01:53:56,199
resort they have is past asides you know

2419
01:53:52,810 --> 01:53:59,350
it just it shows that they've failed but

2420
01:53:56,199 --> 01:54:02,170
when they've invested so much of their

2421
01:53:59,350 --> 01:54:04,920
livelihood and they're gonna financially

2422
01:54:02,170 --> 01:54:07,449
be in ruin if they don't you know

2423
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:09,850
they're they're up against the wall and

2424
01:54:07,449 --> 01:54:12,489
that's just a tough situation to be in a

2425
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:16,560
situation created only by the

2426
01:54:12,489 --> 01:54:19,809
ridiculousness of the black market and

2427
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:23,830
one thing if they're cleaning up mold

2428
01:54:19,810 --> 01:54:27,010
and fungus I mean that happens to the

2429
01:54:23,829 --> 01:54:29,619
best people who were serious growers but

2430
01:54:27,010 --> 01:54:32,440
when they're cleaning up pesticides and

2431
01:54:29,619 --> 01:54:35,430
fungicides are not just giving the

2432
01:54:32,439 --> 01:54:35,429
creepy crawlers

2433
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:45,900
yes much easier to grow it without those

2434
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:49,050
things in it I agree I think that the

2435
01:54:45,899 --> 01:54:53,039
the issue that exists is what happens

2436
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:57,239
one hot oil is discovered right does

2437
01:54:53,039 --> 01:55:01,590
that does that create again

2438
01:54:57,239 --> 01:55:04,439
a paper trail back to the person who

2439
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:06,539
applied the pesticides such that some

2440
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:09,059
regulatory authority could come and shut

2441
01:55:06,539 --> 01:55:11,310
that individual down or you know cite

2442
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:13,440
that individual and find them such that

2443
01:55:11,310 --> 01:55:16,200
if it happens again then they lose their

2444
01:55:13,439 --> 01:55:19,619
license I mean certainly again this is

2445
01:55:16,199 --> 01:55:21,179
something that oh another significant

2446
01:55:19,619 --> 01:55:26,750
thing that that's happened since our

2447
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:30,119
last hashtag is the EPA has now allowed

2448
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:32,310
its the handful of agrochemical

2449
01:55:30,119 --> 01:55:34,800
treatments they're not chemicals

2450
01:55:32,310 --> 01:55:37,230
themselves they're all biological

2451
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:38,909
treatments which would make Josh and

2452
01:55:37,229 --> 01:55:40,919
Kelly happy they're all they're all

2453
01:55:38,909 --> 01:55:43,050
biologicals right so they're all sort of

2454
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:48,210
a part of I guess what you'd call the

2455
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:51,150
the bio IPM strategy of using bugs to

2456
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:54,500
treat bugs but I guess the thing that

2457
01:55:51,149 --> 01:55:58,109
doesn't sit very well again is that

2458
01:55:54,500 --> 01:56:01,920
there are no real safety studies that

2459
01:55:58,109 --> 01:56:04,739
show that when you apply those materials

2460
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:07,859
to cannabinoids that the cannabis is

2461
01:56:04,739 --> 01:56:11,550
safe for consumption so we go back to is

2462
01:56:07,859 --> 01:56:14,789
it really appropriate to apply crop

2463
01:56:11,550 --> 01:56:17,520
protection products like fungicides even

2464
01:56:14,789 --> 01:56:21,329
if they're biologically sors to

2465
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:25,350
biologically derived is it really useful

2466
01:56:21,329 --> 01:56:28,319
for cannabis production and I don't have

2467
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:31,350
the answer to that I think that there's

2468
01:56:28,319 --> 01:56:33,630
not enough known really like the

2469
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:36,420
bacterium and the different types of for

2470
01:56:33,630 --> 01:56:38,609
years that they're making and what kind

2471
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:41,819
of effects is gonna have on the soil and

2472
01:56:38,609 --> 01:56:44,639
also the aquatic life which you know a

2473
01:56:41,819 --> 01:56:45,929
lot of that doesn't go Cornell has a

2474
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:47,880
whole lot of studies on a lot of

2475
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:50,670
different products and

2476
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:52,739
super-intelligent there but you know

2477
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:54,510
we're fine but the one encouraging thing

2478
01:56:52,739 --> 01:56:56,670
if I could just interrupt for a second

2479
01:56:54,510 --> 01:57:00,180
calorie would be that with the EPA

2480
01:56:56,670 --> 01:57:02,130
taking the step in this direction if I'm

2481
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:04,820
a company that wants to make a product

2482
01:57:02,130 --> 01:57:08,010
like that now there's a regulatory

2483
01:57:04,819 --> 01:57:10,409
pathway to develop that study and

2484
01:57:08,010 --> 01:57:13,670
there's a I could actually get a return

2485
01:57:10,409 --> 01:57:17,579
on in my investment if I do the studies

2486
01:57:13,670 --> 01:57:20,430
to show that this biological which is

2487
01:57:17,579 --> 01:57:24,659
part of our natural environment could be

2488
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:27,720
used at this use rate to control this

2489
01:57:24,659 --> 01:57:31,130
particular type of pathogen that attacks

2490
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:34,289
cannabis and taints cannabis with

2491
01:57:31,130 --> 01:57:36,900
microbiological infection this product

2492
01:57:34,289 --> 01:57:40,350
can be used now companies don't have to

2493
01:57:36,899 --> 01:57:42,750
be in the dark about doing the safety

2494
01:57:40,350 --> 01:57:45,900
and efficacy studies to support a

2495
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:48,630
product like that and it's no longer the

2496
01:57:45,899 --> 01:57:51,149
EPA's gonna categorically say no

2497
01:57:48,630 --> 01:57:53,730
cannabis is Schedule one and no we won't

2498
01:57:51,149 --> 01:57:57,000
look at any product registrations the

2499
01:57:53,729 --> 01:57:59,489
EPA's mandate is to make sure that the

2500
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:03,659
crop protection chemicals that are used

2501
01:57:59,489 --> 01:58:05,750
on the food supply and on chemicals of

2502
01:58:03,659 --> 01:58:08,970
commerce that come in contact with

2503
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:11,670
humans like in cosmetics that those are

2504
01:58:08,970 --> 01:58:13,770
safe they don't always get it right and

2505
01:58:11,670 --> 01:58:17,220
the Environmental Working Group will let

2506
01:58:13,770 --> 01:58:19,100
you know that in spades but I can tell

2507
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:22,260
you it's a step in the right direction

2508
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:25,020
that they're looking to say look we need

2509
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:28,140
to regulate products for this industry

2510
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:32,730
because if we don't that's just a total

2511
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:36,390
wrong move altogether in general I would

2512
01:58:32,729 --> 01:58:41,789
think that biologicals are probably

2513
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:44,640
safer than but I'm making a big

2514
01:58:41,789 --> 01:58:47,760
statement they say that but in general I

2515
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:49,230
do find that to be true yeah I just

2516
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:50,820
think that it's really interesting you

2517
01:58:49,229 --> 01:58:52,799
know mark what he said of course it

2518
01:58:50,819 --> 01:58:55,649
makes sense any kind of Avenue that you

2519
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:56,880
can get more research and more study on

2520
01:58:55,649 --> 01:58:59,429
it is better it's just really

2521
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:00,599
interesting that things become you know

2522
01:58:59,430 --> 01:59:03,418
put into the Reg

2523
01:59:00,599 --> 01:59:05,729
related market before we even have the

2524
01:59:03,418 --> 01:59:08,639
opportunity for environmental studies

2525
01:59:05,729 --> 01:59:10,499
even look at it so already it's screwed

2526
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:12,569
up you know you were saying you know do

2527
01:59:10,498 --> 01:59:15,688
we need to go back to the farmer who

2528
01:59:12,569 --> 01:59:18,868
tested hot on any kind of a pesticide or

2529
01:59:15,689 --> 01:59:20,969
a fungicide test you know it's we need

2530
01:59:18,868 --> 01:59:26,848
to go back to the FDA we need to go back

2531
01:59:20,969 --> 01:59:28,559
to the EPA you know yeah and also you

2532
01:59:26,849 --> 01:59:33,840
know there's a lot of these different

2533
01:59:28,559 --> 01:59:35,519
micro biology foliage that you can spray

2534
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:37,859
on your plants or you can put on your

2535
01:59:35,519 --> 01:59:39,989
soils but we need to look at it in a

2536
01:59:37,859 --> 01:59:42,989
more holistic view what's it doing to

2537
01:59:39,988 --> 01:59:50,908
they said before is our aquatic life and

2538
01:59:42,988 --> 01:59:53,968
what's also totally and the way the

2539
01:59:50,908 --> 01:59:57,748
system is in place right now again the

2540
01:59:53,969 --> 02:00:00,538
EPA is is is is the regulatory authority

2541
01:59:57,748 --> 02:00:03,658
that doesn't do those testing but what

2542
02:00:00,538 --> 02:00:05,518
they do to testing the responsibility

2543
02:00:03,658 --> 02:00:09,388
for the testing and and and the data

2544
02:00:05,519 --> 02:00:11,729
package is is is is on is on the

2545
02:00:09,389 --> 02:00:14,340
registrant is on the person who wants to

2546
02:00:11,729 --> 02:00:17,099
register the product under something

2547
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:19,010
called FIFRA which is the federal

2548
02:00:17,099 --> 02:00:22,918
insecticide fungicide and rodenticide

2549
02:00:19,010 --> 02:00:25,739
act so our US government says that if

2550
02:00:22,918 --> 02:00:27,988
you want to make a product that fits in

2551
02:00:25,738 --> 02:00:30,418
that product category you have to

2552
02:00:27,988 --> 02:00:33,208
register it with the EPA and what EPA

2553
02:00:30,418 --> 02:00:35,998
does is it just got a group of experts

2554
02:00:33,208 --> 02:00:38,908
typically academics and other folks who

2555
02:00:35,998 --> 02:00:41,309
look at the not just safety which is

2556
02:00:38,908 --> 02:00:42,208
what does this thing do to humans what

2557
02:00:41,309 --> 02:00:45,479
does this thing do to the environment

2558
02:00:42,208 --> 02:00:49,378
what does it do to non target pests but

2559
02:00:45,479 --> 02:00:52,530
also does it actually [ __ ] work you

2560
02:00:49,378 --> 02:00:57,149
know and and and again to do those

2561
02:00:52,529 --> 02:00:59,059
studies takes years and millions of

2562
02:00:57,149 --> 02:01:02,579
investment and typically like for a

2563
02:00:59,059 --> 02:01:06,840
chemical company like my former employer

2564
02:01:02,578 --> 02:01:10,469
um they would spend anywhere between 10

2565
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:13,139
to 50 million dollars just to get that

2566
02:01:10,469 --> 02:01:14,189
one product over the goal line so it's

2567
02:01:13,139 --> 02:01:16,190
not

2568
02:01:14,189 --> 02:01:18,869
cheap thing to do because you have to do

2569
02:01:16,189 --> 02:01:21,029
toxicity and animals and assumes you get

2570
02:01:18,869 --> 02:01:21,510
a bad result on tox you're dead in the

2571
02:01:21,029 --> 02:01:23,699
water

2572
02:01:21,510 --> 02:01:28,110
now all that investment up to that point

2573
02:01:23,699 --> 02:01:30,000
you're dead so it's just it's a yeah one

2574
02:01:28,109 --> 02:01:34,649
thing that's happening it has to be done

2575
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:38,250
in order to show safety and again

2576
02:01:34,649 --> 02:01:40,589
because cannabis was illegal all these

2577
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:42,539
companies that sell products into the

2578
02:01:40,590 --> 02:01:44,819
space would touch this with a ten-foot

2579
02:01:42,539 --> 02:01:47,489
pole because they have to break the law

2580
02:01:44,819 --> 02:01:50,689
to show now it's interesting with

2581
02:01:47,489 --> 02:01:50,689
tobacco right because

2582
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:05,120
you

2583
02:02:19,420 --> 02:02:25,510
in such microscopic space that you know

2584
02:02:23,170 --> 02:02:27,340
work creating a cannabis and in

2585
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:29,619
accordance with nature and we're passing

2586
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:32,680
all the tests and then when we go not we

2587
02:02:29,619 --> 02:02:34,930
as a community go to make it edibles you

2588
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:37,480
know they'll fail the test from from the

2589
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:40,240
cacao used or they'll failed tests from

2590
02:02:37,479 --> 02:02:44,019
other food streams that they're now

2591
02:02:40,239 --> 02:02:45,670
using so the cross over of the scrutiny

2592
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:48,700
that's happening with the can have in a

2593
02:02:45,670 --> 02:02:50,789
space is cannabis basis is entering into

2594
02:02:48,699 --> 02:02:54,689
the food chain and we've been you know

2595
02:02:50,789 --> 02:02:57,939
studying about how there's like a

2596
02:02:54,689 --> 02:03:01,210
feminization of men and happening on

2597
02:02:57,939 --> 02:03:05,049
earth and and through xenoestrogens and

2598
02:03:01,210 --> 02:03:07,390
that's through the plastics that we were

2599
02:03:05,050 --> 02:03:10,110
talking about been through food

2600
02:03:07,390 --> 02:03:13,150
processing and so many different things

2601
02:03:10,109 --> 02:03:15,189
that is just incredibly important that

2602
02:03:13,149 --> 02:03:17,909
we have these conversations and get to a

2603
02:03:15,189 --> 02:03:20,679
more healthy space because the FDA

2604
02:03:17,909 --> 02:03:22,769
allows up to like three thousand

2605
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:26,230
chemicals to be added to food without

2606
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:28,690
any certifications and this is just

2607
02:03:26,229 --> 02:03:32,859
regular food streams so you know I think

2608
02:03:28,689 --> 02:03:34,419
we need to use it's it's an issue on our

2609
02:03:32,859 --> 02:03:36,909
community to have to go through such

2610
02:03:34,420 --> 02:03:38,949
scrutiny to grow but it's also shedding

2611
02:03:36,909 --> 02:03:41,710
light on the rest of our world so that

2612
02:03:38,949 --> 02:03:43,269
the consciousness that's expanding

2613
02:03:41,710 --> 02:03:45,939
through our use of cannabis and our and

2614
02:03:43,270 --> 02:03:48,280
then our business practices is now

2615
02:03:45,939 --> 02:03:52,629
allowing us to say wow look at the food

2616
02:03:48,279 --> 02:03:54,130
supply the food supply is incredibly you

2617
02:03:52,630 --> 02:03:56,579
know challenged right now and we have

2618
02:03:54,130 --> 02:03:58,900
incredible scientists and and

2619
02:03:56,579 --> 02:04:01,149
microbiology friends that won't even

2620
02:03:58,899 --> 02:04:03,699
enter the cannabis space at the moment

2621
02:04:01,149 --> 02:04:06,819
because they're just so directed into

2622
02:04:03,699 --> 02:04:09,189
food and food security and and scene

2623
02:04:06,819 --> 02:04:10,989
saving and stuff so I appreciate these

2624
02:04:09,189 --> 02:04:12,849
conversations I appreciate everyone

2625
02:04:10,989 --> 02:04:15,399
bringing it to the table and and you

2626
02:04:12,850 --> 02:04:17,710
know it's really our mission in life you

2627
02:04:15,399 --> 02:04:21,279
know to make a healthier world and and

2628
02:04:17,710 --> 02:04:24,489
this medicine is an incredibly powerful

2629
02:04:21,279 --> 02:04:27,539
one and yeah we're bringing that

2630
02:04:24,489 --> 02:04:27,539
consciousness to everything

2631
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:57,850
oh okay sorry I was talking but I was on

2632

out having a nice fire and it was like

2655
02:06:01,810 --> 02:06:09,490
this is nice I like here that we lose

2656
02:06:06,310 --> 02:06:12,340
our electricity because we have our

2657
02:06:09,489 --> 02:06:14,619
power you know I mean I like that it got

2658
02:06:12,340 --> 02:06:16,090
away from well you guys should watch

2659

02:06:20,289 --> 02:06:24,069
Stamets is in it I think the guys that

2663

2664
02:06:24,069 --> 02:06:28,420
I'm gonna share the link with some other

2665

panel okay I want to do I want to do a

2667
02:06:31,810 --> 02:06:35,590

you can share with the collective I

2678
02:06:57,779 --> 02:07:00,840
didn't know the collective rules and I

2679
02:06:59,310 --> 02:07:02,880
didn't want to be like oh maybe I'm not

2680
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:05,489
supposed to be like promote documentary

2681

I think you guys will really love it

2682
02:07:05,489 --> 02:07:10,800
what it's all about yeah yeah exactly

2683
02:07:09,239 --> 02:07:14,309
awesome what do you do with a pure

2684
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:21,090
grower and the electricity goes out and

2685
02:07:14,310 --> 02:07:24,810
a generator seriously I've always had a

2686
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:27,390
generator because it happens and at that

2687
02:07:24,810 --> 02:07:31,350
time you throw in like a team five into

2688
02:07:27,390 --> 02:07:32,880
like a 121 I've gone through some storms

2689
02:07:31,350 --> 02:07:34,470
I was gonna what are you guys five days

2690
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,210
how did you get through with your plants

2691
02:07:34,470 --> 02:07:37,949
mothers or anything like that like what

2692
02:07:36,210 --> 02:07:42,689
are you doing they're like I only have

2693
02:07:37,949 --> 02:07:44,250
any kind of backup my mother's going so

2694
02:07:42,689 --> 02:07:46,589
we're not doing any kind of

2695
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:50,039
high-intensity flowering anything and we

2696
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:53,430
just keep the plants near the window you

2697
02:07:50,039 --> 02:07:55,710
know we did put a generator on for a

2698
02:07:53,430 --> 02:07:58,440
little bit because the freezer was was

2699
02:07:55,710 --> 02:08:02,579
coming out and stuff so you know if we

2700
02:07:58,439 --> 02:08:04,349
had because yeah we just I think that

2701
02:08:02,579 --> 02:08:06,180
near the window just works good enough

2702
02:08:04,350 --> 02:08:08,970
for that for us but that's why we're

2703
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:11,490
annual growers because you know it takes

2704
02:08:08,970 --> 02:08:13,949
a lot to grow here in the winter and

2705
02:08:11,489 --> 02:08:16,319
lead to actually lose electricity quite

2706
02:08:13,949 --> 02:08:19,500
a bit here so it's pretty difficult so

2707
02:08:16,319 --> 02:08:21,569
we just do a really beautiful big you

2708
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:23,159
know annual grow and then we use the

2709
02:08:21,569 --> 02:08:24,899
whole winter to process so like during

2710
02:08:23,159 --> 02:08:27,119
the winter work you know it with it

2711
02:08:24,899 --> 02:08:31,439
electricity off we can still make hash

2712
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:33,149
and and say that's time to my cash you

2713
02:08:31,439 --> 02:08:34,829
know we have been able to make some

2714
02:08:33,149 --> 02:08:37,769
really good try sift and this cold

2715
02:08:34,829 --> 02:08:39,869
weather and everything and you know it

2716
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:45,240
gives us a chance to connect with an

2717
02:08:39,869 --> 02:08:47,399
Abbe annoyed I've always had a battery

2718
02:08:45,239 --> 02:08:50,399
pal just in case just uploading my

2719
02:08:47,399 --> 02:08:51,929
heating mat and my t5b keep my babies

2720
02:08:50,399 --> 02:08:54,299
warm because if the lights going on a

2721
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:56,739
few times so I've just got it's happened

2722
02:08:54,300 --> 02:09:00,860
in the past I've always

2723
02:08:56,738 --> 02:09:08,000
we have gravity-fed water and wood heat

2724
02:09:00,859 --> 02:09:09,618
and really we all them phenol to me and

2725
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,600
as far as food greens and stuff we just

2726
02:09:09,618 --> 02:09:14,750
sprout you know so you know we're

2727
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:17,389
basically in exist mode at the moment

2728
02:09:14,750 --> 02:09:20,149
but we are getting ready to travel and

2729
02:09:17,389 --> 02:09:21,949
spread the good word and and be out at

2730
02:09:20,149 --> 02:09:25,519
the science of regenerative cannabis so

2731
02:09:21,948 --> 02:09:27,469
we're gonna head out towards Maine and

2732
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:29,810
humble really soon down in California

2733
02:09:27,469 --> 02:09:32,510
but we're also gonna be out in Maine and

2734
02:09:29,810 --> 02:09:34,369
mark it be really cool to meet up with

2735
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:37,010
you out in the East Coast I don't know

2736
02:09:34,368 --> 02:09:38,269
you can head up to Maine or maybe we

2737
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:40,579
come see you but it would be really

2738
02:09:38,270 --> 02:09:42,080
valuable to us all in the in the

2739
02:09:40,579 --> 02:09:44,269
regenerative cannabis movement just to

2740
02:09:42,079 --> 02:09:48,319
see you know what what you had to offer

2741
02:09:44,270 --> 02:09:50,389
I'm gonna say gravity-fed I just started

2742
02:09:48,319 --> 02:09:52,509
hooked up Auto pots but like the first

2743
02:09:50,389 --> 02:09:55,368
time and like just put up like 16 and

2744
02:09:52,510 --> 02:09:57,949
what a revolute like I it's so nice

2745
02:09:55,368 --> 02:09:59,210
because I can actually go away I don't

2746
02:09:57,948 --> 02:10:03,579
have to be there every day

2747
02:09:59,210 --> 02:10:07,489
I love the granary fun yeah I'm stoked

2748
02:10:03,579 --> 02:10:09,079
2020 I want to show the trailer for that

2749
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:10,609
little movie I was talking about you

2750
02:10:09,079 --> 02:10:12,920
guys can kind of keep talking until I

2751
02:10:10,609 --> 02:10:15,019
figure it out it's sharing the screen

2752
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:42,230
didn't seem to be quite as simple as I

2753
02:10:15,020 --> 02:10:43,880
thought it would be all right forget

2754
02:10:42,229 --> 02:10:45,229
about it I'm not doing it everyone can

2755
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:50,060
go check them out there at Earth

2756
02:10:45,229 --> 02:10:52,549
conscious life.org and the the DVD the

2757
02:10:50,060 --> 02:10:55,580
movie is called the need to grow save

2758
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:58,820
the soil save the world need to grow I

2759
02:10:55,579 --> 02:11:01,760
like that it's it's very careful it's

2760
02:10:58,819 --> 02:11:06,198
very safe save all relievers he's still

2761
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:08,420
on I hope he's still on well he said he

2762
02:11:06,198 --> 02:11:10,339
said he said in the chat that he was

2763
02:11:08,420 --> 02:11:12,889
gonna get

2764
02:11:10,340 --> 02:11:14,420
to take his little ones for a hike yeah

2765
02:11:12,889 --> 02:11:17,239
he's a family man I should have given

2766
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:19,039
him a better opportunity this morning

2767
02:11:17,238 --> 02:11:21,769
but they just worked out the way it

2768
02:11:19,039 --> 02:11:23,779
worked and yeah that's a bummer I wanted

2769
02:11:21,770 --> 02:11:27,050
to tell him about I wanted to tell him

2770
02:11:23,779 --> 02:11:31,368
about something so you know this whole

2771
02:11:27,050 --> 02:11:34,820
vape pen crisis or this whole vaping

2772
02:11:31,368 --> 02:11:38,269
crisis has been really you know blown

2773
02:11:34,819 --> 02:11:41,809
out of proportion and is actually done

2774
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:44,480
enough damage to actually move markets

2775
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:47,449
and change market dynamics on what's

2776
02:11:44,479 --> 02:11:50,000
going on and so one of the things I

2777
02:11:47,448 --> 02:11:52,039
think few experts have recognized I want

2778
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:56,389
to you know point out Jeff at the

2779
02:11:52,039 --> 02:11:59,149
workshop and Chris that true terpenes is

2780
02:11:56,389 --> 02:12:01,940
that we better move on this issue fast

2781
02:11:59,149 --> 02:12:04,549
and move responsibly and so we're gonna

2782
02:12:01,939 --> 02:12:08,629
be starting a cannabis vaping

2783
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:12,380
Association and really want people like

2784
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:14,300
say about and other experts to be part

2785
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:16,730
of that discussion because to me it's

2786
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:19,219
like main mission is you know is to

2787
02:12:16,729 --> 02:12:22,638
collect and disseminate science-based

2788
02:12:19,219 --> 02:12:24,889
information and best practices for you

2789
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:27,219
know cannabis vaporization products

2790
02:12:24,889 --> 02:12:28,599
because we believe that have done

2791
02:12:27,219 --> 02:12:33,500
properly

2792
02:12:28,599 --> 02:12:36,289
cannabis vaping is safe but yeah if done

2793
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:41,469
properly so that means that we really

2794
02:12:36,289 --> 02:12:44,118
need to be responsive on setting up a

2795
02:12:41,469 --> 02:12:46,579
regulatory some type of regulatory

2796
02:12:44,118 --> 02:12:48,348
framework on what's allowed and maybe

2797
02:12:46,579 --> 02:12:50,689
even come up with a list of things that

2798
02:12:48,349 --> 02:12:53,900
shouldn't be used like this vitamin E

2799
02:12:50,689 --> 02:12:57,198
acetate just for example or if they find

2800
02:12:53,899 --> 02:12:59,000
MCT to be bad you know and if the

2801
02:12:57,198 --> 02:13:01,519
studies are out there and the best

2802
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:03,800
practices are you know what if you want

2803
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:05,780
to make a cannabis vape pen there's

2804
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:08,360
other things that you can do other

2805
02:13:05,779 --> 02:13:11,198
alternatives that you can use rather

2806
02:13:08,359 --> 02:13:14,210
than these things between them are

2807
02:13:11,198 --> 02:13:17,089
problematic so again I think it's a

2808
02:13:14,210 --> 02:13:20,000
wonderful thing that you know thought

2809
02:13:17,090 --> 02:13:23,060
leaders in our industry are trying to

2810
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,930
get ahead of this issue and not let the

2811
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:27,560
you know

2812
02:13:23,930 --> 02:13:29,090
hysteria and the media kind of blow it

2813
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:32,870
way out of proportion because I know

2814
02:13:29,090 --> 02:13:35,270
we've all seen these you know you know

2815
02:13:32,869 --> 02:13:38,210
honey grab the children articles it's

2816
02:13:35,270 --> 02:13:41,350
just it's crazy that they try to again

2817
02:13:38,210 --> 02:13:44,630
really steer with knee-jerk reaction and

2818
02:13:41,350 --> 02:13:48,020
clickbait to really get people you know

2819
02:13:44,630 --> 02:13:50,000
all worked up on this issue when you

2820
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:53,240
know let's face it a lot of people are

2821
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:55,520
using cannabis vape pens certainly the

2822
02:13:53,239 --> 02:14:00,199
the deaths and and the illnesses is

2823
02:13:55,520 --> 02:14:02,300
nowhere near that of tobacco so cry me a

2824
02:14:00,199 --> 02:14:05,329
[ __ ] River if they're their concerns

2825
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:08,930
about safety when they let tobacco and

2826
02:14:05,329 --> 02:14:11,779
and and and and make a team vaping thing

2827
02:14:08,930 --> 02:14:14,690
go which is completely a juggernaut

2828
02:14:11,779 --> 02:14:17,269
going towards destruction anyway because

2829
02:14:14,689 --> 02:14:21,199
their active ingredient is toxic and

2830
02:14:17,270 --> 02:14:24,460
ours ISM so hey I think it's just a

2831
02:14:21,199 --> 02:14:27,439
really good move by again people in our

2832
02:14:24,460 --> 02:14:29,149
industry to put this together and people

2833
02:14:27,439 --> 02:14:31,429
like me are gonna participate and I hope

2834
02:14:29,149 --> 02:14:35,029
people like Sabo and other folks who are

2835
02:14:31,430 --> 02:14:38,659
in the vape end of our industry or have

2836
02:14:35,029 --> 02:14:41,449
a real important role to play to make

2837
02:14:38,659 --> 02:14:44,869
sure that you know common sense is used

2838
02:14:41,449 --> 02:14:48,500
and that we have you know a fair level

2839
02:14:44,869 --> 02:14:50,630
level field for the evaluation of things

2840
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:52,909
like terpenes like we all know we we

2841
02:14:50,630 --> 02:14:55,670
love terpenes terpenes are what drew

2842
02:14:52,909 --> 02:14:57,829
humans to cannabis right but that

2843
02:14:55,670 --> 02:15:00,230
doesn't mean that you should be you know

2844
02:14:57,829 --> 02:15:04,210
using them at at the concentration that

2845
02:15:00,229 --> 02:15:07,339
they're used at certain times you know

2846
02:15:04,210 --> 02:15:09,079
there could be very very you know at

2847
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:11,029
where do you think that level is mark

2848
02:15:09,079 --> 02:15:13,130
like you know if you make a great

2849
02:15:11,029 --> 02:15:15,349
extract from up from a color that's

2850
02:15:13,130 --> 02:15:18,430
close to 5% Turkey and content that

2851
02:15:15,350 --> 02:15:23,090
you're gonna get a fairly high terpene

2852
02:15:18,430 --> 02:15:25,039
percentage in that extract yeah so I

2853
02:15:23,090 --> 02:15:27,199
mean again like I remember looking

2854
02:15:25,039 --> 02:15:30,859
originally at somewhat like the original

2855
02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:34,069
I'm going back to like 2014 when when we

2856
02:15:30,859 --> 02:15:36,529
looked at using NMR to try to identify

2857
02:15:34,069 --> 02:15:37,759
you know how clean some of these

2858
02:15:36,529 --> 02:15:41,029
mixtures work

2859
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:45,890
but I think that a lot has to do with

2860
02:15:41,029 --> 02:15:48,219
not just the not just the amount of what

2861
02:15:45,890 --> 02:15:51,110
you're using I mean certainly like

2862
02:15:48,220 --> 02:15:54,829
limonene is a solvent right

2863
02:15:51,109 --> 02:15:57,439
there's limonene in cannabis but the

2864
02:15:54,829 --> 02:15:59,750
limonene that's in your orange cleaner I

2865
02:15:57,439 --> 02:16:01,579
mean one of the reasons why ours cleaner

2866
02:15:59,750 --> 02:16:05,060
works so good is because they need to

2867
02:16:01,579 --> 02:16:07,550
add emulsifiers to keep the limonene and

2868
02:16:05,060 --> 02:16:12,310
solution and that basically makes a good

2869
02:16:07,550 --> 02:16:14,980
cleaner those compounds again at high

2870
02:16:12,310 --> 02:16:18,230
concentrations could have really

2871
02:16:14,979 --> 02:16:20,738
detrimental effects and and and I think

2872
02:16:18,229 --> 02:16:23,089
that like people who are like buying

2873
02:16:20,738 --> 02:16:26,269
terpenes from terpene providers like

2874
02:16:23,090 --> 02:16:28,310
true terpenes have to realize that you

2875
02:16:26,270 --> 02:16:30,920
know when you put I guess a vape pen

2876
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:32,780
formula together I mean I guess the

2877
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:35,000
concept of adding a terpene is that you

2878
02:16:32,780 --> 02:16:38,599
could flavor it all that and maybe thin

2879
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:41,929
it out a little bit but you know if you

2880
02:16:38,599 --> 02:16:44,058
don't have the analytical equipment in

2881
02:16:41,929 --> 02:16:46,429
your home or in your lab or wherever

2882
02:16:44,058 --> 02:16:50,268
you're doing this work I mean you're

2883
02:16:46,429 --> 02:16:52,159
really not doing your your customers any

2884
02:16:50,269 --> 02:16:55,399
just any justice because you really

2885
02:16:52,159 --> 02:16:57,888
don't know at what level is is is

2886
02:16:55,399 --> 02:16:59,989
appropriate and again like Sam's always

2887
02:16:57,888 --> 02:17:01,759
talked about terpenes potentiate the

2888
02:16:59,989 --> 02:17:04,340
cannabinoids we know that's part of the

2889
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:09,110
entourage effect but I think you can

2890
02:17:04,340 --> 02:17:13,099
completely overwhelm the concentrate or

2891
02:17:09,110 --> 02:17:16,099
an extract or a vape and fluid with way

2892
02:17:13,099 --> 02:17:19,219
too much terpenes or you know is one

2893
02:17:16,099 --> 02:17:21,319
drop on a diamond is that too much is

2894
02:17:19,218 --> 02:17:24,159
that not enough I mean who knows

2895
02:17:21,319 --> 02:17:27,229
III can't you find a balance between

2896
02:17:24,159 --> 02:17:30,709
cannabis based terpenes and food based

2897
02:17:27,229 --> 02:17:33,579
terpenes well okay so we that was the

2898
02:17:30,709 --> 02:17:37,000
discussion we had many years ago so

2899
02:17:33,579 --> 02:17:41,808
terpenes are molecules they have no

2900
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:45,409
memory from which nice Wranglers they

2901
02:17:41,808 --> 02:17:47,929
came from so limonene derived from well

2902
02:17:45,409 --> 02:17:51,799
actually that's not entirely true

2903
02:17:47,929 --> 02:17:54,290
because like there's two different

2904
02:17:51,799 --> 02:17:57,439
isomers of pining there's a right handed

2905
02:17:54,290 --> 02:18:00,860
and a left handed version and one is

2906
02:17:57,440 --> 02:18:03,800
more predominant in pine species in

2907
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:06,050
North America and the other one is more

2908
02:18:03,799 --> 02:18:08,750
predominant in Europe and they don't

2909
02:18:06,049 --> 02:18:11,090
fully understand why so that's an

2910
02:18:08,750 --> 02:18:13,670
example where yeah it depends which

2911
02:18:11,090 --> 02:18:15,469
biological source that comes from well I

2912
02:18:13,670 --> 02:18:17,719
have I have some to chime in on this one

2913
02:18:15,468 --> 02:18:20,029
in the sense that the real difference is

2914
02:18:17,718 --> 02:18:24,259
is that cannabis derived turkeys are

2915
02:18:20,030 --> 02:18:27,139
always profiles and right and plant and

2916
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:31,700
fruit terpenes are always like single

2917
02:18:27,138 --> 02:18:34,308
molecule terpenes not really no there's

2918
02:18:31,700 --> 02:18:35,990
a profile why would why would orange

2919
02:18:34,308 --> 02:18:39,109
peel just make one turkey and there's

2920
02:18:35,989 --> 02:18:41,149
probably well I know when Horatio was

2921
02:18:39,110 --> 02:18:42,950
ordering pure terpenes and he was

2922
02:18:41,149 --> 02:18:44,479
getting his delimiting that it was like

2923
02:18:42,950 --> 02:18:46,820
eventually he figured out there was a

2924
02:18:44,479 --> 02:18:48,709
small small small tiny percentage of

2925
02:18:46,819 --> 02:18:50,449
citrus oils that he figured out how to

2926
02:18:48,709 --> 02:18:52,189
remove which we did a video on which

2927
02:18:50,450 --> 02:18:54,290
totally freaked me out because when he

2928
02:18:52,190 --> 02:18:56,090
first oil I was like it smells like

2929
02:18:54,290 --> 02:18:57,469
oranges he's like no no it's fine and

2930
02:18:56,090 --> 02:18:59,239
then months later he's like well

2931
02:18:57,468 --> 02:19:01,159
actually figured this out and I went and

2932
02:18:59,239 --> 02:19:03,860
filmed it and he showed that like he

2933
02:19:01,159 --> 02:19:06,260
took a clear delimit een and took and

2934
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:08,840
pulled the oranges [ __ ] out of it you

2935
02:19:06,260 --> 02:19:11,389
could ever imagine and it was the citrus

2936
02:19:08,840 --> 02:19:13,429
oils from five gallons of this [ __ ] that

2937
02:19:11,388 --> 02:19:15,799
he like had us like a leader of or

2938
02:19:13,429 --> 02:19:19,549
something but it was freaked me out in

2939
02:19:15,799 --> 02:19:24,159
the sense that I was like so there's

2940
02:19:19,549 --> 02:19:24,159
another sesquiterpene called Valencia

2941
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:31,700
Lancia oranges and it's got a real much

2942
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:33,620
more fruity er orange essence than

2943
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:37,450
limonene Lima need to be smells like

2944
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:41,360
orange cleaner but Valencia smells like

2945
02:19:37,450 --> 02:19:43,159
somebody just twisted an orange peel

2946
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:46,880
under your nose you know it's got that

2947
02:19:43,159 --> 02:19:49,100
almost bitterness of orange that comes

2948
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:52,129
through in the in the orange peel or the

2949
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:56,120
orange zest but you know Marcus you hit

2950
02:19:52,129 --> 02:19:58,639
it on the head which is that any terpene

2951
02:19:56,120 --> 02:20:02,000
profile like in cannabis and if you look

2952
02:19:58,639 --> 02:20:04,119
at the amount of terpenes in cannabis if

2953
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:07,271
you were to take like the idea

2954
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:09,730
extract this you want the terpenes and

2955
02:20:07,271 --> 02:20:12,579
the cannabinoids and very little else

2956
02:20:09,729 --> 02:20:15,579
and that's why we love live resin

2957
02:20:12,579 --> 02:20:17,709
because you can almost get there in fact

2958
02:20:15,579 --> 02:20:20,200
again I got to go back and look at some

2959
02:20:17,709 --> 02:20:24,969
of our old data because now that I know

2960
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:27,851
that that THC B he was in there or could

2961
02:20:24,969 --> 02:20:30,449
be in there that can take some we had

2962
02:20:27,851 --> 02:20:34,170
live resin that was analyzing for

2963
02:20:30,450 --> 02:20:36,370
anywhere between 90 to 93 percent

2964
02:20:34,170 --> 02:20:38,500
cannabinoids and the rest were almost

2965
02:20:36,370 --> 02:20:41,079
terpenes almost all the way up to 100

2966
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:44,170
percent so we were almost able to make

2967
02:20:41,079 --> 02:20:46,539
the perfect extract from cannabis which

2968
02:20:44,170 --> 02:20:49,180
was just terpenes and cannabinoids and

2969
02:20:46,540 --> 02:20:51,990
very little else whatever else was in

2970
02:20:49,180 --> 02:20:57,970
there was somewhere like about 2 or 3%

2971
02:20:51,989 --> 02:21:00,129
maybe these can Abbi no it's that these

2972
02:20:57,969 --> 02:21:02,199
Italians discovered maybe that was the

2973
02:21:00,129 --> 02:21:05,889
missing jigsaw pieces yeah we just found

2974
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:08,140
them underneath the couch yeah that's

2975
02:21:05,889 --> 02:21:11,139
cool to think about really is because I

2976
02:21:08,139 --> 02:21:13,510
think that the crazy thing is is that if

2977
02:21:11,139 --> 02:21:16,479
you're if you're isolating cannabinoids

2978
02:21:13,510 --> 02:21:18,819
there's no reason why those would be

2979
02:21:16,479 --> 02:21:22,060
partitioned out right is you're doing a

2980
02:21:18,819 --> 02:21:24,699
very nonpolar extraction those are gonna

2981
02:21:22,060 --> 02:21:26,409
come along for the ride so you go back

2982
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:29,771
and look at a bunch of data and see if

2983
02:21:26,409 --> 02:21:31,659
see if those other the Italian

2984
02:21:29,771 --> 02:21:34,930
discovered cannabinoids are in there

2985
02:21:31,659 --> 02:21:37,690
they might be in there right there's all

2986
02:21:34,930 --> 02:21:39,840
kinds of printed evidence where you

2987
02:21:37,690 --> 02:21:43,630
should be able to find that beat as an

2988
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:46,120
identified beat right right Sam I mean I

2989
02:21:43,629 --> 02:21:47,979
mean who's gonna go back into I wonder

2990
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:50,290
if these guys have already done and and

2991
02:21:47,979 --> 02:21:53,139
obviously you know I see something I

2992
02:21:50,290 --> 02:21:55,750
want to hydrogenate it's got I get that

2993
02:21:53,139 --> 02:21:58,510
thing I got a we got it we got to see

2994
02:21:55,750 --> 02:22:00,700
what we can do there because there's a

2995
02:21:58,510 --> 02:22:03,930
whole new bunch of structures that we

2996
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:08,170
could make yeah and they're worth work I

2997
02:22:03,930 --> 02:22:10,899
would be very tempted to breed a TV TP

2998
02:22:08,170 --> 02:22:14,079
dominant variety I don't think it'd be

2999
02:22:10,899 --> 02:22:15,579
better yeah here's what I think here's

3000
02:22:14,079 --> 02:22:17,770
what I think these guys have already

3001
02:22:15,579 --> 02:22:20,049
figured out because because it's it's

3002
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:25,149
in army I think they've already figured

3003
02:22:20,049 --> 02:22:30,519
out that they gotta identify the

3004
02:22:25,148 --> 02:22:33,538
promiscuity of that enzyme to work on

3005
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:37,238
those higher homologs figure out

3006
02:22:33,539 --> 02:22:40,239
experimental mutant put that in eco lie

3007
02:22:37,238 --> 02:22:43,629
and it's over express it through

3008
02:22:40,238 --> 02:22:46,118
heterologous expression and use that way

3009
02:22:43,629 --> 02:22:49,059
to make this thing that's exactly what I

3010
02:22:46,119 --> 02:22:54,520
was thinking so that's one way to do it

3011
02:22:49,059 --> 02:23:00,068
that's one way to do it

3012
02:22:54,520 --> 02:23:02,890
I was cannabis Friday it's like the

3013
02:23:00,068 --> 02:23:05,760
tools of modern biology exist and

3014
02:23:02,889 --> 02:23:08,948
there's scientists who are in the lab

3015
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:11,469
working on this very thing right now as

3016
02:23:08,949 --> 02:23:13,750
we're talking about it I'll bet you a

3017
02:23:11,469 --> 02:23:15,670
dollar to a doughnut right and many

3018
02:23:13,750 --> 02:23:17,889
times a plant is doing it as we speak

3019
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:21,728
I know the plants been doing it for

3020
02:23:17,889 --> 02:23:25,358
years we just didn't know about it very

3021
02:23:21,728 --> 02:23:27,698
true very true I don't know exactly what

3022
02:23:25,359 --> 02:23:34,568
you said but at ecole I I started to get

3023
02:23:27,699 --> 02:23:38,710
frightened well kool-aid they could use

3024
02:23:34,568 --> 02:23:42,068
yeast they can use several vehicles to

3025
02:23:38,709 --> 02:23:45,368
accomplish the same thing but sure so

3026
02:23:42,068 --> 02:23:48,609
far deeper to do it that way they do

3027
02:23:45,369 --> 02:23:51,159
growing in the plant well but just it's

3028
02:23:48,609 --> 02:23:54,760
isolated like you said Sam in so little

3029
02:23:51,158 --> 02:24:02,078
quantity now it's a race between trying

3030
02:23:54,760 --> 02:24:13,148
to breathe okay hold of a variety that's

3031
02:24:02,078 --> 02:24:16,478
got two point zero one percent yes I

3032
02:24:13,148 --> 02:24:19,420
think those guys like John John page and

3033
02:24:16,478 --> 02:24:22,408
those guys and chimera those guys will

3034
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:24,939
identify the genes that close for the

3035
02:24:22,408 --> 02:24:28,420
mutant for that and they'll figure that

3036
02:24:24,939 --> 02:24:31,949
[ __ ] out add that [ __ ] up man that's

3037
02:24:28,420 --> 02:24:31,949
they should do that

3038
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:40,579
science folks I mean this is you know

3039
02:24:37,069 --> 02:24:42,979
this is where plant biotechnology exists

3040
02:24:40,579 --> 02:24:50,090
today it's like I see no reason with

3041
02:24:42,979 --> 02:24:52,670
them but it was us using classical

3042
02:24:50,090 --> 02:24:58,899
breeding that explained the inheritance

3043
02:24:52,670 --> 02:25:01,101
of the cannabinoids so with that

3044
02:24:58,899 --> 02:25:02,420
sue Sam with that said how many

3045
02:25:01,101 --> 02:25:07,370
generations do you think it would take

3046
02:25:02,420 --> 02:25:15,729
to bring you know let's say 0.1% to 10

3047
02:25:07,370 --> 02:25:23,090
or 14 if that for five generations plus

3048
02:25:15,729 --> 02:25:27,279
creating poly hybrids from several that

3049
02:25:23,090 --> 02:25:31,280
on TTV was that from the th TV story

3050
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:33,650
yeah I mean T TV we the varieties that I

3051
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:38,561
started with I had four different

3052
02:25:33,649 --> 02:25:42,590
families that I used South African

3053
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:44,720
Afghan and what I did was I sucked them

3054
02:25:42,590 --> 02:25:51,170
each for three or four generations and

3055
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:53,779
then crossed the inbred families that

3056
02:25:51,170 --> 02:25:56,450
were starting to lose a bigger start

3057
02:25:53,780 --> 02:25:59,780
diluted resistance or yield and way down

3058
02:25:56,450 --> 02:26:03,079
but then when I crossed him and made

3059
02:25:59,780 --> 02:26:06,230
hybrid inside of them it restored on but

3060
02:26:03,079 --> 02:26:07,329
it wasn't bigger and it worked really

3061
02:26:06,229 --> 02:26:14,359
really well

3062
02:26:07,329 --> 02:26:19,220
41 z since it ended up over 1012 someone

3063
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:25,819
meeting 15% K TV and smoothing there's

3064
02:26:19,220 --> 02:26:29,629
no THC I mean like point zero so I I met

3065
02:26:25,819 --> 02:26:32,299
up with with Paul Daley a couple months

3066
02:26:29,629 --> 02:26:35,119
back at his place in Oakland so he's

3067
02:26:32,299 --> 02:26:37,159
working at Doug's Varon with David Lam

3068
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:41,811
pack they're in Oakland California and

3069
02:26:37,159 --> 02:26:43,771
they're only half as high yeah there

3070
02:26:41,810 --> 02:26:48,399
yeah so

3071
02:26:43,771 --> 02:26:52,021
4080 yes yeah exactly he showed me their

3072
02:26:48,399 --> 02:26:55,899
display was I want to say it was like

3073
02:26:52,021 --> 02:26:58,051
working I'm surprised it's taken 10-15

3074
02:26:55,899 --> 02:27:01,899
years for people

3075
02:26:58,050 --> 02:27:05,020
yes so I think I'm not if I remember

3076
02:27:01,899 --> 02:27:11,921
correctly it was it was like 50 percent

3077
02:27:05,021 --> 02:27:14,829
THC and like 35 percent THC V in a

3078
02:27:11,921 --> 02:27:18,159
distillate that's made from that plan

3079
02:27:14,829 --> 02:27:21,341
that Your Honor I understand but that's

3080
02:27:18,159 --> 02:27:23,709
not a particular great ratio of I mean

3081
02:27:21,341 --> 02:27:26,261
if you're after THC with it it's great

3082
02:27:23,709 --> 02:27:30,850
but if you don't want to see if you want

3083
02:27:26,261 --> 02:27:33,399
the THC be I think it would be really

3084
02:27:30,851 --> 02:27:37,690
cool to breed a plant that didn't make

3085
02:27:33,399 --> 02:27:42,579
the the c5 at all and just made c3 and

3086
02:27:37,690 --> 02:27:45,940
c7 right right just breathe the the THC

3087
02:27:42,579 --> 02:27:52,360
out and just make the P in the V what

3088
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:54,610
about see people synthase produces the

3089
02:27:52,360 --> 02:27:59,681
cannabinoid which is the case in these

3090
02:27:54,610 --> 02:28:03,909
then that means it can be bred to be

3091
02:27:59,681 --> 02:28:10,091
more instead of 1% you can give it over

3092
02:28:03,909 --> 02:28:12,369
10 15 maybe even 20 not sure I'm not

3093
02:28:10,091 --> 02:28:15,399
sure it's a particular synthase though

3094
02:28:12,370 --> 02:28:23,471
Sam I think it might be the promiscuity

3095
02:28:15,399 --> 02:28:29,470
of a mutant synthase right it might just

3096
02:28:23,470 --> 02:28:33,909
be changing the substrates it already

3097
02:28:29,470 --> 02:28:35,640
exists is creating multi-product that's

3098
02:28:33,909 --> 02:28:41,940
right that's right

3099
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:50,140
possibility yeah but you just tweak

3100
02:28:41,940 --> 02:28:53,290
that's what I'm saying this is like I'm

3101
02:28:50,140 --> 02:28:56,140
presuming the other way this is a jigsaw

3102
02:28:53,290 --> 02:28:56,841
puzzle for miter and biotechnology and

3103
02:28:56,140 --> 02:28:59,659
what under

3104
02:28:56,841 --> 02:29:02,030
ends it is really valuable intellectual

3105
02:28:59,659 --> 02:29:05,149
property well there's a dozen companies

3106
02:29:02,030 --> 02:29:08,480
worldwide inhibitor kind of produced GMO

3107
02:29:05,149 --> 02:29:12,171
cannabinoids mostly CBD and THC but

3108
02:29:08,479 --> 02:29:14,779
they're even in the mall and so far none

3109
02:29:12,171 --> 02:29:22,791
of them are able to produce it cheaper

3110
02:29:14,780 --> 02:29:25,091
then as people are saying but see to it

3111
02:29:22,790 --> 02:29:30,739
well the same things going to happen

3112
02:29:25,091 --> 02:29:32,720
that's because it's really cheap so who

3113
02:29:30,739 --> 02:29:37,521
are some of those companies sound that

3114
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:40,520
are doing that doing this pathetic yeah

3115
02:29:37,521 --> 02:29:44,271
I have a list of them send me an email

3116
02:29:40,521 --> 02:29:47,120
and I'll send you the whole list of all

3117
02:29:44,271 --> 02:29:54,320
the companies they know better working

3118
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:59,421
with the notion that you can converse is

3119
02:29:54,319 --> 02:30:02,630
going them you know just the notion that

3120
02:29:59,421 --> 02:30:08,720
you can brew it you could brew and use

3121
02:30:02,630 --> 02:30:15,159
fermentation closest to was the folks at

3122
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:18,229
Dartmouth University in Germany okay and

3123
02:30:15,159 --> 02:30:21,470
they published four or five papers on

3124
02:30:18,229 --> 02:30:24,079
producing CBD but I went there and

3125
02:30:21,470 --> 02:30:27,671
visited with Rob and what we saw was

3126
02:30:24,079 --> 02:30:32,239
they also have the ability to put in a

3127
02:30:27,671 --> 02:30:38,860
suite of cannabinoids with a suite of

3128
02:30:32,239 --> 02:30:42,351
turkeys all in the single yeast Wow yeah

3129
02:30:38,860 --> 02:30:45,560
that I said Jesus Christ you are gonna

3130
02:30:42,351 --> 02:30:49,730
complete with cannabis but so far nobody

3131
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:55,279
is producing cannabinoids or to CBD for

3132
02:30:49,729 --> 02:30:57,979
2000 kilo in vitro well I definitely met

3133
02:30:55,280 --> 02:31:01,579
a group in this last year that were very

3134
02:30:57,979 --> 02:31:03,739
interesting I I cringe personally when I

3135
02:31:01,579 --> 02:31:08,950
hear about synthetic cannabinoids and

3136
02:31:03,739 --> 02:31:08,949
people making them I like the idea

3137
02:31:10,421 --> 02:31:17,890
yeah yeah these these are full-on like

3138
02:31:12,521 --> 02:31:24,700
chemical like synthetic like black to be

3139
02:31:17,890 --> 02:31:26,199
cheaper than right maybe different

3140
02:31:24,700 --> 02:31:27,641
compounds right mark you're talking

3141
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:29,530
about completely different no I'm

3142
02:31:27,640 --> 02:31:31,870
talking about this group you know I'm

3143
02:31:29,530 --> 02:31:34,091
under okay so I can't talk about it much

3144
02:31:31,870 --> 02:31:38,620
but I can say that they definitely have

3145
02:31:34,091 --> 02:31:42,011
example mark or Utah they may start with

3146
02:31:38,620 --> 02:31:43,500
a limit all which came back cost 30

3147
02:31:42,011 --> 02:31:46,030
pounds in the kilo

3148
02:31:43,501 --> 02:31:48,460
yeah these guys aren't doing that at all

3149
02:31:46,030 --> 02:31:52,239
it's something totally different their

3150
02:31:48,460 --> 02:31:55,060
quote is we built a better mousetrap Wow

3151
02:31:52,239 --> 02:31:58,449
and it's very insane now for me that

3152
02:31:55,060 --> 02:32:00,460
what okay how I kind of I didn't like

3153
02:31:58,450 --> 02:32:03,131
support it but how I kind of got around

3154
02:32:00,460 --> 02:32:05,831
to actually listening to it because like

3155
02:32:03,130 --> 02:32:07,680
I said my skin starts to crawl he was

3156
02:32:05,831 --> 02:32:12,371
like listen like we're not interested in

3157
02:32:07,681 --> 02:32:15,671
taking over you know trying to compete

3158
02:32:12,370 --> 02:32:17,080
with plant based compounds what we're

3159
02:32:15,671 --> 02:32:19,751
trying to do is build the better

3160
02:32:17,081 --> 02:32:21,851
mousetrap so that we can produce novel

3161
02:32:19,751 --> 02:32:26,649
and unique cannabinoids so that science

3162
02:32:21,851 --> 02:32:29,440
can get an early step on studying them

3163
02:32:26,649 --> 02:32:36,279
you know ones that are not available in

3164
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:37,690
in large they're not talking about

3165
02:32:36,280 --> 02:32:40,511
creating new ones they're talking about

3166
02:32:37,690 --> 02:32:42,971
creating ones like THC pee

3167
02:32:40,511 --> 02:32:45,190
you know or before that like maybe a th

3168
02:32:42,970 --> 02:32:46,899
TV or a CVG you know one of the ones

3169
02:32:45,190 --> 02:32:49,541
that are more novel one of the ones that

3170
02:32:46,899 --> 02:32:52,390
are less available by the ton you know

3171
02:32:49,540 --> 02:32:54,760
maybe even other more novel ones CBC or

3172
02:32:52,390 --> 02:32:58,300
CV I don't you know like this was what

3173
02:32:54,761 --> 02:33:01,390
they were taking but yet CBD Ruby's

3174
02:32:58,300 --> 02:33:09,880
cheapest CBD in the near future well

3175
02:33:01,390 --> 02:33:13,870
it's not right now CBD a decade or a

3176
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:20,921
half ago with $70,000 and it still is

3177
02:33:13,870 --> 02:33:23,390
today and some in some circles okay no

3178
02:33:20,921 --> 02:33:24,501
it's the pharmaceutical sir

3179
02:33:23,390 --> 02:33:27,171
if you're if you're a pharmaceutical

3180
02:33:24,501 --> 02:33:29,149
company purchasing CBD actually and

3181
02:33:27,171 --> 02:33:30,800
produced in a GMP facility and your

3182
02:33:29,149 --> 02:33:35,870
companies in Germany trust me you're not

3183
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:37,609
being 100 dollars a kilo trust me they

3184
02:33:35,870 --> 02:33:40,189
paid they pay huge a ridiculous amount

3185
02:33:37,610 --> 02:33:41,841
of money and I'm glad that CBDs I've got

3186
02:33:40,190 --> 02:33:48,921
twelve hundred dollars a kilo personally

3187
02:33:41,841 --> 02:33:51,681
wonderful today was two pounds yeah it's

3188
02:33:48,921 --> 02:34:05,921
a DVD yeah oh I can hook up for 1200

3189
02:33:51,681 --> 02:34:05,921
then you can isolate I ninety-nine point

3190
02:34:10,120 --> 02:34:20,661
Marcus did what I was saying about that

3191
02:34:17,570 --> 02:34:23,751
price going down and a lot of people who

3192
02:34:20,661 --> 02:34:28,331
got into the hemp industry so to speak

3193
02:34:23,751 --> 02:34:31,310
this year kind of like really you know

3194
02:34:28,331 --> 02:34:34,220
lost their shirts because again I think

3195
02:34:31,310 --> 02:34:37,370
they were they were based on what

3196
02:34:34,220 --> 02:34:39,620
isolate prices were going as little as

3197
02:34:37,370 --> 02:34:43,370
12 months ago my god I was seeing stuff

3198
02:34:39,620 --> 02:34:46,189
going for like 75 to like you know

3199
02:34:43,370 --> 02:34:48,740
ninety five hundred dollars a kilo for

3200
02:34:46,190 --> 02:34:51,951
several you know tens of hundreds of

3201
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:54,831
kilos so I mean III don't think that

3202
02:34:51,950 --> 02:34:59,450
this was a one-time thing I think it is

3203
02:34:54,831 --> 02:35:02,081
like a what a supply demand so a lot of

3204
02:34:59,450 --> 02:35:05,899
people grew so there's this huge supply

3205
02:35:02,081 --> 02:35:09,021
the ability to process that supply is

3206
02:35:05,899 --> 02:35:11,630
not where it needs to be but I think was

3207
02:35:09,021 --> 02:35:14,601
really enhanced in the last say two

3208
02:35:11,630 --> 02:35:17,510
years in those seasons a lot of

3209
02:35:14,601 --> 02:35:20,240
processing capacity went in you saw what

3210
02:35:17,511 --> 02:35:22,761
what Chris Brody is doing he's got in

3211
02:35:20,240 --> 02:35:25,190
South Carolina oh my god the size of

3212
02:35:22,761 --> 02:35:27,860
those those wipers are like four-story

3213
02:35:25,190 --> 02:35:31,881
high and a distillate flowing out of

3214
02:35:27,860 --> 02:35:33,411
that thing like a volcano oh it is when

3215
02:35:31,880 --> 02:35:36,579
you have that level of production

3216
02:35:33,411 --> 02:35:39,129
capacity certainly supply demand I can

3217
02:35:36,579 --> 02:35:40,959
it's just going to be a huge supply you

3218
02:35:39,129 --> 02:35:44,799
know I think people who are speculating

3219
02:35:40,959 --> 02:35:49,709
and buying from Joe and selling to Bob

3220
02:35:44,799 --> 02:35:52,179
you know there's it's it's become a very

3221
02:35:49,709 --> 02:35:55,779
it's just that the market just tanked

3222
02:35:52,180 --> 02:35:58,180
market Aggie yeah not here our market is

3223
02:35:55,780 --> 02:36:00,340
kind of jacked and weird and controlled

3224
02:35:58,180 --> 02:36:02,079
and we need to you know we need to

3225
02:36:00,340 --> 02:36:04,090
deregulate it while still maintaining

3226
02:36:02,079 --> 02:36:05,979
some of the important regulations

3227
02:36:04,090 --> 02:36:07,960
because I have kind of put together the

3228
02:36:05,979 --> 02:36:09,430
fact that you know if and we mentioned

3229
02:36:07,959 --> 02:36:11,229
they were mentioning it in chat today

3230
02:36:09,430 --> 02:36:13,659
that if the if some of the food people

3231
02:36:11,229 --> 02:36:15,250
started you know actually getting if

3232
02:36:13,659 --> 02:36:16,810
people started testing what's in their

3233
02:36:15,250 --> 02:36:19,229
food the way they do their cannabis I

3234
02:36:16,810 --> 02:36:22,629
think they would be absolutely shocked

3235
02:36:19,229 --> 02:36:25,119
like you know shocked so maybe that

3236
02:36:22,629 --> 02:36:27,849
aspect could kind of leak over into food

3237
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:30,010
and we could start you know figuring out

3238
02:36:27,850 --> 02:36:33,190
ways and solutions to keep poisons and

3239
02:36:30,010 --> 02:36:35,950
toxins from infiltrating our air and our

3240
02:36:33,190 --> 02:36:38,890
I think you're mistaken

3241
02:36:35,950 --> 02:36:41,710
most people just don't yeah but like

3242
02:36:38,889 --> 02:36:47,229
most people in America want cheaper

3243
02:36:41,709 --> 02:36:49,000
prices America is only 300 million

3244
02:36:47,229 --> 02:36:50,739
people and there's 7 billion the last

3245
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:53,500
time I checked in the world so they're a

3246
02:36:50,739 --> 02:36:55,869
very small small small percentage of the

3247
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:57,700
actual population of the world they're 5

3248
02:36:55,870 --> 02:37:01,540
percent we're not really America or the

3249
02:36:57,700 --> 02:37:07,240
United States different right yeah we

3250
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:08,800
won't get into that holy [ __ ] we still

3251
02:37:07,239 --> 02:37:11,021
got some folks hanging out here how many

3252
02:37:08,799 --> 02:37:12,520
people are we still got here we got a

3253
02:37:11,021 --> 02:37:14,920
good crew here alright I put it on

3254
02:37:12,521 --> 02:37:17,050
full-page we got yeah Jack's still in

3255
02:37:14,920 --> 02:37:20,379
the house Johnny B and Colin and D for

3256
02:37:17,049 --> 02:37:22,840
20 K and it is just got a beautiful like

3257
02:37:20,379 --> 02:37:27,389
I should have just put his thing on it's

3258
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:31,810
just like a beautiful view that is nice

3259
02:37:27,389 --> 02:37:34,119
hey Marcus I I heard that I heard that

3260
02:37:31,810 --> 02:37:37,000
solvent based extracts turned out okay

3261
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:40,720
Canada is that right yeah they have a

3262
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:42,819
whole list of what you can and can't do

3263
02:37:40,719 --> 02:37:45,520
and mostly it's you know all you know

3264
02:37:42,819 --> 02:37:48,399
hydrocarbons are right are allowed and

3265
02:37:45,521 --> 02:37:50,621
ethanol is allowed and you know so

3266
02:37:48,399 --> 02:37:53,440
people are jumping on that there's all

3267
02:37:50,620 --> 02:37:55,870
probably I would say for sure multiple

3268
02:37:53,440 --> 02:37:58,871
licensed production facilities well for

3269
02:37:55,870 --> 02:38:01,420
sure many running Co to many many some

3270
02:37:58,870 --> 02:38:03,909
running water extraction and dry seft

3271
02:38:01,421 --> 02:38:06,069
already now Roz and I seems an LP the

3272
02:38:03,909 --> 02:38:08,290
other day posted I actually had to do a

3273
02:38:06,069 --> 02:38:10,120
double-take and I should have you know

3274
02:38:08,290 --> 02:38:14,319
kept the picture because it was a giant

3275
02:38:10,120 --> 02:38:16,930
jar of just you know golden amber rosin

3276
02:38:14,319 --> 02:38:19,060
and it just to me just looked like you

3277
02:38:16,931 --> 02:38:21,341
know one of the beautiful jars of one of

3278
02:38:19,060 --> 02:38:23,380
the many hash makers and oil makers that

3279
02:38:21,341 --> 02:38:25,450
I follow on Instagram but then I caught

3280
02:38:23,380 --> 02:38:28,090
like a look and it was like it was a

3281
02:38:25,450 --> 02:38:31,871
licensed producer in Canada and I was

3282
02:38:28,091 --> 02:38:34,300
like wow that's kind of crazy yeah I was

3283
02:38:31,870 --> 02:38:36,580
eyes them kind of brought a smile to my

3284
02:38:34,300 --> 02:38:40,001
face it's like we need to get these

3285
02:38:36,581 --> 02:38:41,501
[ __ ] products into these these very

3286
02:38:40,001 --> 02:38:43,931
slow going

3287
02:38:41,501 --> 02:38:45,970
indoor hands it's incredibly slow going

3288
02:38:43,931 --> 02:38:48,671
system in Canada and it's look it's very

3289
02:38:45,970 --> 02:38:51,279
easy to kind of spend your time trying

3290
02:38:48,671 --> 02:38:53,649
to fight it and argue with an old [ __ ]

3291
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:55,150
in wine or you can do like Jack did and

3292
02:38:53,649 --> 02:38:57,520
just be like I'm just gonna create a

3293
02:38:55,149 --> 02:39:05,011
different system that just operates sort

3294
02:38:57,521 --> 02:39:09,159
of parallel and it's like is that all

3295
02:39:05,011 --> 02:39:11,860
because my back protection or is it also

3296
02:39:09,159 --> 02:39:15,460
be reduced any of it continuous

3297
02:39:11,860 --> 02:39:16,780
production um I would say it's batch for

3298
02:39:15,460 --> 02:39:18,939
now but I mean that's what they're all

3299
02:39:16,780 --> 02:39:20,681
trying to build a lot of the bigger ones

3300
02:39:18,940 --> 02:39:22,631
are trying to build to you know have it

3301
02:39:20,681 --> 02:39:24,131
that sort of conveyor belt like they're

3302
02:39:22,630 --> 02:39:26,140
consistently growing their can see

3303
02:39:24,130 --> 02:39:27,819
everyone in Canada seems to think that

3304
02:39:26,140 --> 02:39:30,270
being vertically integrated and growing

3305
02:39:27,819 --> 02:39:33,040
everything and processing everything I

3306
02:39:30,271 --> 02:39:35,021
were a little different we just want to

3307
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:36,699
process we don't want to get into

3308
02:39:35,021 --> 02:39:38,200
growing it or anything like that now

3309
02:39:36,700 --> 02:39:41,771
that doesn't mean that we don't have a

3310
02:39:38,200 --> 02:39:43,360
very big importance for you know having

3311
02:39:41,771 --> 02:39:45,131
relationships with tissue culture

3312
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:47,681
companies that we can share with our

3313
02:39:45,130 --> 02:39:51,279
potential customers where you know they

3314
02:39:47,681 --> 02:39:55,030
can go in a save 15% of their room that

3315
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:57,221
currently is being mothered into bloom

3316
02:39:55,030 --> 02:39:59,141
so now they're generating revenue that

3317
02:39:57,220 --> 02:40:01,290
will not only pay for the tissue culture

3318
02:39:59,140 --> 02:40:04,199
of plants that will come much cleaner

3319
02:40:01,290 --> 02:40:08,819
totally you know

3320
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:12,460
initiated of all fungi and bacteria and

3321
02:40:08,819 --> 02:40:14,170
viruses to us as a processor that's a

3322
02:40:12,459 --> 02:40:16,089
huge advantage but we don't want to have

3323
02:40:14,170 --> 02:40:17,469
to like we want to facilitate like only

3324
02:40:16,090 --> 02:40:19,079
here here's a tissue culture company

3325
02:40:17,469 --> 02:40:22,119
here's some genetics that you can have

3326
02:40:19,079 --> 02:40:23,680
will be at the back end if you want us

3327
02:40:22,120 --> 02:40:25,450
to purchase some of the material or if

3328
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:27,460
you want to create a partnership where

3329
02:40:25,450 --> 02:40:29,610
we collaborate and do something together

3330
02:40:27,459 --> 02:40:33,489
and we just really want to offer

3331
02:40:29,610 --> 02:40:38,050
processing because the the complexity of

3332
02:40:33,489 --> 02:40:40,239
of growing cannabis is it's just not

3333
02:40:38,049 --> 02:40:47,109
something that our company is interested

3334
02:40:40,239 --> 02:40:50,139
in offering processing just because it

3335
02:40:47,110 --> 02:40:52,500
because solvent but because solvent

3336
02:40:50,139 --> 02:40:55,569
extracts are now available are you to

3337
02:40:52,500 --> 02:40:58,629
start doing solvent based extraction at

3338
02:40:55,569 --> 02:41:01,629
embark uh embark absolutely that's what

3339
02:40:58,629 --> 02:41:03,579
Mike is gonna be doing at embark my

3340
02:41:01,629 --> 02:41:05,229
quest he's now not awesome anymore but

3341
02:41:03,579 --> 02:41:07,209
yeah that's his sort of wheelhouse right

3342
02:41:05,229 --> 02:41:10,180
away you know right away when I when we

3343
02:41:07,209 --> 02:41:12,039
got the idea of embark with the two

3344
02:41:10,180 --> 02:41:14,800
other founders Michael and Bruce my

3345
02:41:12,040 --> 02:41:15,880
partners they approached me they said

3346
02:41:14,799 --> 02:41:17,859
yeah we you know you're that you're the

3347
02:41:15,879 --> 02:41:19,270
hash guy you're the extract guy we want

3348
02:41:17,860 --> 02:41:21,790
to bring you on and I kind of had this

3349
02:41:19,271 --> 02:41:23,860
you know epiphany of like you know all

3350
02:41:21,790 --> 02:41:25,811
these different stories from people like

3351
02:41:23,860 --> 02:41:27,460
you know curing their cancers and

3352
02:41:25,810 --> 02:41:30,340
putting cancers into remissions with

3353
02:41:27,459 --> 02:41:31,959
different solvent extracts you know it

3354
02:41:30,340 --> 02:41:33,940
couldn't be ignored to the point where I

3355
02:41:31,959 --> 02:41:35,919
had to get over my own ego and be like

3356
02:41:33,940 --> 02:41:39,069
look I want to focus on solvent list

3357
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:40,629
that's my what I love but I have all

3358
02:41:39,069 --> 02:41:42,489
these colleagues and people that I know

3359
02:41:40,629 --> 02:41:44,079
in the industry and it was very easy to

3360
02:41:42,489 --> 02:41:46,030
call Mike up and be like look would you

3361
02:41:44,079 --> 02:41:47,229
be interested in coming over and you

3362
02:41:46,030 --> 02:41:49,271
know and then my other partner in

3363
02:41:47,229 --> 02:41:51,159
Colorado who's been doing cryo ethanol

3364
02:41:49,271 --> 02:41:53,950
for five years and producing you know

3365
02:41:51,159 --> 02:41:56,021
lots of CBD isolate he was interested in

3366
02:41:53,950 --> 02:41:57,850
having the project in Canada so I

3367
02:41:56,021 --> 02:41:59,829
thought look you can you know you can be

3368
02:41:57,850 --> 02:42:03,250
this guy I was talking to Indra for a

3369
02:41:59,829 --> 02:42:05,260
while about his his units for for embark

3370
02:42:03,250 --> 02:42:07,450
because he had been so known in the

3371
02:42:05,260 --> 02:42:09,159
industry and he had started you know

3372
02:42:07,450 --> 02:42:11,409
that whole process so it was very easy

3373
02:42:09,159 --> 02:42:13,119
for me to just be like look all focus on

3374
02:42:11,409 --> 02:42:16,360
my wheelhouse healthy water extraction

3375
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:17,320
for dry sifting and and wet washing but

3376
02:42:16,360 --> 02:42:19,480
why don't we create a

3377
02:42:17,319 --> 02:42:22,329
cuivre this is kind of my idea from

3378
02:42:19,479 --> 02:42:25,149
almost the very very beginning that we

3379
02:42:22,329 --> 02:42:28,420
do you know ultrasonic cryo ethanol we

3380
02:42:25,149 --> 02:42:30,819
do co2 we do hydro carbon we do dry sift

3381
02:42:28,420 --> 02:42:33,011
we do wet wash we do rosin and we even

3382
02:42:30,819 --> 02:42:35,319
do terpene extractions so we have this

3383
02:42:33,011 --> 02:42:38,950
quiver that's available I thought just

3384
02:42:35,319 --> 02:42:41,440
from a data standpoint of of processing

3385
02:42:38,950 --> 02:42:43,391
for multiple growers and multiple you

3386
02:42:41,440 --> 02:42:45,730
know licensed production growers and

3387
02:42:43,390 --> 02:42:48,220
craft growers that we would create an

3388
02:42:45,729 --> 02:42:50,829
incredible variety of data that in you

3389
02:42:48,220 --> 02:42:53,261
know in connection to the tissue culture

3390
02:42:50,829 --> 02:42:55,329
companies could really start creating a

3391
02:42:53,261 --> 02:42:59,011
beautiful landscape for easy navigation

3392
02:42:55,329 --> 02:43:01,450
on oh well this LP wants to grow

3393
02:42:59,011 --> 02:43:03,190
specifically for dry sifting oh well

3394
02:43:01,450 --> 02:43:05,320
talk to Sager International they're a

3395
02:43:03,190 --> 02:43:07,511
tissue culture company they've compiled

3396
02:43:05,319 --> 02:43:09,640
all of this data come together with

3397
02:43:07,511 --> 02:43:12,431
embark and there's like four pages of

3398
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:15,069
their menu is cultivars that are

3399
02:43:12,431 --> 02:43:16,931
specific for dry sifting and then

3400
02:43:15,069 --> 02:43:18,220
getting into the nuances of well what

3401
02:43:16,931 --> 02:43:19,690
does that mean well it means that those

3402
02:43:18,220 --> 02:43:22,359
cultivars are gonna produce a higher

3403
02:43:19,690 --> 02:43:24,250
variety of higher ratio of capitate

3404
02:43:22,360 --> 02:43:26,110
stocks trichomes in sessile stock

3405
02:43:24,250 --> 02:43:28,450
trichomes and less of the bulbous ones

3406
02:43:26,110 --> 02:43:31,239
that sit on those single Stipe cells and

3407
02:43:28,450 --> 02:43:34,141
tend to not really effectively come off

3408
02:43:31,239 --> 02:43:37,060
in in both water extraction and

3409
02:43:34,140 --> 02:43:43,079
mechanical screen separation so things

3410
02:43:37,060 --> 02:43:48,360
like that I'm super excited about cool

3411
02:43:43,079 --> 02:43:53,950
will are yes yes what's the highest

3412
02:43:48,360 --> 02:43:57,150
extraction rate of resin cleanup 99 okay

3413
02:43:53,950 --> 02:44:00,271
you've heard of promo variety dry city

3414
02:43:57,149 --> 02:44:03,789
water hash you said you've gotten well

3415
02:44:00,271 --> 02:44:07,000
here's the thing when I get when I I

3416
02:44:03,790 --> 02:44:11,351
don't unfortunately don't dry sift

3417
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:14,979
enough from plant matter what I do is I

3418
02:44:11,351 --> 02:44:17,950
dry sift from farmers grades sift and

3419
02:44:14,979 --> 02:44:20,470
because I'm missing the initial ratio of

3420
02:44:17,950 --> 02:44:23,440
what you know I always know like okay

3421
02:44:20,470 --> 02:44:27,609
like from from most material I might get

3422
02:44:23,440 --> 02:44:29,980
20% heads out of out of you know farmers

3423
02:44:27,610 --> 02:44:30,310
grade sift that's that's high that's

3424
02:44:29,979 --> 02:44:33,130
like

3425
02:44:30,310 --> 02:44:35,619
good a good one now from really like you

3426
02:44:33,130 --> 02:44:38,050
know higher-end material with us real

3427
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:40,181
you know maybe in a tumbler like the

3428
02:44:38,050 --> 02:44:41,680
great gardener matt baron would do if he

3429
02:44:40,181 --> 02:44:44,079
just did a quick like minute or

3430
02:44:41,681 --> 02:44:45,971
something it could get to be fifty

3431
02:44:44,079 --> 02:44:47,501
percent and he was growing fairly well

3432
02:44:45,970 --> 02:44:49,841
in that fifty percent heads would

3433
02:44:47,501 --> 02:44:52,870
actually produce a pseudo melty product

3434
02:44:49,841 --> 02:44:54,370
and you know if you're doing a trim bin

3435
02:44:52,870 --> 02:44:56,351
and trimming over it without even

3436
02:44:54,370 --> 02:44:59,650
touching it yeah i've seen it come out

3437
02:44:56,351 --> 02:45:02,230
in the 90s but how much of it do I get

3438
02:44:59,649 --> 02:45:04,989
is impossible for me to know because I

3439
02:45:02,229 --> 02:45:07,060
only know from a kilo of sifts if I get

3440
02:45:04,989 --> 02:45:15,729
a kilo of sift and I work with it to

3441
02:45:07,060 --> 02:45:20,829
clean it up it's still pretty far out

3442
02:45:15,729 --> 02:45:24,540
but cannabis can be cheap enough that

3443
02:45:20,829 --> 02:45:27,659
they can afford to dissect it because

3444
02:45:24,540 --> 02:45:31,079
it's much more you get much more

3445
02:45:27,659 --> 02:45:31,079
cannabinoids in a key

3446
02:45:34,620 --> 02:45:40,120
well and it's like it's this it's the

3447
02:45:37,569 --> 02:45:43,300
system the plant setup to store those

3448
02:45:40,120 --> 02:45:47,641
compounds in so the micro encapsulated

3449
02:45:43,300 --> 02:45:50,560
resin gland is my favorite form of

3450
02:45:47,640 --> 02:45:52,359
having hash in just like little dusted

3451
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:55,630
you know just scoop it out with a little

3452
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:57,521
scooper and you're good I like their

3453
02:45:55,630 --> 02:46:00,939
cured a little bit for the better more

3454
02:45:57,521 --> 02:46:02,521
like dried raisins rather than a fat you

3455
02:46:00,940 --> 02:46:04,780
see great mm-hmm

3456
02:46:02,521 --> 02:46:07,989
absolutely but then again you were you

3457
02:46:04,780 --> 02:46:10,211
know you have some did you ever test the

3458
02:46:07,989 --> 02:46:12,280
percentage of terpenes that were in like

3459
02:46:10,210 --> 02:46:16,979
the skunk or whatever like that's not a

3460
02:46:12,280 --> 02:46:22,931
that's not a one two three is it I did

3461
02:46:16,979 --> 02:46:24,729
one time oh I'm not sure maybe I just

3462
02:46:22,931 --> 02:46:29,801
don't remember what actual percentage

3463
02:46:24,729 --> 02:46:32,501
like the skunk it wasn't enormous lehigh

3464
02:46:29,800 --> 02:46:39,790
and I don't remember what the difference

3465
02:46:32,501 --> 02:46:43,371
was between herb and number one farmers

3466
02:46:39,790 --> 02:46:45,840
ash because I tested both

3467
02:46:43,370 --> 02:46:47,911
be interesting to find out the herb I

3468
02:46:45,841 --> 02:46:50,671
would think it would be over that 3%

3469
02:46:47,911 --> 02:46:54,810
like maybe even 3.0 yeah what might

3470
02:46:50,671 --> 02:47:01,681
because percent or whatever but it's I

3471
02:46:54,810 --> 02:47:06,300
mean I've I've never heard anything

3472
02:47:01,681 --> 02:47:08,101
higher than 10 but maybe yeah tends

3473
02:47:06,300 --> 02:47:09,930
insane that's what I'm saying and then

3474
02:47:08,101 --> 02:47:12,060
we talked about like extracting that in

3475
02:47:09,931 --> 02:47:14,131
making a high terpene you know where

3476
02:47:12,060 --> 02:47:16,140
you're fresh frozen or you're you're

3477
02:47:14,130 --> 02:47:18,390
freezing it before you're doing you know

3478
02:47:16,140 --> 02:47:20,280
you're preserving every last terpene

3479
02:47:18,390 --> 02:47:21,690
that is you're bumping those terpene

3480
02:47:20,281 --> 02:47:25,980
contents hi

3481
02:47:21,690 --> 02:47:29,640
i sometimes wonder if you're saving too

3482
02:47:25,979 --> 02:47:31,800
many or if the when you're carrying your

3483
02:47:29,640 --> 02:47:38,850
baby british little more about twitter

3484
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:40,740
feeds and maybe i don't know who's to

3485
02:47:38,851 --> 02:47:43,621
know well [ __ ] i want to say one more

3486
02:47:40,740 --> 02:47:45,899
time I want to talk about the need to

3487
02:47:43,620 --> 02:47:50,670
grow just briefly I'm gonna share it

3488
02:47:45,899 --> 02:47:53,640
with some friends Tanner who was a part

3489
02:47:50,671 --> 02:47:55,979
of the need to grow it was I think a big

3490
02:47:53,640 --> 02:47:57,421
part of it like a director producer or

3491
02:47:55,979 --> 02:47:59,310
something he sent me an email I guess

3492
02:47:57,421 --> 02:48:00,001
he's watching or my friend from Calgary

3493
02:47:59,310 --> 02:48:02,161
is watching

3494
02:48:00,001 --> 02:48:03,960
he said that he'd love to come on hash

3495
02:48:02,161 --> 02:48:07,050
Church and talk about living soil and

3496
02:48:03,960 --> 02:48:09,689
and you know that the differences of the

3497
02:48:07,050 --> 02:48:11,640
living soil and big AG and he could

3498
02:48:09,690 --> 02:48:13,801
bring the director potentially the green

3499
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:17,100
powerhouse inventor there's this guy who

3500
02:48:13,800 --> 02:48:19,710
creates this powerhouse generator thing

3501
02:48:17,101 --> 02:48:21,810
on this film called the need to grow and

3502
02:48:19,710 --> 02:48:28,620
you can you can check out the need to

3503
02:48:21,810 --> 02:48:30,780
grow at Earth conscious life dot org I

3504
02:48:28,620 --> 02:48:32,729
think it's like I don't know a few bucks

3505
02:48:30,781 --> 02:48:34,440
to watch definitely worth it there's

3506
02:48:32,729 --> 02:48:36,240
some super inspirational [ __ ] in that

3507
02:48:34,440 --> 02:48:38,341
film I watched it this last trip to

3508
02:48:36,240 --> 02:48:40,979
Calgary and I really really enjoyed it

3509
02:48:38,341 --> 02:48:42,810
it was it was just really positive so I

3510
02:48:40,979 --> 02:48:46,290
wanted to mention that one more time and

3511
02:48:42,810 --> 02:48:50,761
get you know I'll say you guys I'll send

3512
02:48:46,290 --> 02:48:53,640
you guys the link here in the chat room

3513
02:48:50,761 --> 02:48:56,069
and then actually I'll yeah yeah and

3514
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:56,728
then here's the password right here I

3515
02:48:56,069 --> 02:48:59,520
guess I

3516
02:48:56,728 --> 02:49:01,019
just keeping that personal to yourselves

3517
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:02,640
because they are you know raising money

3518
02:49:01,020 --> 02:49:04,498
to pay for their project and I'd love

3519
02:49:02,639 --> 02:49:05,788
for people to support them but that's

3520
02:49:04,498 --> 02:49:08,639
gonna be a hashed Church coming up I

3521
02:49:05,789 --> 02:49:10,229
also dropped a photo for for the

3522
02:49:08,639 --> 02:49:12,959
promotion of hashed Church thanks to

3523
02:49:10,228 --> 02:49:15,358
Matthew Tanner for doing that devolved

3524
02:49:12,959 --> 02:49:17,368
media on Instagram get our little hash

3525
02:49:15,359 --> 02:49:21,300
picture for the hash Church episode this

3526
02:49:17,369 --> 02:49:24,180
week and in that post I mentioned hey

3527
02:49:21,299 --> 02:49:26,340
tag your favorite hash makers so for all

3528
02:49:24,180 --> 02:49:29,130
of you hash makers that got tagged in

3529
02:49:26,340 --> 02:49:31,498
that I will be hitting you up one by one

3530
02:49:29,129 --> 02:49:33,898
and sending you a link to a meeting room

3531
02:49:31,498 --> 02:49:36,510
that I'll have set up on my Zune it's

3532
02:49:33,898 --> 02:49:38,368
not gonna be filmed or live but I want

3533
02:49:36,510 --> 02:49:40,648
you guys to come in I'll probably have

3534
02:49:38,369 --> 02:49:42,960
some of my panelists linked up in there

3535
02:49:40,648 --> 02:49:44,698
as well we can fit like 49 at a time now

3536
02:49:42,959 --> 02:49:46,288
so it's pretty gnarly we're gonna have

3537
02:49:44,699 --> 02:49:48,090
to learn to not talk over one another

3538
02:49:46,289 --> 02:49:50,399
but I want to have a conversation with

3539
02:49:48,090 --> 02:49:52,109
all these hash makers there were so many

3540
02:49:50,398 --> 02:49:54,389
of them and I want to kind of suss out a

3541
02:49:52,109 --> 02:49:56,309
really great conversation maybe for next

3542
02:49:54,389 --> 02:49:58,469
week maybe for two or three weeks in the

3543
02:49:56,309 --> 02:50:00,090
future we do have lifts coming to town

3544
02:49:58,469 --> 02:50:02,549
and here in Vancouver which is a big

3545
02:50:00,090 --> 02:50:04,889
event about tours at my facility in

3546
02:50:02,549 --> 02:50:08,938
Delta and I'm going on a couple of tours

3547
02:50:04,889 --> 02:50:10,680
of producers here in British Columbia so

3548
02:50:08,939 --> 02:50:13,139
I will be fairly busy but I'd love to

3549
02:50:10,680 --> 02:50:14,189
keep consistent with hash search and get

3550
02:50:13,139 --> 02:50:16,078
another episode

3551
02:50:14,189 --> 02:50:18,270
I don't want those hash makers to think

3552
02:50:16,078 --> 02:50:19,978
that you know because they didn't get on

3553
02:50:18,270 --> 02:50:22,649
this week maybe that's what they were

3554
02:50:19,978 --> 02:50:23,938
thinking I haven't forgotten about you I

3555
02:50:22,648 --> 02:50:25,769
think it's a great idea to stay

3556
02:50:23,939 --> 02:50:27,630
connected to all these people who are

3557
02:50:25,770 --> 02:50:30,869
actually getting their hands dirty in

3558
02:50:27,629 --> 02:50:32,818
regards to producing full melt ashes and

3559
02:50:30,869 --> 02:50:34,529
solvent less raw sands and all these

3560
02:50:32,818 --> 02:50:37,228
other products I love the idea of having

3561
02:50:34,529 --> 02:50:40,859
another episode that's just really

3562
02:50:37,228 --> 02:50:42,809
focused on hash the thing that of course

3563
02:50:40,859 --> 02:50:46,529
I love so much and this is hash Church

3564
02:50:42,809 --> 02:50:48,328
so I want to be more yeah we need more

3565
02:50:46,529 --> 02:50:50,670
hash Johnny B and Johnny B and I are

3566
02:50:48,328 --> 02:50:53,578

3568
02:50:53,578 --> 02:50:58,228

up under a [ __ ] hot like bridge -

3571
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:06,059
Road in West Vancouver and it was kind

3572
02:51:04,738 --> 02:51:08,219
of funny because the quote of the year

3573
02:51:06,059 --> 02:51:09,369
was like wow we have legalization Johnny

3574
02:51:08,219 --> 02:51:11,709
B was like we have Lee

3575
02:51:09,370 --> 02:51:14,649
and then my quote was like yeah we're

3576
02:51:11,709 --> 02:51:15,879
standing under a bridge like that's

3577
02:51:14,648 --> 02:51:17,590
where we're puffing with our

3578
02:51:15,879 --> 02:51:19,688

3611
02:52:37,989 --> 02:52:42,250
canned stuff like that I was looking in

3612
02:52:40,030 --> 02:52:47,020
the window we weren't that funny back

3613
02:52:42,250 --> 02:52:50,109
happy back the capping businesses that's

3614
02:52:47,020 --> 02:52:52,899
my landlord owns that and I mean we were

3615
02:52:50,109 --> 02:52:55,300
we were blacklisted here in Victoria by

3616
02:52:52,898 --> 02:52:59,379
all the big real estate companies and so

3617
02:52:55,299 --> 02:53:03,219
we had a cannabis activists who his his

3618
02:52:59,379 --> 02:53:05,858
kid ran the bomb City and so he rented a

3619
02:53:03,219 --> 02:53:08,579
the our administrative office is about

3620
02:53:05,859 --> 02:53:11,200
the bomb City it's a beautiful old

3621
02:53:08,579 --> 02:53:14,799
Victorian like apartment and then we

3622
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:17,790
have that North Park which was the dank

3623
02:53:14,799 --> 02:53:21,429
Bank and trees and a bunch of other

3624
02:53:17,790 --> 02:53:22,840
doing we cleaned it up a bit and made it

3625
02:53:21,430 --> 02:53:26,859
into a nice outreach

3626
02:53:22,840 --> 02:53:28,960
and I dropped a sea-can out back so

3627
02:53:26,859 --> 02:53:31,200
everyday we have support groups and

3628
02:53:28,959 --> 02:53:34,209
cannabis education groups back there

3629
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:36,850
where people can keep dry and I've built

3630
02:53:34,209 --> 02:53:42,059
a an overhang so that there's an outdoor

3631
02:53:36,850 --> 02:53:44,800
smoking area since we're allowed to not

3632
02:53:42,059 --> 02:53:47,228
get away with a lot of things I'm trying

3633
02:53:44,799 --> 02:53:48,639
to push the boundaries of what we can do

3634
02:53:47,228 --> 02:53:51,369
to make people comfortable in the

3635
02:53:48,639 --> 02:53:53,319

nice soft kind voice and I you didn't

3689
02:56:14,690 --> 02:56:18,351
say much today but I did appreciate the

3690
02:56:16,310 --> 02:56:22,220
few things that you did say and I would

3691
02:56:18,351 --> 02:56:23,721
chime in for a second yes just say one

3692
02:56:22,220 --> 02:56:26,539
of the things that's on my list this

3693
02:56:23,720 --> 02:56:32,239
year is to renew my passport so I didn't

3694
02:56:26,540 --> 02:56:37,990
come see y'all up there yeah looking

3695
02:56:32,239 --> 02:56:37,989
forward to it and bring forests back

3696
02:56:39,011 --> 02:56:48,051
that that's a hard story right now

3697
02:56:42,739 --> 02:56:51,890
Silas is struggling a lot and I've seen

3698
02:56:48,050 --> 02:56:58,039
forests maybe three times in the last

3699
02:56:51,890 --> 02:57:01,100
four months because as he tells me he's

3700
02:56:58,040 --> 02:57:03,521
trying to keep his son alive he's going

3701
02:57:01,101 --> 02:57:03,521
through puberty

3702
02:57:04,420 --> 02:57:10,479
he's got type 1 diabetes so trying to

3703
02:57:08,511 --> 02:57:13,790
keep him fed and his blood levels

3704
02:57:10,479 --> 02:57:16,970
glucose levels in check and all that so

3705
02:57:13,790 --> 02:57:17,780
yeah I'm totally supporting him trying

3706
02:57:16,970 --> 02:57:19,939
to do that

3707
02:57:17,780 --> 02:57:23,000
keeping Silas alive seems like a really

3708
02:57:19,940 --> 02:57:25,340
important work at the moment for him and

3709
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:28,370
doing what I can to keep the families

3710
02:57:25,340 --> 02:57:33,079
that were involved in the cloud rheostat

3711
02:57:28,370 --> 02:57:35,900
work provided the the medical thing in

3712
02:57:33,079 --> 02:57:38,659
California has really blown apart kind

3713
02:57:35,899 --> 02:57:42,319
of tragically the collective model

3714
02:57:38,659 --> 02:57:44,959
there's some room with the donations tax

3715
02:57:42,319 --> 02:57:48,170
relief and whatnot but anyway I don't

3716
02:57:44,959 --> 02:57:49,630
want to I don't want to go down a long

3717
02:57:48,170 --> 02:57:51,970
rabbit hole I just

3718
02:57:49,630 --> 02:57:55,421
want to thank you again for doing the

3719
02:57:51,970 --> 02:57:58,780
church and thank all of those folks who

3720
02:57:55,421 --> 02:58:01,421

3721
02:57:58,781 --> 02:58:04,690
their voices to what we're talking about
