00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:04,149
the nature of things video that Hillary

40
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:05,949
sent me the other day when she went down

41
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:09,009

00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:22,879
few years later at skunkman Sam's place

00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:23,989
in Amsterdam alright Linus we had met

47
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,568

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,750
it might have been up north with this

49
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:30,889

I'm looking forward to today's

58
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,549
discussion with everyone I think that

59
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,099
it's you know a chance often with us

60
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,230
being a pioneer down in California but

61
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:02,000
it's nice to have yourself it's gonna be

62
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:03,679
great to have Hillary come in she I know

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,129
she's in Ottawa right now she's

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,750
absolutely non-stop and she's got some

65
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:11,389
some interesting things to share with us

66
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:15,709
this morning I've also invited her to

67
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:18,500
saw a really well-spoken lawyer who now

68
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:22,159
works for canopy growth as a consultant

69
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,870
but I saw him recently speak I guess it

70
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,379
was a cannabis conversation that he

71
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,539
spoke at on the news with Bill Blair and

72
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:32,239
a couple of others and he was just so

73
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:34,459
well-spoken that I wanted to get him in

74
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:41,060
as well welcome Hilary how are you

75
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:46,209

76
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:50,810

77
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:52,759
thank you oh good yeah so we're waiting

78
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,129
on forest is going to be coming in in a

79
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,870
few minutes as well and I sent out the

80
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,090
invitation to the dragonfly earth

81
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,829
medicine as well as Wade laughter I

82
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,229
always people that seem to really

83
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:05,989
facilitate a great conversation and of

84
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:08,179
course people that are into this also up

85
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:11,629
to their necks and what I mean by this

86
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,989
is just the whole you know the the

87
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:17,180
activism the growing the educating the

88
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,298
sort of all these things that I guess

89
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,280
the activism has turned into as we get

90
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:24,668
more and more permissions and more and

91
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:27,918
more capabilities to do these things

92
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:28,569
permissions know we can we created our

93
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:32,500
own permission

94
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:36,129
we did not an industry right these two

95
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,050
women before us are the the pioneers I

96
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:39,730
mean yes you could consider me a pioneer

97
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,250
but we're the second generation Valerie

98
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,560
was first generation definitely

99
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,800
wonderful Hillary was the predecessor

100
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,910
there as well so I consider myself a

101
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,610
secondary pioneer to these these amazing

102
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,100
ladies hi Valerie

103
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,600
hello hi darling how are you well I was

104
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,300
trying to remember the last time that I

105
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,640
saw you in person and I don't well if

106
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,800
I've seen you since we filmed the nature

107
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,579
of things in 1998 like have I seen you

108
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,540
in person since then I think that we saw

109
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:15,719
one another in conference someone had a

110
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:20,710
hip thing up in the hips

111
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,920
well it has been 20 years second you

112
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:25,719
know a long time let's try some event

113
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,400
that we both want to go to and see if we

114
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,630
can cross paths because I sure wouldn't

115
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:38,439
want you have an lady at 11 I've been

116
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:40,449

117
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,670
know more bedside events that's more

118
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:45,069
where I've been

119
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:48,310

124
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:03,459
you well you ignited a flame let me tell

125
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:05,199
you Valerie because Hillary has not

126
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:09,339
stopped since she came back from

127
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,610
California in 1998 and it's been like

128
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:15,609
watching a comet across the sky it's

129
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:18,009
been very very inspirational to say the

130
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,520
least she's pulled a lot of good out of

131
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:23,860
me I feel that being just a helper and

132
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,689
an assistant and someone who could help

133
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,449
facilitate things for her she always

134
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:30,759
made me just feel like I just I felt

135
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:32,409
great helping the club I helped great

136
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,649
being a part of anything that she was a

137
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,660
part of and I feel blessed to have been

138
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:39,729
you know the small part that I got to be

139
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,590
in it and still be in it and watching

140
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,600

141
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:45,359

165
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,550
was going to be coming and I did just a

166
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,450
couple of Google searches on both of you

167
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:57,670
and the interesting thing that I found

168
00:07:54,449 --> 00:08:00,189
immediately in Valerie story and in your

169
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,660
stories and it was it seemed like it was

170
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,759
in the first couple of paragraphs of

171
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:07,360
both stories that I brought up were that

172
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,149
you both in all of this have had guns

173
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,290
put to your head by enforcement officers

174
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:17,079
I just thought oh my god what a terrible

175
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,600
thing to have in common yet it's just

176
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,379
this really real thing that were a part

177
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,970
of that it can't be escaped you know and

178
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,589
that was that was pretty pretty

179
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,780
incredible for me to read that you guys

180
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,129
have that in common

181
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:38,319
has that happened to you more than once

182
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:41,649
Mel I yeah it has but no but and you

183
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:47,890
know the the interesting thing that I

184
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:51,819
think there's that how all of us know a

185
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:53,949
place within that's change I'm not

186
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,000
saying that I feel safe with a gun to my

187
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,120
head that's that's

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,970
so but that there's a place inside that

189
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:07,840
knows and you may perhaps maybe it is

190
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,940
the the experience as well certainly the

191
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,690
experiences of our life lend to them but

192
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:20,200
the more the psychedelic or expanded

193
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:24,040
experiences that reveal to us that there

194
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:28,509
is a deep awareness and connection to

195
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:31,299
self and that we can and and do find our

196
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:37,480
way into that place that's the place

197
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:42,189
that protects us when internally when

198
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:44,470
the external becomes too too much to

199
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:50,980
bear that people all over the world know

200
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:52,810
that experience ours in lieu of what has

201
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,000
occurring throughout this the planet at

202
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:58,169
this time of polarization within our own

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,789
country and from state to state of

204
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:04,899
national state from country to country

205
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:06,819
and eternally is profoundly important I

206
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:15,250
think for me to have that experience so

207
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:17,350
that I can both share develop more

208
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,269
compassion and share that internal

209
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:24,040
experience a knowledge of that to know

210
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:26,620
that you know the fear deep can breed

211
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:30,639
deep resentment and and anger and it can

212
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:33,070
also breed compassion so that you know

213
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,990
perhaps those are the little ways the

214
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,360
human ways in a world of almost a

215
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,779
billion people that we share knowledge

216
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,259
of one another that we become better

217
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:44,529
people

218
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:46,088
you know then we done this moment you

219
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:48,100
know from moment to moment it's get a

220
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:49,660
whole lifetime good nice to become a

221
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,639
master so I guess you know we're just

222
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:53,740
here trying to figure out how to be the

223
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,500
master of self and then all the rest

224
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,980
falls away and just forgotten really I

225
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:03,100
mean it's you know it's just a blip but

226
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,639
really an amazingly fun and remarkable

227
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,730
blip

228
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,989
so from in that personal experience of

229
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,418
life so

230
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:14,199
the yeah I've had guns pointed at me I

231
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:16,428
think you know I I know that what's done

232
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:22,068
belabor this but I know that what's done

233
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:28,999
is to men is by men DEA agents or agents

234
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:34,428
dudes with guns is can be demeaning and

235
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:36,798
and in our country the men with guns

236
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:41,028
can't touch women the way that they

237
00:11:36,798 --> 00:11:44,509
touch men the way that they harm and

238
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:46,850
cause try to break a man emotionally so

239
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:50,359
I'm not saying it's less for us I'm

240
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,859
saying it's different and you know I

241
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:54,739
don't know that that's the case all the

242
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:56,749
time but I also know that they don't

243
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:57,410
know agents don't know what they're

244
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,759
walking into

245
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:01,129
they don't know if they're walking into

246
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:06,589
a gun they don't know if they're walking

247
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:09,769
into they're facing their death so no

248
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:11,779
excuses just that we're trying all of us

249
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,009
to learn how to be in this world

250
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:17,629
together

251
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:20,329
I mean cannabis is a huge you know this

252
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:23,329
is the the big industry so you know

253
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:25,849
you've got the pharmaceutical industry

254
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:27,498
and tobacco and alcohol and all the big

255
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:33,109
dudes and I say dudes because I know

256
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:36,189
there are few women in there too but you

257
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:39,769
know put pulling down ownership and

258
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:43,548
pushing out small business and pushing

259
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:46,009
aside compassion I mean for us we know

260
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:47,808
that we've seen what's happened to the

261
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:51,199
we're not Canada we're not connects we

262
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:54,409
don't do we don't do compassion we do

263
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:58,008
pull yourself up by your bootstraps kind

264
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:59,899
of thing so I don't know there's there's

265
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:03,639
too little compassion on the planet so I

266
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:05,909
guess it remains our job right so and

267
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,950
how do you put the

268
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:08,949
[Music]

269
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:17,989
you put the the gun of kindness the one

270
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:19,278
that that blows open someone's heart you

271
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:21,189
know how do you put that to their heart

272
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,808
if they haven't been a party to

273
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:25,129
suffering or become hardened through

274
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:27,588
their own suffering instead of more

275
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:30,168
compassionate so yes I had again at

276
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:33,369
least like a few and he again spilled on

277
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:47,720
me only by cops which is fortunate I

278
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:49,519
guess at looking back on it well that's

279
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,548
very interesting and very well put

280
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,379
Valerie it reminds me of something Jesus

281
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:56,149
just mentioning this guy's name I could

282
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:58,668
have a hundred people hate me because

283
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:00,019
he's classified as he gets put into all

284
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:02,389
these different classifications but I

285
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:03,649
saw Jordan Peterson talking on Joe Rogan

286
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:07,519
the other day and he was talking about

287
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:10,369
the importance of of difficulty and how

288
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,798
it unlocks things in our DNA as we as

289
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:14,418
not necessarily suffer but as we do

290
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:15,828
things that are difficult as we do

291
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:19,039
things that are challenging that it

292
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:22,008
actually unlocks DNA in our own self and

293
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,318
opens ourselves up more to who we have

294
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:25,668
the potential of being and you just

295
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:27,948
really explained that in the most

296
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:30,168
beautiful way like how do we unlock how

297
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:33,498
do we blow up compassion in someone's

298
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:35,659
heart and I guess it's by maybe not

299
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:37,659
reacting the way they anticipate and

300
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:40,519
expect one to react in these particular

301
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:43,909
situations when you know putting a gun

302
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:47,298
to someone's head is a very very serious

303
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:48,588
thing and doing it over flowers and

304
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:50,869
doing it to someone who's actually

305
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:53,720
helping terminally ill and palliative

306
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:55,788
care people it just seems to take it to

307
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,089
a level where it you you would think

308
00:14:55,788 --> 00:15:02,269
that the natural thing to do would be

309
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:04,279
resentful and angry and and and to not

310
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,499
have that experience and to shift it to

311
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:13,879
the other direction is very very

312
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:17,659
powerful in my opinion well yeah me once

313
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:20,989
and market was when our friend Kyle was

314
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:22,278
getting busted and he and he was growing

315
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:25,160
for the compassion clubs

316
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:26,958
I went to his house on purpose and I was

317
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:29,568
the one who opened the door to the

318
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:33,169
police on purpose it was banned into it

319
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:36,620
I ran right into it and the young man

320
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:37,909
who had the gun who was like get down on

321
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,730
the floor as soon as I opened the door

322
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:43,100
and had the gun on me very much towards

323
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,350
my head he was terrified he was

324
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,540
trembling I remember seeing the lake

325
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,050
shaking gun thinking well this is not

326
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:50,688
good

327
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:52,878
and so I was like you're okay you're

328
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:55,849
okay we're not armed you're okay I'm

329
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:58,550
okay we're all okay like that was my

330
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:01,069
response was realizing that like he I

331
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:03,620
think was more terrified than I was I

332
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:08,120
felt pretty strong and calm and clear

333
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:10,278
and that poor peachfuzz armed guy was

334
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,169
like yeah he was not having a good day

335
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:14,299
having all that guy know the whole

336
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:16,219
experience was really incredible I was

337
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:20,719
there obviously from the start I dropped

338
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:22,730
him off at his house he had forgotten

339
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,620
his keys I suggested it wasn't a good

340
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,149
idea at this time of night to try and

341
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,339
break into his house because a neighbor

342
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:29,990
was gonna was gonna think that he was

343
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,370
breaking into the house and he was like

344
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,068
you know you're right let's just call a

345
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,720
locksmith so we called a locksmith and

346
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:37,490
the locksmith worked on the front door

347
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,050
for half an hour well the neighbor saw

348
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,990
the locksmith thought we were breaking

349
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:44,389
into the house called the police police

350
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,769
showed up they wanted to see ID they

351
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:47,688
wanted to see this that the other thing

352
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:50,089
they eventually wanted to gain access to

353
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:53,299
the house because right up at the house

354
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:55,579
it didn't stink but at the sidewalk to

355
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:57,349
the house it reached just the way it is

356
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:58,818
sometimes with smells were you

357
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,990
you make toast in your house and it

358
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,458
doesn't smell in your kitchen but you

359
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,558
walk halfway up your staircase and

360
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:05,629
there's that toast smell that's what

361
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:07,308
happened with the cannabis so then he

362
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,409
showed up they kind of pretended to

363
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:11,720
leave I'm so hyper aware at times

364
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:13,280
especially when it comes to the police I

365
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,808
realized they haven't left at all

366
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,849
they've actually gone and parked down

367
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:19,490
the block in the back lane and they are

368
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:21,438
awaiting a warrant so I'm talking to my

369
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,788
friend like listen let's let's figure

370
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,470
this out maybe we could throw everything

371
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:26,088
into the neighbor's backyard for the

372
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,308
time being I'm just trying to help my

373
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:30,859
friend you know he's also not from

374
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:33,980
Canada I don't want to see him get sent

375
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:35,389
back down to the US and what-do-i-do

376
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,870
what-do-i-do what-do-i-do well I know

377
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,840
what I

378
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:44,028
I [ __ ] call Hillary black is what I

379
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:47,778
do and Hillary literally races down to

380
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:50,990
the house goes inside you know calms him

381
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:57,710
down try to burn the clothes fresh she

382
00:17:50,990 --> 00:18:00,528
was poor guy he created exergy

383
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,808
exigent exigent circumstances what's the

384
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:06,308
term kirk i don't know it's some sort of

385
00:18:02,808 --> 00:18:08,960
circumstances yeah

386
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:10,970
exigent circumstances just made some

387
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:16,970
emergency crazy lawyer word for

388
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:17,480
emergency or routing them right what's

389
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,278
that

390
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,278
i say he should have juiced them

391
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:25,759
absolutely so that was quite quite an

392
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:28,069
experience and that started a whole ball

393
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:31,158
rolling for you he'll and that was one

394
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:32,569
of those moments where you just you're

395
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:34,220
just like of course I'm gonna go run

396
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:36,500
down there and be at the front door when

397
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,659
they open the door like that's I'll tell

398
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,589
you that's that's a compassion club

399
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:46,760
owner right there you know he was

400
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:47,569
growing for us right still that's

401
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,058
incredible

402
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:54,528
Hillary that's incredible had the

403
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:55,788
opportunity yeah the bottom line is you

404
00:18:54,528 --> 00:18:57,798
would have done it a hundred more times

405
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:58,778
had you had the opportunity there's no

406
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:01,460
question about that

407
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:07,159
most about my privilege and that I know

408
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:09,528
that I always felt like the police work

409
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:12,590
for me and then I'm protected and so

410
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:14,569
like I knew in that moment also the

411
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:17,209
courage to run in there and open that

412
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:20,329
door was a part of me exercising

413
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,829
privilege and it's too consistent

414
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:23,720
vigilance to take care of your

415
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:25,879
caregivers and those that provide for

416
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,360
you because life is unpredictable all

417
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,789
the time it's a constant for parents and

418
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,490
getting them counseled and everything

419
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:37,640
that you can to get them back on track

420
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:39,230
you know it's it's yeah it's part of

421
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,278
that eternal vigilance reality that we

422
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:45,110
deal with absolutely well it's good to

423
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:48,648
have both Wade and forest in the house

424
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:49,538
as well there's I guess Wade our forest

425
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:51,748
you guys have been doing

426
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:54,339
good fight as well but not necessarily

427
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:55,868
that 20 year ago fight where they're

428
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:58,028
putting guns to your head but at the

429
00:19:55,868 --> 00:20:01,928
same time it must feel a lot like having

430
00:19:58,028 --> 00:20:04,048
a gun put to your head yeah I definitely

431
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:07,320
have told Bao this several times

432
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:10,028
grateful for the the path that was paved

433
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:13,358
we could kind of enjoy the awareness

434
00:20:10,028 --> 00:20:15,729
that we have now but but yeah there you

435
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:17,710
know there's different ways to put guns

436
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:19,210
to people's heads and you know I know

437
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,669
something that we're all struggling with

438
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:24,579
right now is it's not necessarily the

439
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:27,159
immediate law enforcement well that's

440
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:30,028
not true the law enforcement risk is is

441
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,669
coming kind of rapidly on us here as

442
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:38,048
collectives or ended in a few weeks here

443
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:40,149
in California but but you know the I've

444
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:43,148
been obviously not able to attend as

445
00:20:40,148 --> 00:20:45,638
much because a hundred percent of the

446
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:48,689
focus has just been on preparing for in

447
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:52,269
helping families emotionally prepare for

448
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:54,700
a lot of these programs in ours

449
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:57,190
especially the one that you know I'm

450
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,720
obviously working with directly ending

451
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,989
here pretty soon so you know we have

452
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,118
these kids with terminal illness and no

453
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:05,679
plan and and laws that are gonna in the

454
00:21:04,118 --> 00:21:10,949
programs that are helping them and I

455
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,950
talk to a lot of parents in panic mode

456
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:25,769
he froze he'll be back panic mode is and

457
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:28,090
I can't even really imagine you know

458
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:29,589
forest comes from a unique place we're

459
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:30,939
all compassionate we all want to help

460
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:34,269
people it's I know

461
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:37,629
Valerie's journey started with her

462
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:39,368
accidents and her head injury and it's

463
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:41,348
just how how can it get any more

464
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:45,908
personal when it's when it's your family

465
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:49,028
member when it's your child it just

466
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:51,669
seemed so so wrong on so many different

467
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:53,979
levels that they just have to make that

468
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:56,619
right I mean people are obviously you

469
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:58,509
know getting people out of their records

470
00:21:56,618 --> 00:22:00,848
and out of jail time and and that's

471
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:02,370
hugely important but I think first and

472
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:03,899
foremost is

473
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:06,379
you know the palliative people the

474
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,150
terminal people the children with this

475
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,549
extremely low quality of life due to the

476
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,190
sufferings of their elements and

477
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:16,528
diseases that just kind of just needs to

478
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,028
be put right at the top of the shelf you

479
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:20,819
know people with palliative care

480
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:21,750
increasing and increasing the quality of

481
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:29,418
life for people

482
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:29,419
go ahead Forrest you're back buddy

483
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:36,089
now we got two forests I don't know what

484
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:39,288
happened there

485
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:41,639
figures finally say something and then

486
00:22:39,288 --> 00:22:44,220
living in the mountains is such a joy

487
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:55,190
you know now we can see the forest from

488
00:22:44,220 --> 00:23:02,100
the trees you were just at panic mode oh

489
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:03,630
yeah you know we're not sure if those

490
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:06,599
days are coming again you know I've had

491
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:09,179
my sons Gardens raided just a few years

492
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:11,038
ago I happen to not be on the ground so

493
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,860
you know I didn't have guns at my head

494
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:17,038
but here we are now again looking at

495
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:19,199
breaking the law or not treating our

496
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,720
kids and the patients that we're working

497
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,090
with so you know I go back and forth

498
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,808
sometimes I feel like we're we've made

499
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:29,730
all this progress and obviously we have

500
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:32,178
but at the same time we're looking at

501
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:36,210
being in the very real position again of

502
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:38,909
having no other option but to be outside

503
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:42,298
the legal market and with that comes law

504
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:45,270
enforcement so there's a lot of work to

505
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:48,389
be done still non-stop civil

506
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:50,720
disobedience so I would say to you this

507
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:55,320
is this is the interesting thing

508
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:58,919
how legalization in America has created

509
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:01,079
less access for those who I mean those

510
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,730
who really need it I you know what is

511
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:05,069
one suffering over the other well but

512
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,329
let's just let's just presume that the

513
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:09,048
people who are the sickest and the

514
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:11,849
poorest and the have the least access

515
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:14,819
have a greater need because they cannot

516
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:16,019
access cannabis and then the

517
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:18,629
polarization

518
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:21,930
between that need and the service that's

519
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:27,900
provided and the new front of service

520
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:32,000
the month's Santa fide Jeffrey guys GW

521
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:36,330
pharmaceutical cannabis and how that

522
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,119
creates lack of service until they move

523
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:44,669
in to sell it to all of America etc etc

524
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:46,829
the world so by denying I think and you

525
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:49,320
know my conspiratorial well I mean you

526
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:52,079
know as Bob Wilson needs to say consider

527
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:55,619
yourself on a group of your closest

528
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:59,699
friends a conspiracy conspirators and I

529
00:24:55,619 --> 00:25:03,419
hope so because we it's our turn to

530
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:07,650
conspire against and has been for

531
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:12,420
generations to conspire against the the

532
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:15,630
critical force of the of the corporate

533
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:19,470
state and that structure it is not to

534
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:22,020
allow you know it's very Jeff Bezos his

535
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:25,170
name it means kisses but that's kind of

536
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:28,889
the kiss of death it's the the way that

537
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:31,800
you crashed your competition so that you

538
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:35,490
are the sole server that you are the

539
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:39,269
sole proprietor and as you own

540
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:44,480
everything you control it what what I

541
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:47,129
see is as so phenomenally quickly

542
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,259
difficult and and painful as the

543
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,870
creation of the suffering that has

544
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:54,509
happened in this in America or in

545
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:56,459
California's and in the states where

546
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:58,619
cannabis is legal where we are not

547
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,019
allowed to serve and that will become

548
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:01,979
more and more I mean there are many

549
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:05,369
different ways of thoughts being

550
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:08,309
achieved or we're being denied but that

551
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:11,579
is becoming more and more prevalent and

552
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:15,019
more obvious so unless you have a great

553
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:19,259
deal of money you can put create your

554
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:21,299
got gain your licenses pay the hundreds

555
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:23,029
of thousands of dollars hundred thousand

556
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:26,029
dollars or more to remodel create this

557
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:26,029
guarded

558
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:37,000
at entry or access to your your business

559
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:40,960
and and then put in place all of those

560
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,410
pieces to serve people a plant let me

561
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,019
just say that again a plant you know

562
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:49,540
then you one is not able to continue to

563
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:51,700
do that provide that service so who are

564
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:53,500
our competitors are true competitors the

565
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,110
problem in my opinion is that we think

566
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,660
it's it's each other and it's not if

567
00:26:56,109 --> 00:27:08,649
there were you know a national and

568
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:16,210
international group of a group you know

569
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:19,210
am our own sort of Union CFL CIO or

570
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:21,430
something there's a cannabis Union where

571
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:25,450
we worked together and the really the

572
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:28,870
greater sense of promoting the small

573
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:30,940
business and at with service at our core

574
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:33,479
in our Center we wouldn't be in the

575
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,580
position that's really a tidal wave of

576
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,130
ownership and and corporate

577
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:41,470
entrepreneurship and some people will

578
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:46,150
make money yeah that's that will happen

579
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:49,600
that's certain but however more people

580
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:51,130
will be pushed aside and be work you

581
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:52,959
know go back to the coal mine kind of

582
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,970
consciousness that's probably dramatic

583
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,559
but I mean to be dramatic right now I

584
00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:03,339
think that that's a very huge issue and

585
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:05,589
you know California's had 25 26 years to

586
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:07,389
do good and we didn't we made a mess of

587
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:12,939
it we could have created such a

588
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:17,530
remarkable force with self-governance

589
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:19,630
and and the the highest standards and

590
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,519
you know we mucked it up through

591
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:24,100
competitiveness being competitive with

592
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:27,220
one another and you know trying to be

593
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:29,709
the fastest draw and have the best and

594
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:33,150
that's really an aside because the best

595
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:36,160
is just such a temporal place to sit and

596
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:38,590
everyone's forgotten at you know like

597
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,490
who cares like a thousand years who

598
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:41,589
cares

599
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,710
I mean what can we do now who we serve

600
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:47,678
now who do you serve it's just a really

601
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:50,470
this is and look to look at forest and

602
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,500
khalad rias and the to think of that the

603
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:56,860
impact you know now at now we have to

604
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,740
step forward make sure that forest can

605
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:02,609
be the liaison that he is to service to

606
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:06,670
care to saving lives and be there for

607
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:09,609
for him lest it be me lest it be you how

608
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:12,610
soon because you know it is America is a

609
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:15,819
bad dog but it isn't only America that's

610
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:17,289
the bad dog you know it's it's it's the

611
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:19,689
corporate state which knows no

612
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:23,019
boundaries and has no vote and never

613
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:28,720
dies and never goes to jail um you know

614
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:31,750
that's so bad dog anywhere yeah bad dog

615
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:35,620
indeed it's you know it's too bad Kirk

616
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,179
left I saw him recently on a I guess it

617
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:38,500
was just kind of like an I don't know

618
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:39,970
what it was called he was on there with

619
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,150
Bill Blair it was a cannabis

620
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:44,740
conversation Bill Blair being our you

621
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:49,480
know the main guy that was put in charge

622
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:51,579
of cannabis legalization or cannabis you

623
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,099
know the you know how things were gonna

624
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:56,558
roll out in Canada for cannabis and so

625
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:59,678
this you know this gentleman that spent

626
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:02,230
his entire life enforcing cannabis laws

627
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:06,160
and you know has probably never in his

628
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:08,890
life used cannabis is now in charge of

629
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,960
you know the regulations to put in place

630
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,630
to control everyone in regards to this

631
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,840
and you know Curt was just so like

632
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:18,520
perfect in every I'll put the link up in

633
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:19,959
the comments of this hash Church when

634
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:22,750
it's done so you guys can watch it

635
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:26,079
because he just you know it's scary to

636
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:29,230
see the delusions of people in regards

637
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:30,879
to cannabis and the way the news stories

638
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,980
go out of their way oh let's find this

639
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,990
girl she says she's addicted to cannabis

640
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,370
and we'll make we'll make cannabis look

641
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,620
really scary and then we'll bring this

642
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:40,659
guy on and he can talk about impaired

643
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:43,000
cannabis drivers because that's really

644
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,860
scary too and oh then we'll talk about

645
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,720
edibles because how frightening is that

646
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:50,500
that children could access edibles and

647
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,220
each and every time Kirk just so

648
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:57,450
beautifully and so articulated just

649
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:59,519
destroyed any semblance of sanity in

650
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,788
their discussion they just came across

651
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,259
looking not really all together about it

652
00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:06,690
and it was it's one of the reasons I

653
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:07,558
invited Kurt in today but he has many

654
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,900
children

655
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,700
he's I know he's very busy I said he's

656
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,038
gonna be back in 45 minutes he's taking

657
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:17,548
one of his kids to school ah yes of

658
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:19,859
course a school event of some kind well

659
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:21,389
in that conversation I mean I have had

660
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:24,479
the privilege and honour of presenting

661
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:26,880
with Kirk you know the Senate and here

662
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,089
and there and I never liked going before

663
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,120
him because he's like I'm always like

664
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:36,538
you please like take it home he's so

665
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:39,329
approachable and in that one particular

666
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:41,819
conversation with Bill Blair so he has

667
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:43,918
four kids I tease him sometimes he has

668
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:46,288
like 16 children but it's actually only

669
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,240
four which is quite a lot but in that

670
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:52,288
conversation with Bill the thing that he

671
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,900
very diplomatically pragmatically took

672
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:57,029
him to task on is one of the many things

673
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:59,788
and our legalization regulations that

674
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:02,819
have to be fixed is that it's still a

675
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:05,908
criminal offense for anybody to traffic

676
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:08,399
to a minor so that means that it's a

677
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:11,190
criminal offense for a parent to give

678
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:14,070
somebody under the age of 18 cannabis

679
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:16,019
and the consequences are quite high like

680
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:18,269
I can't remember exactly what the fines

681
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:21,089
and the how many years in jail are Kirk

682
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:24,389
can tell us when he comes back but Kirk

683
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:26,908
really talks about in such a relatable

684
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:29,549
way about a parent's right to model

685
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:33,210
responsible use and that if a parent

686
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:35,038
wants to share a glass of wine with

687
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:37,230
their teenager at home and show them how

688
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:40,048
to you know use can't be used wine in a

689
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:42,509
safe way that that's absolutely you know

690
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:45,029
their right to do that and he's

691
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:46,710
encouraging parents to do it that that's

692
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:49,019
actually the best way for us to show our

693
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,579
youth how to use cannabis responsibly

694
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:55,129
that was my favorite part of his

695
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:57,418
conversation with Blair it's 14 years

696
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:00,120
trafficking cannabis to someone under 18

697
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:02,490
years old that's a maximum fine and it's

698
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:04,389
scary and it sounds insane but keep in

699
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:08,920
mind when I was arrested with

700
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:13,270
compassion Club in 1998 well I I was

701
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:15,190
facing 25 years in prison that's what

702
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:17,799
that's what the fine on the books in

703
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:22,330
Canada was it was anything over three

704
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:26,919
kilos was a maximum fine of 25 years in

705
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:28,569
prison which is pretty insane when you

706
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,000
think about that that's on our books now

707
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:32,919
I doubt anyone's ever been given it but

708
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,460
at that point why not just get it off

709
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,580
the books

710
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,319
well the thing about the youth the wings

711
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:41,679
that we've set it up with youth because

712
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:44,139
our legalization is kind of like it's

713
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,880
like we're we're leading with legalized

714
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,980
cannabis with a prohibitionist mentality

715
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,050
right like the way that we had to feed

716
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,490
the whole ization to the prohibitionists

717
00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:53,500
and power was this is how we're gonna

718
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:55,000
reduce the harms of cannabis rather than

719
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,529
we're really sorry that we lied to you

720
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,529
for a hundred years and this is actually

721
00:33:56,529 --> 00:34:01,629
based in like racism and capitalism but

722
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:04,240
so the whole protects the youth piece if

723
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:07,660
you're a 19 year old and you pass a

724
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,820
joint to an 18 year old that whole body

725
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,470
of criminal law applies to you in terms

726
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,539
of that offense and the scary thing

727
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:15,398
about those kinds of regulations is that

728
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:17,710
we can say you know like they're

729
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:19,690
probably and again let's let's jump back

730
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,179
to this when Kirk is back this is kind

731
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:25,720
of like so much his wheelhouse but they

732
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:28,300
we can assume based on how prohibition

733
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:30,609
has been applied that those laws will be

734
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:34,210
exercised in a disproportionate way the

735
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:36,399
if you are poor or if you do not have

736
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:39,130
white skin you're gonna be more likely

737
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:42,309
to receive those kinds of charges than

738
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:44,320
if you have money our white and our

739
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:48,849
Sharon joint with your kid in your nice

740
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,890
house so I think this is this is where

741
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:54,059
we overlap I mean they're not exactly

742
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:58,389
the same laws we can serve children

743
00:34:54,059 --> 00:35:02,710
primarily I I believe here because so

744
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:04,480
many of our initial patients and the

745
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,780
people that we served were youth

746
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,519
underage and parents were stepping in

747
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,340
many of them lost their children CPS

748
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:15,820
took them this has been a fear I know of

749
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,590
a forest I mean how can you be in the

750
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,570
position

751
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:22,620
there's nothing more important for a

752
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:27,780
parent than to protect your child it's

753
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:31,769
just profound importance so you and

754
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:33,960
again does what you have to do go go

755
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:35,369
ahead I want to I'd rather not speak for

756
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,190
you but I wanted to dovetail on

757
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:39,630
something that I think we both face and

758
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,579
know that we have to deal with here this

759
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:45,180
is where we this is again where you

760
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:47,969
become becomes grassroots work and you

761
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:54,719
go back into the trenches of that go

762
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:57,119
ahead jump in I mean we you know last

763
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:08,639
year I did a panel at the Emerald cup

764
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:11,789
about cannabis people you know there's

765
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,799
not a lot of people who can really

766
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:15,900
advocate for the children on the other

767
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,840
side that that aren't immediately

768
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:21,389
discredited right so they they are

769
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:24,630
absolutely valid voices but but they're

770
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:26,219
the prohibitionist side is always saying

771
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,480
well they have an agenda right they have

772
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:29,909
this business they have that so they

773
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,740
discount them one of the the privileges

774
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:33,750
of my situation is I've always been in

775
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:36,359
this position of just being a parent all

776
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,190
right I don't own any other business the

777
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:42,450
charity that we have doesn't make any

778
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:44,460
money there's no financial gain there so

779
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:47,609
though it was always it able to be used

780
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:51,860
in that position and you know Hillary is

781
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:55,890
absolutely right we always see this this

782
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:57,300
under under appreciation for the risk of

783
00:36:55,889 --> 00:36:59,219
pharmaceutical medication they

784
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,620
exaggerate how well those things work

785
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:03,359
and then they exaggerate the harms of

786
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:06,000
cannabis you know so they're constantly

787
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,160
talking about emergency room visits and

788
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,840
the uptick in emergency room visits now

789
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,429
the edibles are allowed but they never

790
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,440
really go past that right they don't

791
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:15,929
ever say once they're in the emergency

792
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,760
room they just kind of give them some

793
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:19,500
fluids and tell them to hang out for a

794
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,600
little bit and they're gonna be fine

795
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,929
right there's there's no demonstrated

796
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,159
harm there and when they talk about

797
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:27,980
pharmaceutical medication and and risks

798
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,629
and children they never talk about

799
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,190
absolutely how dangerous the

800
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,840
pharmaceutical meds that are being given

801
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:36,329
the kids are especially in comparison

802
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,180
with cannabinoid therapy so they don't

803
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:41,880
talk about what it's like to give

804
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:44,789
phenobarbital to a 11 month old child

805
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,860
they don't talk about the intestinal

806
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:49,500
damage that is caused by that the

807
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:51,660
addiction rates and children they don't

808
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,090
talk about any of the the things that

809
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:56,399
that happen every day with with these

810
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:59,910
medications they are not working they're

811
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,800
also not beneficial for them so it's

812
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:04,379
just I think again where I've always

813
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,570
been it's just education and when when

814
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,530
you have kind of compiled some of the

815
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:12,860
statistics and numbers for what we treat

816
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:15,840
suffering in adults and children versus

817
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,980
you know the efficacy rates of medicine

818
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,650
versus their side effects

819
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,260
you really can't ethically ever say that

820
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:27,150
cannabis should never not be the first

821
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:29,160
option if the thought behind medicine is

822
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,170
is first do no harm and that's that's

823
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:35,009
the the motto our doctors are going to

824
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:37,320
take then the highest chance of efficacy

825
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:40,430
with the least chance of negative side

826
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,380
effects literally none in most cases

827
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:45,389
there's going to be you know cannabinoid

828
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,630
therapies of some type and it is

829
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:52,859
everything on the news is you know every

830
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:54,750
cannabis sort of story that's done is

831
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:57,360
always like with a wink wink nod nod

832
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:00,900
oh it's 4:20 a.m. everyone's coming out

833
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:03,930
to a party and you know it's um to this

834
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:06,599
day you know despite my efforts and a

835
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:10,019
lot of others cannabis is still reported

836
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:13,589
as is kind of a joke and and it's just a

837
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:16,259
party tool when it's so much more than

838
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:19,440
that and in the lack of reporting on how

839
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:22,890
serious of a topic some of the aspects

840
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,130
of cannabis are are the reason we can be

841
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:28,409
banning you know medical access for

842
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,640
hundreds of thousands of patients here

843
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:32,369
in California we're the largest

844
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:35,309
economies in the world here in two weeks

845
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:39,859
and no one's talking about it there's

846
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:42,349
not a new story there's not an uproar

847
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:45,620
there's nothing well people like I'm

848
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:47,179
sure Valery and myself I get 10 to 15

849
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:50,119
phone calls a day

850
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:52,000
from families crying panicking children

851
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:53,980
that we've pulled out a hospice because

852
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,929
nothing was working

853
00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:01,820
wondering what they're going to do as

854
00:39:56,929 --> 00:40:02,869
these charities are shut down and it's

855
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,610
it's not even an issue

856
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:07,309
it's just cannabis is legal everything's

857
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:10,940
great for 20s here everybody and in

858
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:12,829
let's high-five and enjoy it really is a

859
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:16,369
shame well here's a thought on that

860
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:20,029
forest how about when our own community

861
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:22,579
is more obsessed with getting awards for

862
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:24,860
their own works and spend countless

863
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:26,869
amounts of money on these events for

864
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:29,269
booths and for tickets and to win a

865
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:30,710
prize and to be to be basically like

866
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:32,389
patting themselves on the back and then

867
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,949
putting that in all of their instagrams

868
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:36,409
and their Facebook posts and telling

869
00:40:33,949 --> 00:40:38,779
everyone how much they won when there's

870
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:40,489
groups like yours that are the front

871
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:43,130
line of this because here's the thing

872
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:45,199
they'll put the gun to a lot of people's

873
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:47,420
heads but I've yet to see them do it to

874
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:49,759
the children the children I said a few

875
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,980
years back it's like the last leg that

876
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,480
prohibition has to stand on they've kind

877
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,599
of gone around you but you guys can

878
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:59,119
never forget that you guys have a power

879
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:01,190
that no one else in the community has

880
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,190
and I think it's why I've always been

881
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:06,440
sort of attracted to what you're doing

882
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:09,139
and to what Hilary was doing and valerie

883
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,240
and a TA and just always kind of wanting

884
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:13,339
to support that in any way shape or form

885
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:15,619
I told you just the other day for us

886
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,329
that what you got us to do is my

887
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:19,880
favorite part of the cannabis community

888
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:22,759
it's the soul of the cannabis community

889
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,590
and I just think that when when there's

890
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,480
a big event like the Emerald cup coming

891
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:28,880
up I think every single one of those

892
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,059
companies and more should be donating to

893
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,160
groups like yours well what's happened

894
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:36,199
with legalization is it's created an

895
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:39,440
illusion of service and that's the same

896
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:40,819
problem there you can you can get what

897
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,360
you need or get you can get what you

898
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:46,190
want and in fact that is not true some

899
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,660
people can get what they need and some

900
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:51,380
people can get what they want

901
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:52,639
and there has been a dismissiveness if

902
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,660
from men

903
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:58,489
the dispensaries of of medical well we

904
00:41:56,659 --> 00:42:02,088
don't really deal with medical anymore

905
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:02,868
Oh Medical is another type of service go

906
00:42:02,088 --> 00:42:04,699
somewhere else

907
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:06,048
maybe maybe they don't say that's not

908
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:08,598
good for business to say don't go

909
00:42:06,048 --> 00:42:11,778
somewhere else but the but that illusion

910
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:13,700
of service has created that I mean one

911
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:16,059
of the ways that to get parents you've

912
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:18,288
never tried cannabis or who are

913
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:19,490
concerned or even if they have tried

914
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:22,069
cannabis are concerned about getting

915
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:24,018
their kids stone is to ask them and I

916
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:27,018
probably forest is done this to us just

917
00:42:24,018 --> 00:42:28,699
to say look take one half of one dose of

918
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:32,389
the medication that you give your child

919
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:35,750
every day just one half of one dose and

920
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:38,719
then tell me how you feel and then then

921
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:41,599
it changes the perspective but that

922
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,719
still doesn't answer the question and

923
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:47,720
the the the difficulties that we face

924
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:49,879
today in serving those in the greatest

925
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:52,189
need two hundred nearly two hundred and

926
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,838
fifty thousand Californians became

927
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,429
medically bankrupt three people per

928
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:58,068
household that's on you know

929
00:42:55,429 --> 00:43:00,679
three-quarters of a million people when

930
00:42:58,068 --> 00:43:04,579
you look at that those numbers and you

931
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:09,798
see the impact of our completely out of

932
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:13,400
balance system in America where the the

933
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:15,288
most important lay in the power that the

934
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,230
biggest corporations have and I mean

935
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:21,528
every every country and the quote

936
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:27,429
unquote for you free ish world faces

937
00:43:21,528 --> 00:43:33,469
those kinds of impacts and that type of

938
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:35,989
over oversight of a business it it does

939
00:43:33,469 --> 00:43:41,028
not allow for the the way that lives

940
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:43,008
profit or benefit from from access so I

941
00:43:41,028 --> 00:43:47,000
mean I always you know I feel like I've

942
00:43:43,009 --> 00:43:49,190
got the the market cornered because I I

943
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,380
serve the poor you know I don't not the

944
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:55,240
only one who does it but I don't have a

945
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:57,048
lot of competition to serve the poor so

946
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,699
that's what we're doing with our

947
00:43:57,048 --> 00:44:01,099
business I'm we've been closed for

948
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:03,710
almost a year at least you know work I

949
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:06,410
we can help but as an individual but you

950
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:08,869
cannot help as a business unless you

951
00:44:06,409 --> 00:44:10,519
I have met all these hoops and we have

952
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:13,548
not had a site for almost a year I

953
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:15,679
signed the lease a few days ago on a new

954
00:44:13,548 --> 00:44:17,989
site but we're taking what we're doing

955
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,788
the dispensary is only a small part of

956
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:23,209
it the rest is a community center in

957
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:25,309
which we're drawing people with

958
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:28,010
knowledge with information there's an MD

959
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:30,619
and NDA are you Vedic doctor an

960
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:33,260
herbalist people coming in who will be

961
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:35,329
coming in and taking having a part-time

962
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,460
residence there so that they can expand

963
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:39,829
their mission to serve because we know

964
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:43,088
that one thing does not heal right it's

965
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:46,579
many things that heal and it's our our

966
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:48,469
opportunity to provide as much access to

967
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:50,720
the different combinations of phyto

968
00:44:48,469 --> 00:44:52,159
therapies like I'm just a way I've moved

969
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,439
away from using the word medical

970
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,029
cannabis to fight out their therapeutic

971
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,450
applications or phyto therapies because

972
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:02,030
it is profoundly important that we look

973
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:05,538
at the bigger picture if for at least

974
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:08,000
lamb to survive and we won't if I can't

975
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:11,329
compete with dispensaries because it's

976
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,548
not selling cannabis that keeps us in a

977
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:19,579
marketplace it's the service that keeps

978
00:45:13,548 --> 00:45:22,099
us in a marketplace so now I look to to

979
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:25,869
the future being my hope is that over

980
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:30,349
time we turned Wham into a worker owned

981
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:33,400
cooperative because why well because

982
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:36,528
people when you have ownership you

983
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,349
produce the greatest quality the best

984
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:43,429
quality the highest integrity it's your

985
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:45,200
own business and you can do what and a

986
00:45:43,429 --> 00:45:48,379
group of many like we used to be the

987
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:55,519
group of many that we could stand up to

988
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:57,920
the power and now in business one has to

989
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:00,409
define oneself in a different way to

990
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,680
survive as a small business and you just

991
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:06,078
look look every day at Amazon and what's

992
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,690
happening and I and I you know bang and

993
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,670
bash Amazon because I hate his business

994
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,710
practices just Jeff Bezos has business

995
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:17,059
practices I think they're terrible but

996
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:18,769
in in any case to expand by bringing in

997
00:46:17,059 --> 00:46:20,370
the greatest minds and the greatest

998
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:23,679
people the greatest

999
00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:25,569
comrades and service one who has the

1000
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:29,409
opportunity to create a business that

1001
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:31,240
truly serves wellness and all kinds if

1002
00:46:29,409 --> 00:46:32,980
you're well stay well if you're sick get

1003
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:36,969
well if you're dying die well so that

1004
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:41,019
you we are at the bedside and in the gym

1005
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:43,629
and in in the thought processes of

1006
00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:46,090
people as we attempt to heal ourselves

1007
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:49,059
and you know like kind of dorky but

1008
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:50,920
become masters right it's that's what

1009
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:52,869
everybody's trying to achieve the same

1010
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,460
thing whether we know it or not whether

1011
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:58,179
you want to make a billion dollars or

1012
00:46:54,460 --> 00:47:00,699
you you want to have a happy dinner with

1013
00:46:58,179 --> 00:47:02,500
your family there's still a sense deep

1014
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:05,319
with him that we are trying to touch and

1015
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:09,400
achieve so it's important I think as a

1016
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:13,059
small business person to give it back to

1017
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,619
the people in a way that has the

1018
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:16,059
greatest potential and maybe it will

1019
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:18,969
still be in business in a hundred years

1020
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:21,309
who knows right so I mean and I look to

1021
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:26,309
forest for some of that camaraderie

1022
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:29,829
because I see forest as in the same

1023
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:31,449
basket of as myself and many others too

1024
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:35,079
there are many people who I can learn

1025
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:37,719
from and have too much to bring so we've

1026
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:39,969
a really unique situation with just

1027
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:41,379
working with Pediatrics and you know

1028
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:45,699
that's why I think everything comes down

1029
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:47,740
to you know education and educating the

1030
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:48,460
cannabis community in Marcus you're

1031
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:52,329
exactly right

1032
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:54,760
thank you that you know I have uh I've

1033
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:57,909
gotten a lot of flack over the years

1034
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:00,220
because I really had to feel like it was

1035
00:47:57,909 --> 00:48:02,579
important to address the cannabis

1036
00:48:00,219 --> 00:48:06,039
community as much as it was to address

1037
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:08,519
the prohibitionist community because you

1038
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:10,539
know both were doing things that

1039
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:15,699
intentionally or unintentionally we're

1040
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:17,019
putting kids and inpatients at risk and

1041
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:19,389
we don't have to get into that too much

1042
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:21,610
but but it has to do with you know the

1043
00:48:19,389 --> 00:48:23,949
exploitation of the word medicine how

1044
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:26,050
it's been loosely applied to anything

1045
00:48:23,949 --> 00:48:28,679
that has to do with cannabis and kind of

1046
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:31,480
devalued some of the to the point where

1047
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:33,509
that you know medicine has looked at

1048
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,219
medicine or cannabis is

1049
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:36,989
that large communities is a big joke and

1050
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:40,229
it's a wink wink nod nod yeah you got a

1051
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:42,409
backache let's get medicated and just

1052
00:48:40,228 --> 00:48:45,208
you know trying to get them to use terms

1053
00:48:42,409 --> 00:48:47,099
appropriately and that can send them a

1054
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:49,588
big debate of what is medicine and how

1055
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:51,359
many medicinal use is used but it's not

1056
00:48:49,588 --> 00:48:53,188
about that it's not about saying one use

1057
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:55,078
is and isn't medical it's just about

1058
00:48:53,188 --> 00:48:57,239
making sure we're giving the top of the

1059
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:00,059
respect that it deserves so that we're

1060
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:01,409
not inadvertently devaluing some of its

1061
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:03,179
applications to the point where the

1062
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:05,369
greater community doesn't think that

1063
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:08,880
it's real anymore

1064
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:12,389
and in working with with Pediatrics you

1065
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:14,969
know we see that you know Valerie made a

1066
00:49:12,389 --> 00:49:17,099
very good point that that there is this

1067
00:49:14,969 --> 00:49:18,929
we're always fighting this solution that

1068
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:21,479
everything's fine now canvas is

1069
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:23,398
legalized in in in a lot of the United

1070
00:49:21,478 --> 00:49:24,898
States so everything's fine now oh now

1071
00:49:23,398 --> 00:49:26,429
there's dispensaries and Medical

1072
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:29,278
dispensaries so medical patients are

1073
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:31,519
taken care of but what we see may be

1074
00:49:29,278 --> 00:49:34,528
more than other communities in

1075
00:49:31,518 --> 00:49:37,879
Pediatrics is really how far away we are

1076
00:49:34,528 --> 00:49:40,438
from being able to deal with serious

1077
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:43,709
catastrophic neurological condition so

1078
00:49:40,438 --> 00:49:47,458
and I'll give a couple examples we have

1079
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:50,158
that we're serving ongoing 150 to 200

1080
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:52,438
families we do consultation and periodic

1081
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:57,209
help for for over a thousand families I

1082
00:49:52,438 --> 00:50:00,989
would say 1% of those families could

1083
00:49:57,208 --> 00:50:03,989
find and be ok with finding a CBD or

1084
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:06,478
tincture type product in dispensaries

1085
00:50:03,989 --> 00:50:08,369
the rest of them what they take is not

1086
00:50:06,478 --> 00:50:10,498
available for a couple reasons one

1087
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:12,809
there's there's dosage concentration

1088
00:50:10,498 --> 00:50:14,188
limits and this is a problem in Canada

1089
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:16,769
as well because I get calls from

1090
00:50:14,188 --> 00:50:19,288
families there the problem is all of the

1091
00:50:16,768 --> 00:50:22,108
community parents and canvas community

1092
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:23,309
alike is for the most part not up to

1093
00:50:22,108 --> 00:50:26,088
date so they don't even know that

1094
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:26,089
there's a problem

1095
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:34,750
a skein so we had the epidural X trials

1096
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,279
that were released last year again

1097
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,679
that's another problem where people say

1098
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:41,260
well epidural X is out it's a CVD it's

1099
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:42,669
gonna be available by prescription kids

1100
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:45,490
are fine now people are fine with

1101
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:48,369
epilepsy which which is not the case a

1102
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:52,479
lot of people the majority of them don't

1103
00:50:48,369 --> 00:51:01,150
respond to purified CBD but with those

1104
00:50:52,480 --> 00:51:05,190
studies they were dosing a lot of worth

1105
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:07,809
- 15 milligrams per kilogram so we have

1106
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:09,670
nine-year-old ten-year-old kids you know

1107
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:12,338
weighing a hundred pounds coming to us

1108
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:15,190
with anywhere from 15 to 20 to 25

1109
00:51:12,338 --> 00:51:17,049
milligrams per pound and dosage

1110
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:21,039
recommendations sometimes from their

1111
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:22,720
doctors so when you get those sort of

1112
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:25,570
recommendations and they titrate up to

1113
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:27,608
them they find efficacy there you can't

1114
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:30,700
get that sort of dosage in any

1115
00:51:27,608 --> 00:51:32,139
dispensary in California and then I

1116
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:34,659
would argue probably in the United

1117
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:38,679
States because of dosing restrictions

1118
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:42,578
right if you are needing a 1500 to 2000

1119
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:44,889
milligrams per day dose those things

1120
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:46,450
aren't readily available because of the

1121
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:49,838
way we've structured everything so

1122
00:51:46,449 --> 00:51:51,818
there's this constant pushback against

1123
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:54,578
you know everybody's taken care of and

1124
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:56,650
everything's fine now because it's just

1125
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:59,470
not the case and and that's if you're

1126
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:02,559
lucky enough to respond to CBD and my

1127
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:04,719
son doesn't I would say 98% of the kids

1128
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,909
that we work with don't respond to just

1129
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:10,209
CBD again there's a difference between

1130
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:11,828
like 30 percent efficacy and where we

1131
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,349
want to get into the 80 and 90

1132
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:16,030
percentile efficacy right so if you see

1133
00:52:14,349 --> 00:52:17,859
some benefit that doesn't mean that

1134
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:19,720
that's the right medicine for you it is

1135
00:52:17,858 --> 00:52:22,568
beneficial but there is there are

1136
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:25,029
greater sets of relief out there with

1137
00:52:22,568 --> 00:52:28,269
work and as you get kids on specialized

1138
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:30,670
ratios whether it's a two to one or a

1139
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:32,170
ten to one and different balances but

1140
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:35,769
then you get into needing specific

1141
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:37,838
terpene profiles as well as other

1142
00:52:35,769 --> 00:52:40,088
aspects where I did you did some of the

1143
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:41,869
kids that we work with respond to the

1144
00:52:40,088 --> 00:52:43,969
specific acidic tinnitus it

1145
00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:45,889
Canaveral in ratios right we're learning

1146
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:47,299
that there's a synergistic effect we

1147
00:52:45,889 --> 00:52:49,549
have all these different ways that we

1148
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,769
can change how they interact with that

1149
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:54,620
one unique brain and right now on the

1150
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:57,530
shelves we have CBD maybe a one-to-one

1151
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:59,269
oil at such a low concentration and it's

1152
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:02,690
not really beneficial for therapeutic

1153
00:52:59,269 --> 00:53:05,170
use so we're we're really far away from

1154
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:08,599
being anywhere near being able to serve

1155
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:09,800
the community that I'm working with it

1156
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:12,829
there's really a lack of understanding

1157
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:17,180
there and I think that as we can help

1158
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:20,809
people recognize where the holes are and

1159
00:53:17,179 --> 00:53:23,419
why then we can start to address those

1160
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:25,639
things but right now you know every it's

1161
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,170
it's really hard to get any traction and

1162
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:30,079
that everyone's struggling to survive

1163
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:34,070
themselves or they're excited about

1164
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:36,409
other aspects of cannabis this one is

1165
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:38,059
you know it's not as it's not as not a

1166
00:53:36,409 --> 00:53:40,789
lot of glory in it you know there's not

1167
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:43,219
a lot of money in it and it's it's very

1168
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:45,469
hard to get some traction but we know

1169
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:48,529
what Forest in my opinion that's why

1170
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:50,089
groups like you know my company and the

1171
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:52,670
company of many other people need to

1172
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:54,829
just sort of buckle down and kick down

1173
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:56,630
and support these these these places

1174
00:53:54,829 --> 00:53:58,610
because like I said it's the front lines

1175
00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:00,110
it's the it's the it's the group of

1176
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:02,360
people that will actually get through

1177
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:05,059
the prohibitionist you know Hillary said

1178
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,460
it earlier how you know people have just

1179
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:09,739
been so afraid of THC and now these

1180
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:12,260
regulations of having concentrates being

1181
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:15,289
limited and having edibles being limited

1182
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:17,300
it's just to me it's as simple as simple

1183
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:20,420
can be we need exactly the models that

1184
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:23,180
that yourself and Valerie and @j and

1185
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:26,269
Hillary have have done for years but on

1186
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:28,969
the flip side of it I still see it's not

1187
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:30,320
a I'm not on the fence or I guess I am

1188
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:31,969
on the fence I'm not on either side of

1189
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,750
the fence because here we have this huge

1190
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:37,489
division between licensed producers and

1191
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,690
dispensary owners and the dispensary

1192
00:54:37,489 --> 00:54:40,129
owners are like oh the licensed

1193
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:41,809
producers are you know they're taking

1194
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:43,700
all our business they're coming in we're

1195
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:45,529
not getting licensed it's this whole it

1196
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:47,929
almost probably would be what the the

1197
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:49,400
mom-and-pop dealers probably felt when

1198
00:54:47,929 --> 00:54:51,859
people started opening dispensaries

1199
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,329
because trust me like one dispensary

1200
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,340
shut down two or three hundred

1201
00:54:53,329 --> 00:54:57,289
mom-and-pop dealers

1202
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:59,240
like that overnight people that were

1203
00:54:57,289 --> 00:55:01,099
paying they're helping pay their rent

1204
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:02,209
and putting gas in their cars where they

1205
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:03,679
were cut out of that money because now

1206
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:05,539
people could go to these dispensaries

1207
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,549
and that's amazing but it's there's

1208
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:09,920
always sort of this negative aspect of

1209
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:11,750
it I would love to see everyone be able

1210
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,539
to play on an equal playing playing

1211
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:16,639
field and I'm not as opposed to a giant

1212
00:55:14,539 --> 00:55:18,289
company like canopy when I know they've

1213
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:20,119
got someone like Hillary in their ear

1214
00:55:18,289 --> 00:55:22,009
that they've got DNA that they've got

1215
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:23,569
Kurt and more importantly what they

1216
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:25,130
recently did which I'll let Hillary

1217
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,570
speak on because when you're a

1218
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:28,070
compassion Club when Hillary opened the

1219
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:30,860
compassion club and would never take a

1220
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:32,840
penny a profit a popper and came from

1221
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,660
West Vancouver which is like a nice

1222
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:37,370
neighborhood and lived in East Vancouver

1223
00:55:34,659 --> 00:55:39,199
which is like a harder neighbourhood to

1224
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:41,179
move to when you've been living your

1225
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:43,489
whole life in West Vancouver and lived

1226
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:44,839
on this level and refused to take

1227
00:55:43,489 --> 00:55:47,689
profits and when the club started

1228
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:50,930
selling a lot the profits went back into

1229
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:52,460
healers and people that could talk to

1230
00:55:50,929 --> 00:55:54,619
the different people who had different

1231
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:56,750
elements or mental issues mental health

1232
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:57,949
issues or they could get massages or

1233
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:00,469
they could get all these different

1234
00:55:57,949 --> 00:56:02,359
aspects of healing for free based on the

1235
00:56:00,469 --> 00:56:04,039
small profit that was created in them

1236
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:06,260
buying the medicine in the first place

1237
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:08,389
which is amazing that should never go

1238
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:10,760
away you're touching this this group of

1239
00:56:08,389 --> 00:56:12,799
people on the flip side of that you have

1240
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:16,910
a group like canopy just recently taking

1241
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:20,210
down 2.5 million dollars for for this

1242
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:22,369
opioid addiction and potential you know

1243
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:24,139
findings of cannabis being able to be

1244
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:26,269
helpful in that do you want to speak on

1245
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:27,920
that a little bit Hillary well yeah I

1246
00:56:26,269 --> 00:56:31,369
mean this kind of roots back to what Val

1247
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,530
was just talking about in terms of the

1248
00:56:31,369 --> 00:56:36,099
project that she is initiating or

1249
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:38,450
reinitiating again and some of my

1250
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:41,000
inspiration from Val really encouraged

1251
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:43,429
me though to build the wellness center

1252
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,500
at the compassion club so that Wellness

1253
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:46,969
Center I mean the compact the compassion

1254
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:49,670
Club in Vancouver was like the first

1255
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:52,189
serve out of the closet pot dealer in

1256
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:54,139
the country and the Wellness Center is

1257
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:56,210
the thing that was the spoonful of sugar

1258
00:56:54,139 --> 00:56:58,460
that helped the medicine go down I like

1259
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:00,829
to say and that Wellness Center gave us

1260
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:03,170
integrity with the police and the

1261
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:06,750
medical organizations and the city and

1262
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:09,030
even like last year I've still like rep

1263
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:11,219
passion Club when I go to like speak to

1264
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:12,630
the Senate we have the task force come

1265
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:14,339
through that we're doing all the

1266
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,930
recommendations about what legalization

1267
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:18,050
should look like so it's still doing

1268
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:21,149
sort of frontlines political work

1269
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:23,610
converting people to understanding like

1270
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:26,460
that cannabis is not just you know like

1271
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:29,309
a party drug or something that has the

1272
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,659
risks that need to be managed but we

1273
00:57:29,309 --> 00:57:32,400
hear you know you're sort of on a tear

1274
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:35,519
today mark about you know kicking down

1275
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:39,869
in donations and I mean my hope is that

1276
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:41,969
this industry will become the most

1277
00:57:39,869 --> 00:57:44,069
conscious the most generate the most

1278
00:57:41,969 --> 00:57:45,929
socially responsible industry in the

1279
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:48,809
world and I think that even if we're not

1280
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:52,079
doing it for altruistic reasons for even

1281
00:57:48,809 --> 00:57:54,779
if it's driven by economic incentive in

1282
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:57,239
terms of dissolving prohibition around

1283
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:59,640
the world the thing that dissolves the

1284
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:02,459
stigma that props up prohibition is

1285
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:05,539
generosity social responsibility doing

1286
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:09,360
meaningful work inside communities and

1287
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:13,019
sharing the profits and so I choose to

1288
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:15,030
work in the heart of the country and

1289
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:19,079
potentially world's biggest cannabis

1290
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:20,790
company in some ways it is the corporate

1291
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,829
machine it's a part of the like

1292
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:25,559
corporate machinery that val was talking

1293
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:27,989
about and for me I know that I have a

1294
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:30,269
really big responsibility to have a seat

1295
00:58:27,989 --> 00:58:33,239
at the table to use my power that I do

1296
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:36,630
have inside that company to drive really

1297
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:38,369
good work so I wish that Kirk was here

1298
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:40,950
for this party you would love to chime

1299
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:43,529
in I'm sure he'll be back soon but so

1300
00:58:40,949 --> 00:58:46,019
for me like when Canada we have this

1301
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:48,210
crazy opioid overdose epidemic and it's

1302
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:50,429
not just about people being addicted to

1303
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:52,889
their pharmaceuticals but the street

1304
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:55,349
opioids we have there the drug supply is

1305
00:58:52,889 --> 00:58:57,599
poisoned so it's fentanyl that's in the

1306
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:59,190
drug supply the people are like being

1307
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,480
killed in British Columbia faster I

1308
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:03,420
think we're losing four people a day

1309
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:06,420
five people a day now and it's not just

1310
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:08,400
the like it's not the community of

1311
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:12,360
people that you expect it to be that is

1312
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,610
the impoverished mental health sort of

1313
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,620
more visible on the streets I mean the

1314
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:18,690
fentanyl epidemic is touching people in

1315
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:20,219
all walks of life and one of those

1316
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:23,059
people that attached

1317
00:59:20,219 --> 00:59:26,549
here was my best friend's daughter so

1318
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:30,420
her name is Gemma and she died just over

1319
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:32,789
a year ago so I took some time off from

1320
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:35,130
work cuz that's what you do when your

1321
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:37,980
best friend's daughter died hang on I'm

1322
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:39,809
gonna tell this story without crying so

1323
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:41,250
when I went back to work I was gone for

1324
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:44,940
about two months when I went back to

1325
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:46,829
work my team at canopy said well what do

1326
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:50,940
you want to do like let's do something

1327
00:59:46,829 --> 00:59:52,829
and so I phoned up some amazing friends

1328
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,659
and colleagues of mine at the BC Center

1329
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:56,880
of substance use which is like a world's

1330
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:59,759
leading organization around research

1331
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,220
around substance use disorders and they

1332
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,599
helped me to put together a project

1333
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:07,889
because I wanted to do something that

1334
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:10,859
was going to have ongoing impact and so

1335
01:00:07,889 --> 01:00:12,389
we gifted two and a half million dollars

1336
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:15,779
to the University of British Columbia

1337
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:17,549
and the government in BC the Ministry of

1338
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:20,250
Mental Health and Addiction put in

1339
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:23,090
another half a million bucks so pretty

1340
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:25,739
cool to have government money weed money

1341
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:28,220
University coming together because this

1342
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:31,229
crisis really needs some like

1343
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:33,629
collaborative innovative leadership and

1344
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:35,309
money seriously needs money we just

1345
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:38,220
don't seem to care enough about people

1346
01:00:35,309 --> 01:00:40,079
who are using drugs dying and so what we

1347
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:42,689
did is we created an endowment so that

1348
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:44,429
endowment is like a money generating

1349
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:47,579
machine it's not it doesn't just get

1350
01:00:44,429 --> 01:00:51,299
spent it basically will support a

1351
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:53,549
professor and we created the Kent the

1352
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:56,400
canopy growth professorship of cannabis

1353
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:59,700
science and this incredible man MJ

1354
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:03,059
Malloy is going it isn't has now been

1355
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:04,829
announced as that professor and the his

1356
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:08,759
research the body of clinical evidence

1357
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:11,069
that is being supported is about the

1358
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:13,260
role of cannabis in the opioid overdose

1359
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:15,750
epidemic so the clinical trials are not

1360
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:18,210
about opioid sparing for pain patients

1361
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:20,460
how you tape or a pain patient off of

1362
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:21,690
their opioids on to cannabis this is

1363
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:24,329
about people who are addicted to

1364
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:26,550
fentanyl and addicted to heroin and part

1365
01:01:24,329 --> 01:01:28,588
some of the trials will it be about

1366
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:30,330
substitution and some of them will be

1367
01:01:28,588 --> 01:01:32,549
about helping adherence to other

1368
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:33,969
treatment programs because people who

1369
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:36,039
are addicted to fentanyl have a boat

1370
01:01:33,969 --> 01:01:38,739
twenty-something percent success rate of

1371
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:41,679
staying on their treatment programs so

1372
01:01:38,739 --> 01:01:44,769
my hope is that that clinical evidence

1373
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:47,079
it's not an it's not a it's not a quick

1374
01:01:44,769 --> 01:01:48,608
fix it's not like the people who are in

1375
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:50,500
the Downtown Eastside which is the

1376
01:01:48,608 --> 01:01:52,329
hardcore community the hardcore

1377
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,639
neighborhood where this at this epidemic

1378
01:01:52,329 --> 01:01:58,889
is happening who are doing cannabis

1379
01:01:54,639 --> 01:02:02,618
substitution projects this is about

1380
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:05,139
systemic solution because I want I have

1381
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:07,510
my hope is that that body of clinical

1382
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:09,789
evidence will help healthcare

1383
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:12,040
professionals around the world to know

1384
01:02:09,789 --> 01:02:14,019
that cannabis is one of the tools that

1385
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:16,119
they have when they're dealing with

1386
01:02:14,019 --> 01:02:19,119
somebody who has any kind of a substance

1387
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:22,240
use disorder be it alcohol or opioids or

1388
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:26,500
benzos or fentanyl or crack cocaine or

1389
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:30,118
anything and so we actually just

1390
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:33,909
announced MJ just a week ago and I am

1391
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:37,450
profoundly proud of my team a canopy for

1392
01:02:33,909 --> 01:02:39,879
ponying up that kind of dough and as we

1393
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:44,189
build out our global social

1394
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:47,829
responsibility strategy I hope and I I

1395
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:49,900
believe that will continue to lead with

1396
01:02:47,829 --> 01:02:51,639
these kinds of initiatives because I

1397
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:55,150
want every cannabis company in the world

1398
01:02:51,639 --> 01:02:58,230
whether you make hemp bomb lipsticks in

1399
01:02:55,150 --> 01:03:01,030
your kitchen or you're an epic like

1400
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:03,699
multi-million dollar international huge

1401
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:05,859
company for us to really be the most

1402
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:08,919
generous most amazing industry in the

1403
01:03:05,858 --> 01:03:11,289
world because it is true works of

1404
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:13,900
compassion like Val's work and forest

1405
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:17,019
work and my compassion clubs work that

1406
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:19,510
is breaking down prohibition around the

1407
01:03:17,019 --> 01:03:21,759
world and we all need to be like giving

1408
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:24,280
back in a really significant way we need

1409
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,599
not regret that was beautiful Hillary

1410
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,430
and you know what we need to realize

1411
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,320
that this division even within our own

1412
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:30,879
community you know when Hillary

1413
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,619
announced this there were literally

1414
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,750
person after person after person

1415
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:38,200
including well-known people in the

1416
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:41,199
industry attacking her for naming it

1417
01:03:38,199 --> 01:03:43,210
canopy growth like oh you had to put

1418
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:45,669
your name in it it's like dude they

1419
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:46,809
don't they donated 2.5 million dollars

1420
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:47,630
and they're setting up this whole

1421
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:49,489
amazing thing

1422
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:51,860
and you're gonna bash on them for like

1423
01:03:49,489 --> 01:03:53,599
putting their name in it like it just

1424
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:56,570
seems so petty like there's just these

1425
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:58,750
there's this this crazy division in

1426
01:03:56,570 --> 01:04:02,600
Canada especially between the sort of

1427
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:05,030
homegrown dispensary model and the LP

1428
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:08,000
yeah and and a lot of the LPS

1429
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:09,590
I'm sure there are LPS that have brutal

1430
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,250
people working for them where they're

1431
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:15,200
like ex sheriffs or ex police and I get

1432
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:16,880
you know people not having a good

1433
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:18,710
feeling about that but there are LPS

1434
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,390
that were like just black market growers

1435
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:22,519
that we're like I'm gonna start an LP

1436
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:26,779
cuz I just want to operate in a legal

1437
01:04:22,519 --> 01:04:28,639
mechanism and for me I'm not for LPS at

1438
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:31,670
the expense of dispensaries and home

1439
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:33,349
grows I am for all access across the

1440
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:35,360
board in any way that that looks like

1441
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:37,099
for you because while some people are

1442
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,930
very happy to touch the members of their

1443
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:41,150
community there are other people that

1444
01:04:38,929 --> 01:04:42,710
need to touch members of as many

1445
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:44,090
communities as they can they want to

1446
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:45,139
touch hundreds of thousands they want to

1447
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:47,240
touch Millions

1448
01:04:45,139 --> 01:04:49,489
and you can't really [ __ ] on them for

1449
01:04:47,239 --> 01:04:52,159
that as long as their model doesn't

1450
01:04:49,489 --> 01:04:54,169
drastically affect that small model of

1451
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:55,909
you know grassroots like grassroots can

1452
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:57,619
never go away but at the same time that

1453
01:04:55,909 --> 01:04:59,899
certainly doesn't stop the mighty oak

1454
01:04:57,619 --> 01:05:02,269
tree from growing up nice and tall does

1455
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:04,119
it you know I don't know if there's a

1456
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:07,159
way to get around the cannabis industry

1457
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:09,259
kind of being the savior for the

1458
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:10,909
suffering and sick and dying and I don't

1459
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:13,160
know why it would want to not take

1460
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:15,949
advantage of that you know a lot of the

1461
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:18,019
cannabis community is for years and in

1462
01:05:15,949 --> 01:05:21,259
Valerie spoke about this a little bit as

1463
01:05:18,019 --> 01:05:23,349
has been really outspoken against the

1464
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:26,840
pharmaceutical industry for a very

1465
01:05:23,349 --> 01:05:29,509
justifiable reason they very clearly

1466
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:31,910
articulated how much harm it was doing

1467
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:33,800
them how the monopolies damaged our

1468
01:05:31,909 --> 01:05:36,559
community how dangerous sharks were

1469
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:38,900
damaging how profits were put a head of

1470
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:41,360
patients lives and that's what something

1471
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:44,720
that's been talked about openly for

1472
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:47,599
decades but now there's this situation

1473
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:50,359
where as the not only the legitimacy of

1474
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:53,509
cannabis and cannabinoid therapies as a

1475
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:54,650
medicine is more widely accepted but

1476
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:56,690
we're seeing that it's even more

1477
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:59,260
powerful than we even knew it was five

1478
01:05:56,690 --> 01:06:03,000
six seven ten years ago

1479
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:05,350
we have that same option now now the

1480
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,190
medical cure for some of the most

1481
01:06:05,349 --> 01:06:11,500
horrific diseases imaginable is in our

1482
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:14,530
hands and immediately it's kinda like

1483
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:16,300
poof oh we just see dollar signs right

1484
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:17,800
that's human nature the pharmaceutical

1485
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:21,640
industry isn't a separate piece it's

1486
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:23,500
just controlled by humans and I think if

1487
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:26,529
we can get into the culture this

1488
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:28,630
opportunity of one yes if you're a good

1489
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:30,430
businessperson and responsible there's

1490
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:31,630
there's financial riches to be had out

1491
01:06:30,429 --> 01:06:34,029
there and there's nothing wrong with

1492
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:37,750
that I would like a little bit of that

1493
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:39,730
myself at some point but but at the same

1494
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:41,079
time there's when you're dealing with

1495
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:43,599
medicine and we're gonna we're gonna

1496
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:45,549
call this medicine and it is medicine

1497
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:47,289
then then there's some responsibility

1498
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:49,570
and opportunity that comes with it and

1499
01:06:47,289 --> 01:06:55,090
one of the examples they gave earlier

1500
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:57,130
was the price problems with CBD where

1501
01:06:55,090 --> 01:07:00,760
there's clinically shown therapeutic

1502
01:06:57,130 --> 01:07:02,680
efficacy versus what it's being what the

1503
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,440
cost is to get it into dispensary if you

1504
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:06,759
can find it in concentration so let me

1505
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,099
go back to that real quick just to

1506
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:14,100
highlight that if we have someone who's

1507
01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:17,349
taking 1,500 milligrams a day or or

1508
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:19,500
2,500 milligrams a day of CBD in our

1509
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:22,960
local dispensary that equals about 8

1510
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:25,480
bottles of the seat the only whole plant

1511
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,210
CBD oil that they have and those are

1512
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,530
about 80 bucks apiece right so you're

1513
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:31,990
talking about six hundred and forty or

1514
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:34,300
so dollars a day if my math is correct

1515
01:07:31,989 --> 01:07:36,519
that's if you can get them to drink

1516
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,740
eight bottles a day which you can't and

1517
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:41,380
this goes back to some of the problems

1518
01:07:38,739 --> 01:07:45,309
with the understanding of if there is

1519
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:48,070
access or not but those doses are never

1520
01:07:45,309 --> 01:07:50,469
gonna be sustainable I mean you have a

1521
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:52,269
business that has a cost and you know

1522
01:07:50,469 --> 01:07:54,369
people have to survive you can't just

1523
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:56,380
work for free we understand that and you

1524
01:07:54,369 --> 01:07:58,659
have a reality that is requiring

1525
01:07:56,380 --> 01:08:01,720
something that isn't so how do we solve

1526
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:04,649
that right and I think that really where

1527
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:06,789
Hillary hit it on the head it is that

1528
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:08,550
you know if we come together and

1529
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:10,440
structure the system in a way that

1530
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:12,329
subsidizes the

1531
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:14,490
seeds for some of the most critically

1532
01:08:12,329 --> 01:08:16,319
ill in our communities we have an

1533
01:08:14,489 --> 01:08:18,238
opportunity it doesn't have to be

1534
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:22,770
altruistic but to make a business model

1535
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:24,869
that gains public support sways public

1536
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:26,069
support brings in prohibitionists

1537
01:08:24,869 --> 01:08:27,809
because you can see the good that

1538
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:30,390
they're doing by working into that

1539
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:33,630
system and charity and benefit for

1540
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:36,298
people in their communities and that can

1541
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:38,670
be done if our legislators don't tax

1542
01:08:36,298 --> 01:08:40,588
cannabis owners to death right if

1543
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:43,829
everyone's not trying to squeeze every

1544
01:08:40,588 --> 01:08:45,630
penny from our legislators to to all the

1545
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:46,859
the distribution everywhere if

1546
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:49,170
everyone's trying to squeeze every penny

1547
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:51,810
along the supply chain well then there's

1548
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:54,180
going to be nothing left for those in

1549
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:56,730
need but if we subsidize it

1550
01:08:54,180 --> 01:09:01,859
appropriately so that cultivators can

1551
01:08:56,729 --> 01:09:05,548
can affordably have 1% or 5% of their

1552
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:07,079
cultivation go to charitable causes and

1553
01:09:05,548 --> 01:09:09,028
they're not just dying because they

1554
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:11,609
can't afford the taxes to even have a

1555
01:09:09,029 --> 01:09:14,219
single plant that isn't going back into

1556
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:15,930
the regulated market then we can start

1557
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:18,270
to produce cannabis and develop

1558
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:21,600
organizations that harness this market

1559
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:23,069
to meet those people's needs and then

1560
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,838
you know the argument a lot of people

1561
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:25,890
have is well then how everyone if we're

1562
01:09:24,838 --> 01:09:27,390
not going to be paying for it and

1563
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:29,520
everyone's gonna say their medical right

1564
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:31,079
that's another damage that sort of the

1565
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,969
medical system is done here in

1566
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:35,130
California at least the last 20 years if

1567
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:36,779
we give them anything for free then

1568
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:39,838
everyone's gonna have a backache you can

1569
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:42,359
give and everyone's gonna be medical but

1570
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:44,519
you know we don't have to reinvent the

1571
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:46,289
wheel here it seems like we're looking

1572
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:48,359
for this whole new structural system

1573
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:51,229
with cannabis but we have a structural

1574
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:53,789
system for for medication that will

1575
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:56,189
really address a lot of the issues we

1576
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:58,409
have Marcus you brought up edibles and

1577
01:09:56,189 --> 01:10:01,469
dosing limits right we're setting those

1578
01:09:58,409 --> 01:10:03,420
dosing limits and edibles at essentially

1579
01:10:01,469 --> 01:10:06,239
over-the-counter strengths we haven't

1580
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:08,520
really determined and realized yet that

1581
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:10,769
cannabis has potentially over the

1582
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:12,449
counter regulations where any mom and

1583
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:14,550
dad and grandpa anyone who walks in

1584
01:10:12,448 --> 01:10:17,250
wants to try a gummy we're there we have

1585
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:19,020
safety over-the-counter regulations but

1586
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:21,779
we haven't said any of what we call the

1587
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:23,710
prescription regulations yet people who

1588
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:26,039
need higher dosage limits people who

1589
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:28,989
and justifiably need with doctors

1590
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:30,340
support products that right now they're

1591
01:10:28,989 --> 01:10:32,380
saying they're too dangerous to be on

1592
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:35,050
the market if we can start to address

1593
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:38,980
the over-the-counter versus prescription

1594
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:42,460
need of critically ill patients make

1595
01:10:38,979 --> 01:10:45,159
responsible tax incentives and credits

1596
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:47,050
for the industry we can make a pathway

1597
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:49,750
where we could be as successful as we

1598
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:51,880
want and the heroes in our community at

1599
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:54,340
the same time we can show that we have

1600
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:57,090
that we value death but we values

1601
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:57,090
suffering

1602
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:06,049
RINs we pay lip service to seniors and

1603
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:07,759
we pay lip service to dying kids but

1604
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:10,850
when it comes down to it they're

1605
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:13,579
completely forgotten when there's a

1606
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:15,110
dollar to be made if we set up these

1607
01:11:13,579 --> 01:11:16,819
structures we can help all three of

1608
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:19,609
those communities I just named and

1609
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:22,909
others that I haven't while

1610
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:24,380
simultaneously being successful and that

1611
01:11:22,909 --> 01:11:25,909
just tastes it's a big problem

1612
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:28,069
so it takes hitting it on all levels

1613
01:11:25,909 --> 01:11:30,439
which I've kind of burned myself out on

1614
01:11:28,069 --> 01:11:33,349
the last few years trying to do it's a

1615
01:11:30,439 --> 01:11:34,969
legislative local and in our patient

1616
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:38,060
groups and educating to our patient

1617
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:39,770
groups but I believe it can be done and

1618
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:42,500
I think that there's folks in this room

1619
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:45,800
here who who have been fighting the good

1620
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:52,489
fighting and can help us do it I'd like

1621
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:55,340
to pipe up for a second I in my life was

1622
01:11:52,489 --> 01:11:58,550
very inspired back in the 90s when

1623
01:11:55,340 --> 01:12:02,420
Valerie Corral got in a lot of trouble

1624
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:06,619
with the DEA for her work and part of

1625
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:09,440
what was so affecting to me personally

1626
01:12:06,619 --> 01:12:14,029
was witnessing the people she was

1627
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:15,919
helping and it sounds like Hillary has

1628
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:18,349
been doing the same thing in Vancouver

1629
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,810
and I know Forrest is doing that work

1630
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:24,740
and I I think an important part of this

1631
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:28,280
is us being willing to step forward to

1632
01:12:24,739 --> 01:12:31,639
make ourselves public not as perhaps as

1633
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:35,029
business people but as people who have

1634
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:39,730
sufficient compassion or the struggle

1635
01:12:35,029 --> 01:12:41,840
that some humans are dealing with and

1636
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:44,449
recognition of the fact that this plant

1637
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:48,680
can help those people when the plant is

1638
01:12:44,449 --> 01:12:50,869
is grown and prepared and formulated in

1639
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:54,950
a way that is appropriate for the needs

1640
01:12:50,869 --> 01:12:55,849
of the end user you can see miraculous

1641
01:12:54,949 --> 01:12:58,220
things happen

1642
01:12:55,850 --> 01:13:01,340
everyone here has seen that happen in

1643
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:03,770
their own lives and what is important

1644
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:07,690
about hash church and the work that each

1645
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:11,090
of us as individuals have been doing is

1646
01:13:07,689 --> 01:13:13,669
by identifying people who have desperate

1647
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:15,860
need and seeing benefit and

1648
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:18,679
sharing that information with the public

1649
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:21,259
be they prohibitionists be they other

1650
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:24,800
cannabis workers be they medical

1651
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:27,560
professionals be they media people it's

1652
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:31,090
really I think an important part of our

1653
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:33,710
work right now in in our activism and

1654
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:37,250
again Valerie back in the 90s you

1655
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:39,529
changed my life you continue to inspire

1656
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:45,170
me and I'm really glad to know of

1657
01:13:39,529 --> 01:13:46,609
Hillary and her work I really feel like

1658
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:49,310
we're at a point where we have to

1659
01:13:46,609 --> 01:13:51,889
educate about the real need that exists

1660
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:55,160
and the fact that pharmaceuticals can do

1661
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:58,160
so much harm and this plant particularly

1662
01:13:55,159 --> 01:14:00,198
when it is properly formulated from

1663
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:04,609
plant material that's clean and free of

1664
01:14:00,198 --> 01:14:07,698
contaminants can do amazing things for

1665
01:14:04,609 --> 01:14:10,039
people and I'm gonna stop right there

1666
01:14:07,698 --> 01:14:12,919
thank you Marcus for doing this I'm

1667
01:14:10,039 --> 01:14:14,600
gonna just watch some more well thanks

1668
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,239
for sharing Wade we always appreciate

1669
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:24,380
your perspective it always sounds like

1670
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:28,099
it was well thought out and welcome

1671
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:30,170
dragonfly earth medicine hey everybody

1672
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:32,780
good morning super important

1673
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:35,029
conversation we really appreciate all of

1674
01:14:32,779 --> 01:14:38,269
you all that are fighting the good fight

1675
01:14:35,029 --> 01:14:40,340
I know that I can say that you know

1676
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:41,900
dragonfly earth medicine and what we do

1677
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:47,000
really represents a lot of the growers

1678
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:49,460
out there and I feel like you know we

1679
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,310
have a real problem in legislation like

1680
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:54,050
what with everybody is saying and right

1681
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:55,760
now the legislation is basically cutting

1682
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:59,029
off the arms and the legs and the

1683
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:02,840
mobility of growers right now in all

1684
01:14:59,029 --> 01:15:05,630
areas that have recreational and then

1685
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:07,699
they're asking us to give more and do

1686
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:09,230
more and we know now that Washington has

1687
01:15:07,698 --> 01:15:13,250
been rec for I don't know how many years

1688
01:15:09,229 --> 01:15:15,468
now but 58% so if the growers are no

1689
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:18,020
longer in the business there's ghost

1690
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:21,350
towns right now in California that used

1691
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:23,270
to be totally thriving areas where

1692
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:25,489
businesses were doing really well now

1693
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:26,030
you go into those small little towns and

1694
01:15:25,488 --> 01:15:27,908
they're toe

1695
01:15:26,029 --> 01:15:31,639
ghost towns because of the regulations

1696
01:15:27,908 --> 01:15:33,920
so I feel like you know we're getting

1697
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:36,770
hit on all sides if we're talking about

1698
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,199
access access is becoming less and less

1699
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:41,300
in the hands of the small growers and of

1700
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:43,428
the people who are growing responsibly

1701
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:46,250
and more and more in the hands of the

1702
01:15:43,429 --> 01:15:50,658
corporate model and that's a legislative

1703
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:53,750
issue right now and we also look to safe

1704
01:15:50,658 --> 01:15:55,879
access for the earth in providing the

1705
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:57,559
medicine so it's a little bit of an

1706
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:00,828
offshoot from what we're talking about

1707
01:15:57,559 --> 01:16:02,719
at the moment but small farms have the

1708
01:16:00,828 --> 01:16:05,630
ability to save the earth and and large

1709
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:07,939
agriculture is hard on is hard on the

1710
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:10,250
earth and if we're in a place where

1711
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:12,198
we're healing each other it makes a lot

1712
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:15,139
of sense for us to see how we can heal

1713
01:16:12,198 --> 01:16:17,808
the earth at the same time because it's

1714
01:16:15,139 --> 01:16:20,929
another being which is taking a hit and

1715
01:16:17,809 --> 01:16:23,029
is sick on a lot of levels so we have a

1716
01:16:20,929 --> 01:16:24,710
tremendous amount or it's really really

1717
01:16:23,029 --> 01:16:26,509
beautiful to see everyone in this room

1718
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:28,340
is really awesome to hear from you

1719
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:29,900
Valerie and I hope to see you at the

1720
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:33,139
Emerald Cup this year is along with

1721
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:36,259
everyone else but you know we are all in

1722
01:16:33,139 --> 01:16:38,090
different places within this industry

1723
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:40,550
and it's really special that we do get

1724
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:43,520
to come together to share our journey

1725
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:45,889
and our vision and we'll just assure you

1726
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:49,670
that you know our dedication to provide

1727
01:16:45,889 --> 01:16:52,069
the safe medicine and work with farms to

1728
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:55,158
stay in business will continue from us

1729
01:16:52,069 --> 01:16:58,279
and and and we all can only do so much

1730
01:16:55,158 --> 01:17:01,638
so we really are incredibly thankful to

1731
01:16:58,279 --> 01:17:03,679
you all Hilary and Etienne and forests

1732
01:17:01,639 --> 01:17:05,599
and everyone here Marcus that you are

1733
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,609
all doing what you're doing in your area

1734
01:17:05,599 --> 01:17:10,279
and really by us coming together we

1735
01:17:07,609 --> 01:17:12,439
really are supporting each other and

1736
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:16,009
that's what's really important and we're

1737
01:17:12,439 --> 01:17:18,859
an incredibly resilient community we are

1738
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:20,690
an unbelievable resilient community we

1739
01:17:18,859 --> 01:17:23,509
have come from the black market we have

1740
01:17:20,689 --> 01:17:25,460
gone against all odds to sit here in

1741
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:27,289
front of the screen to talk to so many

1742
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:29,599
other people who are in the same

1743
01:17:27,288 --> 01:17:30,859
position as us and also this plant is

1744
01:17:29,599 --> 01:17:33,289
incredibly resilient

1745
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:35,359
she will make herself known no matter

1746
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:37,488
what so how is it that we're gonna

1747
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:39,649
handle her how are we gonna give her the

1748
01:17:37,488 --> 01:17:42,169
respect that she deserves to be able to

1749
01:17:39,649 --> 01:17:43,819
step into the market because I surely

1750
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:46,310
believe that we haven't given her that

1751
01:17:43,819 --> 01:17:48,769
respect not the small growers not the

1752
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:50,659
people that are here on this show you

1753
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:53,239
know today but as far as like the

1754
01:17:50,658 --> 01:17:55,189
legislative end of it you know the

1755
01:17:53,238 --> 01:17:57,049
respect hasn't been given money has been

1756
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:59,118
first and I think that we have this

1757
01:17:57,050 --> 01:18:01,369
opportunity to go hand in hand with the

1758
01:17:59,118 --> 01:18:03,469
plant so that we can move forward in a

1759
01:18:01,368 --> 01:18:05,479
way that's respectful for the earth for

1760
01:18:03,469 --> 01:18:07,399
the farmers for the corporations and

1761
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:09,919
definitely for the patients and I guess

1762
01:18:07,399 --> 01:18:11,719
one more thing as it looks like we are

1763
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,670
gonna get pinched for a little while

1764
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:15,679
longer you know it's not gonna it's

1765
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:18,560
gonna be sort of us sort of suffering

1766
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:20,690
together on one level but as long as

1767
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,190
like we show each other the love that

1768
01:18:20,689 --> 01:18:24,229
we're talking about here it's gonna it's

1769
01:18:22,189 --> 01:18:26,059
gonna be the only inspiration that we

1770
01:18:24,229 --> 01:18:28,609
have to get through this so I just want

1771
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:31,369
to continue to be that voice of reason

1772
01:18:28,609 --> 01:18:33,198
and and really just give each other

1773
01:18:31,368 --> 01:18:34,819
empower each other on our mission

1774
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:36,618
because it's gonna take it like just

1775
01:18:34,819 --> 01:18:38,868
like with with growing it takes a lot of

1776
01:18:36,618 --> 01:18:40,009
different you know modalities to make it

1777
01:18:38,868 --> 01:18:42,109
healthy it's gonna take a lot of

1778
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:44,929
modalities to make this legalization

1779
01:18:42,109 --> 01:18:48,019
work and and it's really tough you know

1780
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:50,420
we're working on it in Canada and you

1781
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:52,940
know we're also in Oregon right now and

1782
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:55,639
on our way to California so we're very

1783
01:18:52,939 --> 01:18:59,839
connected to the process of providing

1784
01:18:55,639 --> 01:19:02,420
this medicine so yeah so we just we want

1785
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:05,869
to do all we can with our network of

1786
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:08,899
farms to support WAM to support Valerie

1787
01:19:05,868 --> 01:19:11,389
to support wave even though you know

1788
01:19:08,899 --> 01:19:14,809
you're in an area we can only have one

1789
01:19:11,389 --> 01:19:18,829
plant that's really sad I hope that

1790
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:20,510
changes and yeah we're please be in

1791
01:19:18,829 --> 01:19:22,550
touch with us we're in touch with you

1792
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:25,369
all mostly anyway but we just really

1793
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:28,130
want to know how you you all could use

1794
01:19:25,368 --> 01:19:30,259
our network to help you out you know and

1795
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:32,210
and and other people in other networks

1796
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:35,179
and right now dragonfly Earth medicine

1797
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:38,779
peer certification is over 80 farms deep

1798
01:19:35,179 --> 01:19:41,599
and we are doing the good work we we are

1799
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:44,238
doing what it takes to make a difference

1800
01:19:41,599 --> 01:19:44,569
on this planet and treat the plant with

1801
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:46,218
an

1802
01:19:44,569 --> 01:19:49,069
attention and respect we're trading

1803
01:19:46,219 --> 01:19:51,649
seeds and swapping and trading as

1804
01:19:49,069 --> 01:19:54,349
stories of successes and failures and

1805
01:19:51,649 --> 01:19:56,868
becoming better as a team so we're gonna

1806
01:19:54,349 --> 01:20:01,849
say we're doing the mycelial work at the

1807
01:19:56,868 --> 01:20:04,130
moment you know just knowing that as a

1808
01:20:01,849 --> 01:20:08,409
lot of our groups are in the legal

1809
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:11,389
market now simultaneously patients and

1810
01:20:08,408 --> 01:20:13,158
terminally ill children and adults are

1811
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:15,859
being forced into the black market you

1812
01:20:13,158 --> 01:20:18,408
know it's just important for us to keep

1813
01:20:15,859 --> 01:20:19,848
that conversation going and we are all

1814
01:20:18,408 --> 01:20:21,439
in different areas but most of the

1815
01:20:19,849 --> 01:20:24,139
states in the United States it's

1816
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:27,348
relatively similar but here in

1817
01:20:24,139 --> 01:20:28,940
California as is we get more and more

1818
01:20:27,349 --> 01:20:30,800
legalized and this happened and

1819
01:20:28,939 --> 01:20:32,149
Washington it happened in Oregon the

1820
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,949
people who actually have critical care

1821
01:20:32,149 --> 01:20:37,279
need are being forced further or further

1822
01:20:33,948 --> 01:20:39,559
into the black market because we're just

1823
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:41,359
not regulating responsibly and I think

1824
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:44,449
the more the people with a with a voice

1825
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:46,908
can always put that little asterisk on

1826
01:20:44,448 --> 01:20:49,698
it it keeps it in the public awareness

1827
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:51,710
and right now it's it's not you know in

1828
01:20:49,698 --> 01:20:53,569
it and it really is a shame that there's

1829
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:57,670
all this topic about conversation but

1830
01:20:53,569 --> 01:20:57,670
here in the 7th market

1831
01:21:01,738 --> 01:21:07,718
that's a check and other collector and

1832
01:21:04,899 --> 01:21:10,118
no one's talking about it so everybody

1833
01:21:07,719 --> 01:21:12,069
out there that can help you know just

1834
01:21:10,118 --> 01:21:14,439
keep that awareness would be wonderful

1835
01:21:12,069 --> 01:21:16,420
I'm also you know to add to what you're

1836
01:21:14,439 --> 01:21:18,339
saying for us more and more patients are

1837
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:20,380
entering into the black market to try to

1838
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:22,210
fulfill their needs well that's what's

1839
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:24,849
happening to a lot of growers to be able

1840
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:26,889
to fulfill the patient's needs so we're

1841
01:21:24,849 --> 01:21:29,319
really in the same position we've had

1842
01:21:26,889 --> 01:21:30,969
hundreds of patients and children that

1843
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:33,158
we've been working with and just like

1844
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:34,448
what you all were saying earlier on the

1845
01:21:33,158 --> 01:21:36,698
show is that we're getting people

1846
01:21:34,448 --> 01:21:38,710
writing us every day and we have a

1847
01:21:36,698 --> 01:21:41,618
tremendous responsibility to continue

1848
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:43,510
taking care of our patients and where is

1849
01:21:41,618 --> 01:21:44,799
the responsibility now so you weigh it

1850
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:46,869
out it's like you've got a

1851
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,940
responsibility for trying to be legal

1852
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:51,308
and play the system in the right way but

1853
01:21:48,939 --> 01:21:53,138
we have a tremendous responsibility to

1854
01:21:51,309 --> 01:21:55,690
continue to provide medicines you are

1855
01:21:53,139 --> 01:21:57,489
patients it's a real conundrum I know

1856
01:21:55,689 --> 01:21:59,109
it's happening in Canada because I get

1857
01:21:57,488 --> 01:22:03,158
calls and emails from families there all

1858
01:21:59,109 --> 01:22:05,198
the time and you know they they say you

1859
01:22:03,158 --> 01:22:06,969
know I think some of the most forgiving

1860
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:08,589
the children with EB the skin condition

1861
01:22:06,969 --> 01:22:10,109
that have really worked hard to help

1862
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:13,300
families with over the last few years

1863
01:22:10,109 --> 01:22:15,098
and they say hey we we can't can we can

1864
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:17,679
you teach us how to make the cream and I

1865
01:22:15,099 --> 01:22:19,750
say absolutely go see what is available

1866
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:22,599
and let's see if we can find what we

1867
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:24,219
need and you can't you know and they

1868
01:22:22,599 --> 01:22:25,960
find out really quickly that what it's

1869
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:27,609
needed for that level of care versus

1870
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:29,408
what is available it's just it's just

1871
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:31,899
not there and it's that disconnect that

1872
01:22:29,408 --> 01:22:33,519
I'm hoping to help close the gap on you

1873
01:22:31,899 --> 01:22:36,670
know and really help people understand

1874
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:38,500
that we don't I almost don't like the

1875
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:40,449
term legalization you know I don't know

1876
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:44,349
if we have legalization we have very

1877
01:22:40,448 --> 01:22:46,988
limited commercial allowance that you

1878
01:22:44,349 --> 01:22:49,110
know there's a bunch left the majority

1879
01:22:46,988 --> 01:22:52,209
of interaction with this plan is

1880
01:22:49,109 --> 01:22:54,189
absolutely illegal and you know I might

1881
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:56,679
be nitpicking but it just it just seems

1882
01:22:54,189 --> 01:22:59,259
like we're constantly fighting that oh

1883
01:22:56,679 --> 01:23:01,059
everything's fine now right it's the

1884
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:02,440
general public as soon as they see any

1885
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:04,750
progress they're okay we don't have to

1886
01:23:02,439 --> 01:23:06,250
worry about all those folks anymore

1887
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:07,238
because it's good now and I just you

1888
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:09,559
know I don't know how to fight that

1889
01:23:07,238 --> 01:23:11,898
other than saying well we don't we don't

1890
01:23:09,559 --> 01:23:13,909
Sara Lee have what we need and we don't

1891
01:23:11,899 --> 01:23:16,099
really have legalization we have some

1892
01:23:13,908 --> 01:23:18,288
very limited commercial allowance and

1893
01:23:16,099 --> 01:23:20,328
because it's so limited things that have

1894
01:23:18,288 --> 01:23:23,628
been legal here in California for 25

1895
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:27,469
years are now completely illegal and

1896
01:23:23,628 --> 01:23:28,399
it's actually harder now than it was a

1897
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:30,739
decade ago

1898
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:34,159
for us to treat the people who these

1899
01:23:30,738 --> 01:23:36,078
laws were absolutely intended for in the

1900
01:23:34,158 --> 01:23:38,029
very beginning the California was the

1901
01:23:36,078 --> 01:23:40,398
first in the United States have medical

1902
01:23:38,029 --> 01:23:43,128
cannabis when Dennis Peron put this out

1903
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:45,260
for dying AIDS patients and others and

1904
01:23:43,128 --> 01:23:48,588
these are the people who no longer have

1905
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:50,329
access to what they need and you know we

1906
01:23:48,588 --> 01:23:53,149
are either gonna ignore it and look back

1907
01:23:50,328 --> 01:23:54,708
on it and regret it or we're gonna you

1908
01:23:53,149 --> 01:23:57,619
know address it and stand up and speak

1909
01:23:54,708 --> 01:24:00,648
about it and I'll be at the Emerald cup

1910
01:23:57,618 --> 01:24:02,568
this year I'm speaking on Saturday and

1911
01:24:00,649 --> 01:24:04,039
I'm not doing a booth this year so I'm

1912
01:24:02,569 --> 01:24:06,859
excited to get to actually walk around

1913
01:24:04,038 --> 01:24:09,378
and spend time in the teepee so you can

1914
01:24:06,859 --> 01:24:12,199
put your information at our tea because

1915
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:13,939
we're making spaces for you and for

1916
01:24:12,198 --> 01:24:15,828
other pure fires because we know that

1917
01:24:13,939 --> 01:24:18,229
the Emerald cup is different this year

1918
01:24:15,828 --> 01:24:20,088
you have a big space so we're gonna

1919
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:25,249
utilize it so yeah we're gonna make

1920
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:29,389
space for you for sure I wanted to you

1921
01:24:25,248 --> 01:24:32,328
bring the conversation from the micro to

1922
01:24:29,389 --> 01:24:34,338
the macro so as individuals and as

1923
01:24:32,328 --> 01:24:37,549
people who suffer that is our story and

1924
01:24:34,338 --> 01:24:41,448
the work that we do is the way that we

1925
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:43,609
reach human beings the way that we touch

1926
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:45,858
one another's heart and that's that kind

1927
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:47,359
of the intimate connection that we have

1928
01:24:45,859 --> 01:24:50,019
from human to human

1929
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:54,739
and our the story of suffering always

1930
01:24:50,019 --> 01:24:57,889
not always but primarily ignites an

1931
01:24:54,738 --> 01:24:59,718
emotion no response from others and we

1932
01:24:57,889 --> 01:25:04,368
look to that because that's how we

1933
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:06,979
connect I too i impassioned and but

1934
01:25:04,368 --> 01:25:11,058
however I want to pull it back to the

1935
01:25:06,979 --> 01:25:14,389
macro because where I think that it is

1936
01:25:11,059 --> 01:25:15,949
in a profoundly important to push back

1937
01:25:14,389 --> 01:25:18,139
against the corporate state now let me

1938
01:25:15,948 --> 01:25:21,750
make a distinction here lambs the

1939
01:25:18,139 --> 01:25:27,000
corporation so I'm not saying that ever

1940
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:29,909
corporation is dooms the the fit is the

1941
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,430
doomsayer for the for smaller business

1942
01:25:29,909 --> 01:25:35,420
I'm not saying that however I do believe

1943
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:41,070
that you know how do you

1944
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:43,619
if we are ever to be able to turn this

1945
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:49,019
monster this corporate monster on its

1946
01:25:43,619 --> 01:25:53,519
head to flip it so that there is space

1947
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:56,670
for compassionate access and not just to

1948
01:25:53,520 --> 01:26:00,510
cannabis but compassionate access to

1949
01:25:56,670 --> 01:26:03,480
life for human beings for all living

1950
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:05,850
creatures for every sentient being for

1951
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:12,569
the planet itself as a sentient being

1952
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:17,280
then we it's our job it's my job at

1953
01:26:12,569 --> 01:26:22,859
least to to speak against the profound

1954
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:30,889
and innate evil that is part of the

1955
01:26:22,859 --> 01:26:35,099
corporate state of consciousness it is

1956
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:37,560
what what we are looking at and what we

1957
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:41,730
are being affected by is so profoundly

1958
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:43,380
huge that when we look when we see only

1959
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:46,259
from our own perspective which is really

1960
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:50,130
all we can do but but when we see only

1961
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:54,560
from that perspective we are trying to

1962
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:58,770
find our place in a structure that

1963
01:26:54,560 --> 01:27:02,520
always minimizes who we are as

1964
01:26:58,770 --> 01:27:04,530
individuals as small business people as

1965
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:09,620
the people who are suffering the the

1966
01:27:04,529 --> 01:27:14,779
response now I I want to commend and I

1967
01:27:09,619 --> 01:27:14,779
agree that we need to inspire

1968
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:19,740
corporations large corporations big

1969
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:23,789
business to do good right we want them

1970
01:27:19,739 --> 01:27:25,559
to do good however and anytime that we

1971
01:27:23,789 --> 01:27:27,569
can do that that isn't a profoundly

1972
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:31,860
important thing but there are several

1973
01:27:27,569 --> 01:27:34,029
things that that that are at cost here

1974
01:27:31,859 --> 01:27:38,979
and are at stake

1975
01:27:34,029 --> 01:27:40,599
and one of one to begin one is that

1976
01:27:38,979 --> 01:27:42,459
we're removing we're taking all these

1977
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:45,010
sacred medicines well all plants are

1978
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:48,279
sacred its nature but poison oak is

1979
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:52,449
sacred all of it but but we are taking

1980
01:27:48,279 --> 01:27:54,189
this we're removing it from its place in

1981
01:27:52,449 --> 01:27:56,050
nature and the shaman the knowers the

1982
01:27:54,189 --> 01:27:58,689
keepers of wisdom we're taking them

1983
01:27:56,050 --> 01:28:02,369
removing them and we're putting these

1984
01:27:58,689 --> 01:28:05,439
plants into the into the laboratory and

1985
01:28:02,369 --> 01:28:08,319
when what happens when we do that what

1986
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:12,549
occurs when we do that we're removing

1987
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:16,750
the the connection to the sentient part

1988
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:18,880
of plants because for instance the way

1989
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:20,289
we look at animals well animals aren't

1990
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:22,930
smart because they don't speak English

1991
01:28:20,289 --> 01:28:24,729
or they don't speak Spanish they don't

1992
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:27,010
speak an oral language that we

1993
01:28:24,729 --> 01:28:29,079
understand so we try to train them to

1994
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:31,440
speak the language that we speak without

1995
01:28:29,079 --> 01:28:35,680
understanding that they have their own

1996
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:38,739
communication their own systems so it's

1997
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:43,930
how it's what we do as human beings in

1998
01:28:38,739 --> 01:28:47,050
our infinite wisdom and our lack of our

1999
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:49,060
inability to connect deeply that's why

2000
01:28:47,050 --> 01:28:52,000
we do psychedelics and why we take this

2001
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:56,980
plant to that space let it take s excuse

2002
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:00,520
me to that space of deep to into insight

2003
01:28:56,979 --> 01:29:04,839
our wisdom to inspire us to listen

2004
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:07,240
deeply so I think that I think it is

2005
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,960
time to say no to the corporate stage to

2006
01:29:07,239 --> 01:29:12,010
say no thank you

2007
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:14,939
we we can we can do this and we will do

2008
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:17,800
it so much better than you and Rhonda

2009
01:29:14,939 --> 01:29:22,839
you used to sit before his stroke he sat

2010
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:25,360
on many boards he sat on a Turner 40 MT

2011
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:29,680
that board to keep why to keep the heart

2012
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:31,359
in the the in the boardroom to bring it

2013
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:33,280
in once in a while as you're talking

2014
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:35,529
about billions of dollars where's the

2015
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:38,050
heart in the delet where's that language

2016
01:29:35,529 --> 01:29:40,989
who speaks it how do we say it how do we

2017
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:44,470
remind one another and and the in I

2018
01:29:40,989 --> 01:29:46,239
think that it is to not I mean I I don't

2019
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:47,770
condemn anybody for doing it and I know

2020
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:50,139
that it has to be done

2021
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:51,670
to take part at that at that table in

2022
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:54,280
that boardroom last place I would ever

2023
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:56,380
want to be no last place is in a

2024
01:29:54,279 --> 01:30:00,099
political position so second to the last

2025
01:29:56,380 --> 01:30:03,279
place I would ever want to be I think

2026
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:07,260
that it is of profound importance to say

2027
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:09,759
no and so define to take on our role

2028
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:12,270
California I take a personal and very

2029
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:14,829
feel very personal about this California

2030
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:16,840
Blewett massively blue it we had such a

2031
01:30:14,829 --> 01:30:19,960
great opportunity to do good and we

2032
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:22,029
chose to do money okay we are they

2033
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:23,920
separate are they exclusive from one

2034
01:30:22,029 --> 01:30:28,300
another they don't have to be but they

2035
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:29,680
have been and and I'm not seeing us at

2036
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:33,909
this in this conversation this

2037
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:36,640
conversation is so remarkable and I'm so

2038
01:30:33,909 --> 01:30:39,880
grateful to be sitting at the table with

2039
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:43,000
all of you and recognize that you know

2040
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:45,369
nothing is done alone and I I never did

2041
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:50,529
anything alone I've always done it in

2042
01:30:45,369 --> 01:30:53,710
the company of greatness and and my most

2043
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:56,019
profound teachers are the people who who

2044
01:30:53,710 --> 01:31:03,390
have faced death and done what I hope to

2045
01:30:56,020 --> 01:31:06,280
do a good job at yet here we sit and and

2046
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:08,070
you know what I mean I I'm just gonna go

2047
01:31:06,279 --> 01:31:10,960
on and sound like I'm bashing

2048
01:31:08,069 --> 01:31:14,319
corporations and in in many ways I am I

2049
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:16,180
am saying you have done a bad job yes

2050
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:18,549
Amazon can get something to my door and

2051
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:21,220
I could pick on Amazon every day I tried

2052
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:25,239
to it's one of my mantras you know that

2053
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:27,640
and so because I'm that and I love you

2054
01:31:25,239 --> 01:31:30,099
Donald Trump because I he brings up

2055
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:32,110
emotions in me that I really don't want

2056
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:35,380
to feel you know I don't want to have

2057
01:31:32,109 --> 01:31:37,779
been waiting my life those those things

2058
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:41,310
that we look at in our lives and the way

2059
01:31:37,779 --> 01:31:45,250
that we can change what is profoundly

2060
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:46,780
the wrong path for just we talk about

2061
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:49,119
saving the planet but we really mean

2062
01:31:46,779 --> 01:31:51,159
save the people my next husband Mike

2063
01:31:49,119 --> 01:31:54,550
used to say that we really mean save us

2064
01:31:51,159 --> 01:31:56,909
give us a place in it make us give us

2065
01:31:54,550 --> 01:32:00,400
what we want so that we can thrive and

2066
01:31:56,909 --> 01:32:01,300
unless we thrive together and recognize

2067
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:03,399
that we cannot for

2068
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:08,469
individually but that's not thriving

2069
01:32:03,399 --> 01:32:13,689
then I think that we are on a very

2070
01:32:08,469 --> 01:32:16,569
course to to eliminate our personally to

2071
01:32:13,689 --> 01:32:18,578
eliminate our ability to help other than

2072
01:32:16,569 --> 01:32:20,710
just you know crossing the street

2073
01:32:18,578 --> 01:32:24,210
helping someone cross the street we must

2074
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:28,719
really find the ways to infiltrate and

2075
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:31,539
flip this this thought this idea that

2076
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:33,069
the the best way to thrive is to make

2077
01:32:31,539 --> 01:32:34,389
the most that you can make I'm not

2078
01:32:33,069 --> 01:32:36,819
saying that that's happening in our

2079
01:32:34,389 --> 01:32:39,368
group but I but I think that it is

2080
01:32:36,819 --> 01:32:42,099
profoundly important that we stand up to

2081
01:32:39,368 --> 01:32:43,719
it and say no and you're doing it

2082
01:32:42,099 --> 01:32:45,429
completely wrong and you're doing it all

2083
01:32:43,719 --> 01:32:48,670
wrong and then that may leave us

2084
01:32:45,429 --> 01:32:51,279
vulnerable again right right forest it

2085
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:54,908
leaves us vulnerable again because we're

2086
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:57,969
not protected we're not protected and

2087
01:32:54,908 --> 01:33:00,460
that's why we've done the same work for

2088
01:32:57,969 --> 01:33:03,340
for 25 years we've always helped people

2089
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:04,779
with for once a week we have a community

2090
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:06,279
meeting all of our members come blah

2091
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:08,738
blah blah all those things that you do

2092
01:33:06,279 --> 01:33:10,988
to build community which is a safe place

2093
01:33:08,738 --> 01:33:13,689
to be the more of us there are the

2094
01:33:10,988 --> 01:33:15,698
greater number the more power that we

2095
01:33:13,689 --> 01:33:17,919
have but I would say that we already

2096
01:33:15,698 --> 01:33:20,049
have that power that we are already

2097
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:22,690
great in numbers and that we already

2098
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:25,440
feel very much the same way not if not

2099
01:33:22,689 --> 01:33:30,729
exactly the same but our intention is

2100
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:33,519
there to be to create the world that we

2101
01:33:30,729 --> 01:33:38,769
can thrive in where the world itself as

2102
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:41,219
a single body and thrives because all of

2103
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:44,110
us are in complement with that

2104
01:33:41,219 --> 01:33:47,739
consciousness and awareness and because

2105
01:33:44,109 --> 01:33:50,049
we influence infiltrate and influence

2106
01:33:47,738 --> 01:33:52,479
those who are not yet you know everybody

2107
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:55,480
dies and you I watch people I've been at

2108
01:33:52,479 --> 01:34:00,549
over 200 death beds I people you die the

2109
01:33:55,479 --> 01:34:02,408
way you live you you it isn't great it's

2110
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:04,469
a great opportunity to pull your [ __ ]

2111
01:34:02,408 --> 01:34:08,019
together in the bet if we haven't been

2112
01:34:04,469 --> 01:34:09,969
working hard to achieve that or working

2113
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:12,579
to achieve that it can become a great

2114
01:34:09,969 --> 01:34:13,230
puzzle I'm not saying I do a great job I

2115
01:34:12,578 --> 01:34:14,729
don't know

2116
01:34:13,229 --> 01:34:19,019
that I probably do a terrible job if

2117
01:34:14,729 --> 01:34:22,099
that happens today but this ultimate

2118
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:25,470
goal is to not watch our work die

2119
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:30,510
because it is controlled by those who

2120
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:34,619
are motivated strictly by profit okay

2121
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:35,159
I'm I'm done we'll shout out to Terence

2122
01:34:34,619 --> 01:34:36,930
Mckenna

2123
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:38,670
you did mention psychedelics that can

2124
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:40,320
never be mentioned you can't mention

2125
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:42,810
psychedelics without me mentioning

2126
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:44,369
Terence Mckenna huge inspiration in my

2127
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:46,739
life listening to him and Rupert

2128
01:34:44,369 --> 01:34:49,800

2133
01:34:59,430 --> 01:35:10,770
the many one of your many sixteen

2134
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:12,090
children's as it feels like well we were

2135
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:13,590
missing you there was a few good

2136
01:35:12,090 --> 01:35:15,840
conversations that came up where we were

2137
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:20,909
like oh it would be good if Kirk was in

2138
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:22,260
the room to talk you know on this issue

2139
01:35:20,909 --> 01:35:27,689
of corporations because it's an

2140
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:29,100
interesting one to me you know and I

2141
01:35:27,689 --> 01:35:33,659
guess I'll put this out there a

2142
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:35,400
corporation is nothing more than a group

2143
01:35:33,659 --> 01:35:38,069
of people that have come together to

2144
01:35:35,399 --> 01:35:41,609
achieve a common purpose that's given a

2145
01:35:38,069 --> 01:35:44,039
legal structure within you know most

2146
01:35:41,609 --> 01:35:46,199
most countries in the world and you know

2147
01:35:44,039 --> 01:35:48,689
to focus on North America it's given a

2148
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:50,340
certain legal structure so that people

2149
01:35:48,689 --> 01:35:53,429
can come together and achieve that

2150
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:55,230
common purpose now traditionally the

2151
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:57,600
common purpose of a corporation has been

2152
01:35:55,229 --> 01:35:59,009
to maximize the profit and shareholders

2153
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,920
the people that have equity in that

2154
01:35:59,010 --> 01:36:04,949
corporation and that's probably how 90

2155
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:06,779
plus percent of the corporations in the

2156
01:36:04,949 --> 01:36:09,359
world are organized and then that's

2157
01:36:06,779 --> 01:36:12,000
their purpose but it doesn't necessarily

2158
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:15,599
have to be their purpose you can come

2159
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,939
together in an association to try to not

2160
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:20,310
maximize profits but Matt rather

2161
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:22,919
maximize this sort of good you do in the

2162
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:27,030
world and so I think like all sort of

2163
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:28,710
human endeavors the good or evil that

2164
01:36:27,029 --> 01:36:31,738
corporation does in the world is

2165
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:33,809
determined almost exclusively by the

2166
01:36:31,738 --> 01:36:35,189
good or evil that the people involved in

2167
01:36:33,809 --> 01:36:38,309
that corporation want to do in the world

2168
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:41,279
and in that way it's no different than

2169
01:36:38,309 --> 01:36:44,820
any Association of people I think where

2170
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:47,939
we sort of go wrong in our society is

2171
01:36:44,819 --> 01:36:52,198
that we've we've privileged corporations

2172
01:36:47,939 --> 01:36:54,089
that seek profit in a variety of ways

2173
01:36:52,198 --> 01:36:57,029
within our sort of legal structures

2174
01:36:54,090 --> 01:37:00,150
we've given them eternal life we have

2175
01:36:57,029 --> 01:37:03,509
imposed duties upon directors to

2176
01:37:00,149 --> 01:37:06,029
maximize profits we have treated them

2177
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:08,130
like people rather than legal entities

2178
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:11,059
and we've given a massive tax advantages

2179
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:14,489
that we don't provide ordinary people

2180
01:37:11,059 --> 01:37:17,010
all those things are changeable but

2181
01:37:14,488 --> 01:37:19,828
they're also all sort of divorced from

2182
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:21,840
the conversation of you know what is a

2183
01:37:19,828 --> 01:37:24,538
corporation and is it intrinsically good

2184
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:26,520
or evil yeah well fresh Andes is a

2185
01:37:24,538 --> 01:37:29,158
corporation I always hear people be like

2186
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:30,389
well what about those corporate I'm like

2187
01:37:29,158 --> 01:37:31,948
oh you mean like the corporate

2188
01:37:30,389 --> 01:37:33,420
douchebags there should be like a

2189
01:37:31,948 --> 01:37:35,939
different title where you can be a

2190
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:37,649
corporation or you can be like corporate

2191
01:37:35,939 --> 01:37:39,229
douchebags because we know some

2192
01:37:37,649 --> 01:37:42,750
corporations just like some people

2193
01:37:39,229 --> 01:37:45,689
aren't good and then we know other ones

2194
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:47,279
that are and then there are ones no

2195
01:37:45,689 --> 01:37:49,738
matter how good they do I was mentioning

2196
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:51,479
this earlier when Hillary mentioned that

2197
01:37:49,738 --> 01:37:55,649
canopy was going to donate two and a

2198
01:37:51,479 --> 01:37:59,368
half million to to the to the project or

2199
01:37:55,649 --> 01:38:01,379
you see a UBC yeah that I saw

2200
01:37:59,368 --> 01:38:04,500
immediately on Twitter just her taking

2201
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:06,538
fire like oh you guys had to name it

2202
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:09,118
canopy growth it's like well yeah we

2203
01:38:06,538 --> 01:38:11,609
donated the money like is that too much

2204
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:13,558
of a connection are we like are we I

2205
01:38:11,609 --> 01:38:15,420
just thought it was amazing that even

2206
01:38:13,559 --> 01:38:17,730
you know canopy gets called out for

2207
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:19,828
everything no matter what they do but

2208
01:38:17,729 --> 01:38:21,328
even like a good thing like they make a

2209
01:38:19,828 --> 01:38:23,009
mistake we all make mistakes but if

2210
01:38:21,328 --> 01:38:25,229
canopy makes a mistake they take like a

2211
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:27,750
serious beating like because there's

2212
01:38:25,229 --> 01:38:30,828
this whole division you know it this

2213
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:33,389
division of the know is talking about

2214
01:38:30,828 --> 01:38:34,590
Kirk also it just takes a beating

2215
01:38:33,389 --> 01:38:36,269
sometimes I'll just write the most

2216
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:38,460
innocent thing and then people just be

2217
01:38:36,269 --> 01:38:39,929
like you know Joe Rogan and Jordan

2218
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,889
Peterson we're talking about this the

2219
01:38:39,929 --> 01:38:42,748
other day and how

2220
01:38:40,889 --> 01:38:45,029
it's this man you gotta bring that dude

2221
01:38:42,748 --> 01:38:46,828
back up again well listen the

2222
01:38:45,029 --> 01:38:48,828
conversation was really good it was a

2223
01:38:46,828 --> 01:38:52,078
really good conversation in regards to

2224
01:38:48,828 --> 01:38:53,759
people responding on the Internet to

2225
01:38:52,078 --> 01:38:55,679
certain things and if you pay too much

2226
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,059
attention to them you can think wow am I

2227
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,189
like a really bad person I'm getting a

2228
01:38:57,059 --> 01:39:00,779
lot of hate and you start it starts

2229
01:38:59,189 --> 01:39:03,269
creating doubt and it just it's not

2230
01:39:00,779 --> 01:39:04,590
really this necessarily accurate thing

2231
01:39:03,269 --> 01:39:07,199
when the people who are the most angry

2232
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:09,300
who have the most energy to share are

2233
01:39:07,198 --> 01:39:10,618
not an accurate representation of the

2234
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:12,599
rest of the people that actually are

2235
01:39:10,618 --> 01:39:14,578
thinking about these things but if they

2236
01:39:12,599 --> 01:39:17,760
get Warped particularly in the person's

2237
01:39:14,578 --> 01:39:20,219
mind who's taking the firing and you

2238
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,748
know Joe Rogan said to Joe Jordan like

2239
01:39:20,219 --> 01:39:23,189
you just can't read that stuff like

2240
01:39:21,748 --> 01:39:25,260
otherwise it could just drive you

2241
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:28,010
completely mental well they're often

2242
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:30,329
educated about the subjects you know

2243
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:32,309
right it's you know there's some

2244
01:39:30,328 --> 01:39:35,819
justified anger out there as well

2245
01:39:32,309 --> 01:39:37,800
directed towards many including frankly

2246
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:40,408
Jordan Peterson but we don't want this

2247
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:43,708
conversation that address too far down

2248
01:39:40,408 --> 01:39:45,418
that path maybe it already has no no any

2249
01:39:43,708 --> 01:39:51,988
of you are unfamiliar with his work I'd

2250
01:39:45,418 --> 01:39:54,988
suggest remaining that way but but yeah

2251
01:39:51,988 --> 01:39:57,328
I mean it's you know I'm not immune to

2252
01:39:54,988 --> 01:40:01,198
going out there and provoking some of it

2253
01:39:57,328 --> 01:40:03,448
as well right to be fair but I think you

2254
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:07,078
have to sort of look at things in terms

2255
01:40:03,448 --> 01:40:09,598
of their actions if we if we want to

2256
01:40:07,078 --> 01:40:11,009
solve the problems of sort of the

2257
01:40:09,599 --> 01:40:12,389
corporate superstructure and the

2258
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:14,820
capitalist superstructure that we have

2259
01:40:12,389 --> 01:40:18,590
in our society and I heard somebody say

2260
01:40:14,819 --> 01:40:22,018
this Ataturk policy Alliance conference

2261
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:24,179
more than 10 years ago now I guess you

2262
01:40:22,019 --> 01:40:27,539
know we're talking about legalization

2263
01:40:24,179 --> 01:40:33,059
then and it looked frankly like it

2264
01:40:27,538 --> 01:40:34,708
wasn't coming anytime soon anywhere but

2265
01:40:33,059 --> 01:40:37,260
you know there was there was this sort

2266
01:40:34,708 --> 01:40:40,559
of eternal discussion about whether

2267
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:43,800
corporate interests should be permitted

2268
01:40:40,559 --> 01:40:46,260
to or cheered for supporting

2269
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:48,949
legalization initiatives because they

2270
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:51,239
are self-interested when doing so and

2271
01:40:48,948 --> 01:40:54,509
you know the guy stood up and he said

2272
01:40:51,238 --> 01:40:56,819
look you know this plant sort of

2273
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:58,739
illegal everywhere in the world and I

2274
01:40:56,819 --> 01:41:03,420
think it's putting an awful lot on the

2275
01:40:58,739 --> 01:41:04,979
plant to not only become legal and you

2276
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:07,350
know stop arresting people just for

2277
01:41:04,979 --> 01:41:09,929
having it in their pocket but also solve

2278
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:12,750
all the problems that exist because of

2279
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:15,150
our sort of history as a species and the

2280
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:17,729
existing economic super structures that

2281
01:41:15,149 --> 01:41:21,179
we labor under in capitalism in general

2282
01:41:17,729 --> 01:41:23,299
and you know I I took that to heart then

2283
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:27,360
and I and I sort of still believe it now

2284
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:29,550
that I think when people consume

2285
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:32,130
cannabis pathways in their mind open up

2286
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:34,170
that allow them to contemplate other

2287
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:36,690
ways of being another ways about

2288
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:38,880
thinking about those issues those those

2289
01:41:36,689 --> 01:41:41,489
major issues in our world but I also

2290
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:46,079
don't know that we should be expecting

2291
01:41:41,489 --> 01:41:49,260
to achieve some of the massive reforms

2292
01:41:46,079 --> 01:41:52,800
that we need as a species on the backs

2293
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:55,039
of this legalization movement right it's

2294
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:57,690
it's a small piece of a bigger puzzle

2295
01:41:55,039 --> 01:42:00,359
and I think something that gets confused

2296
01:41:57,689 --> 01:42:03,389
I think it's not legalization about

2297
01:42:00,359 --> 01:42:07,170
regulation it's it's a regulation market

2298
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:09,300
and and corporations are totally can be

2299
01:42:07,170 --> 01:42:12,239
good so it's really definitely not a

2300
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:13,949
thing about just saying corporations are

2301
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:16,349
bad or good so I think we can all agree

2302
01:42:13,949 --> 01:42:18,449
that it's it's the energy behind the

2303
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:20,039
corporation that would make it good or

2304
01:42:18,449 --> 01:42:23,909
bad and it's up to the individual to

2305
01:42:20,039 --> 01:42:26,550
find out what that means I just think

2306
01:42:23,909 --> 01:42:29,579
that oftentimes that that structure

2307
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:32,100
tends to overtake and then in the case

2308
01:42:29,579 --> 01:42:34,409
of regulate regulation in cannabis what

2309
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:37,200
we have with the larger corporations is

2310
01:42:34,409 --> 01:42:38,939
a disconnect from the medicine and the

2311
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:42,289
medicine makers that brought it forward

2312
01:42:38,939 --> 01:42:45,869
so it's like you have this umbrella of

2313
01:42:42,289 --> 01:42:47,760
law makers and and corporations but

2314
01:42:45,869 --> 01:42:50,130
there's the disconnect because they're

2315
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:51,449
not providing any of this medicine that

2316
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:53,819
we're all talking about is saving

2317
01:42:51,449 --> 01:42:55,500
everyone's lives what they're for what

2318
01:42:53,819 --> 01:42:57,719
they're having what they're doing is

2319
01:42:55,500 --> 01:43:00,300
they're providing a pathway for

2320
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:03,630
regulation and once we provide the

2321
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:06,690
correct amount of dots and an eyes we

2322
01:43:03,630 --> 01:43:08,279
can provide you know taxation to the

2323
01:43:06,689 --> 01:43:09,928
system to allow us to

2324
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:11,429
to provide our medicine so right now

2325
01:43:09,929 --> 01:43:14,670
we're at a point where we're just kind

2326
01:43:11,429 --> 01:43:16,408
of trying to figure out the system you

2327
01:43:14,670 --> 01:43:18,210
know so we have corporations that have

2328
01:43:16,408 --> 01:43:19,920
been in in Canada that have been

2329
01:43:18,210 --> 01:43:21,868
existing for years now and they're

2330
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:24,510
totally having other stuff figured out

2331
01:43:21,868 --> 01:43:27,509
and now the and from our perspective the

2332
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:29,369
true medicine makers are now just trying

2333
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:33,150
to figure it all out in this so it just

2334
01:43:29,368 --> 01:43:34,948
creates a that's where the energy comes

2335
01:43:33,149 --> 01:43:36,899
from of like oh god these corporations

2336
01:43:34,948 --> 01:43:39,269
are killing us you know and it makes it

2337
01:43:36,899 --> 01:43:41,670
really difficult to feel like everyone

2338
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:43,619
is kind of doing a part to make it

2339
01:43:41,670 --> 01:43:45,510
better and I think that's what we're

2340
01:43:43,618 --> 01:43:48,319
talking about here is all of us are kind

2341
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:50,130
of doing our part to make it better

2342
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:51,960
where does that a point where it's

2343
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:53,730
really difficult to find value between

2344
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:55,679
each other sometimes we're just like oh

2345
01:43:53,729 --> 01:43:57,509
god you know like well you know what

2346
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:59,788
have you done you know but I you know

2347
01:43:57,510 --> 01:44:01,260
we're also you know creating this

2348
01:43:59,788 --> 01:44:02,939
community right here to empower each

2349
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:04,710
other well and I think that you know I

2350
01:44:02,939 --> 01:44:06,509
think I'll be brave enough just to talk

2351
01:44:04,710 --> 01:44:09,448
about the elephant in the room is that

2352
01:44:06,510 --> 01:44:12,059
I'm sorry but what corporation forms to

2353
01:44:09,448 --> 01:44:15,089
not make money is their number one thing

2354
01:44:12,059 --> 01:44:17,099
very few other other people huge large

2355
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:19,230
corporations that have been set up in

2356
01:44:17,099 --> 01:44:22,139
the cannabis industry their number one

2357
01:44:19,229 --> 01:44:23,968
goal is not medicine it is not safe

2358
01:44:22,139 --> 01:44:25,710
access that is not safe for those

2359
01:44:23,969 --> 01:44:28,288
further earth it's making money because

2360
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:30,480
that's what corporations do and I think

2361
01:44:28,288 --> 01:44:32,759
that we have a bigger responsibility as

2362
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:34,799
corporations you know dragon fire earth

2363
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:35,969
medicine we're also a corporation you

2364
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,038
know because we had to become

2365
01:44:35,969 --> 01:44:40,380
incorporated to even be able to step

2366
01:44:38,038 --> 01:44:42,630
into this market so it was like the path

2367
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:44,819
was already laid out for us as growers

2368
01:44:42,630 --> 01:44:46,949
asthma medicine makers and I just don't

2369
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:49,109
think that that path was necessarily a

2370
01:44:46,948 --> 01:44:51,000
path that the plant wants us to go down

2371
01:44:49,109 --> 01:44:52,948
that the sentient being wants us to go

2372
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,170
down but the patient's want us to go

2373
01:44:52,948 --> 01:44:57,058
down and I feel like we do have a social

2374
01:44:55,170 --> 01:44:59,279
responsibility to the plant I think we

2375
01:44:57,059 --> 01:45:01,320
do have a social responsibility to the

2376
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:03,238
patients and I don't believe that the

2377
01:45:01,319 --> 01:45:05,340
corporations that are in cannabis are

2378
01:45:03,238 --> 01:45:07,589
upholding those social responsibilities

2379
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:09,690
right now I believe that they have you

2380
01:45:07,590 --> 01:45:11,250
know openings of it and I believe that

2381
01:45:09,689 --> 01:45:12,569
they may wake up one morning and say

2382
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:14,520
yeah okay I've got a social

2383
01:45:12,569 --> 01:45:16,229
responsibility and I'm not doubting that

2384
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:19,650
I think that it's absolutely imperative

2385
01:45:16,229 --> 01:45:22,049
that they do show something up in

2386
01:45:19,649 --> 01:45:24,000
tension and goodness but I think that we

2387
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:26,520
can do better I think that we can all do

2388
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:29,219
better as large corporations we have to

2389
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:32,730
do better so apparently you just pulled

2390
01:45:29,219 --> 01:45:35,010
out like exactly why I am where I am you

2391
01:45:32,729 --> 01:45:37,349
know Val said a little while ago that

2392
01:45:35,010 --> 01:45:39,060
the last place she wants to be as a

2393
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:40,500
politician and the second last place

2394
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:42,539
that she wants to be is in a boardroom

2395
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:44,488
navigating working inside a corporate

2396
01:45:42,539 --> 01:45:46,979
structure and I've chosen to take that

2397
01:45:44,488 --> 01:45:49,198
on and it's not always easy and it's not

2398
01:45:46,979 --> 01:45:50,939
always fun and it's like learning a

2399
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:53,639
whole new language and whole new

2400
01:45:50,939 --> 01:45:57,869
landscape I'd kind of rather be in a

2401
01:45:53,640 --> 01:46:01,770
garden tell you the truth but I see that

2402
01:45:57,869 --> 01:46:03,569
there are massive economic drivers that

2403
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:05,880
are making other countries around the

2404
01:46:03,569 --> 01:46:08,158
world start looking at repealing

2405
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:10,230
prohibition and that there are other

2406
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:12,029
governments that are not looking at

2407
01:46:10,229 --> 01:46:13,979
repealing prohibition because it's the

2408
01:46:12,029 --> 01:46:15,719
right thing to do or because of the

2409
01:46:13,979 --> 01:46:17,698
tremendous amount of harms that the drug

2410
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:19,380
war I've done but that they're motivated

2411
01:46:17,698 --> 01:46:21,178
to start looking at changing the

2412
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:23,969
regulatory framework because there are

2413
01:46:21,179 --> 01:46:25,560
economic drivers to becoming a part of

2414
01:46:23,969 --> 01:46:29,579
what is going to be a global industry

2415
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:31,140
and so the force of capitalism what

2416
01:46:29,579 --> 01:46:33,238
you're talking about inside you know

2417
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:35,550
like why corporations are formed and

2418
01:46:33,238 --> 01:46:38,519
what the focus of most of them are it's

2419
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:41,310
this huge force of energy that is

2420
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:43,530
driving change around the world and I

2421
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:46,159
would like to see cannabis legalized and

2422
01:46:43,529 --> 01:46:49,079
regulated in a way that is like

2423
01:46:46,158 --> 01:46:50,670
reflective of this plant that honors the

2424
01:46:49,079 --> 01:46:52,800
plant and respects the plant

2425
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:55,380
it's not about we're gonna legalize

2426
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:58,110
cannabis in a way that manages the risks

2427
01:46:55,380 --> 01:47:00,510
of it right this is a huge compromise

2428
01:46:58,109 --> 01:47:02,069
having other countries looking at

2429
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:04,710
changing the regulatory framework

2430
01:47:02,069 --> 01:47:07,710
because they're driven by wanting to be

2431
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:09,840
a part of a global economy is not the

2432
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:13,230
right reason to do it but is it harm

2433
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:15,510
reduction is it like starting to create

2434
01:47:13,229 --> 01:47:17,549
change and evolution like the legal

2435
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:19,530
framework that we have in Canada we know

2436
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:21,869
all of the reasons and all of the places

2437
01:47:19,529 --> 01:47:24,170
why it needs to keep evolving and where

2438
01:47:21,869 --> 01:47:26,819
we need to keep working you know like

2439
01:47:24,170 --> 01:47:28,980
Kirk's awesome rant about us being able

2440
01:47:26,819 --> 01:47:30,809
to teach our children how to use

2441
01:47:28,979 --> 01:47:32,789
cannabis safely

2442
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:35,400
like what we're talking about around the

2443
01:47:32,789 --> 01:47:37,229
inclusion of like all of the small farms

2444
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:38,489
and regulating Canada's production in a

2445
01:47:37,229 --> 01:47:43,199
way where we're taking care of the earth

2446
01:47:38,489 --> 01:47:44,969
and not hurting it so I think that's the

2447
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:47,869
end of my rant I don't think that I

2448
01:47:44,970 --> 01:47:50,010
could wrap it up nicer than to say that

2449
01:47:47,869 --> 01:47:54,239
you know you and you and I talked about

2450
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:56,670
this offline right it's like trying to

2451
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:59,579
create the same kind of change from very

2452
01:47:56,670 --> 01:48:03,810
different places I mean this phase of my

2453
01:47:59,579 --> 01:48:06,390
activism is challenging and and I

2454
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:15,060
wouldn't want to be anywhere else no no

2455
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:16,920
I hate here as a you know I guess I'm

2456
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:19,230
the face here of corporate cannabis here

2457
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:21,750
because I do have a dispensary and I

2458
01:48:19,229 --> 01:48:25,399
have navigated through the very

2459
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:28,770
expensive and very difficult way of

2460
01:48:25,399 --> 01:48:30,750
finally appearing in the legal market

2461
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:33,090
but Valerie who you've never forgotten

2462
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:35,220
who we are you know Berkeley patient's

2463
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:38,010
group it's in our name we still provide

2464
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:41,460
free medicine to over 250 patients

2465
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:44,130
weekly that was definitely as you know

2466
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:45,869
for us had made more challenging and we

2467
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:47,850
had to make them actually get state

2468
01:48:45,869 --> 01:48:49,829
cards because of the loophole they had

2469
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:52,440
to go through and a few people couldn't

2470
01:48:49,829 --> 01:48:54,930
make that and that was painful and that

2471
01:48:52,439 --> 01:48:56,969
didn't stop us from putting you know a

2472
01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:59,280
and B together so that you know they're

2473
01:48:56,970 --> 01:49:01,560
taking care of there is still an

2474
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:03,269
underground network you know with under

2475
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:05,070
with legalization they said there was

2476
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:06,600
gonna at least a third the network was

2477
01:49:05,069 --> 01:49:10,739
still going to stay illegal and that's

2478
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:14,850
the reality that's transpired and right

2479
01:49:10,739 --> 01:49:17,699
now we're volunteering our weekends to

2480
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:20,100
teach teachers and doctors right now

2481
01:49:17,699 --> 01:49:22,710
because there's no education now that

2482
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:24,900
dares been pulled cannabis from its

2483
01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:26,609
reality we've created our own syllabus

2484
01:49:24,899 --> 01:49:28,619
and we're at trying to educate the

2485
01:49:26,609 --> 01:49:30,210
educators because they have no

2486
01:49:28,619 --> 01:49:32,340
information out there to teach these

2487
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:34,680
kids anything and they don't know about

2488
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:37,350
their laws they all they see is these

2489
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:39,990
kids are using vaporizers in classes now

2490
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:42,630
and so we've been able to challenge that

2491
01:49:39,989 --> 01:49:44,849
and them on top of that we had a

2492
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:46,770
a group of heart surgeons come to us out

2493
01:49:44,850 --> 01:49:48,690
of curiosity because there's no access

2494
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:51,330
of information in the state of

2495
01:49:48,689 --> 01:49:53,039
California so we've just taken it

2496
01:49:51,329 --> 01:49:55,350
internally and gone to becoming

2497
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:57,658
educators where we volunteer our space

2498
01:49:55,350 --> 01:50:00,000
and our weekends and our time so that

2499
01:49:57,658 --> 01:50:02,519
they can come and they've been flocking

2500
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,859
I mean we had a whole swath of health

2501
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:07,110
educators from seventh grade all the way

2502
01:50:04,859 --> 01:50:11,309
to seniors in high school that need the

2503
01:50:07,109 --> 01:50:13,469
most basic information so we can be good

2504
01:50:11,310 --> 01:50:16,380
corporate people yes Berkeley patient's

2505
01:50:13,469 --> 01:50:18,480
group was always a corporation but we

2506
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:21,510
were enacted as a non-profit we still

2507
01:50:18,479 --> 01:50:24,928
give everything away we still give to

2508
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:27,929
many organizations and still try to do

2509
01:50:24,929 --> 01:50:30,480
things right but unfortunately we try to

2510
01:50:27,929 --> 01:50:33,000
lead by example and not many people are

2511
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:34,738
listening to our examples so that's not

2512
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,619
going to stop us it's not going to cause

2513
01:50:34,738 --> 01:50:39,448
us from moving in our reality and you

2514
01:50:37,619 --> 01:50:41,279
know it's it sucks being in board

2515
01:50:39,448 --> 01:50:43,019
meetings and having to do that you know

2516
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:46,439
the corporate things you have to do but

2517
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:47,909
a better voice no better voice than ours

2518
01:50:46,439 --> 01:50:49,829
that have been through the thick of it

2519
01:50:47,908 --> 01:50:52,529
to actually be there to hold people

2520
01:50:49,829 --> 01:50:54,269
accountable but we need bigger voices

2521
01:50:52,529 --> 01:50:56,399
you know I've been saying from the

2522
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:59,400
beginning that the biggest suffers are

2523
01:50:56,399 --> 01:51:01,789
the dosage reality limited people

2524
01:50:59,399 --> 01:51:04,710
because I deal with patients I have

2525
01:51:01,789 --> 01:51:07,619
quadriplegic patients who need and

2526
01:51:04,710 --> 01:51:09,420
require a high dosage cannabis and so we

2527
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:11,130
have to put them in touch with people so

2528
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:13,949
that they have to now go to the

2529
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:15,719
underground network and you know have

2530
01:51:13,948 --> 01:51:18,059
people make this that way in the other

2531
01:51:15,719 --> 01:51:19,739
put you know chemists in touch with

2532
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:21,929
people so that they can do as best they

2533
01:51:19,738 --> 01:51:23,939
can reformulate things you know the

2534
01:51:21,929 --> 01:51:26,100
grassroots never stops it's not gonna

2535
01:51:23,939 --> 01:51:28,259
stop but unfortunately there's too few

2536
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:30,179
of us holding that light in the dark and

2537
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:33,090
it's getting harder and harder with

2538
01:51:30,179 --> 01:51:36,869
these corporate rules the cannabis that

2539
01:51:33,090 --> 01:51:38,969
we grew or processed we've had in

2540
01:51:36,869 --> 01:51:42,569
certain price points that we have

2541
01:51:38,969 --> 01:51:44,069
20-plus almost years of you know knowing

2542
01:51:42,569 --> 01:51:46,319
what should be equality and we're seeing

2543
01:51:44,069 --> 01:51:48,529
nowhere near the quality and the price

2544
01:51:46,319 --> 01:51:51,119
ranges of what we're left with the

2545
01:51:48,529 --> 01:51:54,000
distribution realities that were you

2546
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:56,219
know we're forced to deal with so we're

2547
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,939
doing the best that we can in the

2548
01:51:56,219 --> 01:51:59,730
limited

2549
01:51:56,939 --> 01:52:01,559
that we have unfortunately we hear you

2550
01:51:59,729 --> 01:52:03,419
forests and we hear you Valerie and

2551
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:06,120
we're trying to do the best we can with

2552
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:07,739
the realities that we have but you know

2553
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:09,269
we can't do everything unfortunately

2554
01:52:07,738 --> 01:52:11,729
well yeah a lot of the problem is

2555
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:16,830
regulatory requirements you know we got

2556
01:52:11,729 --> 01:52:19,229
some great dish dispensary owners in our

2557
01:52:16,829 --> 01:52:21,869
area here but there's only so much you

2558
01:52:19,229 --> 01:52:23,968
can do and the the penalties are so big

2559
01:52:21,869 --> 01:52:25,920
for violating a lot of those rules that

2560
01:52:23,969 --> 01:52:28,800
you can't risk all the work that's been

2561
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:29,969
done to violate them and I think you

2562
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:31,890
know what I'm really glad to hear that

2563
01:52:29,969 --> 01:52:34,230
you're doing that type of education I

2564
01:52:31,890 --> 01:52:37,079
hope other owners out there hear that

2565
01:52:34,229 --> 01:52:39,479
because it's absolutely necessary

2566
01:52:37,079 --> 01:52:42,329
you know I sit on a lot of panels when

2567
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:45,238
when I'm invited I've done some for with

2568
01:52:42,329 --> 01:52:46,649
the school districts up here and you

2569
01:52:45,238 --> 01:52:48,839
know I just heard the most ridiculous

2570
01:52:46,649 --> 01:52:50,879
stats and figures about risks come out

2571
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:52,680
of their mouth and and I'm sure 18

2572
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:54,150
you've seen this but it's always when

2573
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,960
they ask them where are you getting this

2574
01:52:54,149 --> 01:52:57,988
information

2575
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:59,819
it's from Sam every time because it's

2576
01:52:57,988 --> 01:53:02,069
it's the only if you know it's the only

2577
01:52:59,819 --> 01:53:03,899
really good if you want to go find prop

2578
01:53:02,069 --> 01:53:05,939
negative propaganda that's that's where

2579
01:53:03,899 --> 01:53:09,319
everyone ends up but you know we're

2580
01:53:05,939 --> 01:53:11,460
teaching our kids just absolute false

2581
01:53:09,319 --> 01:53:14,269
realities with this propaganda

2582
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:18,329
information it isn't it been discredited

2583
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:21,000
time and time again and you know they

2584
01:53:18,329 --> 01:53:22,710
and then they wonder why cannabis or

2585
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,550
other drugs have a reputation as a

2586
01:53:22,710 --> 01:53:25,409
gateway drug

2587
01:53:23,550 --> 01:53:29,070
you know and it's keep telling them if

2588
01:53:25,409 --> 01:53:30,930
you lie to children right the way longer

2589
01:53:29,069 --> 01:53:32,698
in and then they go out and have an

2590
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:34,140
experience with cannabis and it turns

2591
01:53:32,698 --> 01:53:34,738
out that everything you told them was a

2592
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:36,150
lie

2593
01:53:34,738 --> 01:53:38,009
then they're gonna think that everything

2594
01:53:36,149 --> 01:53:39,029
about these other drugs is a lie as well

2595
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:40,619
they must have been lying about

2596
01:53:39,029 --> 01:53:43,380
methamphetamines and they must have been

2597
01:53:40,619 --> 01:53:46,109
lying about heroin in these other things

2598
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:48,569
and the damage done is is very

2599
01:53:46,109 --> 01:53:50,250
significant in my opinion so you know I

2600
01:53:48,569 --> 01:53:53,189
hope that and we are lying about those

2601
01:53:50,250 --> 01:53:55,170
other drugs do yeah to a certain extent

2602
01:53:53,189 --> 01:53:56,969
yeah absolutely absolutely there's

2603
01:53:55,170 --> 01:54:00,569
definitely a difference in risk and harm

2604
01:53:56,969 --> 01:54:01,710
and in use but yeah absolutely so you

2605
01:54:00,569 --> 01:54:05,969
know being able to get that education

2606
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:07,619
out there is important we're gonna try

2607
01:54:05,969 --> 01:54:10,140
on the board of the National cannabis

2608
01:54:07,619 --> 01:54:10,890
Industry Association and they want to

2609
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:12,810
adopt

2610
01:54:10,890 --> 01:54:14,460
our syllabus and our syllabus is

2611
01:54:12,810 --> 01:54:16,380
basically from the internet we got the

2612
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:18,239
National Institute of Health all their

2613
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:20,310
negative stuff and then we got all a lot

2614
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:24,269
of the other positives so we balanced it

2615
01:54:20,310 --> 01:54:26,190
out along with a lot of links so that

2616
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:29,280
they can also go and do their research

2617
01:54:26,189 --> 01:54:32,399
so what we're hoping is the NCAA adopts

2618
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:34,590
it so that in all 50 states they'll have

2619
01:54:32,399 --> 01:54:35,639
the access of the syllabus and I think

2620
01:54:34,590 --> 01:54:38,730
we're going to try and do a training

2621
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:41,520
video and so anybody can then take this

2622
01:54:38,729 --> 01:54:43,229
information and then go out there and do

2623
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:44,640
it themselves so they can regionally do

2624
01:54:43,229 --> 01:54:47,069
it so it's just a way that we're trying

2625
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:48,780
to find a way to locally activate people

2626
01:54:47,069 --> 01:54:51,179
by giving them the knowledge and at

2627
01:54:48,779 --> 01:54:52,889
least information so that they can then

2628
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:54,300
go with it because a lot of these people

2629
01:54:52,890 --> 01:54:56,490
and all these states have become good

2630
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:58,770
communicators regarding cannabis it's

2631
01:54:56,489 --> 01:55:00,929
just they need better tools and there's

2632
01:54:58,770 --> 01:55:02,280
no tools out there so until the state of

2633
01:55:00,930 --> 01:55:05,130
California gets it up-to-date

2634
01:55:02,279 --> 01:55:08,069
we're the ones filling in that void so

2635
01:55:05,130 --> 01:55:10,260
it's not perfect it's very introductory

2636
01:55:08,069 --> 01:55:13,439
but I think it's it's a little past the

2637
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:15,720
oh you state of you know education but

2638
01:55:13,439 --> 01:55:17,429
there's still a lot people have to gain

2639
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:19,650
on themselves and so that's why we try

2640
01:55:17,430 --> 01:55:21,090
to impart them with a little bit of that

2641
01:55:19,649 --> 01:55:24,539
in a syllabus so they think they can

2642
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:26,850
research further but no one hasn't come

2643
01:55:24,539 --> 01:55:29,100
away from it better for it and then

2644
01:55:26,850 --> 01:55:30,539
after we do that we actually we kind of

2645
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:32,370
cheat and then we take them to through

2646
01:55:30,539 --> 01:55:34,409
the dispensary so that we show them what

2647
01:55:32,369 --> 01:55:36,510
the cannabis looks like is majority of

2648
01:55:34,409 --> 01:55:39,180
these doctors and teachers have never

2649
01:55:36,510 --> 01:55:40,079
seen what cannabis looks like they of

2650
01:55:39,180 --> 01:55:42,420
course they're all whipping out their

2651
01:55:40,079 --> 01:55:44,250
cameras are so excited oh look I've

2652
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:45,930
never seen this another gram of cannabis

2653
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:47,609
looks like oh wow I thought it was much

2654
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:49,440
more than that you know and then you

2655
01:55:47,609 --> 01:55:52,529
show them an ounce and so that they see

2656
01:55:49,439 --> 01:55:54,389
and it dispels a lot of that information

2657
01:55:52,529 --> 01:55:57,000
that they've been told because as you

2658
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:59,820
stated you were amazed at the stupidity

2659
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,869
that we hear back from people all the

2660
01:55:59,819 --> 01:56:02,609
time

2661
01:56:00,869 --> 01:56:06,420
regarding their lies and misinformation

2662
01:56:02,609 --> 01:56:09,509
that they asked consistently so it's

2663
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:11,399
challenging but it's it's something we

2664
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:13,230
volunteer and we do out of the love of

2665
01:56:11,399 --> 01:56:15,089
you know the education that needs to be

2666
01:56:13,229 --> 01:56:17,579
there because if we don't do it who else

2667
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:19,230
is going to and you know as smoking

2668
01:56:17,579 --> 01:56:21,809
circles they'll fill you with so much

2669
01:56:19,229 --> 01:56:24,299
misinformation so that's what started me

2670
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:27,449
in the first place hearing that

2671
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:29,070
out of brains a career with his book

2672
01:56:27,448 --> 01:56:31,319
Emperor's no clothes says that's stupid

2673
01:56:29,069 --> 01:56:32,670
boy and you know if he hadn't been there

2674
01:56:31,319 --> 01:56:34,889
to slap me over the head with that book

2675
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:37,408
I don't know where I would be you know

2676
01:56:34,889 --> 01:56:39,359
so you know that education we're trying

2677
01:56:37,408 --> 01:56:41,098
to be that hundreds monkey that

2678
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:43,289
millionth monkey that takes that

2679
01:56:41,099 --> 01:56:45,239
information and imparts on somebody so

2680
01:56:43,289 --> 01:56:48,960
that they can take it and run with it

2681
01:56:45,238 --> 01:56:51,539
and be that spark we I've done all I can

2682
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:54,569
on a certain resolve so we need others

2683
01:56:51,539 --> 01:56:57,118
to have fire and spread that fire within

2684
01:56:54,569 --> 01:56:59,578
their local community so the best way we

2685
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:02,308
can find is like I said through teachers

2686
01:56:59,578 --> 01:57:04,039
and through doctors in the underground

2687
01:57:02,309 --> 01:57:06,719
teaching way if you can believe that in

2688
01:57:04,039 --> 01:57:09,389
2018 in a lot of ways that's the real

2689
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:11,219
fun of it and I bet Hillary enjoys that

2690
01:57:09,389 --> 01:57:12,840
a lot because that's a real important

2691
01:57:11,219 --> 01:57:14,819
part of the work that she does and and

2692
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:18,960
when we were in Vancouver last at the

2693
01:57:14,819 --> 01:57:20,899
bank cannabis hemp expo there was a lot

2694
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:23,250
of doctors there that really are

2695
01:57:20,899 --> 01:57:27,439
basically just coming awake to the

2696
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:29,460
cannabinoid really big now they up the

2697
01:57:27,439 --> 01:57:32,638
opportunity you know they have the

2698
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:34,980
ability to they're now able to connect

2699
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:38,059
with the cannabis plant and we're seeing

2700
01:57:34,979 --> 01:57:40,500
a lot of doctors that really have

2701
01:57:38,059 --> 01:57:42,809
alienated themselves from it because of

2702
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:44,939
the laws so now they're they're almost

2703
01:57:42,809 --> 01:57:47,929
hungry for the information because I

2704
01:57:44,939 --> 01:57:50,638
think that doctors are partly trapped

2705
01:57:47,929 --> 01:57:52,050
again doctors are similar to this

2706
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:54,300
cannabis we're talking about they're

2707
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:56,400
trapped by their system there's a ton of

2708
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:58,559
things doctors can do and there's a ton

2709
01:57:56,399 --> 01:58:01,710
of areas that they that have taken

2710
01:57:58,559 --> 01:58:03,929
themselves out of being healers and I

2711
01:58:01,710 --> 01:58:06,539
think doctors initially were meant to be

2712
01:58:03,929 --> 01:58:09,300
healers but now we're seeing a whole new

2713
01:58:06,539 --> 01:58:11,729
of demographic maybe of elders that

2714
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:13,230
didn't smoke or ingest before and

2715
01:58:11,729 --> 01:58:15,359
there's a lot of elders that are just

2716
01:58:13,229 --> 01:58:17,638
experiencing it for the first time so I

2717
01:58:15,359 --> 01:58:19,948
think there's a tremendous need for

2718
01:58:17,639 --> 01:58:22,559
people to just travel around and talk to

2719
01:58:19,948 --> 01:58:24,149
different people in Oklahoma and North

2720
01:58:22,559 --> 01:58:27,000
Carolina all these states that are just

2721
01:58:24,149 --> 01:58:29,189
opening up right now I mean we're partly

2722
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:30,630
saturated in it I mean in a way we're

2723
01:58:29,189 --> 01:58:33,269
just like waiting for the next like

2724
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:35,130
thing to come out to learn the new bit

2725
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:37,210
of information but there's like you say

2726
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:38,890
a tea and a whole world of people

2727
01:58:37,210 --> 01:58:41,469
out there that are just awakening to it

2728
01:58:38,890 --> 01:58:43,450
so I mean that's the real fun part of it

2729
01:58:41,469 --> 01:58:47,439
all in a way because you get to see

2730
01:58:43,449 --> 01:58:48,609
people come become awake to something

2731
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:50,829
that can help them and then you see

2732
01:58:48,609 --> 01:58:57,250
incredible changes and I can only

2733
01:58:50,829 --> 01:58:59,529
imagine what forest is you know and as

2734
01:58:57,250 --> 01:59:01,630
seen over the newest changes that have

2735
01:58:59,529 --> 01:59:03,759
come and I just want to as we move

2736
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:05,500
forward just recognize what we're all

2737
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:08,619
saying here is like we we are having

2738
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:10,750
successes with with the legalization and

2739
01:59:08,619 --> 01:59:13,229
I think that in the regulation in the

2740
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:15,399
world and I think we just need to

2741
01:59:13,229 --> 01:59:17,379
continue even though we're not sleeping

2742
01:59:15,399 --> 01:59:19,750
now we have to continue not sleeping to

2743
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:22,529
continue to create the access to the to

2744
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:24,969
the medicine of the people I want it

2745
01:59:22,529 --> 01:59:28,210
champion I wanted first of all and

2746
01:59:24,969 --> 01:59:29,980
clarify that when when speaking of

2747
01:59:28,210 --> 01:59:31,210
corporations and I agree with you Marcus

2748
01:59:29,979 --> 01:59:35,649
there should be a distinction between

2749
01:59:31,210 --> 01:59:37,210
corporation incorporation I when I said

2750
01:59:35,649 --> 01:59:38,439
I did not want to would not want to be

2751
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:40,930
sitting on the board I would not want to

2752
01:59:38,439 --> 01:59:44,139
be sitting on the board of Amazon to be

2753
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:47,050
their conscience because that is not I

2754
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:52,600
that's not my work and I mean maybe if

2755
01:59:47,050 --> 01:59:54,610
one if if Jeff Bezos ever dies them yeah

2756
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:56,500
if he's dying I could be by his bedside

2757
01:59:54,609 --> 01:59:59,349
I would find that an honor the rest of

2758
01:59:56,500 --> 02:00:02,170
it for me personally is not my work it's

2759
01:59:59,350 --> 02:00:04,930
not where I I can thrive nor do I feel

2760
02:00:02,170 --> 02:00:07,930
that I could serve and the great the

2761
02:00:04,930 --> 02:00:11,800
greatest capacity that's my personal now

2762
02:00:07,930 --> 02:00:14,469
we are not the enemy Hillary what you're

2763
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:16,630
doing it had been doing your the way

2764
02:00:14,469 --> 02:00:20,590
that you set your course and followed it

2765
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:24,279
is remarkable and it's it's admirable

2766
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:26,710
and that is look each of us is doing I

2767
02:00:24,279 --> 02:00:28,809
mean I that's my perception of each of

2768
02:00:26,710 --> 02:00:32,909
the work of each of us and TN of course

2769
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:37,090
you know that is you guys continue to to

2770
02:00:32,909 --> 02:00:40,000
thrive by doing your good work and never

2771
02:00:37,090 --> 02:00:43,000
turning your back on me so need it has

2772
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:45,729
many thing it has many edges and sides

2773
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:48,930
the dependence and endless wealth and

2774
02:00:45,729 --> 02:00:50,658
our capacity to serve to fill that is

2775
02:00:48,930 --> 02:00:55,340
takes and

2776
02:00:50,658 --> 02:00:58,388
this force of humanity so the

2777
02:00:55,340 --> 02:01:02,360
inspiration that we can provide is

2778
02:00:58,389 --> 02:01:04,069
through our work and that's the best

2779
02:01:02,359 --> 02:01:05,630
thing that we can do it I mean I know

2780
02:01:04,069 --> 02:01:09,228
that I have nothing to teach I'm not a

2781
02:01:05,630 --> 02:01:12,260
teacher I just I'm that this student

2782
02:01:09,229 --> 02:01:17,659
care and this and continue to be taught

2783
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:19,639
by my powerful human beings and sister

2784
02:01:17,658 --> 02:01:21,918
you taught us all don't you realize

2785
02:01:19,639 --> 02:01:24,498
everybody sitting before you it is

2786
02:01:21,918 --> 02:01:26,630
because of your inspiration and what you

2787
02:01:24,498 --> 02:01:29,300
did in the dark light that you held in

2788
02:01:26,630 --> 02:01:31,458
the darkness that's touched all of our

2789
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:37,550
torches so we held our lights to four

2790
02:01:31,458 --> 02:01:39,469
others thank you at John Valery hundred

2791
02:01:37,550 --> 02:01:41,300
percent you've you've passed on the

2792
02:01:39,469 --> 02:01:44,118
light to all of our candles you have

2793
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:45,979
been an incredible mentor and teacher I

2794
02:01:44,118 --> 02:01:48,708
know to me we would do anything without

2795
02:01:45,979 --> 02:01:51,979
you well I really appreciate that and

2796
02:01:48,708 --> 02:01:55,748
that's why why I think I'm Kali out that

2797
02:01:51,979 --> 02:01:59,590
we that we push back against look amaz

2798
02:01:55,748 --> 02:02:01,938
when I found out was last year I guess

2799
02:01:59,590 --> 02:02:04,159
Monsanto is working directly with

2800
02:02:01,939 --> 02:02:06,289
Jeffrey guy and I have to admit Jeffrey

2801
02:02:04,158 --> 02:02:11,198
the only time I met Jeffrey guy I

2802
02:02:06,288 --> 02:02:14,090
wouldn't say he and I agreed fully on a

2803
02:02:11,198 --> 02:02:16,848
or even you know I do agree and I do

2804
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:21,619
support the use of medicine and the

2805
02:02:16,849 --> 02:02:23,569
access to medicine know that medical

2806
02:02:21,618 --> 02:02:25,279
cannabis is an important piece and the

2807
02:02:23,569 --> 02:02:27,018
reason I'm chained I feel it is

2808
02:02:25,279 --> 02:02:29,918
important for me to change language is

2809
02:02:27,019 --> 02:02:32,269
because when I see that legalization

2810
02:02:29,918 --> 02:02:34,788
legalization of regulation have nothing

2811
02:02:32,269 --> 02:02:35,800
to do with freedom they have everything

2812
02:02:34,788 --> 02:02:43,038
to do with control

2813
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:47,689
so to instruct us those all of us that

2814
02:02:43,038 --> 02:02:51,050
have done so much work have been it had

2815
02:02:47,689 --> 02:02:53,959
our feet on the ground and had the the

2816
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:57,788
heads of the human beings that are

2817
02:02:53,958 --> 02:03:00,078
suffering in our labs and held the

2818
02:02:57,788 --> 02:03:02,368
opportunity to serve people in the

2819
02:03:00,078 --> 02:03:05,518
greatest possible

2820
02:03:02,368 --> 02:03:10,139
the capacity that we can to be subject

2821
02:03:05,519 --> 02:03:12,689
to a body of rules that not only

2822
02:03:10,139 --> 02:03:16,429
restricts but prevents us from doing the

2823
02:03:12,689 --> 02:03:19,499
work that we need to do that is part of

2824
02:03:16,429 --> 02:03:22,590
that is in part my belief been

2825
02:03:19,498 --> 02:03:24,988
instituted by the corporate state

2826
02:03:22,590 --> 02:03:30,989
meaning the bad boys of court and I say

2827
02:03:24,988 --> 02:03:33,628
boys sorry my sexism the bad the the bad

2828
02:03:30,988 --> 02:03:35,958
doers of the court managers and and

2829
02:03:33,628 --> 02:03:38,458
controllers of the corporate state and

2830
02:03:35,958 --> 02:03:40,378
and when I say corporate state I mean

2831
02:03:38,458 --> 02:03:43,529
those corporations who influence

2832
02:03:40,378 --> 02:03:45,628
politics because it isn't me it isn't

2833
02:03:43,529 --> 02:03:48,148
you it isn't our corporations that are

2834
02:03:45,628 --> 02:03:50,300
necessarily can influence in politics

2835
02:03:48,149 --> 02:03:54,749
and Hillary I agree with you we need to

2836
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:58,320
we have to influence that politic so but

2837
02:03:54,748 --> 02:04:01,128
they are not hearing how to serve

2838
02:03:58,319 --> 02:04:05,099
they're hearing the fears that

2839
02:04:01,128 --> 02:04:07,889
governments always hear around

2840
02:04:05,099 --> 02:04:14,340
abuse and lack of control and abuse is

2841
02:04:07,889 --> 02:04:16,859
often considered abuse because there is

2842
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:21,679
a lack of control by those that are the

2843
02:04:16,859 --> 02:04:26,639
torch bearers for for that control for

2844
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:29,429
holding a line and so when I heard that

2845
02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:32,359
Monsanto was working with you know had

2846
02:04:29,429 --> 02:04:36,359
now created the genetically modified

2847
02:04:32,359 --> 02:04:39,448
medicines plants that are the medicine

2848
02:04:36,359 --> 02:04:41,128
to be delivered by GW pharmaceutical

2849
02:04:39,448 --> 02:04:45,058
both in America as soon as it becomes

2850
02:04:41,128 --> 02:04:48,840
legal which obviously will become a

2851
02:04:45,059 --> 02:04:51,860
pharmaceutical then I felt it's I'm

2852
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:55,288
correct and changing language from

2853
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:58,378
medical cannabis to phyto therapies

2854
02:04:55,288 --> 02:05:02,248
because it is a plant and because what

2855
02:04:58,378 --> 02:05:04,948
we serve is a deeper it is them it is

2856
02:05:02,248 --> 02:05:07,288
the health of mind the health of body

2857
02:05:04,948 --> 02:05:11,038
the health of consciousness it's a

2858
02:05:07,288 --> 02:05:13,590
deeper relationship on the human level

2859
02:05:11,038 --> 02:05:15,210
and then it also is the Health and

2860
02:05:13,590 --> 02:05:19,529
Welfare

2861
02:05:15,210 --> 02:05:22,980
our nations of our planet and it is far

2862
02:05:19,529 --> 02:05:27,439
more complex than our language allows or

2863
02:05:22,979 --> 02:05:30,539
my language allows me to speak to and so

2864
02:05:27,439 --> 02:05:33,000
with that in mind and this is another

2865
02:05:30,539 --> 02:05:36,199
piece that I think is so valuable I

2866
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:41,000
think it is an imperative to work in our

2867
02:05:36,199 --> 02:05:46,159
realm of trade that we barter and trade

2868
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:52,729
outside of this failure of capitalism

2869
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:56,939
capitalism is innate has an innate mean

2870
02:05:52,729 --> 02:06:01,889
it's innately flawed why because it does

2871
02:05:56,939 --> 02:06:05,129
not value wellness it does not value

2872
02:06:01,890 --> 02:06:08,130
happiness it has no means by which to

2873
02:06:05,130 --> 02:06:11,670
measure the profit the true prophet of a

2874
02:06:08,130 --> 02:06:13,440
healthy and thriving humanity and planet

2875
02:06:11,670 --> 02:06:16,619
and that's why I just innately flawed

2876
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:18,809
and that's why I think it needs to be

2877
02:06:16,619 --> 02:06:23,909
turned on its head and that's why I

2878
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:27,390
think it's our job to do so mic mic drop

2879
02:06:23,909 --> 02:06:29,309
oh absolutely and I think as humans it's

2880
02:06:27,390 --> 02:06:32,010
really interesting we continue to build

2881
02:06:29,310 --> 02:06:34,770
fences but yet we want to be free we're

2882
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:38,760
a very interesting species that's all I

2883
02:06:34,770 --> 02:06:41,160
have to say and I just really appreciate

2884
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:43,770
everything you said and I just feel like

2885
02:06:41,159 --> 02:06:46,260
it's all it's safe to say that at this

2886
02:06:43,770 --> 02:06:49,800
point since legalization we've lost

2887
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:52,560
access so at this point where we've lost

2888
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:55,020
access and where we have to do all we

2889
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:58,400
can to gain it back I'll tell you the

2890
02:06:55,020 --> 02:07:01,380
best access I have experienced in this

2891
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:04,859
25 to 30 years experience that I've had

2892
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:06,359
was getting my MMA are getting my MMA R

2893
02:07:04,859 --> 02:07:08,909
was like wait a minute so I can grow

2894
02:07:06,359 --> 02:07:11,429
cannabis and then I can possess cannabis

2895
02:07:08,909 --> 02:07:13,229
anywhere I am and then thanks to Owen

2896
02:07:11,430 --> 02:07:16,710
Smith and the good group of lawyers that

2897
02:07:13,229 --> 02:07:19,019
represented him all of a sudden you

2898
02:07:16,710 --> 02:07:21,239
could process cannabis which was just

2899
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:23,100
this unbelievable I didn't need to sell

2900
02:07:21,239 --> 02:07:25,619
it I was just happy to be able to

2901
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:27,840
possess it to be able to grow it to be

2902
02:07:25,619 --> 02:07:28,979
able to process it you know like to me

2903
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:33,150
that was a

2904
02:07:28,979 --> 02:07:36,419
huge step in in in changing my

2905
02:07:33,149 --> 02:07:38,939
perspective and my perception on on

2906
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:41,220
cannabis and feeling that you know

2907
02:07:38,939 --> 02:07:43,559
constant feeling of like you know I just

2908
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:45,119
thought I'd before that I always felt

2909
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:46,710
like I was gonna get in trouble that I

2910
02:07:45,119 --> 02:07:48,809
was just like I wasn't it was so

2911
02:07:46,710 --> 02:07:50,460
paranoid driving especially once I got

2912
02:07:48,810 --> 02:07:54,050
pulled over up my roadblock which was

2913
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:57,539
actually with six kilos sorry not three

2914
02:07:54,050 --> 02:07:59,400
it was it just was this crazy fear that

2915
02:07:57,539 --> 02:08:01,409
I thought wow like this is just me being

2916
02:07:59,399 --> 02:08:04,199
afraid for my own person imagine how

2917
02:08:01,409 --> 02:08:06,359
much of this vibration is currently

2918
02:08:04,199 --> 02:08:08,159
happening on the planet in countries

2919
02:08:06,359 --> 02:08:11,039
like Malaysia where they hang you in

2920
02:08:08,159 --> 02:08:12,569
countries or states like Alabama where

2921
02:08:11,039 --> 02:08:14,430
they just give you ten years you know

2922
02:08:12,569 --> 02:08:17,009
like they're like it's no big deal like

2923
02:08:14,430 --> 02:08:20,250
oh you had six kilos like well you get

2924
02:08:17,010 --> 02:08:22,500
ten years and you get ten years and you

2925
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:25,189
get ten years and just to be able to

2926
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:30,149
remove myself a little bit from that

2927
02:08:25,189 --> 02:08:32,219
frequency was huge yeah I think that you

2928
02:08:30,149 --> 02:08:33,899
talked about legalization when you get

2929
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:35,550
you know the fact that people aren't

2930
02:08:33,899 --> 02:08:37,349
getting arrested that if we could

2931
02:08:35,550 --> 02:08:39,630
combine that feeling of not getting

2932
02:08:37,350 --> 02:08:42,510
arrested with the feeling of having an

2933
02:08:39,630 --> 02:08:45,720
MMAR and then the feeling of being able

2934
02:08:42,510 --> 02:08:48,300
to grow like erm on your own land if we

2935
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:50,159
could combine all three of those things

2936
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:51,900
you know along with that access I mean

2937
02:08:50,159 --> 02:08:54,210
that now we're talking about

2938
02:08:51,899 --> 02:08:57,029
legalization and true freedom I mean

2939
02:08:54,210 --> 02:08:59,220
right now we're we're dying we're dying

2940
02:08:57,029 --> 02:09:01,738
without medicine we're dying as a farm

2941
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:02,610
where we're we're getting crushed right

2942
02:09:01,738 --> 02:09:04,919
now

2943
02:09:02,609 --> 02:09:07,079
and and it's really really difficult I

2944
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:09,180
mean we're we're still drinking good

2945
02:09:07,079 --> 02:09:11,640
drinks and eating good food to keep the

2946
02:09:09,180 --> 02:09:13,680
the vibes going but you know it's it's

2947
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:15,480
something that we really are having to

2948
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:18,720
work really hard to gain that access

2949
02:09:15,479 --> 02:09:21,119
back so forest I would love to do i if

2950
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:23,369
we could do one thing in life it would

2951
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:26,189
just be grow medicine and give it away

2952
02:09:23,369 --> 02:09:28,738
and if there was like a magic fairy that

2953
02:09:26,189 --> 02:09:31,289
could just put enough money in our bank

2954
02:09:28,738 --> 02:09:33,419
account to like you know pay off the

2955
02:09:31,289 --> 02:09:36,899
other things that would be fine we would

2956
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:39,180
just grow and develop strains and give

2957
02:09:36,899 --> 02:09:41,389
all the weed away so we could save

2958
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:45,800
Heelys beings on earth

2959
02:09:41,390 --> 02:09:47,570
that's all we know go ahead no you go I

2960
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:49,670
was just saying that's just the sort of

2961
02:09:47,569 --> 02:09:51,579
difficult reality of the super

2962
02:09:49,670 --> 02:09:55,430
structures that we live in right because

2963
02:09:51,579 --> 02:09:58,069
legally in Canada right now you you can

2964
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:59,900
grow medicine and give it away you

2965
02:09:58,069 --> 02:10:02,449
you're absolutely legally permitted to

2966
02:09:59,899 --> 02:10:04,969
do that and you can even grow sort of an

2967
02:10:02,449 --> 02:10:08,689
MMA hour amount of medicine and give it

2968
02:10:04,970 --> 02:10:11,329
away either in the designated caregiver

2969
02:10:08,689 --> 02:10:13,539
role that's allowed to you or simply

2970
02:10:11,329 --> 02:10:16,880
because you can now give away cannabis

2971
02:10:13,539 --> 02:10:20,000
so the difficulty of course is you got

2972
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:22,880
to pay your bills and that's the

2973
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,859
structure that we in and and so if you

2974
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:27,079
want to pay your bills also by growing

2975
02:10:24,859 --> 02:10:28,789
cannabis now we've moved into a

2976
02:10:27,079 --> 02:10:31,699
situation where we have a regulated

2977
02:10:28,789 --> 02:10:33,470
market for doing so that is incredibly

2978
02:10:31,699 --> 02:10:35,210
difficult to access and far too

2979
02:10:33,470 --> 02:10:37,789
difficult to access which I think goes

2980
02:10:35,210 --> 02:10:39,529
back to sort of Hillary's point of there

2981
02:10:37,789 --> 02:10:41,779
there has to continue to be progress

2982
02:10:39,529 --> 02:10:45,529
made and allowing people to participate

2983
02:10:41,779 --> 02:10:49,069
in this in an economic way so that they

2984
02:10:45,529 --> 02:10:51,109
can pay their bills and achieve their

2985
02:10:49,069 --> 02:10:53,359
goals whatever those goals happen to be

2986
02:10:51,109 --> 02:10:56,029
and we're not there yet but I think

2987
02:10:53,359 --> 02:10:59,149
we're now at a place where we can have

2988
02:10:56,029 --> 02:11:01,960
that conversation instead of the old

2989
02:10:59,149 --> 02:11:04,009
conversation which was you know

2990
02:11:01,960 --> 02:11:05,989
everybody involved in this industry is a

2991
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:07,909
criminal and you know marijuana is a

2992
02:11:05,989 --> 02:11:10,819
criminal activity and it's all crying

2993
02:11:07,909 --> 02:11:12,710
and I think the beauty of legalization

2994
02:11:10,819 --> 02:11:14,149
sort of spreading and I think it's

2995
02:11:12,710 --> 02:11:16,640
accelerating I think the spread of

2996
02:11:14,149 --> 02:11:20,929
legalization is expressed accelerating

2997
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:24,530
in a highly regulated manner is that you

2998
02:11:20,930 --> 02:11:27,380
now are able to take cannabis out of the

2999
02:11:24,529 --> 02:11:30,859
category of criminal as a society as a

3000
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:32,930
culture as law as politics and you put

3001
02:11:30,859 --> 02:11:34,759
it over on the other side of you know

3002
02:11:32,930 --> 02:11:37,250
it's an imaginary line but I think it's

3003
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:40,940
very very real you put it over on the

3004
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:42,829
not criminal side and doctors begin to

3005
02:11:40,939 --> 02:11:44,329
be able to have the conversations and

3006
02:11:42,829 --> 02:11:47,269
learn more to the point that was made

3007
02:11:44,329 --> 02:11:48,500
earlier people at the table with their

3008
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:51,020
kids get to be able to have

3009
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:52,880
conversations in a different way than

3010
02:11:51,020 --> 02:11:54,090
they would have had them when cannabis

3011
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:55,859
was over in the illegal

3012
02:11:54,090 --> 02:11:59,190
side and so as long as we can keep

3013
02:11:55,859 --> 02:12:03,118
marshaling all the different forces that

3014
02:11:59,189 --> 02:12:05,879
want to change that categorization

3015
02:12:03,118 --> 02:12:08,460
I think that'll start spreading it'll

3016
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:10,469
spread quicker and as a result more

3017
02:12:08,460 --> 02:12:12,719
people will learn the truth about this

3018
02:12:10,469 --> 02:12:16,439
planet and more people will consume it

3019
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:18,480
which will allow those people to let it

3020
02:12:16,439 --> 02:12:20,819
guide you to the understandings of the

3021
02:12:18,479 --> 02:12:22,799
bigger issues we're talking about of how

3022
02:12:20,819 --> 02:12:25,920
we relate to each other as humans how we

3023
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:29,130
relate to the planet of how we conduct

3024
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:30,840
all of our affairs and our intentions

3025
02:12:29,130 --> 02:12:33,389
and and it you know I think it's gonna

3026
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:35,550
gain momentum but we have to switch that

3027
02:12:33,389 --> 02:12:38,039
category so that it will continue to

3028
02:12:35,550 --> 02:12:40,920
gain those momentum you know this goes

3029
02:12:38,039 --> 02:12:43,019
back to what Valerie said about you know

3030
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:44,908
turning the whole industry upside down

3031
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:46,980
on its head and that being our role to

3032
02:12:44,908 --> 02:12:49,348
do that I think what we're talking about

3033
02:12:46,979 --> 02:12:52,169
is is trying to spread an idea you know

3034
02:12:49,349 --> 02:12:53,969
an ideas are powerful capitalism is

3035
02:12:52,170 --> 02:12:56,130
gonna try to do to cannabis what it does

3036
02:12:53,969 --> 02:13:00,539
to everything right chew it up spit it

3037
02:12:56,130 --> 02:13:03,510
out exploited maximize profit but if we

3038
02:13:00,539 --> 02:13:05,908
can help encourage a culture that wants

3039
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:07,710
to see a different model I think there

3040
02:13:05,908 --> 02:13:10,379
is an opportunity for some impact there

3041
02:13:07,710 --> 02:13:14,069
if we have a culture that of consumers

3042
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:15,989
who shop responsibly look for socially

3043
02:13:14,069 --> 02:13:18,000
responsible models support those

3044
02:13:15,988 --> 02:13:20,848
industries support those businesses

3045
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:22,738
you're gonna see an impact on those who

3046
02:13:20,849 --> 02:13:25,199
aren't coming into cannabis with that

3047
02:13:22,738 --> 02:13:27,868
sort of mind if we can encourage also

3048
02:13:25,198 --> 02:13:30,210
you know yeah we all have to pay our

3049
02:13:27,868 --> 02:13:32,130
bills right but there's a lot of other

3050
02:13:30,210 --> 02:13:34,170
different localized models you can use

3051
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:36,569
community gardens community compassion

3052
02:13:34,170 --> 02:13:38,250
programs that really work on local

3053
02:13:36,569 --> 02:13:40,920
levels as opposed to trying to start

3054
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:43,349
companies who are dealing with you know

3055
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:45,420
the whole state or a whole you know

3056
02:13:43,349 --> 02:13:46,710
province or area there's there's

3057
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:49,920
different models that we can set up they

3058
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:52,859
can help do that and take care of the

3059
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:54,960
critical critical need as well as be

3060
02:13:52,859 --> 02:13:59,309
successful in our businesses at the same

3061
02:13:54,960 --> 02:14:01,469
time you know we have it's not every day

3062
02:13:59,310 --> 02:14:02,940
you get to be at the start of such a

3063
02:14:01,469 --> 02:14:06,270
huge what's going to be such a huge

3064
02:14:02,939 --> 02:14:07,799
economic force and industry you know we

3065
02:14:06,270 --> 02:14:12,090
weren't around when automobiles

3066
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:14,130
invented right I missed the the Silicon

3067
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:15,960
Valley tech bubble although that's still

3068
02:14:14,130 --> 02:14:17,819
kind of going this is this is the

3069
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:20,100
beginning of something that I think with

3070
02:14:17,819 --> 02:14:23,699
a cultural awareness in an expectation

3071
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:26,880
of responsibility from the beginning we

3072
02:14:23,699 --> 02:14:29,130
can help influence that a little bit and

3073
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:31,190
you know I they test seem kind of a pie

3074
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:34,500
in the sky dream thing but you know

3075
02:14:31,189 --> 02:14:36,750
cultural expectations do shift and

3076
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:38,909
change the wheels although it's slow we

3077
02:14:36,750 --> 02:14:41,340
see it in civil rights issues we see it

3078
02:14:38,909 --> 02:14:45,029
in other issues in our communities you

3079
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:47,190
know we can expect a level of giving

3080
02:14:45,029 --> 02:14:49,529
back some of that pie out of companies

3081
02:14:47,189 --> 02:14:51,899
in a way that really impacts our

3082
02:14:49,529 --> 02:14:53,759
communities because the reality is we're

3083
02:14:51,899 --> 02:14:55,500
it's different with cannabis as everyone

3084
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:58,590
should be motivated to do this because

3085
02:14:55,500 --> 02:15:00,899
we are all going to be patients one day

3086
02:14:58,590 --> 02:15:03,539
even if you're you're a patient now but

3087
02:15:00,899 --> 02:15:06,139
your need is light you know our time is

3088
02:15:03,539 --> 02:15:08,489
short something's gonna give us in

3089
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:10,680
Canada does help such a wide variety of

3090
02:15:08,489 --> 02:15:12,210
conditions that there's a good chance

3091
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:14,310
we're all gonna need this someday and

3092
02:15:12,210 --> 02:15:18,539
when we can set up a structure that when

3093
02:15:14,310 --> 02:15:20,960
you have if you know heaven forbid

3094
02:15:18,539 --> 02:15:24,810
you're diagnosed with a type of

3095
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:28,409
glioblastoma right or or cancer that

3096
02:15:24,810 --> 02:15:30,510
later in life and as opposed to becoming

3097
02:15:28,409 --> 02:15:32,430
medically bankrupt by fowleri was

3098
02:15:30,510 --> 02:15:33,960
speaking about having an infrastructure

3099
02:15:32,430 --> 02:15:36,090
that is immediately set up to didn't

3100
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:38,250
care for you that you funded your whole

3101
02:15:36,090 --> 02:15:40,050
life by shopping responsibly supporting

3102
02:15:38,250 --> 02:15:41,909
those companies and then when you have

3103
02:15:40,050 --> 02:15:43,529
the diagnosis that qualifies for the

3104
02:15:41,909 --> 02:15:45,479
community to come and care for you

3105
02:15:43,529 --> 02:15:46,559
you're cared for and you don't have to

3106
02:15:45,479 --> 02:15:49,559
worry about where you're gonna get

3107
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:51,660
fifteen hundred milligrams a day of both

3108
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:54,180
THC and CBD to give your system a

3109
02:15:51,659 --> 02:15:56,130
shock-and-awe dose to hopefully fight

3110
02:15:54,180 --> 02:15:58,470
some of these diseases that cannabis can

3111
02:15:56,130 --> 02:15:59,520
be effective on and I think some of it's

3112
02:15:58,470 --> 02:16:01,890
just about having these type of

3113
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:04,740
conversations and getting that out there

3114
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:07,289
in the in and making that in expectation

3115
02:16:04,739 --> 02:16:09,109
our our industry is going to be

3116
02:16:07,289 --> 02:16:11,729
different we're gonna shift some of our

3117
02:16:09,109 --> 02:16:14,159
values into it from the beginning

3118
02:16:11,729 --> 02:16:16,500
and it starts with the consumer and if

3119
02:16:14,159 --> 02:16:19,519
the consumer thinks it's important the

3120
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:19,520
businesses will follow

3121
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:29,860
speechless I know there's well a sad

3122
02:16:26,679 --> 02:16:32,049
forest and I like Kirk's opinion as well

3123
02:16:29,859 --> 02:16:34,929
about just you know we said a similar

3124
02:16:32,049 --> 02:16:37,179
thing years ago in 94 my partner and I

3125
02:16:34,929 --> 02:16:38,739
Martin and we were get trying to get

3126
02:16:37,179 --> 02:16:39,939
hemp grown in Manitoba and it was just

3127
02:16:38,739 --> 02:16:41,500
you know we were having to visit

3128
02:16:39,939 --> 02:16:43,329
ministers and do all these things that

3129
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:45,099
were we might as well have been on an

3130
02:16:43,329 --> 02:16:46,840
alien spaceship actually we would have

3131
02:16:45,099 --> 02:16:49,239
for sure been more at home and more

3132
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:51,969
comfortable on an alien spaceship than

3133
02:16:49,239 --> 02:16:53,920
we were in some of those situations and

3134
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:56,259
when we got the first five acres growing

3135
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:58,719
Martin said to me he said you know this

3136
02:16:56,260 --> 02:17:00,609
is gonna change the way people think and

3137
02:16:58,718 --> 02:17:02,858
I was kind of like what do you mean I

3138
02:17:00,609 --> 02:17:05,079
was pretty young he's like well just

3139
02:17:02,859 --> 02:17:07,269
seeing this just this be this existing

3140
02:17:05,079 --> 02:17:09,760
is going to push against belief systems

3141
02:17:07,269 --> 02:17:11,469
and foundations that I'm telling you

3142
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:13,210
it's gonna rock people it's going to

3143
02:17:11,468 --> 02:17:14,829
rock people and slowly but surely you

3144
02:17:13,209 --> 02:17:16,869
know it was literally a couple years

3145
02:17:14,829 --> 02:17:19,090
later Hillary was doing the compassion

3146
02:17:16,870 --> 02:17:22,210
Club like you know like a couple years

3147
02:17:19,090 --> 02:17:24,728
later you you knew her name Hillary from

3148
02:17:22,209 --> 02:17:28,029
the body shop had the big full sized pot

3149
02:17:24,728 --> 02:17:30,789
Leafs in the in the malls like it just

3150
02:17:28,030 --> 02:17:33,250
sort of like it affected the way people

3151
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:36,099
thinks and and and that was unsealed via

3152
02:17:33,250 --> 02:17:37,808
the other side of that illusionary you

3153
02:17:36,099 --> 02:17:41,648
know slowly we were pushing it over but

3154
02:17:37,808 --> 02:17:43,090
now with sort of decriminalization 1.0

3155
02:17:41,648 --> 02:17:45,459
whatever you want to call it at least

3156
02:17:43,090 --> 02:17:49,000
here in Canada it will change the way

3157
02:17:45,459 --> 02:17:51,489
people think in a drastically like never

3158
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:54,250
to go back the way it was way

3159
02:17:51,489 --> 02:17:56,199
I've already seen tons of people that

3160
02:17:54,250 --> 02:17:57,728
were quite against cannabis for no other

3161
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:59,079
reason other than the fact that it was

3162
02:17:57,728 --> 02:18:01,388
illegal it was just quite you know

3163
02:17:59,079 --> 02:18:03,120
there's a huge population the huge

3164
02:18:01,388 --> 02:18:06,009
proportion of the population that are

3165
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:08,079
absolutely that's as simple as it is for

3166
02:18:06,010 --> 02:18:09,489
them if it's in the newspaper and they

3167
02:18:08,079 --> 02:18:10,808
tell you it's good it's good if it's in

3168
02:18:09,489 --> 02:18:13,299
the newspaper and they tell you it's bad

3169
02:18:10,808 --> 02:18:15,188
it's bad and so when you realize that

3170
02:18:13,299 --> 02:18:17,888
there's a huge amount of people maybe

3171
02:18:15,189 --> 02:18:19,659
like the majority of our populace that's

3172
02:18:17,888 --> 02:18:22,329
how they think and that's how they learn

3173
02:18:19,659 --> 02:18:24,280
then it's important to put what we're

3174
02:18:22,329 --> 02:18:26,558
talking about on to the other side of

3175
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:28,000
the imaginary line and for sure that the

3176
02:18:26,558 --> 02:18:29,558
same people from this side are going to

3177
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:33,189
try and control it they're gonna try to

3178
02:18:29,558 --> 02:18:35,129
to make maintaining and contain it but I

3179
02:18:33,189 --> 02:18:37,889
think Kelly was saying early

3180
02:18:35,129 --> 02:18:42,179
it cannot be contained you can't stop it

3181
02:18:37,888 --> 02:18:45,299
it's a sorry two things that are sort of

3182
02:18:42,179 --> 02:18:48,648
odd one of them is to do with the

3183
02:18:45,299 --> 02:18:50,279
capitalism thing we were talking about

3184
02:18:48,648 --> 02:18:55,799
Goldman Sachs

3185
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:58,530
to name a high temple of capitalism does

3186
02:18:55,799 --> 02:19:01,949
really good research on things too who

3187
02:18:58,530 --> 02:19:05,159
guide investors and just saw a thing

3188
02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:07,349
recently they were looking at cannabis

3189
02:19:05,159 --> 02:19:11,250
companies as investment opportunities

3190
02:19:07,349 --> 02:19:14,670
and we're cautioning the folks who might

3191
02:19:11,250 --> 02:19:16,558
use their guidance that the problem with

3192
02:19:14,670 --> 02:19:17,159
cannabis as medicine is it actually

3193
02:19:16,558 --> 02:19:18,659
works

3194
02:19:17,159 --> 02:19:20,340
people don't it's not like

3195
02:19:18,659 --> 02:19:22,319
pharmaceuticals where you have to get it

3196
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:24,960
renewed every day and it gets really

3197
02:19:22,319 --> 02:19:27,439
insanely expensive in fact people can

3198
02:19:24,959 --> 02:19:32,789
grow their own and it's like a problem

3199
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:35,010
for big money worth looking for if it's

3200
02:19:32,790 --> 02:19:36,660
if you if that's an interesting topic to

3201
02:19:35,010 --> 02:19:40,019
you the other thing that I wanted to

3202
02:19:36,659 --> 02:19:42,179
throw in sort of an odd bit talking to a

3203
02:19:40,019 --> 02:19:48,139
friend who knows

3204
02:19:42,179 --> 02:19:50,489
researchers sorry sorry thank you

3205
02:19:48,139 --> 02:19:53,129
researchers that use at the University

3206
02:19:50,489 --> 02:19:55,439
of California down in Davis which is one

3207
02:19:53,129 --> 02:19:58,349
of the AG universities here in

3208
02:19:55,439 --> 02:20:02,069
California they're working with dairy

3209
02:19:58,350 --> 02:20:05,520
cows and they're under hemp they're

3210
02:20:02,069 --> 02:20:09,719
giving cannabis to cows to see what it

3211
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:11,880
does to them and the report is and this

3212
02:20:09,719 --> 02:20:15,049
is not published data yet but it's just

3213
02:20:11,879 --> 02:20:19,289
word of mouth not only are they seeing

3214
02:20:15,049 --> 02:20:21,929
increased milk production but even more

3215
02:20:19,290 --> 02:20:24,600
significantly they saw an unexpected

3216
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:28,229
side effect the cows are producing less

3217
02:20:24,600 --> 02:20:30,000
methane which is a greenhouse gas and I

3218
02:20:28,228 --> 02:20:32,010
think it's because the cow's digestive

3219
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:35,370
system is working better they're having

3220
02:20:32,010 --> 02:20:36,630
better gut health and so producing using

3221
02:20:35,370 --> 02:20:39,020
their food better and therefore

3222
02:20:36,629 --> 02:20:41,159
producing less methane and I think that

3223
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:43,100
over the next couple of years that's

3224
02:20:41,159 --> 02:20:44,879
going the whole conversation

3225
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:48,909
particularly as it relates to

3226
02:20:44,879 --> 02:20:50,949
agriculture is going to help normalize

3227
02:20:48,909 --> 02:20:53,469
just like the marcus was saying a minute

3228
02:20:50,950 --> 02:20:55,990
ago that first five acres started

3229
02:20:53,469 --> 02:20:58,359
changing the conversation in Vancouver I

3230
02:20:55,989 --> 02:20:59,560
think the same thing is happening in

3231
02:20:58,360 --> 02:21:04,030
California

3232
02:20:59,560 --> 02:21:05,949
despite the regulation mindset that's

3233
02:21:04,030 --> 02:21:11,530
really just another manifestation of

3234
02:21:05,950 --> 02:21:14,380
prohibition so yeah and meantime yeah

3235
02:21:11,530 --> 02:21:17,170
plant is insanely resilient and we are

3236
02:21:14,379 --> 02:21:23,020
all incredibly creative and determined

3237
02:21:17,170 --> 02:21:24,819
and it's a shame that California's legal

3238
02:21:23,021 --> 02:21:29,320
framework is playing out the way it is

3239
02:21:24,819 --> 02:21:33,610
and again I think that any of us that

3240
02:21:29,319 --> 02:21:36,369
are working with people who need this

3241
02:21:33,610 --> 02:21:40,060
plant in its various preparations as

3242
02:21:36,370 --> 02:21:43,750
medicine we can't stop doing what how do

3243
02:21:40,060 --> 02:21:47,351
you say no to a family that's seeing

3244
02:21:43,750 --> 02:21:49,510
benefit for their child if you have you

3245
02:21:47,351 --> 02:21:52,510
have to share you have to you have to

3246
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:59,260
make it available and as for the

3247
02:21:52,510 --> 02:22:03,219
corporate thing yeah it's as as Kirk was

3248
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:05,710
saying a corporation is just a way of

3249
02:22:03,219 --> 02:22:08,039
people associating together to do a

3250
02:22:05,709 --> 02:22:10,869
certain work the shame of corporates

3251
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:13,180
identity at the moment is it for the

3252
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:17,190
most practical purposes it's only about

3253
02:22:13,180 --> 02:22:21,550
making money for your shareholders so

3254
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:23,620
that's a thing that can be changed and

3255
02:22:21,549 --> 02:22:27,759
the plant is going to help with that

3256
02:22:23,620 --> 02:22:30,851
it's just yeah it's a shame what's

3257
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:36,280
happened in California and all across

3258
02:22:30,851 --> 02:22:37,870
the world we have to help the people who

3259
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:40,420
are writing the rules that don't know

3260
02:22:37,870 --> 02:22:43,240
anything about cannabis to understand

3261
02:22:40,420 --> 02:22:45,399
what went wrong in California so they

3262
02:22:43,239 --> 02:22:46,899
might get it closer to right and I think

3263
02:22:45,399 --> 02:22:49,239
it has everything to do with an

3264
02:22:46,899 --> 02:22:52,239
individual's right to cultivate their

3265
02:22:49,239 --> 02:22:56,709
cannabis as they see fit wherever they

3266
02:22:52,239 --> 02:22:59,619
are and there should be a supply chain

3267
02:22:56,709 --> 02:23:01,419
of where cultivars be they seeds or

3268
02:22:59,620 --> 02:23:02,590
clones are available for those

3269
02:23:01,420 --> 02:23:04,840
individuals to grow

3270
02:23:02,590 --> 02:23:07,148
what they need and information available

3271
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:10,569
about how to make their own medicine

3272
02:23:07,148 --> 02:23:14,039
and that way pharmaceutical companies

3273
02:23:10,569 --> 02:23:17,949
and governments cannot own this plant

3274
02:23:14,040 --> 02:23:19,479
every person should have the right and

3275
02:23:17,950 --> 02:23:21,159
you know to add something to what you're

3276
02:23:19,478 --> 02:23:23,889
saying wait is that you know if we're

3277
02:23:21,159 --> 02:23:26,379
feeding the cows hemp then the milk that

3278
02:23:23,889 --> 02:23:30,250
they're producing also has traces of CBD

3279
02:23:26,379 --> 02:23:34,449
a friend of ours did a study on feeding

3280
02:23:30,250 --> 02:23:37,420
his chickens 20% CBD and then tested the

3281
02:23:34,450 --> 02:23:40,540
egg yolks they had 3% CBD in it and

3282
02:23:37,420 --> 02:23:43,030
that's a way that we can actually start

3283
02:23:40,540 --> 02:23:44,590
getting cannabinoids into people and I

3284
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:46,720
think that that's really important and I

3285
02:23:44,590 --> 02:23:48,819
also wanted to address Hillary what you

3286
02:23:46,719 --> 02:23:52,358
were saying earlier is that it is

3287
02:23:48,819 --> 02:23:54,728
absolutely imperative for access around

3288
02:23:52,359 --> 02:23:57,550
the world right now I work in disaster

3289
02:23:54,728 --> 02:24:01,209
relief areas I work in Indonesia I've

3290
02:23:57,549 --> 02:24:04,269
worked in Haiti I've helped hundreds of

3291
02:24:01,209 --> 02:24:07,000
people dying and if I could just have

3292
02:24:04,270 --> 02:24:10,750
had and birthing and women in birthing

3293
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:12,670
situations and horrible trauma you know

3294
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:15,939
after the tsunami or after the

3295
02:24:12,670 --> 02:24:18,040
earthquake that happened and if I had

3296
02:24:15,939 --> 02:24:20,290
had cannabis things would have been

3297
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:22,450
incredibly different and I can't tell

3298
02:24:20,290 --> 02:24:24,970
you how many times that I wish that

3299
02:24:22,450 --> 02:24:27,250
these countries had safe access because

3300
02:24:24,969 --> 02:24:29,260
I know that we would be able to deal

3301
02:24:27,250 --> 02:24:32,770
with those issues and those traumatic

3302
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:34,960
situations in such a better way I mean

3303
02:24:32,770 --> 02:24:36,870
better is you know like what Valerie

3304
02:24:34,959 --> 02:24:41,019
said you know there's such a lack of

3305
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:42,880
words that I have in lieu of what this

3306
02:24:41,020 --> 02:24:44,890
plant provides I really don't

3307
02:24:42,879 --> 02:24:47,409
necessarily connect with the use of the

3308
02:24:44,889 --> 02:24:51,069
term drug either I really like the term

3309
02:24:47,409 --> 02:24:52,840
essential nutrient because it really is

3310
02:24:51,069 --> 02:24:55,719
an essential nutrient in our

3311
02:24:52,840 --> 02:24:57,760
neurological system and in the cows to

3312
02:24:55,719 --> 02:25:00,549
not produce methane or whatever it is

3313
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:03,189
and it it does have an effect on our

3314
02:25:00,549 --> 02:25:05,049
mind which you know it does put it into

3315
02:25:03,189 --> 02:25:06,850
a different category but you know how

3316
02:25:05,049 --> 02:25:09,489
you feel after you haven't eaten in a

3317
02:25:06,850 --> 02:25:11,380
while or different foods that

3318
02:25:09,489 --> 02:25:13,360
connect with our system so we like to

3319
02:25:11,379 --> 02:25:15,969
think of it as an essential nutrient and

3320
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:18,040
in that way it frees it up and allows us

3321
02:25:15,969 --> 02:25:21,760
to feed it to our animals and everything

3322
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:23,800
I mean it's a medicine or a drive I

3323
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:27,489
think where people confuse is that it's

3324
02:25:23,799 --> 02:25:29,739
not a narcotic you know in in that's

3325
02:25:27,489 --> 02:25:32,319
really where that confusion comes in

3326
02:25:29,739 --> 02:25:34,510
where we look at just kind of we've lost

3327
02:25:32,319 --> 02:25:36,219
the ability to you know with words and

3328
02:25:34,510 --> 02:25:38,469
definitions these days we see that on

3329
02:25:36,219 --> 02:25:41,228
Twitter and Facebook words don't have

3330
02:25:38,469 --> 02:25:43,239
meanings you know but yeah cannabis

3331
02:25:41,228 --> 02:25:45,459
isn't a narcotic in the way that these

3332
02:25:43,239 --> 02:25:46,750
these other drugs are but the benefit

3333
02:25:45,459 --> 02:25:49,209
that it can provide us amazing I mean

3334
02:25:46,750 --> 02:25:50,978
how think of the different world we'd be

3335
02:25:49,209 --> 02:25:53,439
living in ah I'll I'll get off the big

3336
02:25:50,978 --> 02:25:56,819
dreams topic for a moment but if we

3337
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:59,739
subsidize him like we did corn and

3338
02:25:56,819 --> 02:26:02,500
filled the Midwest with him instead of

3339
02:25:59,739 --> 02:26:04,840
corn and use that for livestock feed and

3340
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:07,090
use that for biofuels and use that for

3341
02:26:04,840 --> 02:26:09,190
other the the endless amount of

3342
02:26:07,090 --> 02:26:11,559
industries that him can be beneficial or

3343
02:26:09,190 --> 02:26:13,780
we would see that trickle into pretty

3344
02:26:11,559 --> 02:26:17,619
much every aspect of our life from our

3345
02:26:13,780 --> 02:26:19,989
food to our air to our water and up and

3346
02:26:17,620 --> 02:26:22,210
it would be you know that's a benefit

3347
02:26:19,989 --> 02:26:24,010
that it's it's amazing that it's just

3348
02:26:22,209 --> 02:26:25,959
not really something that is on the

3349
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:30,300
radar I would think if I was just

3350
02:26:25,959 --> 02:26:32,978
corporately minded that would be a big

3351
02:26:30,299 --> 02:26:34,420
motivator to get involved in those that

3352
02:26:32,978 --> 02:26:36,699
industry and really push that and

3353
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:38,829
luckily we've seen him added to the farm

3354
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:41,430
bill so we'll see but if we can start to

3355
02:26:38,829 --> 02:26:43,978
make this shift I mean in 30 years our

3356
02:26:41,430 --> 02:26:46,329
communities could look very different

3357
02:26:43,978 --> 02:26:48,609
than they do now

3358
02:26:46,329 --> 02:26:51,639
you know and in in every topic it's a

3359
02:26:48,610 --> 02:26:54,100
mate from global warming to our diets to

3360
02:26:51,639 --> 02:26:56,799
our health to our food a very different

3361
02:26:54,100 --> 02:26:59,050
world and that's where him looks it like

3362
02:26:56,799 --> 02:27:00,969
this big issue where it's you know

3363
02:26:59,049 --> 02:27:03,429
people say it's a miracle and it's not

3364
02:27:00,969 --> 02:27:05,829
magic well some believe it's magic I

3365
02:27:03,430 --> 02:27:09,040
don't know about magic it's it's but

3366
02:27:05,829 --> 02:27:11,680
it's one of the most amazing plants on

3367
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:13,810
the planet and its introduction into

3368
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:17,550
every aspect of our life can lead to

3369
02:27:13,809 --> 02:27:17,549
nothing but benefit

3370
02:27:19,310 --> 02:27:32,149
it's the only medicine with no lethal

3371
02:27:21,319 --> 02:27:38,181
dose and the best side-effect ever and

3372
02:27:32,149 --> 02:27:41,479
if mother or lover when we went to

3373
02:27:38,181 --> 02:27:43,819
Romania we went to a place where you

3374
02:27:41,479 --> 02:27:46,671
they used to grow hemp you know for the

3375
02:27:43,819 --> 02:27:49,369
as alive as a livelihood and they made

3376
02:27:46,671 --> 02:27:52,489
their clothes from it and they you know

3377
02:27:49,370 --> 02:27:55,931
they solder fodder fed their animals and

3378
02:27:52,489 --> 02:28:00,140
after the fall of the USSR in communism

3379
02:27:55,931 --> 02:28:03,140
they stopped subsidizing him in the in

3380
02:28:00,140 --> 02:28:06,020
the countryside and went towards you

3381
02:28:03,140 --> 02:28:07,609
know other types of farming and poly you

3382
02:28:06,021 --> 02:28:10,251
know to make the ropes and everything

3383
02:28:07,610 --> 02:28:11,721
that they were doing so when we went to

3384
02:28:10,251 --> 02:28:13,550
those parts of Romanians that were

3385
02:28:11,720 --> 02:28:16,220
growing him now there's the government

3386
02:28:13,550 --> 02:28:19,100
is just subsidizing to them to stack hay

3387
02:28:16,220 --> 02:28:22,130
and grow hay and have fields of hay so

3388
02:28:19,101 --> 02:28:23,721
it's it's interesting to see how it on

3389
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:26,449
earth we've gone through so many

3390
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:28,579
different cycles of ways that we you

3391
02:28:26,450 --> 02:28:31,251
know we've okayed it and not allocate it

3392
02:28:28,579 --> 02:28:32,960
and there there was amazing fabrics that

3393
02:28:31,251 --> 02:28:35,030
we saw there that people were still

3394
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:39,501
wearing that had been made you know 50

3395
02:28:35,030 --> 02:28:41,091
and 60 years ago and it was just it was

3396
02:28:39,501 --> 02:28:42,291
kind of frustrating to not see him

3397
02:28:41,091 --> 02:28:44,690
growing everywhere but it was

3398
02:28:42,290 --> 02:28:46,609
interesting to see how in and and that

3399
02:28:44,690 --> 02:28:48,530
system people were able to grow it and

3400
02:28:46,610 --> 02:28:51,409
it was subsidized by the government time

3401
02:28:48,530 --> 02:28:54,521
right here in the United States the

3402
02:28:51,409 --> 02:28:57,739
original copies that exist of the

3403
02:28:54,521 --> 02:29:02,841
Declaration of Independence are written

3404
02:28:57,739 --> 02:29:06,440
on paper made of him I think we're gonna

3405
02:29:02,841 --> 02:29:09,530
see hemp have a resurgence in the US

3406
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:12,021
with federal forms in place both in the

3407
02:29:09,530 --> 02:29:14,181
US and Canada I mean I think that you

3408
02:29:12,021 --> 02:29:18,351
know we've we've had that now category

3409
02:29:14,181 --> 02:29:23,810
switch where it's going to be of

3410
02:29:18,351 --> 02:29:25,280
interest to large economic drivers and

3411
02:29:23,810 --> 02:29:27,529
that and you know that's the other side

3412
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:29,659
of it is for hemp to sort of take off

3413
02:29:27,530 --> 02:29:32,120
and to be used for all these purposes

3414
02:29:29,659 --> 02:29:33,229
that we know it can be used for the

3415
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:34,971
reality of the world we live

3416
02:29:33,229 --> 02:29:37,761
there also has to be an economic case

3417
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:40,520
for that right because to grow millions

3418
02:29:37,761 --> 02:29:42,319
of hectares of plants and harvest them

3419
02:29:40,521 --> 02:29:45,141
and turn them into things requires

3420
02:29:42,319 --> 02:29:47,421
fairly significant infrastructure and a

3421
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:49,431
whole bunch of money and a whole bunch

3422
02:29:47,421 --> 02:29:53,421
of people and equipment and all of those

3423
02:29:49,431 --> 02:29:56,181
things and so that economic case has to

3424
02:29:53,421 --> 02:30:00,171
exist or the capital won't flow to the

3425
02:29:56,181 --> 02:30:01,671
activity and it won't occur I think it

3426
02:30:00,171 --> 02:30:03,890
does exist and I think we're gonna see

3427
02:30:01,671 --> 02:30:06,711
more and more of it start happening now

3428
02:30:03,890 --> 02:30:09,409
that some of the restrictions that our

3429
02:30:06,710 --> 02:30:10,029
laws have put into place are falling

3430
02:30:09,409 --> 02:30:12,829
away

3431
02:30:10,030 --> 02:30:15,051
well after 23 years of growing hemp in

3432
02:30:12,829 --> 02:30:18,530
Canada and hemp oil and hemp hearts

3433
02:30:15,050 --> 02:30:21,199
being really like 95 percent maybe more

3434
02:30:18,530 --> 02:30:23,091
I was just in one of the largest hemp

3435
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:25,101
processing facilities in Manitoba

3436
02:30:23,091 --> 02:30:27,620
recently when I was there for a hemp

3437
02:30:25,101 --> 02:30:29,841
conference and meeting with farmers all

3438
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:32,030
the farmers their value is this is the

3439
02:30:29,841 --> 02:30:35,360
essential amino acid rich seed oil and

3440
02:30:32,030 --> 02:30:37,730
the hemp parts and the protein powder

3441
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:40,461
isolates that come from the seed cakes

3442
02:30:37,729 --> 02:30:43,341
after they've been cold-pressed and

3443
02:30:40,460 --> 02:30:44,840
there you just you don't see you know

3444
02:30:43,341 --> 02:30:47,271
what when we approached our minister it

3445
02:30:44,841 --> 02:30:49,370
was really about these 50,000 commercial

3446
02:30:47,271 --> 02:30:51,230
products all these amazing products that

3447
02:30:49,370 --> 02:30:53,181
you could make from it and we really

3448
02:30:51,229 --> 02:30:56,149
quickly learned as well that it was it

3449
02:30:53,181 --> 02:30:57,950
was the and it's I believe it's passed

3450
02:30:56,149 --> 02:30:59,750
hundreds of millions I believe it's in

3451
02:30:57,950 --> 02:31:01,610
the billions of dollars of

3452
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:05,120
infrastructure that are required for

3453
02:31:01,610 --> 02:31:07,730
these things to exist and it was kind of

3454
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:09,561
utopian us of us to think otherwise they

3455
02:31:07,729 --> 02:31:11,239
just kept it illegal for so long and

3456
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:13,431
allowed all these other technologies to

3457
02:31:11,239 --> 02:31:14,931
take the place to deal with the plants

3458
02:31:13,431 --> 02:31:17,841
that they were processing whether it be

3459
02:31:14,931 --> 02:31:20,750
caught in your flax or whatever and so

3460
02:31:17,841 --> 02:31:23,239
hemp just was so far behind that it's

3461
02:31:20,750 --> 02:31:25,640
managed to I could really see the CBD

3462
02:31:23,239 --> 02:31:27,500
thing the cannabinoid thing being able

3463
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:29,479
to grow monomolecular medicines maybe

3464
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:32,239
not the highest quality full plant

3465
02:31:29,479 --> 02:31:35,869
spectrum but for producing monomolecular

3466
02:31:32,239 --> 02:31:37,550
medicines like CBD and THC that you

3467
02:31:35,870 --> 02:31:40,221
wouldn't be able to grow at any cheaper

3468
02:31:37,550 --> 02:31:42,260
and that would allow potentially for

3469
02:31:40,220 --> 02:31:44,029
farmers to make you know the kind of

3470
02:31:42,261 --> 02:31:45,120
money and producers and processors to

3471
02:31:44,030 --> 02:31:46,470
make the kind of money

3472
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:47,910
they could then turn around and put

3473
02:31:46,469 --> 02:31:50,429
their money where their mouth is and say

3474
02:31:47,909 --> 02:31:53,459
yeah we want to start a plastics program

3475
02:31:50,430 --> 02:31:54,989
with the hemp seed husks from the seed

3476
02:31:53,459 --> 02:31:57,089
or the and some of the fiber and

3477
02:31:54,989 --> 02:31:59,549
cellulose or we want to start a paper

3478
02:31:57,090 --> 02:32:03,060
projector doing things that you know

3479
02:31:59,549 --> 02:32:05,639
would require this infrastructure on a

3480
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:08,940
very it's it's big infrastructure it is

3481
02:32:05,639 --> 02:32:12,000
not small I think just a tie a bow on

3482
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:15,870
all that so what this conversation shows

3483
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:19,590
me is is that there is really no limit

3484
02:32:15,870 --> 02:32:22,351
to social good opportunities if you want

3485
02:32:19,590 --> 02:32:24,601
to work with with cannabis in him you

3486
02:32:22,351 --> 02:32:25,980
know you know we focus on I focus on

3487
02:32:24,601 --> 02:32:29,790
patients a lot of the people here are

3488
02:32:25,979 --> 02:32:32,100
patient focused but the ability as far

3489
02:32:29,790 --> 02:32:35,220
as I'm concerned having a cannabis into

3490
02:32:32,101 --> 02:32:37,260
your organization you take your pick

3491
02:32:35,219 --> 02:32:39,510
there's no shortage of things that you

3492
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:41,729
can do and if and if you're choosing not

3493
02:32:39,510 --> 02:32:44,280
to you know hey that's everybody's right

3494
02:32:41,729 --> 02:32:47,310
but I don't think it's in the spirit of

3495
02:32:44,280 --> 02:32:50,101
cannabis our community in our culture

3496
02:32:47,310 --> 02:32:52,500
when there's so much in the world that

3497
02:32:50,101 --> 02:32:54,569
this plant and business with this plant

3498
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:56,940
has the opportunity to affect you know

3499
02:32:54,569 --> 02:32:59,489
from plastics to regenerative

3500
02:32:56,940 --> 02:33:01,101
agriculture to you know you know

3501
02:32:59,489 --> 02:33:04,199
eliminating need for other dangerous

3502
02:33:01,101 --> 02:33:06,900
industries patient care you know really

3503
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:09,271
take your pick just have that thought in

3504
02:33:06,899 --> 02:33:10,949
the front of your mind is so while I do

3505
02:33:09,271 --> 02:33:12,420
this what am I looking to impact what

3506
02:33:10,950 --> 02:33:14,700
benefit do I want to bring to the

3507
02:33:12,420 --> 02:33:18,000
community more than just financial gain

3508
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:21,061
and I think that's something that if we

3509
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:23,940
can put as part of the culture and in

3510
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:27,329
the conversations you know I don't come

3511
02:33:23,940 --> 02:33:29,250
out of it oh look who's here um I think

3512
02:33:27,329 --> 02:33:31,170
that it's really interesting too is that

3513
02:33:29,250 --> 02:33:33,209
you know talking about large AG we're

3514
02:33:31,170 --> 02:33:36,360
talking about corn industry or the

3515
02:33:33,209 --> 02:33:38,549
soybean industry and you know tobacco or

3516
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:40,771
you know even the forest industry and

3517
02:33:38,549 --> 02:33:43,859
how it's taken over you know this plant

3518
02:33:40,771 --> 02:33:46,650
is an adaptogen it is a master plan it

3519
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:49,140
has the ability to think past that a lot

3520
02:33:46,649 --> 02:33:51,149
of these plants are not master plants in

3521
02:33:49,139 --> 02:33:53,399
the same way they can be controlled and

3522
02:33:51,149 --> 02:33:55,279
we've seen it over and over again and

3523
02:33:53,399 --> 02:33:58,090
like I'd like to think that the people

3524
02:33:55,280 --> 02:34:00,159
that are supporting this plant are

3525
02:33:58,090 --> 02:34:03,398
so adaptogenic and I think that we have

3526
02:34:00,159 --> 02:34:05,049
vast amounts of ability to move forward

3527
02:34:03,398 --> 02:34:06,579
in this industry and we're seeing a

3528
02:34:05,049 --> 02:34:08,409
resurgence in hemp we're seeing a

3529
02:34:06,579 --> 02:34:11,139
resurgence in cannabis because that's

3530
02:34:08,409 --> 02:34:14,170
the nature of an adaptogen that's what

3531
02:34:11,139 --> 02:34:16,180
adaptogens do and I see that also within

3532
02:34:14,170 --> 02:34:18,639
this community we are in adaptogenic

3533
02:34:16,180 --> 02:34:20,829
community and we're not going away and I

3534
02:34:18,639 --> 02:34:23,199
believe that you know to tie a bow on it

3535
02:34:20,829 --> 02:34:25,420
as well in this conversation is that all

3536
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:27,640
of these people here on this panel are

3537
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:29,950
incredible adaptogens and we're all

3538
02:34:27,639 --> 02:34:32,319
moving forward to make a change in this

3539
02:34:29,950 --> 02:34:35,050
industry but also to make a change in

3540
02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:38,170
the world and I just have faith but the

3541
02:34:35,049 --> 02:34:40,659
plant is going to continue to show her

3542
02:34:38,170 --> 02:34:43,210
face over and over again all over the

3543
02:34:40,659 --> 02:34:46,450
planet and whatever we can do to help

3544
02:34:43,209 --> 02:34:48,879
guide her and help aid her in that path

3545
02:34:46,450 --> 02:34:51,729
is what we need to do you know I had a

3546
02:34:48,879 --> 02:34:54,309
conversation many years ago with ROM

3547
02:34:51,728 --> 02:34:57,489
Dobbs and he was sitting backstage

3548
02:34:54,309 --> 02:34:59,590
somewhere it was all by himself and and

3549
02:34:57,489 --> 02:35:00,939
I had to do bees in my pocket and I was

3550
02:34:59,590 --> 02:35:01,659
like oh this is an incredible

3551
02:35:00,939 --> 02:35:03,850
opportunity

3552
02:35:01,659 --> 02:35:05,799
well three hours later after the

3553
02:35:03,850 --> 02:35:08,739
conversation what I really picked up out

3554
02:35:05,799 --> 02:35:10,750
of that conversation is that he made the

3555
02:35:08,739 --> 02:35:14,079
differentiation between the pointer and

3556
02:35:10,750 --> 02:35:17,559
the moon all of us are pointers and the

3557
02:35:14,079 --> 02:35:20,109
moon is the plant so how is it that we

3558
02:35:17,559 --> 02:35:22,148
can continue to point at the moon so

3559
02:35:20,109 --> 02:35:26,620
that she can move forward and an adopter

3560
02:35:22,148 --> 02:35:28,449
genic way to change the world beautiful

3561
02:35:26,620 --> 02:35:31,960
thanks for sharing Kelly and welcome

3562
02:35:28,450 --> 02:35:35,290
skunk man Sam I like I like the new

3563
02:35:31,959 --> 02:35:43,509
angle I like I see he's on the sort of

3564
02:35:35,290 --> 02:35:47,260
couch now I can hear you you are there

3565
02:35:43,510 --> 02:35:49,210
or or here it depends on how you look at

3566
02:35:47,260 --> 02:35:51,989
it are you the moon or are you the

3567
02:35:49,209 --> 02:35:54,879
pointer you're definitely the pointer

3568
02:35:51,989 --> 02:35:57,939
because I was out having dinner with my

3569
02:35:54,879 --> 02:35:59,079
oh well wonderful we wouldn't want to

3570
02:35:57,939 --> 02:36:01,600
keep you from that we've just been

3571
02:35:59,079 --> 02:36:04,299

3572
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:07,510

3582
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:46,930
comes into to play during this season

3583
02:36:40,719 --> 02:36:53,528

3586
02:36:58,750 --> 02:37:05,290
did Sam accidentally show part of his

3587
02:37:01,148 --> 02:37:07,809
chin on on hash Church kind of stepped

3588
02:37:05,290 --> 02:37:09,729
into the town still living that down I

3589
02:37:07,809 --> 02:37:13,648
thought I thought we got a little arm

3590
02:37:09,728 --> 02:37:17,408

3596
02:37:38,978 --> 02:37:43,898

I'm just so taken by your beauty I just

3598
02:37:43,898 --> 02:37:49,059

3599
02:37:45,939 --> 02:37:53,318
thank you it's great to see you great to

3600
02:37:49,059 --> 02:37:55,090
connect hash Church it's where we

3601
02:37:53,318 --> 02:37:56,648
connect there's you know there's

3602
02:37:55,090 --> 02:37:58,568
hundreds of people and they're watching

3603
02:37:56,648 --> 02:37:59,500
and listening to what we're saying and

3604
02:37:58,568 --> 02:38:02,648
they're also having their own

3605
02:37:59,500 --> 02:38:05,920
conversation over on YouTube and I have

3606
02:38:02,648 --> 02:38:08,228
to say aside from the odd troll a good

3607
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:10,299
group of people in there really you can

3608
02:38:08,228 --> 02:38:12,698
kind of read the the real-time

3609
02:38:10,299 --> 02:38:15,250
inspiration that's occurring after

3610
02:38:12,699 --> 02:38:17,470
things are said and it's it's great that

3611
02:38:15,250 --> 02:38:19,148
our conversation of course the purpose

3612
02:38:17,469 --> 02:38:21,278
of this conversation is to continue

3613
02:38:19,148 --> 02:38:23,500
other conversations and to create action

3614
02:38:21,279 --> 02:38:26,040
and so it's neat to be able to just see

3615
02:38:23,500 --> 02:38:28,319
some of the you know maybe a hundred or

3616
02:38:26,040 --> 02:38:30,330
200 of the 5 or 600 that are watching at

3617
02:38:28,319 --> 02:38:32,489
any given time are just having this

3618
02:38:30,329 --> 02:38:35,430
conversation you can see that spark in

3619
02:38:32,489 --> 02:38:36,989
real time being ignited and obviously

3620
02:38:35,430 --> 02:38:39,389
there's a bunch of it that we can't see

3621
02:38:36,989 --> 02:38:41,850
but this definitely feels like it's the

3622
02:38:39,389 --> 02:38:45,119
good work I always you know this channel

3623
02:38:41,850 --> 02:38:47,250
I've always said it I've it's it's kind

3624
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:50,490
of the metaphor of the of the corporate

3625
02:38:47,250 --> 02:38:53,579
greed versus the grassroots and so for

3626
02:38:50,489 --> 02:38:55,860
me once again always sort of seeing that

3627
02:38:53,579 --> 02:38:58,319
group of pioneers that have really

3628
02:38:55,860 --> 02:39:01,950
brought this for what I consider the the

3629
02:38:58,319 --> 02:39:05,159
truest most righteous reasons has

3630
02:39:01,950 --> 02:39:06,930
allowed me to do that with the channel

3631
02:39:05,159 --> 02:39:09,271
and not just make the channel about me

3632
02:39:06,930 --> 02:39:11,010
and try to promote my products and make

3633
02:39:09,271 --> 02:39:13,409
sales but be like how can I make this

3634
02:39:11,010 --> 02:39:15,569
channel like better and in the last

3635
02:39:13,409 --> 02:39:18,959
month this channel has gotten over a

3636
02:39:15,569 --> 02:39:22,229
million and a 1.1 million views in the

3637
02:39:18,959 --> 02:39:24,989
last 28 days on this channel so yeah

3638
02:39:22,229 --> 02:39:27,989
yeah that's a lot of views like that so

3639
02:39:24,989 --> 02:39:30,600
that's my truth Marcus you get a dollar

3640
02:39:27,989 --> 02:39:33,360
for every viewer you know what they

3641
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:36,569
actually they actually paid me nine

3642
02:39:33,360 --> 02:39:40,710
hundred and seventy dollars for last

3643
02:39:36,569 --> 02:39:43,500
month's episode but I'm happy to donate

3644
02:39:40,709 --> 02:39:47,909
it to to WAM and to the clad Reyes

3645
02:39:43,500 --> 02:39:50,850
Network and I have no idea you know that

3646
02:39:47,909 --> 02:39:52,709
I've monetized my channel for a listen I

3647
02:39:50,850 --> 02:39:55,500
used to work for a YouTube monetization

3648
02:39:52,709 --> 02:39:57,209
company and I went to Jamaica and my

3649
02:39:55,500 --> 02:39:58,920
thing was to explain to my Jamaican

3650
02:39:57,209 --> 02:40:00,569
artists friends and have many who have

3651
02:39:58,920 --> 02:40:02,819
been ripped off by producers and this

3652
02:40:00,569 --> 02:40:05,430
that and the other thing offer them a

3653
02:40:02,819 --> 02:40:07,949
way to create revenue when people are

3654
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:09,899
listening to their music and so I turned

3655
02:40:07,950 --> 02:40:11,700
a bunch of them onto it including toots

3656
02:40:09,899 --> 02:40:13,079
from toots and the Maytals

3657
02:40:11,700 --> 02:40:14,850
I signed a bunch of these different

3658
02:40:13,079 --> 02:40:16,440
bands and it was a no-brainer it's like

3659
02:40:14,850 --> 02:40:18,360
listen people are already listening

3660
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:20,880
YouTube is where young people go to

3661
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:22,650
listen to music and after learning in

3662
02:40:20,879 --> 02:40:24,359
teaching them about why wouldn't you

3663
02:40:22,649 --> 02:40:27,479
monetize your channel to do whatever

3664
02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:28,890
weather soldiers of Jah army they didn't

3665
02:40:27,479 --> 02:40:31,590
want to monetize their channel I said

3666
02:40:28,889 --> 02:40:33,359
listen monetize it and donate the money

3667
02:40:31,590 --> 02:40:35,819
you guys are losing hundreds of

3668
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:38,310
thousands of dollars over the many many

3669
02:40:35,819 --> 02:40:40,979
tens and 20s and 30 million views your

3670
02:40:38,309 --> 02:40:44,279
videos get and also convince them to do

3671
02:40:40,979 --> 02:40:45,840
it so it was it taught me in a sense

3672
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:48,870
that it would make no sense not to

3673
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:52,049
monetize my channel but at the same time

3674
02:40:48,870 --> 02:40:55,170
do good things with that monetization

3675
02:40:52,049 --> 02:40:57,270
gives people that support the message of

3676
02:40:55,170 --> 02:41:00,149
the artist or the content creator a way

3677
02:40:57,271 --> 02:41:03,271
to thank them and support them for

3678
02:41:00,149 --> 02:41:04,829
creating the content right mm-hmm my

3679
02:41:03,271 --> 02:41:07,489
kids sort of do a lot of YouTube

3680
02:41:04,829 --> 02:41:11,250
watching and twitch watching as well so

3681
02:41:07,489 --> 02:41:13,619
I've sort of looked into this this this

3682
02:41:11,250 --> 02:41:17,639
this sort of phenomenon of sort of

3683
02:41:13,620 --> 02:41:20,190
self-directed economic activity where

3684
02:41:17,639 --> 02:41:22,559
there's only a small intermediary

3685
02:41:20,190 --> 02:41:26,250
between the artist or the content

3686
02:41:22,559 --> 02:41:27,719
creator and the ultimate consumer or the

3687
02:41:26,250 --> 02:41:29,969
wants to help them and that's it's

3688
02:41:27,719 --> 02:41:31,409
pretty fascinating because there's a you

3689
02:41:29,969 --> 02:41:34,760
know you all these things are available

3690
02:41:31,409 --> 02:41:37,739
free but you can also choose to

3691
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:41,309
economically support those people and

3692
02:41:37,739 --> 02:41:42,750
and lots of people make that choice I

3693
02:41:41,309 --> 02:41:45,779
think that's that's kind of wonderful to

3694
02:41:42,750 --> 02:41:47,430
have that ability oh you know I haven't

3695
02:41:45,780 --> 02:41:49,890
shared this but you know I don't think

3696
02:41:47,430 --> 02:41:52,889
people realize how big of an impact can

3697
02:41:49,889 --> 02:41:55,709
be had you know with very little you

3698
02:41:52,889 --> 02:41:57,689
know monetary donation which is which is

3699
02:41:55,709 --> 02:41:59,609
why you know when get back to you know

3700
02:41:57,690 --> 02:42:01,340

above ground for a little over two years

3709
02:42:14,459 --> 02:42:21,000
now and in that time because we're being

3710

shut down in a few weeks where we're

3711

giving everything we can out to families

3712
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:28,980
to help tide them over until we can get

3713
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:33,720
the laws changed we looking at our books

3714
02:42:28,979 --> 02:42:36,899
you know we have donated in the last two

3715
02:42:33,719 --> 02:42:39,119
years at this point we're at about nine

3716
02:42:36,899 --> 02:42:41,819
hundred and fifty six thousand dollars

3717
02:42:39,120 --> 02:42:44,430
worth of Medicine you know I think my

3718
02:42:41,819 --> 02:42:46,079
goal by the by January 9th when the

3719
02:42:44,430 --> 02:42:47,130
collective model ends at California is

3720
02:42:46,079 --> 02:42:49,770
we're going to top over a million

3721
02:42:47,129 --> 02:42:51,379
dollars worth of donations to families

3722
02:42:49,770 --> 02:42:53,780
that is with

3723
02:42:51,379 --> 02:42:55,819
monetary donations to the khalad race

3724
02:42:53,780 --> 02:43:00,290
network for the last two years being

3725
02:42:55,819 --> 02:43:04,159
under $12,000 so with less than 12 grand

3726
02:43:00,290 --> 02:43:07,490
and some community volunteers in an

3727
02:43:04,159 --> 02:43:10,010
amazing cannabis community we've been

3728
02:43:07,489 --> 02:43:11,869
able to donate over a million or will we

3729
02:43:10,010 --> 02:43:16,100

3730
02:43:11,870 --> 02:43:19,670
million dollars by January knives worth

3731
02:43:16,100 --> 02:43:21,800
of medication to families and so you

3732
02:43:19,670 --> 02:43:23,569
know I just I share that and I haven't

3733
02:43:21,799 --> 02:43:27,379
shared this in the past because if to me

3734
02:43:23,569 --> 02:43:28,850
it sounds a little Diigo century but but

3735
02:43:27,379 --> 02:43:29,659
a lot of people wonder like does this do

3736
02:43:28,850 --> 02:43:31,430
any good

3737
02:43:29,659 --> 02:43:33,139
you know the people putting little

3738
02:43:31,430 --> 02:43:35,569
donations up here at hash church are

3739
02:43:33,139 --> 02:43:38,180
donating the way more these others it's

3740
02:43:35,569 --> 02:43:41,119
amazing the amount of benefit that comes

3741
02:43:38,180 --> 02:43:43,460
out of every nickel that is donated to

3742
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:45,470
some of these nonprofits and I just want

3743
02:43:43,459 --> 02:43:47,029
to know that everything that people have

3744
02:43:45,469 --> 02:43:50,539
done to support us over the last two

3745
02:43:47,030 --> 02:43:52,310
years has paid off significantly for the

3746
02:43:50,540 --> 02:43:56,510
people that we were were hoping to help

3747
02:43:52,309 --> 02:43:59,209
and I just want to see that that that

3748
02:43:56,510 --> 02:44:00,950
attitude continue to move forward in

3749
02:43:59,209 --> 02:44:03,679
every state in the United States and

3750
02:44:00,950 --> 02:44:06,530
Canada because these programs Hillary's

3751
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:09,050
and others that are that are instituting

3752
02:44:06,530 --> 02:44:11,560
social good programs in there they need

3753
02:44:09,049 --> 02:44:14,449
the support and when you do support them

3754
02:44:11,559 --> 02:44:16,459
it pays off and we were really shocked

3755
02:44:14,450 --> 02:44:18,229
to see the numbers the the we had once

3756
02:44:16,459 --> 02:44:21,978
we finally went into the books and

3757
02:44:18,228 --> 02:44:24,920
looked at everything congratulations for

3758
02:44:21,978 --> 02:44:26,898
us that's amazing we can none of us can

3759
02:44:24,920 --> 02:44:29,420
do it without you excuse me Kirk right

3760
02:44:26,898 --> 02:44:32,109
none of us could do it without all of

3761
02:44:29,420 --> 02:44:36,620
you no it's not we don't do this alone

3762
02:44:32,110 --> 02:44:39,470
it never has been alone so even in even

3763
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:41,810
it's with the opportunity to hold on

3764
02:44:39,469 --> 02:44:45,739
just a little bit of noise in my I hope

3765
02:44:41,809 --> 02:44:48,260
and given the opportunity to serve one

3766
02:44:45,739 --> 02:44:52,489
another and being able to you know and I

3767
02:44:48,260 --> 02:44:55,398
appreciate your kindness toward me but

3768
02:44:52,489 --> 02:44:59,799
it's never been done alone it's always

3769
02:44:55,398 --> 02:45:03,129
been a massive movement with all of us

3770
02:44:59,799 --> 02:45:04,909
holding our place and holding the line

3771
02:45:03,129 --> 02:45:09,770
and

3772
02:45:04,909 --> 02:45:13,729
because the Oh cannabis awareness is a

3773
02:45:09,771 --> 02:45:17,030
movement already and plant healing and

3774
02:45:13,729 --> 02:45:19,879
the sacred plants healing us allowing us

3775
02:45:17,030 --> 02:45:24,050
the opportunity to use them for our own

3776
02:45:19,879 --> 02:45:28,129
benefit and I think as well for their

3777
02:45:24,049 --> 02:45:32,149
benefit it makes a huge front it makes a

3778
02:45:28,129 --> 02:45:34,640
profound impact being able to serve

3779
02:45:32,149 --> 02:45:38,180
people at their greatest time of need is

3780
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:41,390
a massive reward so whatever money and I

3781
02:45:38,180 --> 02:45:45,200
know that that you agree with this

3782
02:45:41,390 --> 02:45:47,989
forest at ten he's not here right now

3783
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:51,220
but all of us who every one of us here

3784
02:45:47,989 --> 02:45:54,680
who shares that's a such a rich reward

3785
02:45:51,219 --> 02:45:58,429
powerful and while we do need to pay

3786
02:45:54,680 --> 02:46:00,829
rent and um you know I know differently

3787
02:45:58,430 --> 02:46:05,420
now so it's like I don't have my land

3788
02:46:00,829 --> 02:46:08,659
anymore that the the really profound

3789
02:46:05,420 --> 02:46:13,190
impact is something that lasts forever

3790
02:46:08,659 --> 02:46:15,140
and touches everybody so we really have

3791
02:46:13,190 --> 02:46:18,710

3832
02:47:59,238 --> 02:48:04,818

02:48:13,728 --> 02:48:17,538

3838
02:48:15,978 --> 02:48:19,938
that are cannabis laws were built upon

3839
02:48:17,539 --> 02:48:23,180

3845
02:48:33,738 --> 02:48:39,109

3856
02:48:58,309 --> 02:49:03,648
difficult to tell a family know for

daughter's in Hospice we heard about

3861
02:49:09,049 --> 02:49:12,919
your organization the doctors say that

3862
02:49:10,728 --> 02:49:14,448
might be the only thing they could save

3863
02:49:12,918 --> 02:49:16,488
her she's not expected to live

3864
02:49:14,449 --> 02:49:20,390
throughout the week and have they well

3865
02:49:16,488 --> 02:49:21,948
were being shut down so I cannot stress

3866
02:49:20,389 --> 02:49:23,809
enough how important it is for the

3867
02:49:21,949 --> 02:49:25,551
community's help to continue this

3868
02:49:23,809 --> 02:49:29,399
message

3869
02:49:25,550 --> 02:49:30,539
senator Weiner in California is going to

3870
02:49:29,399 --> 02:49:32,431
be reentry announced that he's

3871
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:34,070
reintroducing the compassion legislation

3872
02:49:32,431 --> 02:49:36,511
that I and others have been working on

3873
02:49:34,069 --> 02:49:39,000
for two or three years now that was

3874
02:49:36,511 --> 02:49:41,569
vetoed by the government by Governor

3875
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:44,370
Jerry Brown put us in this bad situation

3876
02:49:41,569 --> 02:49:47,279
we're gonna need support is that gets

3877
02:49:44,370 --> 02:49:49,471
closer to coming to fruition again this

3878
02:49:47,280 --> 02:49:52,200
legislative season it's just I just want

3879
02:49:49,470 --> 02:49:56,069
to keep keep the hope alive donations

3880
02:49:52,200 --> 02:49:58,980
support spreading the message you know

3881
02:49:56,069 --> 02:50:01,979
anything you guys can do there will

3882
02:49:58,979 --> 02:50:05,789
literally translate into saving lives

3883
02:50:01,979 --> 02:50:08,970
the adults in cases like Wham and weed

3884
02:50:05,790 --> 02:50:11,131
for warriors children in cases you know

3885
02:50:08,970 --> 02:50:13,709
like the clad routes Network it's not a

3886
02:50:11,130 --> 02:50:15,239
it's not a feel-good exaggeration

3887
02:50:13,709 --> 02:50:16,340
talking point hey and we're gonna save

3888
02:50:15,239 --> 02:50:18,989
lives

3889
02:50:16,341 --> 02:50:22,470
for some of us we see it every day it's

3890
02:50:18,989 --> 02:50:24,149
very literal it's tangible you see the

3891
02:50:22,470 --> 02:50:26,819
eyes of the parents and the mother

3892
02:50:24,149 --> 02:50:31,500
you see the death you get invitations to

3893
02:50:26,819 --> 02:50:36,390
the funerals it's real and it's just

3894
02:50:31,500 --> 02:50:39,300
heartbreaking that it's um it's on the

3895
02:50:36,390 --> 02:50:42,479
back burner but with with the help of

3896
02:50:39,300 --> 02:50:49,489
you know communities like this we can

3897
02:50:42,479 --> 02:50:49,489
make a real impact Bravo

3898
02:50:50,479 --> 02:50:56,270
sorry I don't mean to get too heavy it's

3899
02:50:52,739 --> 02:51:03,360
just you know it really is it's been

3900
02:50:56,271 --> 02:51:05,551
quite an experience the last I mean the

3901
02:51:03,360 --> 02:51:09,900
truth of it is is the reason why people

3902
02:51:05,550 --> 02:51:14,789
like Marcus and I have been healthy so

3903
02:51:09,899 --> 02:51:18,359
much is for people like you and the

3904
02:51:14,790 --> 02:51:23,580
benefit vinod got me is I want cannabis

3905
02:51:18,360 --> 02:51:27,780
to be legalized for people everywhere

3906
02:51:23,579 --> 02:51:32,601
and yeah you're definitely a big part of

3907
02:51:27,780 --> 02:51:32,601
that so

3908
02:51:32,978 --> 02:51:41,528
what so movie is what do you think what

3909
02:51:39,939 --> 02:51:43,029
do you think of being silenced to being

3910
02:51:41,529 --> 02:51:46,479
shut down of all the people that you

3911
02:51:43,029 --> 02:51:48,908
can't reach it feels it's it's

3912
02:51:46,478 --> 02:51:51,760
disempowering it it feels hopeless now I

3913
02:51:48,908 --> 02:51:54,760
know that you don't believe that I know

3914
02:51:51,760 --> 02:51:58,748
that there is a way to for us

3915
02:51:54,760 --> 02:52:02,318
collectively together to serve and to

3916
02:51:58,748 --> 02:52:05,139
find an answer to this to this

3917
02:52:02,318 --> 02:52:06,850
particular problem that's profound and

3918
02:52:05,139 --> 02:52:10,889
it's right at the very top of the list

3919
02:52:06,850 --> 02:52:13,479
because if tomorrow or January first

3920
02:52:10,889 --> 02:52:15,998
people are not served if lives are not

3921
02:52:13,478 --> 02:52:18,278
saved because of restrictions that are

3922
02:52:15,998 --> 02:52:20,949
just unjust and absolutely they're

3923
02:52:18,279 --> 02:52:23,020
meaningless so yes there's risk involved

3924
02:52:20,949 --> 02:52:25,239
but there's always some risk involved in

3925
02:52:23,020 --> 02:52:27,939
doing what's what's good and what's

3926
02:52:25,238 --> 02:52:31,270
right because that is not at the it is

3927
02:52:27,939 --> 02:52:33,670
not the driven by profits like imagine

3928
02:52:31,270 --> 02:52:35,670
that you had so much good you couldn't

3929
02:52:33,670 --> 02:52:38,289
even count it or spend it I mean

3930
02:52:35,670 --> 02:52:39,818
everything that if you did it every

3931
02:52:38,289 --> 02:52:41,350
moment of every single day for the rest

3932
02:52:39,818 --> 02:52:44,288
of your life and every other lifetime

3933
02:52:41,350 --> 02:52:46,748
you possibly could get so so that's the

3934
02:52:44,289 --> 02:52:51,939
goal and that's the work and trust that

3935
02:52:46,748 --> 02:52:56,289
you are in you have comrades and that

3936
02:52:51,939 --> 02:52:58,748
that will help in that the issue the

3937
02:52:56,289 --> 02:53:01,420
point that I'm trying to that we are

3938
02:52:58,748 --> 02:53:04,299
trying to do with Wham is to expand it

3939
02:53:01,420 --> 02:53:08,020
to become ever more inclusive because

3940
02:53:04,299 --> 02:53:09,608
always we've been for 25 years our work

3941
02:53:08,020 --> 02:53:11,859
has been done through attrition you know

3942
02:53:09,609 --> 02:53:13,840
come in who's the sickest how do you

3943
02:53:11,859 --> 02:53:18,090
weigh those things like who's suffering

3944
02:53:13,840 --> 02:53:20,949
do you wait suffering and access so we

3945
02:53:18,090 --> 02:53:22,568
just trust that we'll find a way to do

3946
02:53:20,949 --> 02:53:26,408
this and you and I will just talk

3947
02:53:22,568 --> 02:53:28,559
privately and about what is profoundly

3948
02:53:26,408 --> 02:53:31,840
important human human life and

3949
02:53:28,559 --> 02:53:35,469
diminishing suffering and the life of

3950
02:53:31,840 --> 02:53:38,109
the very planet that we are consuming

3951
02:53:35,469 --> 02:53:43,078
for for our own benefit and how we

3952
02:53:38,109 --> 02:53:46,078
create balance in in that exercise of

3953
02:53:43,078 --> 02:53:46,078
kindness

3954
02:53:46,620 --> 02:53:54,430
yeah looking forward to seeing what how

3955
02:53:52,239 --> 02:53:56,500
we're all gonna move forward because

3956
02:53:54,430 --> 02:53:58,360
because you know that you know there's

3957
02:53:56,500 --> 02:54:00,430
no stopping there's just there's no

3958
02:53:58,360 --> 02:54:03,040
choice to stop it's not a it wasn't a

3959
02:54:00,430 --> 02:54:04,960
choice for me to get involved in this

3960
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:08,260
although I'm glad in a lot of ways that

3961
02:54:04,959 --> 02:54:11,709
I did but it was illness that brought me

3962
02:54:08,260 --> 02:54:13,479
here like so many others and that's not

3963
02:54:11,709 --> 02:54:17,379
going away because the law has changed

3964
02:54:13,479 --> 02:54:23,049
and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let my

3965
02:54:17,379 --> 02:54:26,979
son go without because of the law and if

3966
02:54:23,049 --> 02:54:28,659
I'm working to help my son then how

3967
02:54:26,979 --> 02:54:30,489
could I not help others that comes kind

3968
02:54:28,659 --> 02:54:32,590
of have a class reset work started we

3969
02:54:30,489 --> 02:54:34,719
had some community gardens couple

3970
02:54:32,590 --> 02:54:35,979
parents saw reports in the newspaper and

3971
02:54:34,719 --> 02:54:37,389
other things they said hey could you

3972
02:54:35,979 --> 02:54:41,170
help us and say how do you how do you

3973
02:54:37,389 --> 02:54:43,299
not right so I'm excited to see kind of

3974
02:54:41,170 --> 02:54:47,139
how it moves forward but but at the same

3975
02:54:43,299 --> 02:54:49,479
time you know the risk is that you know

3976
02:54:47,139 --> 02:54:52,060
we're back where we were years ago where

3977
02:54:49,479 --> 02:54:53,979
we set up gardens we get them going for

3978
02:54:52,060 --> 02:54:57,369
children or patients and they're just

3979
02:54:53,979 --> 02:54:58,840
cut down or but here in Sierra County

3980
02:54:57,370 --> 02:55:00,940
right next door to West they're not even

3981
02:54:58,840 --> 02:55:03,010
putting up gate notices anymore they're

3982
02:55:00,940 --> 02:55:05,530
just they literally bring the bulldozer

3983
02:55:03,010 --> 02:55:08,860
on the back of a truck and just bulldoze

3984
02:55:05,530 --> 02:55:11,280
over the gate over the garden drive the

3985
02:55:08,860 --> 02:55:14,170
bulldozer back up on the truck and leave

3986
02:55:11,280 --> 02:55:16,000
that's where we're at right now and if

3987
02:55:14,170 --> 02:55:18,569
you know if that's legalization then

3988
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:22,180
we've got a lot of a lot more work to do

3989
02:55:18,569 --> 02:55:25,569
no respect whether it's a legal you know

3990
02:55:22,180 --> 02:55:26,800
medical garden no worrying about you

3991
02:55:25,569 --> 02:55:28,959
know what has been you know if there's

3992
02:55:26,799 --> 02:55:31,149
scripts or recommendations of some of

3993
02:55:28,959 --> 02:55:34,719
those that are still compliant in

3994
02:55:31,149 --> 02:55:36,459
California just bulldozing them so that

3995
02:55:34,719 --> 02:55:39,129
you know it's that uncertainty that is

3996
02:55:36,459 --> 02:55:41,549
that is terrifying you know when you're

3997
02:55:39,129 --> 02:55:44,409
dealing with with life-or-death

3998
02:55:41,549 --> 02:55:47,409
treatments you know I know we shouldn't

3999
02:55:44,409 --> 02:55:49,539
have to worry about being bulldozed to

4000
02:55:47,409 --> 02:55:52,500
save our child's life or our mother's

4001
02:55:49,540 --> 02:55:54,790
life or our father's life or our own

4002
02:55:52,500 --> 02:55:57,190
there should be something that sort of

4003
02:55:54,790 --> 02:55:59,171
ability should be rooted in

4004
02:55:57,190 --> 02:56:02,290
the very nature of our communities and

4005
02:55:59,171 --> 02:56:05,319
again not that to beat a dead horse

4006
02:56:02,290 --> 02:56:07,631
pardon the horrible expression but um

4007
02:56:05,319 --> 02:56:11,591
this is why I think it's it's just gotta

4008
02:56:07,630 --> 02:56:14,079
be in our daily conversation and it's

4009
02:56:11,591 --> 02:56:15,851
and it's not as much and you know

4010
02:56:14,079 --> 02:56:17,681
there's people watching this show and

4011
02:56:15,851 --> 02:56:19,421
there's people on this show who get

4012
02:56:17,681 --> 02:56:23,051
interviewed you know we get interviewed

4013
02:56:19,421 --> 02:56:25,870
for local media for four papers we do

4014
02:56:23,050 --> 02:56:27,069
panels and discussions like a lot of us

4015
02:56:25,870 --> 02:56:29,230
are going to be at the Emerald cup here

4016
02:56:27,069 --> 02:56:33,159
pretty soon and I just want to just

4017
02:56:29,229 --> 02:56:37,810
encourage in request that you know we're

4018
02:56:33,159 --> 02:56:40,200
where you're able to insert some of

4019
02:56:37,810 --> 02:56:42,640
these realities into those conversations

4020
02:56:40,200 --> 02:56:47,921
because that's you know it's ideas that

4021
02:56:42,640 --> 02:56:50,380
are gonna change our landscape and what

4022
02:56:47,921 --> 02:56:53,021
I found is as people know and in our

4023
02:56:50,380 --> 02:56:55,810
educated you know the majority of people

4024
02:56:53,021 --> 02:56:58,570
are essentially good and they want to

4025
02:56:55,810 --> 02:57:00,699
see a change so so you know really the

4026
02:56:58,569 --> 02:57:03,039
more that we can encourage that and

4027
02:57:00,700 --> 02:57:04,750
encourage sort of these topics to be

4028
02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:06,580
brought up and inserted into other

4029
02:57:04,750 --> 02:57:07,479
conversations for those of us who have a

4030
02:57:06,579 --> 02:57:11,229
platform

4031
02:57:07,479 --> 02:57:12,671
I would definitely appreciate it greatly

4032
02:57:11,229 --> 02:57:17,250
and I know that it would have a real

4033
02:57:12,671 --> 02:57:20,440
impact we got you covered on that one

4034
02:57:17,250 --> 02:57:24,521
we're on panels your your network is on

4035
02:57:20,440 --> 02:57:28,239
our website and we'll put valerie's on

4036
02:57:24,521 --> 02:57:30,551
there too and any chance we get to be a

4037
02:57:28,239 --> 02:57:32,500
voice for anyone doing good we totally

4038
02:57:30,550 --> 02:57:35,949
agree with you that it's it's almost our

4039
02:57:32,500 --> 02:57:37,959
duty if we have a platform to make use

4040
02:57:35,950 --> 02:57:39,641
of it and I encourage everybody else out

4041
02:57:37,959 --> 02:57:41,829
there who's listening who do have a

4042
02:57:39,640 --> 02:57:44,591
large platform that this is a very

4043
02:57:41,829 --> 02:57:46,630
important potent conversation I like to

4044
02:57:44,591 --> 02:57:48,700
say patent because I think that that's

4045
02:57:46,630 --> 02:57:52,421
fun and I think that it's important but

4046
02:57:48,700 --> 02:57:54,311
it really is truly important and yeah

4047
02:57:52,421 --> 02:57:57,489
there's our platform Oh to where you are

4048
02:57:54,310 --> 02:58:00,550
yeah I think I think it's as simple as

4049
02:57:57,489 --> 02:58:02,560
this forest that you just don't stop

4050
02:58:00,550 --> 02:58:04,449
doing anything and that you you know you

4051
02:58:02,560 --> 02:58:06,341
bring it to the media's attention when

4052
02:58:04,450 --> 02:58:08,500
things are done like how can you arrest

4053
02:58:06,341 --> 02:58:10,440
people that are helping like very ill

4054
02:58:08,500 --> 02:58:13,110
children like it's just it

4055
02:58:10,440 --> 02:58:15,239
there's no there's no leg to stand on in

4056
02:58:13,110 --> 02:58:17,370
that argument like it would be you would

4057
02:58:15,239 --> 02:58:20,880
change the laws in the first case that

4058
02:58:17,370 --> 02:58:23,971
went through like nobody nobody is that

4059
02:58:20,880 --> 02:58:26,430
ignorant to not see the suffering but I

4060
02:58:23,970 --> 02:58:30,140
see right now on your face that's not

4061
02:58:26,431 --> 02:58:33,120
acting that's that's the real deal dude

4062
02:58:30,140 --> 02:58:35,159
excuse me excuse me Marcus no no I'm

4063
02:58:33,120 --> 02:58:37,381
done I'm done I just wanted to say it's

4064
02:58:35,159 --> 02:58:39,780
not that the arrest because nobody in

4065
02:58:37,380 --> 02:58:42,630
their right mind would do that but it's

4066
02:58:39,780 --> 02:58:45,540
the it eliminates the ability to

4067
02:58:42,630 --> 02:58:48,209
practice to go into business and you

4068
02:58:45,540 --> 02:58:52,620
violate the tenants of the law and then

4069
02:58:48,209 --> 02:58:55,939
you're eliminated from continuing in

4070
02:58:52,620 --> 02:59:00,421
that process so that's why we have to

4071
02:58:55,940 --> 02:59:02,700
create the umbrella that and the cradle

4072
02:59:00,421 --> 02:59:04,979
really the cradle that holds all of us

4073
02:59:02,700 --> 02:59:08,610
safely to do our work because really

4074
02:59:04,979 --> 02:59:10,470
it's about outcome and and the only way

4075
02:59:08,610 --> 02:59:13,381
to achieve the outcome that we are

4076
02:59:10,470 --> 02:59:15,390
seeking is to hold one another that

4077
02:59:13,380 --> 02:59:18,600
grace that we hold one another end that

4078
02:59:15,390 --> 02:59:22,681
we recognize that we are equal and that

4079
02:59:18,601 --> 02:59:25,440
we function with equanimity and balance

4080
02:59:22,681 --> 02:59:27,690
and how do we do that by by supporting

4081
02:59:25,440 --> 02:59:30,060
one another because there is no one

4082
02:59:27,690 --> 02:59:34,649
better to do that any of this work than

4083
02:59:30,060 --> 02:59:38,369
all of us there yeah I think it's a

4084
02:59:34,649 --> 02:59:40,829
seven was it a seven year ban that's

4085
02:59:38,370 --> 02:59:44,579
right yes if you're caught working

4086
02:59:40,829 --> 02:59:46,110
outside the regulated market which is it

4087
02:59:44,579 --> 02:59:48,630
you know it's it's an incentive for a

4088
02:59:46,110 --> 02:59:50,610
reason and that's a good one but it does

4089
02:59:48,630 --> 02:59:54,869
it is it makes the real question as to

4090
02:59:50,610 --> 02:59:56,011
how to move forward but that's we're

4091
02:59:54,870 --> 02:59:58,610
running out of time so that's another

4092
02:59:56,011 --> 02:59:58,610
another show

4093
03:00:00,549 --> 03:00:06,939
he's every show yeah seriously it was

4094
03:00:04,209 --> 03:00:10,810
Mahatma Gandhi who talked about fighting

4095
03:00:06,940 --> 03:00:13,390
unjust laws and some one of the things

4096
03:00:10,810 --> 03:00:16,601
that I am certain is going to happen is

4097
03:00:13,390 --> 03:00:21,220
that people will continue to resist this

4098
03:00:16,601 --> 03:00:24,040
version of an unjust law this again this

4099
03:00:21,220 --> 03:00:29,739
plant has no lethal dose and it has such

4100
03:00:24,040 --> 03:00:32,530
amazing properties in the proper

4101
03:00:29,739 --> 03:00:35,021
preparations not just for those in

4102
03:00:32,530 --> 03:00:37,181
desperate need but for the general

4103
03:00:35,021 --> 03:00:44,440
health of all beings and for the health

4104
03:00:37,181 --> 03:00:46,659
of our planet so yeah I think each of us

4105
03:00:44,440 --> 03:00:50,590
are part of a group of people who are

4106
03:00:46,659 --> 03:00:57,360
standing up to this new version of

4107
03:00:50,590 --> 03:01:03,010
prohibition and and I know in my work

4108
03:00:57,360 --> 03:01:05,880
supporting forests I you can't say no to

4109

these families how do you do that you

4110

of us who are listening that's made

4118
03:01:38,771 --> 03:01:47,141
laughter we should conclude with your

4119
03:01:40,720 --> 03:01:48,909
name you know yes and that still there's

4120
03:01:47,140 --> 03:01:53,350
always social justice work to do

4121
03:01:48,909 --> 03:01:53,950
that doesn't change yet 10,000 years

4122
03:01:53,351 --> 03:01:58,360
more

4123
03:01:53,950 --> 03:02:00,159
we will evolve I'm confident well I look

Sunday morning now afternoon although I

4139
03:02:36,250 --> 03:02:44,350

and thank you such a pleasure I have

4143
03:02:48,430 --> 03:02:51,430
been on the road for a long time and it

4144
03:02:49,930 --> 03:02:53,559
can be a little lonely and I got to like

4145
03:02:51,430 --> 03:02:57,010
hang out with family and friends today I

4146
03:02:53,559 --> 03:03:00,988

4147
03:02:57,010 --> 03:03:03,639
up wonderful thanks Forrest as always

4148
03:03:00,988 --> 03:03:06,340
powerful stuff man gets you thinking

4149
03:03:03,639 --> 03:03:09,789
gets you gets you thinking a little bit

4150
03:03:06,340 --> 03:03:11,889
differently from from maybe the regular

4151
03:03:09,790 --> 03:03:14,199
way of thinking in this community where

4152
03:03:11,889 --> 03:03:16,000
we can get caught up in some of the well

4153
03:03:14,199 --> 03:03:18,119
we can just get hypnotized like in any

4154
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:21,040
community I guess with you know these

4155
03:03:18,119 --> 03:03:22,449
different things of less importance when

4156
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:24,579
we could when we should be sharing a

4157
03:03:22,449 --> 03:03:26,380
little bit of our time on things that

4158
03:03:24,578 --> 03:03:30,309
are a little bit more important so I do

4159
03:03:26,379 --> 03:03:32,228
appreciate cannabis has depth that's all

4160
03:03:30,309 --> 03:03:34,719
you know you can focus on a lot of

4161
03:03:32,228 --> 03:03:37,929
aspects of it you know it's just the

4162
03:03:34,719 --> 03:03:39,488
area we're focused on is is intense so

4163
03:03:37,930 --> 03:03:41,078
it's not always fun to talk about when

4164
03:03:39,488 --> 03:03:44,559
you're enjoying the fun parts of Canada

4165
03:03:41,078 --> 03:03:46,898
its but but it's it's because of that it

4166
03:03:44,559 --> 03:03:48,309
gets it gets forgotten sometimes so it's

4167
03:03:46,898 --> 03:03:51,459
just it's good to bring up and keep on

4168
03:03:48,309 --> 03:03:53,019
our focus that this plant is amazing and

4169
03:03:51,459 --> 03:03:56,318
how we can be involved with it is so

4170
03:03:53,020 --> 03:03:59,290
diverse that you could spend your whole

4171
03:03:56,318 --> 03:04:01,228
life working in cannabis and in this

4172
03:03:59,290 --> 03:04:04,090
happens quite a bit and not hit all the

4173
03:04:01,228 --> 03:04:06,340
different aspects of how its interacting

4174
03:04:04,090 --> 03:04:08,469
with people's lives so really appreciate

4175
03:04:06,340 --> 03:04:11,380
you giving us an opportunity to speak

4176
03:04:08,469 --> 03:04:13,510
about where our focus is and how it can

4177
03:04:11,379 --> 03:04:16,000
be integrated into all the different

have no choice but to continue our work

4204
03:05:20,699 --> 03:05:25,248
whether the law supports it or not so

4205
03:05:22,859 --> 03:05:28,020
that's a reality and that will be

4206
03:05:25,248 --> 03:05:28,738
something that we'll figure out so we'll

4207
