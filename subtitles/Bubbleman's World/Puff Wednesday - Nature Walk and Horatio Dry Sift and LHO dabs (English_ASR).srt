00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,760
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world I

3
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,359
here in West Vancouver right on the

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,599
water you can see the Lion's Gate Bridge

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,279
in the background and there's a ship

6
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,278
that's coming through right now there's

7
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,238
uh basically you've got West Vancouver

8
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,799
on this side here and as you go over the

9
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:39,359
bridge you end up in Stanley Park which

10
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:42,439
is that right there I of course have my

11
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:45,000
fab EG with my Banger which I got from

12
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:46,599
DC glass thank you Dark Crystal glass

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,119
and I guess today what I'm going to do

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,879
is a little a little show on just

15
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:54,558
traveling around Vancouver and West

16
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:56,759
Vancouver and ripping bowls I obviously

17
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:59,280
have my license so if I go to a private

18
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:02,320
area a public area where you know no

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,118
one's around and I'm able to do rips

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,599
Without Really uh being in breach of any

21
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:08,799
laws which is

22
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,438
awesome um so I saw this deck out here

23
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,840
and I thought this is where we'll start

24
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,239
the day we'll do a couple of

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,240
rips couple of rips out here and then

26
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,158
we'll head into maybe the mountains

27
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:20,158
maybe go up to Cypress or maybe head

28
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,240
over to

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,880
grous I don't exactly know but we see

30
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,158
what happens we got a couple of Japanese

31
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:31,839
people coming and we'll see what uh what

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,840
they think of this

33
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:42,519
all

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,560
right Japanese people get ready for a

35
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:48,000
dab because that is what is happening

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,000
here

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,799
today all right here we

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
go

39
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,959
I suspect they're curious as to what it

40
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,960
is I'm

41
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,760
doing maybe we better have another rip

42
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,280
and let them let them

43
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,840
see yeah I think that's a good idea

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,959
they're stretching right

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,959
now I almost want to move the camera and

46
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,959
show you guys because it's so

47
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,518
funny Good Old West

48
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,759

all

50
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:49,199
right and now I've got a bird as my

51
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,199

52
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:04,719
word what's up bird what's up

53
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:04,719

54
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,959
Bird

55
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,439
anyway that concludes the first part of

56
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,120
our session we will catch you in the

57
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,878
mountains well I was just dumping out

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,200
the water from the Fab egg and man if

59
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,359
this little bird didn't come check it

60
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,598
out it's like he wants to take a rip

61
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,560
want to take a rip

62
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:31,679
buddy there you

63
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,840
go there you go there he's taking a rip

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,920
just being silly hanging out with nature

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,120
this bird's getting a little closer

66
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:41,238
now he doesn't want to hit this guy to

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,840
get whatever it is he's possibly

68
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,840
getting thought it was kind of

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,799
funny all right so I am here in the

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,560
Beautiful Lighthouse Park trees

71
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,920
everywhere behind me above me really

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,158
beautiful Park Lighthouse Park in west

73
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,958
Vancouver nice to be able to come do all

74
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:15,000
the trails lots of people walk in their

75
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,000
dogs um I have been looking for water

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,720
and I've literally found the smallest

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,519
little trickle right

78
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,280
here

79
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,000
so without further

80
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:31,599
Ado I

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,600
guess what we're going to do here

82
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,000
is try and get

83
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,000
water into the Mother

84
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,680
Ship here we

85
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:50,639
go all right let's see what we can do

86
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,840
here gentle gentle gentle

87
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,560
Mothership adding the

88
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:59,198
water get in there it's all rock here so

89
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,879
you want to be real careful with uh at

90
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,319
the last last one I was I used ocean

91
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:05,839
water if you can

92
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:08,560
imagine last time here last little bit

93
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:13,599
guys for all of you cringing out there

94
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,600
in in the world of

95
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:22,120
YouTube that wasn't so

96
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:25,159
bad now uh here's the question do we go

97
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,478
down or do we go up I think we should do

98
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,880
both let's go down first have a quick

99
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:31,079
rip then we'll head back up I found a

100
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,159
really nice spot in the forest where I

101
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,599
wanted to share a rip with you guys so

102
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,600
let's do

103
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:50,159
that all right well looks like we found

104
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:52,279
the next spot for

105
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,319
sessions uh you saw how I had to put

106
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,198
water in this

107
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,879
thing but we're going to get those nice

108
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,759
bubbles because of

109
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:02,759
it so

110
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,960
without too much further Ado let's torch

111
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,919
up the

112
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,879
Banger I like the quartz because it

113
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:13,439
seems to hold its heat for a long

114
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,439
time I can hit

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,879
it I still manage to get my dab ready in

116
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,880
a

117
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,639
hurry there we

118
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,479
go all right so

119
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,680
get the

120
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:37,038
Dabber and of course the zash

121
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,800
shishi which is going to be an important

122
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,800
part of

123
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,199
this all right

124
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,719
so this is called multitasking here

125
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,720
people pay

126
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,399
attention

127
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,800
yeah it's

128
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,960
rip respect to this monster tree that's

129
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,839
bent over next to me here you can see

130
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,799
the size of it it's

131
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,079
huge and uh I think we're going to head

132
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,000
down a little bit more we're just right

133
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:24,120
at the Pacific Ocean and uh yeah I think

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,598
it's probably not a bad idea for us

135
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,680
to wrap this up and uh go ahead out

136
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,120
there and have a Bowl in the open ocean

137
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,319
and then I'm going to head back up and

138
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,079
have a bowl in the middle of the forests

139
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,360
so wanted to get all of our bases

140
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,519
covered and I think we're doing a pretty

141
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,520
good

142
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:55,709
[Music]

143
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:25,910
job

144
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:25,909
[Music]

145
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
w

146
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,159
get on there later

147
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,240
maybe we got another

148
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,039
ledge might as well go down one more

149
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,360
ledge right

150
00:08:54,039 --> 00:09:00,480
people

151
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:03,000
slippery I think we're okay all

152
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,000
right okay all

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
right put that down for a

154
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,519
second all

155
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,040
right well I think this is a good spot

156
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,160
for us to maybe set up the

157
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,439
camera and have a rip or two I think I

158
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,159
might want to hang out at this spot for

159
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,160
a little bit in

160
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,278
fact oh that's not going to work is it

161
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:50,278
or maybe it will let's

162
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:50,278
see got the

163
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,800
torch get the dab got put back inside

164
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,278
I'm guessing no I've got the Dabber TI

165
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,078
it potentially we have everything we we

166
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,879
need all we need

167
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:05,199
is the hash and oh my goodness it's

168
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:09,159
right

169
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,440
here oo can I can I access it without

170
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:13,078
dumping the whole

171

lot that'll be the

172
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:20,759
test

173
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:24,719

outer Cliff faces of Lighthouse Park

175
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,360

good with the torch I will

198
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,599
admit that'll be interesting for whoever

199
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
is walking above me right now to stick

200
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,000
their head up over the ledge and see me

201
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:53,839
down here with the Fab EG and the quartz

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,679
Banger and the creme brulee

203
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,800
torch a

204
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,519

205
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,078
see Dolphins I don't see either right

206
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,078
now but you

207
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:18,200
[Music]

208
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,879
could

209
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,559
that was a good one tell you with the

210
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:52,719
glass on quartz carb cap there that was

211
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,719
probably the best hit I've had so

212
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
far

213
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:04,519
yep best one so

214
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,759
far

215
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,519
it's one thing to hike through the

216
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:44,320
forest on a lovely non-rainy day it's

217
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,320
another completely to bring your Fab

218
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,198
egg yeah we roll with our FB bags

219
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:54,958
through the

220
00:13:50,198 --> 00:14:00,758
forest climbing up Rocky super sketchy

221
00:13:54,958 --> 00:14:00,758
terrain takeing my fab bag for a walk

222
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,159
all right guys so this is going to be

223
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,799
the last place that we hit a bowl

224
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,838
together while we tour Lighthouse Park

225
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,599
together uh this is an easy Park to find

226
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,600
if you want to leave Vancouver you take

227
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,680
the Lionsgate bridge and you go left on

228
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,839
onto Marine it's actually a right and it

229
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,359
Loops you around back underneath but you

230
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,120
follow that into West Vancouver and you

231
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,440
just keep going and going and going and

232
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,919
I mean you go for quite a ways past the

233
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,320
fire department and all these things

234
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,198
before you see this little sign on the

235
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,440
left right by the bus stop they'll say

236
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,319
Lighthouse Park I'm sure you can find an

237
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,560
address in directions if you Google it

238
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,879
but uh there really are some spectacular

239
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,919
trees in this Forest so it's uh it's a

240
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,360
great place to come walk your dog or

241
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,838
walk with your girlfriend or your

242
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,720
buddies and just uh yeah enjoy a few

243
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:51,040
rips while you're doing it so I've got

244
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,240
my Dabber all loaded over

245
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,919
there mother ship's ready for one more

246
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,278
rip and then I had uh a call with

247
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,759
Horatio Mr D lemon himself and he

248
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,198
thought that he was going to rip down

249
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,680
this way so I'm going to maybe go eat

250
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,519
eat a little lunch after this and then

251
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,120
I'm going to hook up with Horatio and

252
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,799
I'm not exactly sure what we'll do but

253
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,679
we'll probably sit down dab hang out

254
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:15,838
talk and it usually gets pretty deep

255
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,679
with Horatio I think he's got a tarpine

256
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,680
thing that we're going to do so you guys

257
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:23,120
will definitely want to stay tuned for

258
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:26,479
that as that's going to be fun balancing

259

appeared rather than actually just spent

279
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:19,240
the last two hours yeah racing down the

280

while you were out you know puffing

281
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,160
tough off water ocean Forest it was all

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,160
long but uh we've got some excitement

286
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,400
don't we what uh we should let them know

287
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,720
exactly what we're going to do here next

288
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,160
bringing out some stuff once we we got a

289
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,798
little hot box session and then probably

290
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,640
heading back to the lab yeah do a quick

291
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:46,079
little rip here and then head back to my

292
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,960
zone and uh we're going to pull out a

293
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:51,798
bunch of fun stuff and go through a sort

294
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,160
of tarpine experiment with Horatio so

295
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:57,960
that'll be fun yeah got some things

296
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,798
still frozen in the pack oh yeah yeah

297
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,400
see if I can reach for it this is where

298
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:05,679
it's at people uh the secrets Ling here

299
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,960
ah yes it's not easy when you got to

300
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,360
keep things Frozen no it's the zebra

301
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,440
stripes though that actually preserve

302
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,558
the Turks that's why I got it yeah the

303
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,480
zebra zebra stripes are

304
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,558
actually I I'm pretty sure it's a

305
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,679
scientific fact at this point that zebra

306
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:23,798
stripes um preserve tpin you can do that

307
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,360
and then if you get pink piping then you

308
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:27,639
pretty much it'll never butter or white

309
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,319
out straight up it's I heard that the

310
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,480
pink piping is is quite important for

311
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:33,759
the non- buttering out Factor There You

312
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,120
Go sir all right give you a little

313
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:40,079
Ripper of this like ancient bubble hash

314
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:42,399
let's do this just make sure there's

315

a

319
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,600
champion and then we use the glass

320
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:00,400
jar to carb we learned that

321
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:03,359

every once in a while it's been raining

326
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,320
here the last few days so it was kind of

327
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,440
nice to just get out still cloudy and

328
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:20,038
dark but perfect for just getting out

329
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,360
and spending a few hours in the forest

330
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:23,519
ripping away while the police you know

331
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:25,558
do their thing out on the street and

332
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,679
drive back and forth we just uh they're

333
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:28,918
not worried we'll just continue to do

334
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,000
our thing

335
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,720
if I saw anybody else hot boxing at the

336
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,839
mall I don't know you want to torch that

337
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,798
one up yeah yeah hot boxing at the mall

338
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,399
we can't be the only ones hot boxing at

339
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,079
the mall in front of the bank I think so

340
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,720
in front of the bank yeah especially

341
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,720
after the Epic places I've just been s

342
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,360
yeah and then it's like let's just hot

343
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,880
box in front dude just pull over just

344
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:54,038
pull over let just have a session in the

345
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,600
bank right up in front no one's worrying

346
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:58,759
about the glass or the Torches or smoke

347
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,038
effects

348
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,839
all right no we're just chilling in the

349
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,119
car dash truck I don't know what you

350
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:07,079
call this

351
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:11,000
thing the other way the other B thank

352
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:14,279
you sir Dy Shane that's good hash I

353
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,279
tipped it and it never spilled a

354
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,639
drop still going for this plastic

355
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,360
Tech

356
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:34,480
yeah oh that tasted so good that was

357
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,479
like Astro Boy or

358
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,600
something

359
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:41,480
wow well that's good um we're probably

360
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,719
going to hit a couple more of those but

361
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,400
the next time you see us I have a

362
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,880
feeling we'll be somewhere different

363
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,759
yeah out of the car how'd you find the

364
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,320
carbonated water hits that was a

365
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,359
surprise I only had you know what I

366
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:56,000
didn't mind it the first dry rip I took

367
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:59,719
of it was not good it was

368
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
like kind of grabbed oygen

369
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,319
but now it

370
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,599
seems it seemed fine it'd be interesting

371
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:08,519
to see what the carbonated water filters

372
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,079
versus non-carbonated water but then

373
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,679
again at that point you could get into

374
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:15,158
the different PHS you could get into

375
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,679
reverse osmosis you could get into dis

376
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,400
distillated I mean yeah well you get

377
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,200
into distilled water that stuff is

378
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,559
literally stripping everything it comes

379
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,200
in TCT with so it has an upside and a

380
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,599
downside you might find all the turps

381
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,400
are in your water yeah I I think as well

382
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,519
that I have a little bit of a worry when

383
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,640
it comes to distilled water that it

384
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:38,599
seems that it would strip more good than

385
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,520
bad I mean I use it in my process but

386
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:42,558
I'm using it in a spot in which I

387
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:44,839
already know what it's going to do but

388
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,678
it definitely I would rather experiment

389
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:49,319
with carbonated water or other not that

390
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,440
we're going to go around refilling our

391
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:54,720
bongs with soda anytime soon but um it

392
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,038
is one of the unique capacities now that

393
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,720
you're pairing water with another

394
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,319
molecule of carbon

395
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,038
it's true you know today just walking

396
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,158
around with the Mother Ship really had

397
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:06,319
me realize like first I went down to the

398
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,039
the right to the ocean had no water was

399
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,599
like well there's a whole ocean full so

400
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:12,919
I I filled it up from the ocean uh I

401
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,359
smoked an ocean dab saltwater rips

402
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,000
saltwater rips then I went into

403
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,599
Lighthouse Park where it was just dry

404
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,919
there's no water anyway and I was like I

405
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:21,278
just kept going deeper and deeper and

406
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,759
deeper and I got to a point where there

407
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:27,359
was this little like Creek of dribbling

408
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:29,400
Spring Water rips yeah then I then I got

409
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,918
that in there filled it up through here

410
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,480
yeah and now I'm with you and we're

411
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,720
doing carbonated water that's so [ __ ]

412
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,240
up it's really quite [ __ ] up so

413
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,640
probably we should do some type of water

414
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,400
when we get to the next Z I don't know

415
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,000
maybe plain water I don't plain water it

416
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,559
it could be exciting it could be boring

417
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,119
today maybe artisian spring well I'm I'm

418
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:53,839
looking there's possibly baby tier water

419
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:57,038
baby that could be pretty exciting

420
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,759
Unicorn oh made from baby's tears I I

421
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,119
mean when you get really rich you could

422
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:03,119
do a bubble run with baby tier water

423
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,519
crystal crystal results like a 20 gallon

424
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,399
batch

425
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:08,879
yeah cuz cuz you know me dude well we're

426
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,840
going to get it's the comments that are

427
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,760
coming over the baby tier water that's

428
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:15,119
true well you know what right now what

429
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:18,919
we're really doing is we're working on

430
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:22,158
an upcoming episode of reading all your

431
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,559
um um how would I put it douchebaggery

432
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,480
comment hater raid comments reading just

433
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:28,759
the nastiest meanest comments that you

434
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,159
guys write I want to an episode I don't

435
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:31,558
know who's going to be in it with me but

436
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,000
it'll be funny and we're just going to

437
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,519
take about a dozen maybe more write them

438
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
all down and then we'll go through each

439
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:40,119
one and then we'll kind of talk a little

440
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,038
bit about what it takes for a person

441
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:45,038
like for a person to watch a particular

442
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:46,558
video maybe it's a 30 minute video and

443
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,440
maybe you know the part they're talking

444
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,480
about is at like the 28th minute so

445
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,600
these guys have watched 2third of the of

446
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,038
the video you know they must have gotten

447
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:57,319
something more out of it but this is the

448
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,919
thing that they choose to comment on so

449
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:01,319
explode yeah why is that guy squeaking

450
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:05,159
his chair

451
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:06,359
though yeah it's interesting anyway so

452
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,480
we're going to have that that'll be up

453
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:09,678
and coming and so you're going to hear

454
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,798
us making lots of jokes as we get to

455
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,679
that episode because we want to get uh

456
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:15,079
we want to get you guys uh commenting

457
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,798
with your best comments that you

458
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:20,678
possibly can

459
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:22,400
so I guess we'll see you soon peace out

460
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,640
all right guys Horatio and I are out of

461
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,840
the car and we've head over to high

462
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,320
integrity glass art who is uh shy and

463
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,519
off camera right now actually doing the

464
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:35,200
wonderful job of heating up what did you

465
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:37,519
call that piece spinal CL the spinal

466
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,919
clim the spinal

467
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:45,759
Klein okay then spinal

468
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:48,399
Klein I was excited to uh to get the

469
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,000
pieces over here it's a right-handed one

470
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:51,038
I'm left-handed but that's okay it still

471
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,880
works

472
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:56,558
perfect time to be destroyed after a rip

473
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,559
from uh the

474
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:59,759
congales

475
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,519
yeah that ought to do

476
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,000
it spinal

477
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:26,679
Kleine very nice you going to rip one of

478
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,679
those ratio oh

479
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
yeah

480
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:38,759
I often get really great quality highs

481
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,679
visiting him in fact similar the one

482
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:43,720
time I did hit LH I got a really nice

483
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,240
rush off of it it was unfortunate cuz I

484
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,399
had to leave my wife called me almost

485
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,640
immediately after and I was like

486
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:51,879
literally like okay I guess I'm driving

487
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,159
now something most people don't really

488
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,960
want to do like I got rocked good in a

489
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,278
good way not like oh I'm uncomfortable

490
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,759
but just really much the the same way I

491
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:04,038
get rocked when I take a nice hit from

492
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:08,079
something that's uh that higher end

493
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:10,038
passes over that was congales 90 Micron

494
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:13,199
yeah so that's the top of the top right

495
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:15,319
there grown to pure perfection um uh

496
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,080
flattened out on parchment paper about 3

497
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:20,359
minutes ago just to show you what she

498
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,359
looks

499
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,480
like rip for

500
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:29,599
ratio

501
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:44,278
that little ofz is the optimized flavor

502
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:45,720
Zone got to admit I like it uh first

503
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:47,759
time I was passed one I was very

504
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,960
confused but it's got a little uh little

505
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,319
lip in there and you're confused cuz you

506
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:59,600
put this big piece the the tube down

507
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:59,599
into the uh quartz so very cool ofz

508
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:07,319
beautiful isn't that just a lovely

509
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:09,519
flavor on H I don't know the dabs are

510
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:11,678
big I think it's the dabs well it's a

511
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,839
big dab for sure but uh they're not

512
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,519
small dabs I was tempted to take half of

513
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:19,398
it but after I took half of it I was

514
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:20,720
like well me too there was a moment

515
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:22,759
where the you're like wait a minute

516
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,120
there's a full dab still on this or a

517
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:25,839
dab and a half yeah and then I'm like

518
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,038
all just finish just finish it just

519
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,158
finish it it through I mean you're

520
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,480
hitting at a such a beautiful piece it's

521
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:35,960
it's almost like you deserve to hit a

522
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:38,440
rock and roll dab on the day that uh you

523
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,038
hit a piece such as this it's got that

524
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,558
sweat out Mothership on the edge there

525
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,079
that's really

526
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:49,000

00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:06,599
for me with personal if it gets any

533
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,759
bigger than that I it doesn't belong on

534
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:09,199
my desk it seems like something I'm

535
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,000
going to hit

536
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,360
myself it's incredible how actually

537
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,839
handleable this pipe is for these

538
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:20,519
spinals you know like you can

539
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:22,678
actually put your fingers on each spinal

540
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,679
column and

541
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:28,240

550
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,398
go

551
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:11,640
oh that was much more reasonable that

552
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:14,959

553

559
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,480
over there I like me some guava about

560
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:36,359
that it had a real nice flavor to it

561
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,839
what else did you say might be in there

562

the blue suede shoes that the triome

565
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,600
heavy extracts guys the melts that they

566
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:52,679
had in Amsterdam this year it was

567
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:54,199
unbelievable like blueberry yogurt it

568
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,960
really did have a unique like I wanted

569
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,919
to make dry sift with it well there you

570
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,558
know those like there's those things

571
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,278
where I'm like the name just matches the

572
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:06,798
effect to the point you know you believe

573
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:09,359
um without having a even skunkman Sam

574
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,480
was like what's that like everyone that

575
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:14,839
smoked it or smelled it was like what I

576
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,839
want to try that so right on guys props

577
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:18,319
on that I think it was a contender too I

578
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:21,558
think it took like second or third at

579
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:24,200
the uh Legends and then I saw them up on

580
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:25,879
stage as well at the Cannabis Cup and I

581
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,360
don't know if they Ed dabad do but I'm

582
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,159
sure if they did they would have cr

583
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,879
probably gotten some type of award there

584
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,278
as well they always seem to be in the

585
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,278

dry sift which sorry to show you my

604

that

607
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:38,278
can we get close enough

608
00:31:35,798 --> 00:31:39,599

609
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:41,798
give us the love but we'll show you

610
