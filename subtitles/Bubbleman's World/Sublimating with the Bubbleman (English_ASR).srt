00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,799
hey how's it going there facebookers uh

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,240
yeah just been posting a bunch of

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,599
pictures today of uh melty bubble people

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,199
have really been stoked on seeing the

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,879
pictures of bubble so I figured uh well

6
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:17,079
maybe we'll do a little video of

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:21,000
sublimating some so I just pull out a

8
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,439
little little little bit here and dump

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,679
her into the

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,160
sublimator now generally for the

11
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:31,118
sublimator to give an instant rip you

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,880
want to have the wand on top of the bowl

13
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,799
that heats the bottom of the bowl up and

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,760
that way when you put the uh material in

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,238
there it's it's ready to go but I've got

16
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:40,558
my sublimator turned on hot enough that

17
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:44,000
it should still give a nice milky hit

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,000
let's check it out

19
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,728

20
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:13,459
[Music]

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,439
it was a little slow going there when

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,200
the supplim gets hot enough it'll just

23
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,279
milk right up but still that t that hit

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,759
was super

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,759
tasty Pi another one

[Music]

27
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,920
all

28
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,560
right number two generally I would only

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,840
get probably one hit from a hit like

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,478
that in the bong but sublimator usually

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,478
gives me four or five

32
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:06,578
[Music]

33
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,159
one of the things I really like about

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,920
the sublimator is

35
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:17,000
uh lifting the wand you can put hash or

36
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,039
cannabis in there but you can also dab

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,680
your solventless oils in these little

38
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:24,359
dots here in these little holes that the

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:28,040
sublimator comes with so often

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,000
uh after you know five or six

41
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:35,199
hits I can usually squeeze out a really

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,878
nice little blob of oil which I got one

43
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,439
on this nail here and then it's just a

44
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:45,759
simple as dropping

45
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:45,759
that into the hole and taking the hip

46
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:55,099
[Music]

47
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,719
[Music]

48
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,199
so there we have it it's one of the many

49
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:11,158
reasons why the sublimator is superior

50
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,158
to all vaporizers that I've ever

51
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:21,199
smoked cannabis hash and oil all

52
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:24,878
effortlessly all non-stop anyway bubble

53
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,878
on we'll see you soon
