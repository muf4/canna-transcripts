in the house as

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,399
well we're here at the what is this the

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,119
Cannabis economy conference is that the

12
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,200
name of it it's definitely a unique type

13
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,399
of conference uh it's happening right

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,640
below us here I could show you later on

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,280
with the camera we're kind of on this

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,399
little rooftop Terrace and uh it's quite

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,359
private and it's all round T events it's

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,558
been different for sure somewhat

19
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,640
interesting there's a little bit of uh

20
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:01,038
one-on ones going on but I have to say

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,320
the most most interesting conversation

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,760
that I've heard since I've been here uh

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,840
was the conversation we were all just

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,560
having about tpen and the modulating

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,478
effects and how we've all come to learn

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,759
about these different things and that's

27
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:13,200
why I wanted to turn the camera on

28
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,118
hoping that we would uh have a little

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,799
bit more of that conversation give you

30
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,640
guys a little introduction to this event

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,200
that we're at there are no cameras uh

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,040
being brought in but uh uh we'll still

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,118
end up having a couple more sessions

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,040
before it's all said and done so why

35
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,159
don't we just have a few dabs and uh

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,320
maintain our conversation that we were

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,640
uh yeah I mean it didn't take long

38
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,199
before we're like tp's danger we know

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,920
you all want them because you see us

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,240
with them but why are we acting so

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,640
conservative now that um we've

42
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:46,000
experienced them MH and um that's a hard

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,439
thing for any public to swallow I think

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,159
you have a strong voice in this because

45
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:53,758
you work with the tpine delimine and one

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,399
of the first things you mentioned to me

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,118
at your house which was not something

48
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:58,439
that most people would have mentioned I

49
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,879
think they would have tried to sweep it

50
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,959
sweep it under the the rug but when I

51
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,078
was asking uh you you know how you would

52
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,718
remove this orange liquid from your

53
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:08,639
clear liquid and then brought it back to

54
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,399
a clear liquid we were talking about

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,759
what's in that orange liquid and you

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,360
know the the the sort of uh politically

57
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,359
correct or not politically correct but

58
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,680
the sort of you know the the the

59
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,519
business savvy uh let's protect my own

60
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,319
ass person would have said it in a way

61
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,920
like oh those are the Citrus oils that

62
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,238
are not delimiting and one of the first

63
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,119
things he said was those are that's like

64
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,519
the Mystery Oil that's whatever it is I

65
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,200
mean it could be from this plastic gas

66
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,439
that the delimiting comes in and you

67
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:38,399
were really aware that tpin can be

68
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:41,199
costic they can literally break you got

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,519
to I met somebody downstairs at this

70
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,079
conference and they're like what you

71
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,080
extract with hexane and I'm like that's

72
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,760
funny I extract with cyc hexane he's

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,879
like what's cycle hexane and I'm like oh

74
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,840
it's called the leonine um I extract

75
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,799
with a solvent stronger than you and I

76
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,120
understand why you extract with hexane

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,959
for medical purposes not um for

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,519
recreational dabs um and the amounts are

79
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,759
working with he's really happy with how

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,959
clean he can get his product in the end

81
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,679
and I'm like you you know as well as I

82
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,039
do how much stronger hexane is than

83
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,239
typical um light hydrocarbons he's like

84
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,199
yep and I'm like well then you have a

85
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,200
perspective on how powerful lening is

86
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,079
and it's just one in an array of

87
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,959
potential um things

88
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,719
so if you don't respect it in the same

89
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,959
like basically you have liquid butane

90
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,199
it's that powerful of a hail I'll just

91
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,799
is that g I'll just take all of that

92
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,119
rubber and incorporate it into myself if

93
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,438
you don't respect it in that way um you

94
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,319
can get really [ __ ] up so um the fact

95
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:44,479
that I take clear got the red I'm like

96
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,518
all of this red was invisible and

97
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,840
everyone said that was clean Delan it

98
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,039
was food it was food gra and I'm like

99
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,598
smell this you know if you put this in

100
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,878
your body it ain't good it is the

101
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:56,078
craziest thing I don't know if you saw

102
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,878
the video uh when I went to htio it's

103
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:59,439
called Horatio's inner sanctum and he

104
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:01,679
brings me into his place and he shows me

105
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,479
a variety of things but it is the most

106
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,400
powerful thing you could see it's he's

107
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,479
got clear liquid in a jar and it's

108
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,480
delemon and it is not uh distilled or

109
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,438
not cleaned yet it's just food grade

110
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,919
it's just food grade so then out of that

111
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:20,000
through his own processes he's extracted

112
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:22,079
this nasty orish red liquid that came

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,478
out of the clear and then he was left

114
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,918
with clear again but two clears do they

115
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,000
look the same they both look clear like

116
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,758
water and then in the middle he's got

117
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,478
this jar of like and it is it's bad it's

118
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,080
like he even showed it to me when he

119
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:40,719
allowed it to um dry right out into a

120
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:42,959
cake or into a a waxy it just does not

121
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,440
polymer yeah almost like a plastic so

122
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,680
nasty dude that it was just like it's a

123
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:48,800
very powerful lesson for people to no

124
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,319
matter what process you are doing

125
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,160
because of course in our community we

126
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,759
support a variety of processes I'm known

127
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,120
as a a solventless guy I love the

128
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,720
solventless quiver but we have friends

129
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,160
that that run hydrocarbons both of these

130
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,360
guys are in that list uh delemon and

131
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,720
butane you use what else other than

132
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,879
butane I use just butane butane but then

133
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,080
you also do water extraction you're

134
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,279
you're not a one trick pony no which is

135
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:14,038
what we're trying to kind of promote

136
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,119
more and more and more Horatio is also

137
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:17,879
not a onetick pony he makes Incredible

138
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,560
uh dry sift I know that he has the

139
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,279
ability to make water hash he makes his

140
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,918
delimine extracts uh he makes all of his

141
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:27,879
purified uh thcas and the tpine

142
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:30,399
extractions so uh we're not trying to

143
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,079
promote any one thing over the other as

144
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:36,198
much as really it seems like the mission

145
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:38,680
today and from now on is to unveil and

146
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,879
uncover as many of the footprints that

147
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,840
are leaving behind negative aspects in

148
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,279
any of our extraction processes whether

149
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,198
it's molds from water uh whether it's uh

150
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,198
rubber gaskets from delimiting that

151
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,879
hasn't been cleaned properly uh whether

152
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,960
it's mer capatin present in dirty butane

153
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,240
that was bought in lowquality cans at a

154
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:58,359
grocery store these are things that need

155
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,160
to be discussed and if we can stop sort

156
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,720
of dividing ourselves eles from one

157
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,960
another and sit down as as a group which

158
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,160
we're doing right now it sort of moves

159
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,879
the the it forwards the conversation in

160
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,599
a in a greater way in my opinion we all

161
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,800
learn from each other for sure

162
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:16,079
absolutely well I mean everyone always

163
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,720
forgets I'm like you understand butane

164
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,439
created me I didn't understand boiling

165
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,520
points and it it was all through the

166
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,800
rise of that era um that's kind of why

167
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:26,719
like when we ever get a chance to shoot

168
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,598
the next series of videos I'm going to

169
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,360
go through a whole another side of

170
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:33,399
contamination that has nothing to do

171
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,160
with principal swing all the way the

172
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,000
principal names like is butane bad I'm

173
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,680
like no butane isn't bad we all know

174
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,560
we've smok the a joint and we can Huff

175
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,639
that now there are other ways in which

176
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,319
if butane is run in this way if this

177
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:51,680
filter isn't cleaned often really the

178
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,080
underside of um bad extraction artists

179
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,840
you know people who we always hear the

180
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,318
situation W it was a closed loop but why

181
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,038
did it blow up oh they never replaced

182
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,639
their gaskets never I'm like

183
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:03,399
that that is literally comparable to the

184
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,439
Simplicity of cleaning your water with a

185
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,120
water filtration system and it becomes a

186
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,038
wonderful thing while you're replacing

187
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,598
your filters and the minute you stop and

188
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:14,240
I've talked to Addison about this the

189
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,759
other day is that now you are con we

190
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,800
we're always concentrating that's what

191
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,400
we're doing so when you all of a sudden

192
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,120
stop removing that filter what you're

193
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,679
doing is you're still concentrating as

194
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,519
that thing's breaking down I'm like

195
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,240
where did it go that rendered into the

196
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,198
oil you've been getting rid of your

197
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,038
filter as soon it starts to break down

198
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,038
it's no good it's no different than

199
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:36,199
maybe all the mold is coming from not

200
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:39,360
establishing proper protocols for bag

201
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,120
cleanup immediately after use that's

202
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,439
probably the mold isn't even in the grow

203
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,199
half the time it's in mold is everywhere

204
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,360
it's like floating around but the last

205
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
the last R surfaces I'm like if the weed

206
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,840
was clean if someone was really thought

207
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,479
they did their best how could they [ __ ]

208
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,719
it up I'm like it would be that they

209
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,158
didn't know how to clean their bags

210
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,759
properly when they not well they know

211
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:00,879
what everybody knows and they everyone's

212
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,800
learned but what do you do in a pinch

213
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,240
what do you do when you're under the gun

214
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,840
do you need to clean it with a alcohol

215
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,038
but throw it in the dryer is that a way

216
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,638
to basically addressing this new world

217
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:14,279
where individual users are becoming

218
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,000
producers I think commercial uh level

219
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,559
extra actions I mean the the bags were

220
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,879
originally really you know for the

221
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,800
personal user they were never something

222
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,039
that was supposed to be set up for

223
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,720
commercial production uh you can produce

224
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,360
commercially with them of course but

225
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,720
it's it get get back to that yeah are

226
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,278
there small little bits and pieces that

227
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,560
are getting caught in the screen like I

228
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,479
think a stainless steel screen with many

229
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,239
hundreds of gallons uh you know the

230
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,360
mixers that go down into the into the V

231
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,399
the conle the conical cones those are

232
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,480
like things that you can run 25 or 50

233
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,600
lbs at a time you know you figure out

234
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,159
your thrashing versus how much material

235
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
is there versus water and ice and you

236
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,759
can really basically get it down so

237
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,879
you're getting your extraction ratio on

238
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,958
point you're not wasting by consistent

239
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,200
yeah you're becoming consistent but uh I

240
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,879
don't don't think that that'll be

241
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,360
that'll be done in stainless steel Vats

242
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:06,879
with chillers and you know I do like

243
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,639
things that can tolerate fire yeah I do

244
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,159
like BL it might kill me but I can

245
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,799
convience you know you can fly to

246
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,799
Jamaica with a pair of brand new bags

247
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,599
and then leave them behind to to someone

248
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,000
to have a little some opportunity it's

249
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,040
just yeah you got to be careful with

250
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,839
what you leave behind because there's no

251
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,278
way that the majority of people are

252
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,200
cleaning their bags the way I clean my

253
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,759
bags I don't think the majority of

254
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,600
people that that the thing is people end

255
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,399
up joining the um we talked a lot today

256
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
about the gray Market this new spirit

257
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,679
where anyone can become good some grower

258
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,480
could find out he has the gift in bubble

259
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:42,239
hash because he grew the right strain

260
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,200
sure and now he becomes the dude and

261
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,079
Instagram blows up but it doesn't

262
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,560
necessarily mean he came up at in a

263
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,199
culture in which he's learned the rules

264
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,359
to provide for people um they're very

265
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,959
different things and what so he was good

266
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,159
when it was all between 10 and 50 g but

267
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,000
as things go up as fatigue goes up as

268
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,399
you start getting secondary employees

269
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,639
everything what do you mean you didn't

270
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:09,399
clean it well we got to go capping it

271
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,319
yeah it's a I think a lot of people have

272
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,679
become caught up by joining some level

273
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,320
of production industry that's beyond the

274
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:17,879
personal on the homie you can poison

275
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,440
yourself you can poison your homie you

276
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,240
can punch your back but um as soon as

277
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,440
you could say money gets involved um

278
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,079
there's a different Karma very true

279
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,399
there's a different Karma completely

280
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:30,359
especially when you know when I talked

281
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,958
about this of ways that we're in this

282
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,039
gray area of removing ourselves from

283
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,879
what I call the prohibition based dollar

284
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,078
the profit margin that exists based on

285
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,759
prohibition based on I can make money on

286
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:42,799
this because if he gets caught with it

287
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:45,958
he's doing 20 years wow you that that's

288
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:49,319
a great profit margin but it's a totally

289
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,719
horrible profit to make you know what I

290
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,440
mean I like the idea of cannabis

291
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,639
becoming more of a positive profit

292
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,639
margin where it is medicinal it is fun

293
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,200
recreational it is preventative it does

294
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,360
have incredible value so let's charge a

295
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,240
little bit of money for that but what we

296
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,959
give them in return the people that are

297
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,480
paying for this is standards is the

298
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,679
highest quality of Standards so that

299
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,120
they can acquire the safest you know

300
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,399
best quality medicine or recreational

301
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,799
preventative uh product that they could

302
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,958
possibly uh access and that's where the

303
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,639
profit margin in my opinion it's a great

304
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,958
profit margin that's a great profit Marg

305
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,278
you know what I mean it's based on you

306
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:28,518
trading standards for your profit not

307
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,480
Brandon doing 20 years right well I mean

308
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,879
I think

309
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,079
one of the things about trading that

310
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,320
basically that's kind of why we get in

311
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,599
these arguments about medical because

312
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,240
medical always kind of in says well it

313
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,480
means standards doesn't it where

314
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,720
Recreation means PE PE whatever people

315
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,320
like and is I can get away with right

316
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,120
now which is a shifting what about Ken's

317
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,639
what he quote what he said today the guy

318
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,799
at our table instead of medical or

319
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,120
recreational he said I like to refer to

320
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:54,919
it as overthe counter and I was like I

321
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,200
thought unique yeah cuz everything

322
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:58,399
pretty much everything that you can be

323
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,200
sold over the counter has a guarantee do

324
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,480
not harm a within it that you can trust

325
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,360
it's when the guy gives you a

326
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,159
prescription that listen this stuff's

327
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,680
[ __ ] up you can get [ __ ] don't eat

328
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,679
more than two in a day so that over the

329
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,078
that over the counter trust means look

330
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:16,638
this has been you kind of stake your

331
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:17,799
karma on it as a brand and um I like the

332
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,560
I like the fact that you know everyone

333
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,639
says yeah I got my standards and it

334
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,679
doesn't [ __ ] up my chest but depending

335
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:25,320
on where your medicine is going you have

336
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,239
to be your standards have to meet where

337
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,639
it's going not yourself because I can be

338
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,919
a I can be a man that has a generation

339
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,919
of smokers that we're just going to take

340
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:38,519
it yeah it's not burning my chest and

341
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:40,958
but that's not that's always a trickle

342
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,360
down [ __ ] I'm like no if you f you

343
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,559
got to interact with your dispensaries

344
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,079
you got to where's this being used

345
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:48,518
anybody old using this is this being

346
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:50,559
used to for palea of care um cuz if so

347
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,720
then maybe these lipids or whatever I

348
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,119
have else in my product um is doing harm

349
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,320
again where for my buddies it's fine um

350
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,240
they're young and they can choose what

351
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,920
they want to choose and they like it um

352
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,120
I think there's got to be a choice level

353
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,759
and a jump in responsibility because

354
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
anything that could be provided over the

355
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,958
counter um you can pretty much sue if it

356
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,959
hurts you yeah and Sue big time and we

357
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,518
don't have that um here you're lucky if

358
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,958
you can bring back some weed that cuts

359
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,440
your throat well it's crazy all the

360
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,039
regulations on cannabis and they're

361
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,880
comparing it to alcohol and I'm just

362
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:22,599
like so this has like zero ld50 I don't

363
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,360
know what the ld50 for alcohol is but it

364
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,600
can't be that high alcohol's pretty de

365
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,839
it depends on the person it depends on

366
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,720
the person it can be pretty quick yeah

367
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,920
exactly so it's insane that we compare

368
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,320
it to what I would consider one of the

369
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:39,639
most um I I don't want to say dangerous

370
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,480
but I guess um it is gu it is linked to

371
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,519
so many deaths alcohol in so many

372
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,480
different uh ways through car accidents

373
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,399
or through spousal abuse or through

374
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,759
liver damage or through there's so many

375
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,039
different roads that lead back to death

376
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,720
with alcohol but it's incredible that we

377
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:58,198
could be discussing like oh well how

378
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,480
many milligrams should we allow it's

379
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:03,000
like no minimum like just whatever

380
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,079
people want like if people will buy

381
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,159
10,000 milligram treats then make make

382
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,838
people 10,000 Mig treats like why do you

383
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,958
want to make them eat 10,000 milligram

384
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,000
or worse like what was that guy saying

385
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:18,439
10 Mig yeah he just wanted to do that's

386
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,159
just over the top yeah the senator guy

387
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,959
he was like I think we should keep it to

388
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,879
10 okay maybe maybe 10 10 so you can

389
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,679
have 100 in your possession at a time

390
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:30,600
basically was like 100 milligrams would

391
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:32,559
be your maximum right Gorge yeah but

392
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,120
Bing that would be binge consumption

393
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,000
even baby MJ in the hospital here in

394
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,240
Vancouver is currently taking I believe

395
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,639
a th000 migs absolutely a day so look at

396
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,440
that and think of what he thinks is

397
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,079
binging in the you know she was just

398
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,639
prematurely born and she has all sorts

399
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:47,958
of problems with her it's it's a pretty

400
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,240
heavy story that's going on here right

401
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:52,439
now the the the the hospital sort of

402
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,320
took over and they they took um

403
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,519
possession of the child from through

404
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,680
child family services and then they said

405
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,078
that they were going to decide that they

406
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,958
were going to take this child off off of

407
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:02,519
the ventilator which would have been

408
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,559
maybe a death sentence for the child

409
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,078
saying that oh it's going to have

410
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:07,599
cerebral paly and all these other

411
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:09,319
problems uh well the young couple that

412
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,320
that are the parents they fought it got

413
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,040
a court injunction uh are giving the

414
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,399
baby cannabis oil because she has

415
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,639
seizures it's one of her problems and

416
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,679
it's helping alleviate and I think that

417
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,440
that's one thing that like I that I

418
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,719
really noticed about this conference is

419
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,800
is that um I think a lot of the people

420
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,560
that the legislators that we were we

421
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,439
were getting a chance to talk to really

422
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,799
have no idea about these things that

423
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,560
we're talking about like setting these

424
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,799
limits of hey a 10 mgram or 100

425
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:36,439
milligram is all you're allowed to be

426
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,599
able to have I think they have no idea

427
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,560
about these cases talking I think I'm

428
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,480
like how how can you do that chance to

429
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,278
talk to them it's like limiting research

430
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,839
that's exactly what it is I'm like

431
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,519
that's limiting medical research we

432
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,480
don't know how much it's going to take

433
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,440
to potentially solve spasms in someone

434
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,199
who's been shot so don't tell me we do

435
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,319
know treat it like alcohol we know that

436
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:58,278
everyone down there said over and over

437
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:00,559
and over again that it's all about the

438
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,879
patient PTI but I didn't really see any

439
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,278
patients invited to speak I think it

440
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,000
would have been good to have the patient

441
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,399
perspective and potentially get that

442
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,078
really unique a few really unique get

443
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,679
theing some bring in some guest speakers

444
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:15,519
Jessica Hawkins or the Nia Hawkins you

445
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,359
know just to kind of get a real a real

446
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,000
story on what they're actually a real

447
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,759
powerful story that is UN mutable it's

448
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,120
it's unarguable that's the future they

449
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,399
need to be told what needs to be done

450
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,480
I'm not I'm not getting the regulations

451
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,759
that made makes this ACC to everyone

452
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,759
like me I'm Notting theity of medicine

453
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,720
that my physical body needs I need more

454
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,680
yes I can trust cannabis but I cannot

455
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,720
trust all the in between parties and the

456
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,599
bottom line is it's a benign herb that

457
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,399
has no ld50 so on both of those sides of

458
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,680
the coin one that there are people

459
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,799
children in particular that are

460
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,958
extremely sick and suffering that need

461
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,439
much higher doses than the doses that

462
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,359
these Regulators are even considering

463
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,240
and that on the other side of that that

464
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,120
there is no ld50 for cannabis that there

465
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,240
is no uh detrimental dose that the worst

466
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,959
thing that you can have is just a a

467
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,959
bummer feeling it's like oh I ate too

468
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,078
much and yeah people and there's things

469
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,240
that counteract that's kind of why we're

470
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:14,279
so anal about what is cuz the thing is

471
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,038
it's not cannabis it's what's on it's

472
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,720
what can get in it's what can get passed

473
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,119
through so it's really a defense of the

474
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,439
plant to find I'm like there's no ld50

475
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,359
for cannabis but there is for what Some

476
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,000
Humans spray on it but the unique thing

477
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,879
about cannabis unlike any other

478
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,279
substance you can name is the Cannabis

479
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,000
comes with its own Protection Agency

480
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,720
which is these nucleation points in the

481
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,839
lungs these non-polar components that

482
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,880
protect the lungs I mean

483
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:42,359
I I couldn't understand it for years

484
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,280
when people were smoking the thick paper

485
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:46,119
with the glue on it just like ton and I

486
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:48,079
was just like Steve cubby was smoking

487
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:49,439
like ounces of weed a day and I was like

488
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,759
dude that can't be good for you and then

489
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,400
he went and got his lungs tested at some

490
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:54,679
crazy place in California and they were

491
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,280
like they were telling him that he had

492
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,720
the lungs of like a a young athlete and

493
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,678
he was like 48 years old old or

494
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,079
something at the time so it made me

495
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,080
realize it was before I knew about you

496
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,519
know Jim fra and him talking about what

497
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,158
I just literally mentioned about the

498
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:10,240
nucleation points and the non-polar

499
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:11,720
components it really made sense to me

500
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,480
when I learned that and it made me

501
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,400
realize wow that's really an important

502
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,599
factor for the BHO Community or any

503
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,519
Community using non-polar components to

504
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,798
make sure that you remove your nauseous

505
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,200
plant waxes that your product now no

506
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:27,158
longer has a safety net to protect you

507
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,640
from mhm so that's huge just get rid of

508
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:30,840
those nauseous plant waxes if you're

509
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,720
going to use a non-polar component

510
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,519
because you won't have polar components

511
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,279
present that are the nucleation points

512
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:39,599
in your lungs that do protect us from

513
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,079
papers and glues and all these nasty

514
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,599
things that are that are in cannabis

515
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,519
that somehow it's incredible I totally

516
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,359
get you cuz you know it's not like

517
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,359
there's a whole side of us that I

518
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,319
clearly smoke cigarettes with it and

519
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,319
wouldn't live without it and I'm I

520
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:55,359
wonder sometimes for the lifestyle I

521
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:57,359
lived I'm like are you saying the

522
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,000
[ __ ] cannabis protected me from the

523
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:02,119
cigarettes the alcohol alcohol the

524
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,359
boozing the toxins on the Cannabis the

525
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:06,599
[ __ ] [ __ ] it was handed to me with

526
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:08,959
and I'm like you know for the amount of

527
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,000
things I rely on today that should have

528
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,360
fallen apart for my current lifestyle

529
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,038
which is working to death in all these

530
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,639
new Realms I'm like yeah you know what I

531
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:18,319
would have died even now without

532
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,320
cannabis and probably back then so never

533
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:24,000
take my paranoia for the baby who

534
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:26,720
clearly can't take coughing up a lung um

535
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,440
right now for the fact that yes cannabis

536
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,600
does protect us against the things we've

537
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,320
done to cannabis but in pushing medicine

538
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:38,879
because what if there is that 10,000 mg

539
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:41,558
dose we can't let those um contaminants

540
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,720
also move with the current trends yeah

541
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:47,000
um to then ruin cannabis again and I

542
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,640
don't want to find out Mr does leave

543
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,240
permanent harm so let's get it out of

544
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,759
there before we ever get to a job big

545
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,480
enough that we concentrate too much of

546
00:19:52,759 --> 00:20:00,319
it and hurt a kid or kill a kid because

547
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,880
she convulsed um still run air you know

548
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,759
what uh we're going to we're going to

549
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,039
pause it on that incredible dialogue is

550
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,640
