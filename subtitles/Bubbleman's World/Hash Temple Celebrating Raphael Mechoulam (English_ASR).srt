America conference in keto um for a

62
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,078
couple of days and then I spent a week

63
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,799
in the rainforest uh with my daughter

64
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,280
Sarah and um

65
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,760
uh my business partner Nisha Whitley and

66
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,560
a friend of hers so it was

67
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,840
great yeah it looked spectacular I saw

68
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,479
nisha's um photography so I saw a little

69
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,560
bit of the stuff you guys like staring

70
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,358
at giant snakes on the side of the on

71
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,238
the river banks and stuff it looked

72
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,959
pretty wild

73
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:26,638
right we got some folks in the room here

74
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:29,038
linking up with us to hear about rafie

75
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,038
today thanks for the idea by the way Dr

76
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:34,319
Mark I think uh it's crazy how hash

77
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,839
church has just turned into like

78
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,519
gathering for people that we have lost

79
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,638
in the last little while there's been a

80
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:44,198
lot of that sort of going on so I guess

81
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,120
uh I'll never forget skunkman Sam I

82
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,600
think he was probably in his 50s when he

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,720
told me this but he said more of my

84
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,160
friends are dying now than I'm making

85
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,440
friends and I was still like in my 30s

86
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,000
and thought well that's a weird

87
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,879
statement I can't imagine that but now

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,800
as I approach 50 at the end of the month

89
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,639
here March 3 first I'll be 50 years old

90
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,240
I have to say it's very accurate I um

91
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,560
seem to be losing more friends than I'm

92
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,680
making friends these days so I guess

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,319
that's the uh the way life goes

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,439
sometimes yeah well it goes for mentors

95
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:20,599
as well I don't have a lot left I'm

96
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:24,279
afraid at this

97
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,000
point no I can imagine that's uh yeah we

98
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:29,758
all you know if you're lucky you get

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,360
older and I say that because my father

100
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,800
passed away at a very young age he was

101
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,240
only 55 years old and his wife was only

102
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,800
49 years old and so um I hear people

103
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,600
complaining about getting older and

104
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,478
they're like oh this and that it's no

105
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,400
it's not a walk in the park anymore but

106
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,800
it's like but you're lucky if you're

107
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,198
getting older so try to remember that

108
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,879
out

109
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,199
there it's better than the alternative

110
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,719
right if you're not getting older you're

111
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,240
dead I mean I think so personally I

112
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,199
think that there's the random person

113
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,680
that doesn't think that but uh I like to

114
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,319
stay POS positive and think that uh yeah

115
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,800
it's good to stay it's good to stay on

116
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,080
the on the

117
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,478
upside how are you doing Rob it's been

118
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:14,120

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,639
at the moment I'm here continuing to try

127
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:39,240
to move out of my apartment it's going

128
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,079
to happen this summer I suppose and I'm

129
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,519
all packed up pretty

130
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:47,120
much dude that's unbelievable your

131
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:49,758
apartment spot I moved in here um

132
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,079
exactly 30 years ago on this coming

133
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,800
April 1 and who gets the place I guess

134
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,359
my landlord gets it back I hope he's

135
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,560
happy with it he'll he'll get it and

136
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,720
remodel it it never be the ghetto that

137
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,959
it is ever

138
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,080
again well lots of good times in that

139
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,758
apartment I I'll miss that apartment

140
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,878
myself oh I've had a great bunch of

141
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,000
times here for sure I was shocked when I

142
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,840
read my lease few months ago I thought I

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
lived here for more than 20 years I said

144
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,799
to myself yeah I don't know put a number

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,639
on it I felt like 22 or three something

146
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,840
like that then I got the lease I holy

147
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:30,720
[ __ ] 29 years time flies when you're

148
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,519
having fun so yeah is unbelievable

149
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,800
that's just not something that really

150
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,639
exists that much in North America like

151
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,598
leasing a place for like 30 years that

152
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,000
you live in I mean I I leased house I I

153
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:45,478
leased in rented houses for 20 plus

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,839
years and it I was lucky if I got like

155
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,519
four years and I didn't have to move

156
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,560
again you know we were just constantly

157
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:55,918
forced into moving and uh yeah well

158
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,800
thought I was G to live in any one city

159
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,918
for this long I would have bought an

160
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,598
apartment I feel pretty stupid have

161
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,279
rented it for so long but I never really

162
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,839
thought I was going to stay here I just

163
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:09,799
never left I guess there's a difference

164
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:13,439
but yeah it uh I didn't consciously hang

165
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,680
here really but anyway that's how it

166
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,719
goes awesome I don't know what the

167
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,199
chat's doing for me right now but when I

168
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,520
punch anything into the chat no one

169
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,960
replies so it'll be a little bit rough

170
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:28,240
trying to communicate with the folks

171
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,239
that are watching right now it does say

172
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,399
that we have a couple

173
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,200
people in here watching

174
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,799
[Music]

175
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,680
just I think it's just the the speed of

176
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:44,038
my computer um I I guarantee it's on my

177
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,278
side not uh anything else but it's

178
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:47,480
unfortunate because I usually like to

179
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,200
pay attention to the chat and engage

180
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,759
with the people who are watching so we

181
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,440
can maybe you'll have to uh do that Dr

182
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:58,000
Mark yeah sure I I'll Rel anything I

183
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,399
think it's

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,078
pretty so I think I think it was 2014

185
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,879
maybe 2015 I don't know maybe Dr Ethan

186
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:09,879
would remember better than I would but

187
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:12,399
um for me the one and only real time

188
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:15,559
that I actually spent time with uh with

189
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:19,360
Rafi was at the international canabo

190
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:21,278
research um event in Liden Holland I I

191
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,000
went to the one in Leiden Holland I

192
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,360
can't remember the year was it 2018 or

193
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,919
2014 they do it in a different place

194
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,120
every year so it's uh kind of hard to

195
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,679
remember but that's where I got the

196
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,879
photo um that I used as the avatar for

197
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,679
this particular hash church and I just

198
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,720
uh I just approached him and you know

199
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,399
kind of gave my respects and said it was

200
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,680
really cool the work that he had done

201
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,720
and that uh had a small conversation

202
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:50,120
with him and uh managed to get that

203
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:54,320
photo and so obviously um his work was

204
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,078
profound in our in in what we do in in

205
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,278
everything that we do so it's uh I

206
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:58,519
thought it would be a good idea well

207
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,439
Mark really thought it would be a good

208
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:05,240
idea to gather and uh to join all the

209
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,600
fellows that are here I mean Sam and uh

210
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,560
Rob had hoard a farm for years and years

211
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,079
and years and I'm sure their paths must

212
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:14,518
have crossed with uh at least with

213
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,599
rafi's work I'm sure you probably met

214
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,720
him multiple times and I know you did as

215
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,360
well Dr Ethan Russo so maybe we could uh

216
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,680
you know tell tell some some stories of

217
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,278
how we how you guys met and some of the

218
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:29,078
interactions that you had over the years

219
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:33,159
and maybe how his work impacted the work

220
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:33,159
that uh that you guys would have

221
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,319
done and I'll try to get this YouTube

222
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,639
chat

223
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,160
going uh do you need somebody to lead

224
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,200
off yeah any any one of you guys are

225
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:50,838
welcome to to lead off it's super loose

226
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,879
you know okay I'd be happy to uh first I

227
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,079
appreciate this opportunity I think

228
00:10:52,879 --> 00:11:00,720
possibly we should rename this hash

229
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:05,120
temple in his memory um but um I also

230
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:08,000
want a plug for um Shango Los and I

231
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,919
recorded an episode of shaping fire on

232
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,639
Friday and it's already posted as of

233
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:17,360
yesterday so shaping fire um if you look

234
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,399
for that um we've got about an hour and

235
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,560
20 minutes uh conversation back and

236
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:27,559
forth uh be supplemental to what we do

237
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:30,239
here today um so I knew of rafy's work

238
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:33,278
uh for many years before I actually met

239
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,519
him um you know I was already working in

240
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:40,799
the Cannabis space for three years when

241
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:43,919
I met him the same time I uh met uh Rob

242
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:48,159
and and David uh for the first time in

243
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:52,240
aapco in 1999 at the icrs

244
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:54,679
meeting so um we established a good

245
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,680
rapport pretty much immediately he

246
00:11:54,679 --> 00:12:00,599
recognized uh my name as one that uh

247
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,719
could have been Israeli and uh turned

248
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,639
out he was born to a sapharic Jewish

249
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Family in Sophia Bulgaria in

250
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:14,600
1930 my family came from nearby uh in

251
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:19,199
Macedonia a town called moner now called

252
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:22,159
Bola um so there was that also I was

253
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:24,759
getting a certain credibility by being a

254
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,240
physician in the space where it was

255
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:30,600
mainly bench scientists and renegades

256
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:34,079
like Rob and Dave um

257
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,360
so that was the composition of ICS then

258
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:40,319
but um we

259
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,360
certainly his work heavily influenced me

260
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,760
uh

261
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,759
additionally uh we work together quite

262
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:49,958
extensively at GW

263
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:52,720
Pharmaceuticals between uh 2003 and 2014

264
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:56,879
when I was senior medical advisor there

265
00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:00,440
he was attending um the annual meetings

266
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,838
research meetings where um it was

267
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,800
decided uh what kind of work would be

268
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:09,920
done on the various phyto canabo whether

269
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:14,159
it be THC CBD a lot of the work on CBD

270
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:20,078
was initiated there mostly um among

271
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:22,799
European scientists um and uh I talled

272
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:26,159
it up the other day we were together at

273
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,639
one meeting or another icrs or the

274
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,719
International Association for

275
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:33,680
cannabinoid medicine meeting he was

276
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:37,000
heavily involved in clinical work um so

277
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:40,319
between those so we were together in 14

278
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,519
countries um and I was really fortunate

279
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:47,839
to be able to share many a meal with him

280
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,440
and his wonderful wife Dalia um so it

281
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,759
was a a close

282
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,880
relationship of course they have stories

283
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,560
um one of my favorites was somewhere

284
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:02,039
around

285
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:05,439
2008 we in London and he uh tried to

286
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:07,759
introduce me to Y gar who I already knew

287
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,800
uh but he said something along the lines

288
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:15,320
of uh this is my friend Ethan Russo and

289
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:17,799
then he said he has many crazy ideas so

290
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,079
uh to me that was a high compliment and

291
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:25,758
I've always bragged about it ever since

292
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:27,278
um um I was also really pleased uh in

293
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,440
2005

294
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,759
um his last book B was released and he

295
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:37,880
had asked me to write the first chapter

296
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:40,759
of that on cannabis in India um so again

297
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:43,320
um I'll always remember for bragging

298
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,199
rights um but I I'll let people go

299
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,560
around we can certainly talk about all

300
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:51,319
the scientific developments uh that he

301
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:51,319
spearheaded or in which he was

302
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,079
involved thanks Ethan appreciate that

303
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,879
just uh kind of reading the chat here um

304
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:04,719
one one question from the chat was can

305
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,000
can Ethan explain the distinction for

306
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,959
Raphael being credited with discovering

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,559
or isolating cannabinoids please sure

308
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,758
okay well you know this had a real

309
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,319
history um back in the 19th century

310
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,320
chemists around the world were trying to

311
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,360
figure out what the active ingredients

312
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,720
were in psychoactive plants so they had

313
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,919
great success with the Opium poppy they

314
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,680
found morphine somewhere around

315
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:32,679
1804 also cocaine cocoa leaves but

316
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:35,278
working on cannabis they were sort of

317
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:40,599
stumped um they could get it down to

318
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:43,039
this red oil um someone in 1896 isolated

319
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,159
what they call canaban but it wasn't

320
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:50,039
pure um subsequently low in the United

321
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:52,679
States after being a refugee from

322
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,519
Germany um sort of had the structure of

323
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:58,399
canaba in

324
00:15:54,519 --> 00:16:04,278
1940 uh but it wasn't until rafy and his

325
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:06,000
associates it's um goni and Sho um 1963

326
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,198
kneeled down the three-dimensional

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,600
structure of canaba dial and then of

328
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:16,000
course the next year in

329
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:19,319
64 um they uh isolated and synthesized

330
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,440
tetrahydro canab andol known to

331
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:26,719
us but it didn't stop there um that same

332
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:30,639
year they isolated canaba gereral and

333
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,079
had the preci to uh note that it seemed

334
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,680
to be the parent compound of the other

335
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:40,399
canabo but that same year they found the

336
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:43,719
real parents the cannabinoid acids uh

337
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:47,720
cbda uh cbga

338
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:52,319
cbna and then in 66 they found canab

339
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,959
chromin um and uh went on from there um

340
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:58,240
so yeah I mean people could argue that

341
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:02,919
uh canaba was discovered by low earlier

342
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,599
but um Roger Adams Roger Roger Adams was

343
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,519
the first one to isolate CBD from

344
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,519
Minnesota Wild I think that's who you're

345
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,599
referring to right sure I'm sorry that's

346
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:15,000
right loow was working in the canaban

347
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:19,480
wood field it was Adams Roger Adams so I

348
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,558
stand corrected there um but uh went on

349
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:27,480
from there I mean rafy's work never

350
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:32,839
stopped um after the discovery of the

351
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:36,640
CB1 canaban receptor in 1988 and 90 um

352
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:39,639
they isolated anandamide the first uh

353
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:44,520
endoc canabo that work done with Bill

354
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:47,240
Deane and lumir hanou um and then a few

355
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,960
years later they found two aric adonal

356
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:54,079
glycerol 2 AG in

357
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:57,079
1995 and went on from there so I think

358
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,079
that addresses the

359
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:02,399
question yes thank you there's always

360
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,639
you know one person in the chat uh

361
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,919
making sure that the history is accurate

362
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,080
so we got Steve from poton ponic just

363
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,720
left right that's not true this was the

364
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,199
it was this guy it was this guy it was

365
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,279
this guy it was this guy I trust that Dr

366
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,360
Ethan Russo knows the history Ethan

367
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:21,839
Ethan You' love to know I mean how many

368
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:24,839
people who just think that he was the

369
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:28,599
first to discover THC and he was the

370
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:31,918
first to isolate THC when we all know

371
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:34,519
and and and Rafi no too he re he

372
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:39,400
referenced all this work very accurately

373
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:41,720
humbly in in his papers back to uh the

374
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,038
woods bivy easterfield

375
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:49,640
isolation that you reference in 1896

376
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:52,798
were the first folks to isolate you know

377
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,600
distilled canabo the first people to

378
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:59,720
make distillate I guess you'd say right

379
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:03,199
and then it was really um Robert S Con

380
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:07,159
in in in in in four backtack papers in

381
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,200
the early 30s who really took so they

382
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,480
they knew the thing that was confusing

383
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,640
them is is that back in the day this was

384
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,240
before spectroscopy and before all this

385
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,679
analytical instrumentation and what they

386
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,120
often would do is they would perform

387
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:25,360
chemical reactions on these natural

388
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:27,319
extracts to try to identify the product

389
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,959
of these chemical reactions and

390
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:33,319
sometimes they would be treating with

391
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,960
like concentrated nitric acid in fact

392
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:38,599
that was one of the derivatives that

393
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,840
that the wood Spivy uh easterfield group

394
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:45,359
made in fact I believe it was Spivy was

395
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:48,119
actually killed in a in an explosion in

396
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:51,079
the laboratory during some of that work

397
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:54,000
when they were working with that really

398
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:56,519
um explosive nitration chemistry the

399
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,720
same thing that killed one of the people

400
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:02,359
in The Dupont family that was making

401
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,319
nitrates for explosives so this this

402
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:08,399
chemistry was often just very harsh and

403
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:11,158
would tear up these molecules and and

404
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,600
and a lot of times like like when you

405
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,520
think of heroin heroin is the acetate

406
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,119
right and so they would make these

407
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:21,440
derivatives and sometimes be able to

408
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:23,158
purify these chemical derivatives and so

409
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,279
like I know there's been a lot of

410
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:29,000
interest in THC acetate these days this

411
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,639
was actually uh one of the typical

412
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,359
derivatizations that they would do when

413
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,600
they isolated a compound that had a free

414
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:39,839
o or a free phenol and wood in SP and

415
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,639
easterfield carried out enough detective

416
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:45,359
work and their original work to know

417
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,480
that there was a free there was a free

418
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,678
phenol so that's why they named the

419
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,839
compound canaban and you're right it was

420
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,880
a mixture of compounds but if you look

421
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:58,359
at their boiling points and you plot

422
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,880
their boiling points on something called

423
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:04,000
a nomograph which corrects for the the

424
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,120
vacuum pressure at which that fraction

425
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,319
is collected under vacuum it corrects it

426
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:14,599
for uh you know the the boiling point at

427
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:17,480
at at at at standard pressure and often

428
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:19,480
when boiling points were reported and

429
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,159
you know this Ethan because some some of

430
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,360
these are in some of your own papers it

431
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,559
often got reported as this is the

432
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:30,599
boiling point of THC but they forgot to

433
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:33,599
mention that it was measured under this

434
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:35,839
vacuum pressure and so the boiling point

435
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,119
at at atmospheric pressure was much much

436
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,759
higher but the point is is that if you

437
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:42,359
look at the boiling point of what Woods

438
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:45,640
Spivy and easterfield

439
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:49,359
isolated it is smacked on the boiling

440
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,559
point of what Rafi isolated several

441
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,278
years later and so that I think is is

442
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:58,200
the nail in the coffin that those people

443
00:21:54,278 --> 00:22:01,278
did indeed ident or isolate THC it was

444
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,400
probably mixture of the Ring isomer

445
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:06,400
Delta 8 Delta 9 who knows right yeah now

446
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,919
we're g to quibble about history we also

447
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,919
have to give credit to the checks I mean

448
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:14,240
uh speaking to lumir hanu it's apparent

449
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,278
that a tremendous amount of work was

450
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:22,159
accomplished in earlier in the 50s on

451
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:25,839
these compounds but it was uh because of

452
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,080
Soviet influence or communist influence

453
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:32,000
that was published in check and was

454
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:36,839
never accessible to people in other

455
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,319
countries but um be that as it may rafy

456
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,879
got the credit um and certainly with

457
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:45,319
these other substances uh he was the

458
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,679
clear winner um with most of them at

459
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:51,918
least um in isolating them and helping

460
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:55,720
to figure out what they did well he he

461
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,640
had proton NMR which just was invented

462
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,679
in the early 60s that Roger Adams and

463
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,640
the previous chem so and and and I think

464
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,640
you know Rafi would totally admit that

465
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,720
he stood on the shoulders of Adams and

466
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,679
and brango and all those people Khan and

467
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,200
everybody who came before him because I

468
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:18,038
think there was always ambiguity over

469
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,319
the position of the double bond Ethan if

470
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:24,440
you look at some of Roger Adams papers

471
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:27,119
from 1940 you'll see that he represents

472
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,759
Tetra Hydro canabidol with just the

473
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:32,079
double bond in like either Delta 7 or

474
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:35,079
Delta 6 it's just in an odd position

475
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:38,119
because they had no clue I mean this is

476
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,199
this is during during the war man I it's

477
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:44,079
like it's amazing that that work was

478
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:47,360
even done and um and uh he was the first

479
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:50,960
one that hydrogenated so he

480
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:54,158
hydrogenated THC that they isolated from

481
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,558
conversion of CBD and he talked about

482
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,679
the acid catalyzed conversion of CBD

483
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:00,639
over into THC and hydrogenated it to

484
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,919
make

485
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:08,720
hhc and then uh patented it uh claiming

486
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:10,600
a compound with marijuana like

487
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,200
activity which I always thought was

488
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:14,959
interesting somebody in the lab must

489
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,960
have tried it

490
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:24,440
right chemistry chuckle I like that

491
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:27,200
appreciate the

492
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:30,278
stories lots of people in chat talking

493
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,759
about this hydrogenate

494
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:35,599
canono everyone's got lots to say about

495
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:38,879
it it's really impactful like Ethan said

496
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:41,639
when you lose a mentor because mentors

497
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,960
have this incredible impact on the

498
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,278
community because they've mentored

499
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:52,840
scientists who've gone on to be mentors

500
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:57,038
themselves and so it's like a a chemical

501
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:59,639
family connection that you have back to

502
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:05,240
your your mentor

503
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:08,399
and um um I never met Professor michul

504
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:13,000
but we corresponded quite a bit um and

505
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:15,719
um by the time um I became an active

506
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,558
chemist in cannabis chemistry he wasn't

507
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:22,399
taking any more collaborations but I

508
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:24,038
think he found great um interest in what

509
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:27,639
and what I was doing in some of the

510
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:30,319
ideas and counseled me and sent me all

511
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:35,200
kinds of paper ERS and I think he

512
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:37,918
enjoyed his um his Fame in a certain way

513
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,679
because I think he kind of understood

514
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,360
that there were chemists like me and

515
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:46,798
other scientists throughout the world

516
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:50,839
that have now jumped in feet first into

517
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:53,918
canono science mostly based on on his

518
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:56,639
inspiration and his story his story is

519
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,720
just incredible right Ethan it's just

520
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,360
it's just a it's a story it's a story

521
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,960
about the war it's a story about you

522
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:10,079
know Israel it's a story about how the

523
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:13,399
ni told them to go pound salt

524
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:15,119
until um the the director from NIH went

525
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:18,239
over there and then grabbed a bunch of

526
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,319
THC brought it back to to Bethesda and

527
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,120
that's the world

528
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:27,519
Supply yeah I I can elaborate on that a

529
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:30,678
bit um so rafie tells the sto would tell

530
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:34,079
the story that um uh when he first

531
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:37,200
applied to NIH as Mark said they turned

532
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:41,439
him down and the explanation was well

533
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:44,960
nobody nobody uh uses cannabis in this

534
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:48,278
country which obviously wasn't true but

535
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:52,600
uh the tune changed apparently uh the

536
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:56,919
son of a senator got busted for quote

537
00:26:52,599 --> 00:27:00,519
marijuana um and uh Senator was worried

538
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:02,600
that uh this is make him crazy forever

539
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,200
um suddenly he had funding and he had

540
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:06,519
funding through NIH for 40 years and

541
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,919
it's true

542
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:13,960
that um NIH asked for the total

543
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:18,278
synthesized supply of uh THC which was

544
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:20,919
something like 25 grams at that time um

545
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:24,919
and they kept coming back um so it meant

546
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:29,440
more hashish had to be processed and at

547
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:33,000
that time um this was seized from uh

548
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,080
Police Supplies um how the hasi got

549
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,079
there was interesting too because it was

550
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:40,079
grown in Lebanon and it' be thrown over

551
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:45,639
the barbwire fence presumably there was

552
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:45,639
an exchange of money involved but um you

553
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:55,918
know I just uh was in Barcelona and I

554
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,519
met some Lebanese gentlemen and they

555
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,200
gave me the most beautiful pie piece of

556
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:04,159
red Lebanese hash I've seen in a very

557
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,558
very long time yeah that looks like what

558
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,519
we were seeing in the 70s yeah it's all

559
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:11,678
traditional cultivars traditional

560
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,440
methodologies they're younger guys but

561
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,200
they're

562
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,720
following uh you know the tradition and

563
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,600
it was just great to uh I what I really

564
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,038
loved about it was you know

565
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,879
simultaneously there was a woman we were

566
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,759
at HQ in Barcelona my friend David's

567
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,760
club we were in this sort of upstairs

568
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,200
private area that you know shout out to

569
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,038
Frenchie can onlyi because the last time

570
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,840
I got to spend time with Frenchie and

571
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:38,240
smoke with Frenchie was at HQ In This

572
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:41,839
Very spot where I met these uh Lebanese

573
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,679
gentlemen and so I was there at HQ uh it

574
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:45,879
was the end of the event when I landed

575
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,399
at the event I was a judge for masters

576
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,240
of rosin and the Masters of rosin was a

577
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:53,959
competition with 64

578
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,798
entries and basically half a gram per

579
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,720
entry for the judge so it was 32 grams

580
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:01,480
of live hash rosin that was given to me

581
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,679
as I landed in uh the at the airport in

582
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,960
Barcelona half an hour later I had all

583
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,960
this Ro live hash rosin and so I was

584
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,240
giving out the last little jars little

585
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,278
quarter grams little tenth of grams just

586
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,440
to the people in HQ and the first group

587
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:18,079
that I approached were these guys from

588
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,080
from Lebanon they're actually Armenian

589
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,678
and

590
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:23,759
Lebanese and so they pulled out this

591
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,679
Lebanese hash I said come on up to this

592
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,440
little private area we'll try smoking

593
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,840
some and there was a girl up there John

594
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:35,080
Burell who has a com who works for a

595
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:37,439
company called flute FL Lut TT I believe

596
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:40,398
and it's one of these cups that sits on

597
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,440
a base and vaporizes the smoke into the

598
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,319
cup and then you drink you drink the The

599
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,798
Vapor I tried a few before and wasn't

600
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:50,158
impressed with them at all but this unit

601
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:52,720
was unbelievable and how how effective

602
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,600
it was now the the this Lebanese hash

603
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,079
was very melty it was um we had a hash

604
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,839
Kettle that we tried to make a snake out

605
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,558
out and put it into the hash Kettle but

606
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,158
when my buddy lit it it just was

607
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:06,879
Dripping and and and melting so it was a

608
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,799
very nice caliber of hash anyway this

609
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,760
cup was the perfect way you just put it

610
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:14,918
into the little um coil very much like a

611
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:17,398
puffco or a a Carta or any of these

612
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:19,799
units and she put the cup on the base

613
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:22,239
and it filled up super psychedelically

614
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:26,398
with this really neat Smoky Vapor right

615
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,200
to the top and I I I I swigged it down

616
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,199
and I just had to say like from taking

617
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,840
the moon rides with the live hash Ros

618
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,679
and you know the rocket ship to the Moon

619
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:37,319
every hit you take I was very impressed

620
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,640
with the flavor and the and the the

621
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:42,319
effects of the Lebanese hash it was just

622
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,159
very very different I think that a lot

623
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:47,918
of people that are smoking these very

624
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:49,720
pure full melts and live has rosins

625
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,679
would have an appreciation if they could

626
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,519
access product like that and be able to

627
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,320
smoke it in a very particular way that

628
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,919
still made it enjoyable the high was

629
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:03,079
completely different in in every way it

630
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:05,360
was just uh it made me appreciate um

631
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:07,240
that traditional hash and obviously you

632
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:10,158
know it was done very well as you can

633
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:13,200
even just see from the pictures but uh

634
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:17,240
was there a a COA on that

635
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,880
material there was no COA that I you

636
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,759
know these were just couple of dudes

637
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,039
that had it but I'm in touch with them

638
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:24,960
they've invited me to Lebanon I've told

639
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,919
them that I would love to go there and

640
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,798
bring some hash making techniques and

641
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,840
maybe learn some Trad traditional hash

642
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,798
makinging techniques and so I'm going to

643
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:35,638
keep the uh connection with them they're

644
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:38,599
very excited and just very gung-ho guys

645
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:40,759
and uh I I just couldn't believe the

646
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:43,759
caliber of of hash that they had from

647
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:45,679
Lebanon it was uh it was shocking to say

648
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:49,679
the

649
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:57,679
least well I I can step in with a little

650
00:31:49,679 --> 00:32:00,960
bit uh I first met Dr mulam in 1993 when

651
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,919
I joined the at that time it was the

652
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,960
international cannabis research Society

653
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:11,840
later changed to the conoid research

654
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:17,798
Society but uh so I went to the Toronto

655

meeting uh of the icrs in

656
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,798
1993 and uh that's the first one I

657
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:26,798
attended I believe it was their fourth

658
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:30,879
of 33 meetings that they've had so far

659
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:35,000
yearly uh I lik Dr Mulan from the first

660
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,760
time we met uh his love of cannabis the

661
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,599
cannaboids and the endoc canabo system

662
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:44,278
and his belief in their importance to

663
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:46,519
medicine and uh is something that both

664
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:50,200
of us really shared

665
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:54,159
deeply uh he was kind enough to help my

666
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:58,480
cannabis R&amp;D company uh the first

667
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,039
company uh licensed in the world uh

668
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,240
to

669
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:05,879
uh do research and development with

670
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,038
cannabis and grow and breed cannabis for

671
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,799
medical use he

672
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:14,839
participated in the filming of a

673
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:20,679
documentary by a Dutch Dutch Science

674
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:22,359
Program n light uh broadcast on Dutch TV

675
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:25,159
in the

676
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:27,879
mid90s uh about the future of medical

677
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:32,840
cannabis he felt very strongly about it

678
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:37,278
the canids and endoc canids and uh they

679
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:40,240
filmed uh rafie walking through my 1

680
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:42,880
acre greenhouse in Holland swelling the

681
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,519
individual plants and talking to the

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,080
norite film crew and uh several other

683
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:54,000
people who were interviewing him on the

684
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:57,119
film uh at the time many people in the

685
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,319
government uh the government authorities

686
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,199
scientists

687
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,278
and doctors included really did not

688
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,759
believe cannabis had a future in

689
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:10,320
medicine uh I knew it did as Dr mulam of

690
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:12,398
course

691
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,039
knew

692
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:20,759
uh he visited my home with his wife

693
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:25,639

00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:23,598
show that tpes were able to uh

709
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:28,079
potentiate and uh modulate uh THC and

710
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:32,079
the other conoids and uh

711
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:35,880
he was really interested in that but uh

712
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:39,640
he was a scientist uh I I was really a

713
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:43,280
pot grower or cannabis grower but uh we

714
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:48,118

exists and it's a place and it's a

725
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,000
platform that if we ever do want to to

you just Decades of like oh how many de

737
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:41,000
like Rob I thought I lived here for 20

738
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,200
years it's like well it's been

739
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,480
30 just a whole extra decade that you

740
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:50,759
sort of missed there but it was it it

741
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,760
happened pretty

742
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:56,119
loud that's S I just got my little guy

743
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,799
talking in the background here I'll

744
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,838
probably mute it out if someone else

745
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,920
wants to go into his

746
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:08,239
story um yeah I'd like to say a couple

747
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:12,639
other things if I could um rafie was a

748
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:15,598
real International character and um he

749
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:19,679
easily could have gotten mixed up in the

750
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:23,599
politics um rather than the science uh

751
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:26,078
related to cannabis but um in 2002 I had

752
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:29,079
a research project in Morocco we were

753
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:32,599
looking at how can affected night vision

754
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:37,440
which had improves um anyway I was a

755
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:42,400
little bit uh concerned there um but I

756
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:45,559
was fascinated to see how uh rafie was

757
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,079
revered uh in the science community in

758
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:52,318
Morocco everybody asked me about it and

759
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,960
um they knew that I knew him and just

760
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:57,759
constant questions and uh the respect

761
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,358
was uh so obvious

762
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,240
um same thing when uh we met in

763
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:08,239
1999 I wondered what his relationship

764
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:10,559
was with Mahmud El who of course uh runs

765
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:13,239
the cannabis farm at the University of

766
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,960
Mississippi he he was Egyptian by birth

767
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:18,838
but they've been colleagues Forever

768
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,519
on as far as I know politics never

769
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:24,400
entered into their

770
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:28,119
relationship additionally uh Rafi had

771
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,119
Palestinian scientists in his lab um so

772
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,680
you know we certainly need more of that

773
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,680
kind of attitude in the

774
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:43,599
world roie also uh was I had asked him

775
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,599
about Israeli politics I said the the

776
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,280
fundamentalists G is they seem to be

777
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:52,079
taking over this was I don't know 10

778
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,599
years ago or even longer and uh he said

779
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,960
yeah well we need to separate the church

780
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,960
from the state well

781
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,000
religion from the state but uh he says

782
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:09,119
the right-wingers in Israel just don't

783
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,559
want that to happen and uh he he thought

784
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,960
he privately told me he thought they

785
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,960
were all

786
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:19,239
crazy well you know I'd apply that to

787
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:22,000
fundamentalists of any structure so I

788
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:22,000
would agree with

789
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,240
you are there any hashish

790
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,200
fundamentalists out there that insists

791
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:32,679
that you smoke it a very specific way

792
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:35,000
and process it a very specific

793
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:36,759
way it's the same thing as cannabis

794
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,039
Growers everybody thinks they have the

795
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,040
best stuff don't they

796
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,119
right Ethan let me ask a question so you

797
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:50,199
know AR

798
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,720
arguably arguably I think his most

799
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:55,000
important

800
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:57,399
contribution is the the fundamental

801
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,838
discovery of the endoc canabo system

802
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:05,079
system and its impact in medicine and

803
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:08,239
everyone talked about how oh this is

804
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:11,240
Nobel worthy and he should win the Nobel

805
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,318
Prize in medicine and when you consider

806
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:16,439
all of the medicines that have been

807
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:18,599
develop that act on the endoc canabo

808
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,679
system that have nothing to do with

809
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,960
phyto

810
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:25,598
canabo why why do you think that there

811
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,720
was politics and the negative stigma of

812
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:32,519
the plant that that held up that that

813
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:34,519
Nobel Prize which almost seemed obvious

814
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,639
and at some point just seemed laughable

815
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:39,039
that he wasn't going to get it I

816
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:42,759
heartily agree this is a subject of

817
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:45,599
discussion amongst many of us in the uh

818
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,599
canabo scientific Community we didn't

819
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,880
discuss it with rafy per se but I

820
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:54,960
discussed it with uh one of the

821
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,838
scientists resident in uh Sweden and he

822
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,039
was going to look into it the nom ation

823
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:04,039
process is a very Byzantine one uh it's

824
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:06,400
not something where you know I or you or

825
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:08,639
anybody else can just suggest the

826
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,960
committee that this person is

827
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:13,838
deserving I have to think but I don't

828
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,960
have substantiation on this that it

829
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:19,400
really had to do with prohibitionist

830
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,720
policies in Sweden maybe Rob would like

831
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,200
to address that further but I just say I

832
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:27,399
think it's a crying shame that he didn't

833
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,358
receive this and he can't now because

834
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,079
they're never awarded

835
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:35,400
ously um they did um someone was

836
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,119
nominated and died in the interim and

837
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:41,480
they gave it to his family but um once

838
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:43,039
you're dead you don't get it um Rob do

839
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,960
you want to say something more about

840
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:47,800
that any

841
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:52,679
insight oh I just have uh recent

842
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:55,039
insights on on Sweden but uh there is

843
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:58,078
very little of any cannabis research

844
00:41:55,039 --> 00:42:02,358
going on in Sweden um although Sweden

845
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,960
does um handsomely Grant people to do

846
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:05,318
all kinds of different things I mean

847
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,119
they have a very good system in that

848
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:10,519
regard but there's uh especially on that

849
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:13,000
background a real poity of science

850
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:15,759
evidence and and it extends over to the

851
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,960
industrial hemp side as well there are

852
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,200
still projects trying to to get things

853
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,480
together in Sweden but

854
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:25,558
they're it's kind of an echo of projects

855
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,159
that were tried to be accomplished 20

856
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:31,079
years ago and longer that there's not

857
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:33,519
not really any new fire there and the

858
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,680
government is well able to help these

859
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:37,280
things should they wish

860
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,919
to

861
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,319
sure yeah the scientist that I had

862
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,039
talked to years ago about the Nobel

863
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:49,119
nomination for rafie is no longer active

864
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:53,400
in the field um at least I haven't seen

865
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:56,240
him at meetings in quite a long time um

866
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,000
so again I think you're quite right he

867
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:02,039
had students at the time that were doing

868
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,079
good work but um as usual they probably

869
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:07,358
found jobs in other areas um and this

870
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:11,039
has been a problem throughout I can't

871
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:13,679
tell you the number of excellent canono

872
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:15,838
chemists and uh scientists of other

873
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,399
disciplines who had to find jobs in

874
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,799
other fields hopefully that's changing

875
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,358
now certainly we need a lot of

876
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:28,920
analytical chemist to deal with um uh

877
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:32,078
the output from uh us if not other

878
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,680
countries I I think a lot of people have

879
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,920
this experience I mean Rob when you were

880
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:41,719
graduating uh from Indiana

881
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:47,358
University uh you had the same problem

882
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:50,439
you you your uh Mentor uh excuse me I

883
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:55,759
forgot your your the professor's name

884
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:57,599
there malberg malberg yes he he said

885
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,400
what are you ever going to do with this

886
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:04,000
knowledge I mean you can't you can't get

887
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,720
a job with

888
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,239
cannabis he wasn't he wasn't a guy who

889
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:11,000
just liked to study things like me had

890
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:14,838
to be practical you

891
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,239
know however rest in peace Paul Gordon

892
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:21,440
malberg did pass away not too long ago

893
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:24,399
and uh okay yeah and he

894
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,480
uh he was a just a real straight sort of

895
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,960
slus guy his one claim to fame that I

896
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,480
always really got a kick out of because

897
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,800
it's so different from the rest of his

898
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:35,880
personality was that uh he got a hold of

899
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:39,079
some of the limited number of moon rock

900
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:42,559
samples that came back so around the

901
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:44,680
department he was known as Moon Rock

902
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,040
smallberg but that that was his real

903
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:52,199
claim to fame in my mind but well Dr

904
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:54,639
malberg also uh had Carl hilig under him

905
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:58,318
and that really picked off the

906
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,920
classification change mhm

907
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,279
now good work came out of his lab a lot

908
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,280
of other good stuff too good uh gland

909
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,800
morphology work a lot of really cool

910
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:10,280
stuff so he he was really nice to me in

911
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,119
person when I met him he's a good guy he

912
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,280
was nice to me as well and all federally

913
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,280
funded right he had Federal funding for

914
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:21,920
this he had Federal funding for a lot of

915
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:24,280
this yeah yeah absolutely oh although

916
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,599
they didn't have enough Nations funding

917
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:30,519
considerably as well they didn't have

918
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:33,400
enough money for Carl's work so uh we

919
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:36,759
gave them a grant and uh that enabled

920
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,800
Carl to do his work for several

921
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,520
years no the uh un grants were more

922
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,680
involved with trying to have some

923
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,920
forensic angle to whatever was being

924
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:48,679
done like being able to identify glands

925
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,800
and things like that you know it's there

926
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:54,318
had to be some little twist that might

927
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,359
be able to use to the government's

928
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,079
Advantage but he did really good work

929
00:45:56,358 --> 00:45:59,960
his grad students did as well it's all

930
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,680
kinds of great stuff done there you were

931
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,519
saying that in in in Sweden it's it's

932
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:09,159
there's hardly any funding for this kind

933
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:12,838
of work but remember I I I forget his

934
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:14,078
name uh the guy who wrote the

935
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:16,920
anti-cannabis

936
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:20,640
books from Sweden remember he was at the

937
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:23,440
ISS BR for years and then he just

938
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:27,039
disappeared yep yeah well I'm sure they

939
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,400
had those uh disperate elements as well

940
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:29,400
well

941
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:41,719
but did uh Professor malberg uh have an

942
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:45,639
appreciation for the impact of his of

943
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:49,078
his work I've must have read about I'm

944
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:51,719
not kidding about 20 of his papers on

945
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,880
the accumulation of canono and the

946
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:56,399
Tricom this is

947
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:00,039
extremely important seminal work that

948
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:03,440
this he did he know the impact that he

949
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:06,279
had on generations of scientists who are

950
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,960
going to read his papers and want to

951
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,400
continue I don't know later in life if

952
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,079
he finally got it but at the time

953
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,880
no he must gotten it later in life I

954
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:21,519
mean he wasn't just fishing in Minnesota

955
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,039
all the time I mean yeah he was retired

956
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:28,000
he fully retired when he left Academia

957
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:31,440
he really left Academia I saw him at uh

958
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,679
North American Industrial Hemp meetings

959
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,159
twice I believe and uh that's the only

960
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:38,480
time Ian into him and it was really good

961
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:41,159
to see him but he was uh trying to get

962
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,440
involved after retirement with the hemp

963
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:45,960
side of things as a as an expert

964
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,119
basically you know expert name yeah that

965
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,960
that's where I met him the one time was

966
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:54,358
uh one of the hemp meetings in Colorado

967
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,480
and he was extremely nice to me and uh

968
00:47:54,358 --> 00:48:00,239
complimentary the work that I'd done

969
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,199
which shocked me that he'd seen it but

970
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,598
anyway that well I'm glad that he was

971
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:07,480
that curious still he I never really

972
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:09,720
thought that he was I mean he he really

973
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:13,039
wanted me to study um

974
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:16,919
laticifers it's just another gland that

975
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:18,719
secretes things you know so and and I

976
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,599
happen to study him as an undergraduate

977
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:24,679
a little bit too I was misdirected then

978
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:27,559
also but another gland that secretes

979
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:29,919
things tell me more

980
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:34,880
wellers are found in

981
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:38,400
uh pine trees to to poetas and uh the

982
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:42,760
main ones in tense their name are are in

983
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:45,760
uh rubber trees and they produce latex

984
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:49,440
which comes from lusifer but lusers make

985
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,960
all kinds of pine oils and even turpins

986
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,280
I would assume although I'm not sure

987
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,838
about that but I bet they do and uh yeah

988
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:01,119
they're all through pine trees and E

989
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:03,639
Forbes is what studied them in in uh in

990
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,680
undergraduate one of the reasons Dr

991
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:09,838
malberg was connected with so many uh

992
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:13,519
famous historical cannabis papers is

993
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:16,639
that he had a license which meant that

994
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:20,400
students could actually grow cannabis on

995
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:22,679
campus and work with it whereas uh there

996
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,680
wasn't a lot of choices about that in

997
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:27,879
America and when my understanding was

998
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,719
when he retired that that that passed

999
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:33,760
and it uh just University of Miss

1000
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:36,159
Mississippi was the only one left right

1001
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,720
at the time I was there there were five

1002
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:41,639
licenses as I

1003
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:44,558
remember and it was a peak I think John

1004
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:48,400
mcpartland even had one of them right at

1005
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:50,280
that time and Eli of course and malberg

1006
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,639
and there were a couple of other ones

1007
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,319
that didn't really they weren't part of

1008
00:49:52,639 --> 00:50:00,400
research Maryland weed

1009
00:49:55,318 --> 00:50:02,318
control yeah weeds yeah yep yep the USDA

1010
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,920
in Bethesda they had a license that's

1011
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:05,639
right and then there's one more I think

1012
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,358
but yeah they were they were really

1013
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:10,159
limited and only a couple of them were

1014
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:15,119
in any kind of an academic setting

1015
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:17,159
so um yeah University of Michigan in Ann

1016
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,119
Arbor and and Bloomington I think were

1017
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:21,159
the only two I don't think Harvard ever

1018
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,798
had a license

1019
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:27,838
now just those two as far as I

1020
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:30,719
know so to bring it back to rafy's work

1021
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:33,000
he got into synthetic canabo at one

1022
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:35,399
point what uh can can any of you speak

1023
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,480
to that work and what you guys kind of

1024
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,280
felt like about that I know some people

1025
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,559
feel that it's dangerous but what are

1026
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,359
the you know what are the advantages of

1027
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:46,440
doing dangerous work well you know he

1028
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:49,159
was a chemist so one of the things

1029
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,760
chemists do is take the natural molecule

1030
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:54,920
and try to make it better uh either

1031
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:58,720
longer lasting or more potent so one of

1032
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:00,880
the those was H2 210 hu designation

1033
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:03,679
meant Hebrew University where he was

1034
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:09,000
working so

1035
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:12,759
h210 is uh a synthetic analog it's a

1036
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:17,239
dimethyl heal uh derivative of

1037
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:19,040
THC uh which made it far more potent um

1038
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:20,798
and so this is used in the lab as

1039
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:24,000
something you tried to knock off the

1040
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:27,239
receptor and testing other things I know

1041
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,199
somebody who took this once and had a

1042
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:32,118
really bad weekend and I mean the whole

1043
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:35,879
week was that

1044
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:37,440
bill I I'm not going to say who it was

1045
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:42,838
okay well that's why I didn't say his

1046
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:45,599
last name um yeah but um so this was

1047
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:48,519
never designed to be a therapeutic agent

1048
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,798
it has appeared in some of the synthetic

1049
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:54,280
can abono mixes uh through the black

1050
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:57,159
market uh but it was it was developed as

1051
00:51:54,280 --> 00:52:01,200
a lab Aid it's

1052
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:05,078
um three-dimensional Mirror Image was

1053
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:07,558
h211 which was non psychoactive this was

1054
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:10,640
actually there were attempts to develop

1055
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:13,920
this as a drug called Dex and naol by a

1056
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:16,279
company called pharmos in Israel

1057
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,358
unfortunately after they got the license

1058
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,720
they never checked with Rafi again

1059
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:22,558
according to his story and the way that

1060
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:24,639
they gave this was someone would have a

1061
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,240
head injury and they would give the Dex

1062
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:30,318
an NA avenol intravenously but only one

1063
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:33,318
time so this worked in initial studies

1064
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:36,480
but in the pivotal uh phase three

1065
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:38,759
randomized control trials it didn't work

1066
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,639
um we have to wonder in retrospect

1067
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,280
whether they had used it more

1068
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:45,798
judiciously that it could have

1069
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,400
worked um you know rafy was also

1070
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:51,480
involved in study of the CB2 non

1071
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,599
psychoactive receptor uh that affect

1072
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,199
pain and

1073
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:57,720
inflammation um so he had another uh

1074
00:52:55,199 --> 00:53:00,960
synthetic agent called

1075
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:03,558
h308 uh that was tested and then more

1076
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,240
recently um you know finally after all

1077
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:08,079
these years there was excitement about

1078
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:10,798
the acid cannabinoids but hindered

1079
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:14,400
somewhat by the the lack of shelf

1080
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:17,719
stability uh with those molecules so he

1081
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,599
uh made methyl Esters of these and one

1082
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:23,039
called um

1083
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,640
h58 is a methylester of cannabidiolic

1084
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:27,480
acid

1085
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:31,039
cbda um and that could very interesting

1086
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:34,400
in treating nausea um and possibly

1087
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:37,639
anxiety it's a pro drug so when it's

1088
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,880
administered it'll break back down into

1089
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:42,558
cbda uh in the

1090
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:46,599
body um

1091
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:49,680
so Rafi head is is feet in both camps in

1092
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:53,400
terms of the synthetic cannaboids but

1093
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:57,000
also the phyto canabo many of which he

1094
00:53:53,400 --> 00:54:01,200
discovered um or was the first uh to

1095
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:04,119
nail down um to put a fine point on it

1096
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:07,798
but um I mean that just gives an idea of

1097
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:12,240
the breadth of his work and the the the

1098
00:54:07,798 --> 00:54:14,960
uh length of his relevance in scientific

1099
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:18,399
discovery over the course of six decades

1100
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,798
I mean how often can you say that um you

1101
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,440
know a lot of people make an initial

1102
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:24,719
Discovery and then

1103
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:29,559
they're sitting

1104
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,558
back we're gone and whatever it

1105
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:35,719
is how about you Dr Mark can you speak

1106
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:37,400
to the sort of you know the the reaction

1107
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:39,879
when people hear about synthetic

1108
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,559
cannaboids the in the canab in the

1109
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,519
Cannabis Community it's generally like

1110
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:45,480
oh my God that's St is horrible it's the

1111
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:48,280
spice it's like there's videos on

1112
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:52,599
YouTube but like speak to the sort of

1113
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:54,400
potential um reasons that chemists do it

1114
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:56,400
and you know why we're you know that

1115
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,920
it's not nefarious that it's not like

1116
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,720
they're trying to harm people but

1117
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,240
there's you know there there's a good

1118
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:05,679
behind it where you're trying to

1119
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:08,639
learn well there's there's a couple

1120
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:13,159
factors that that influence it one of it

1121
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:15,960
unfortunately is the almighty dollar um

1122
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:19,358
you know Financial return on drug

1123
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:23,679
development it takes a lot of money to

1124
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:26,639
bring a medicine through uh FDA sanction

1125
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:29,199
clinical trials uh hundreds of millions

1126
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:32,159
of dollars to do that and so for a

1127
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:35,078
pharmaceutical company it's got to be

1128
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:39,118
the views got to be worth the climb and

1129
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:41,760
and I I think you know the discovery of

1130
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:45,440
the endoc canabo

1131
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:47,400
system impacted drug Discovery because

1132
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,480
people knew how

1133
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:53,760
important this system was because we

1134
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,318
knew how important the phyto canabo were

1135
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,640
on how they act on it so I think with

1136
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,480
without exception all the pharmaceutical

1137
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:04,679
companies in the early in the late 80s

1138
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:07,880
and early 90s started developing uh non

1139
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:12,798
phyto canabo heterocyclic molecules that

1140
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:16,119
look nothing like um the uh the phyto

1141
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:17,960
canabo and these are most notably the

1142
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:21,400
the the JW

1143
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:24,599
compounds uh these are Indo compounds

1144
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,519
that look nothing like the phyto canabo

1145
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:29,519
themselves but because of the scaffold

1146
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:32,079
of the molecule itself it displays the

1147
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,880
right functionality in the right way

1148
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:37,280
that it it does the lock and key thing

1149
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,798
inside these canono receptors sometimes

1150
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:44,119
a whole hell of a lot better than the

1151
00:56:39,798 --> 00:56:47,559
natural ligans and the phyto canono do

1152
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:49,400
and so um the other thing is that a lot

1153
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:50,798
of those indol and a lot of those

1154
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,920
nitrogen

1155
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:57,159
heterocycles uh don't have the thermal

1156
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,838
stability uh for consumption in a

1157
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:03,759
vaporization kind of way so the

1158
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:06,838
synthetic spice molecules and all those

1159
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:09,480
other synthetic canabo are going to

1160
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:11,199
really thermally decompose and degrade

1161
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,599
into a myriad of different other

1162
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:16,358
compounds that are going to have all

1163
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:20,119
kinds of bad impact be pulling into your

1164
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:22,519
lungs so but I I think Ethan's right you

1165
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:25,760
know the chemist who wants to look at

1166
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:29,960
the phyto canabo as being the mother

1167
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:33,359
nature lead how can we improve on the

1168
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:35,599
activity of these compounds and you know

1169
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:37,639
going back to the money thing is you

1170
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:41,160
know the companies have to be able to

1171
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:43,199
patent those those medicines because

1172
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:44,798
when they're spending all that money on

1173
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:47,439
all those clinical

1174
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:49,960
trials uh it's kind of I the one

1175
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:53,000
conversation I'd love to have with e I'd

1176
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,599
love to have Ethan with with Rafi was

1177
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,559
what would what was his opinion on

1178
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:59,720
running clinical trials on something

1179
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:03,200
like CBD which is a public composition

1180
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:05,759
to which GW does does not have have

1181
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:07,919
composition of matter patents on and and

1182
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,720
that's usually the the the top of the

1183
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:15,200
pyramid in the pharmaceutical world you

1184
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:17,199
need a a patent on the actual compound

1185
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:19,838
that they've made and usually if it's a

1186
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,960
starts out as a phyto avonoid by the

1187
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:23,920
time synthetic chemists are done

1188
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,119
manipulating functional groups and

1189
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,960
putting different rings and and looking

1190
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:30,920
looking at different structures they've

1191
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:33,760
made a completely new compound and now

1192
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:36,280
they're developing not only uh the

1193
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,799
process chemistry to make that compound

1194
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,720
economically viable but that's the

1195
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:43,199
compound that ultimately they select and

1196
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:45,919
bring through clinical trials when you

1197
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:49,279
do that with a public composition like

1198
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:51,760
CBD I think it was maybe the notion that

1199
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:56,240
the FDA approval of

1200
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:59,440
epidex was going to somehow give GW the

1201
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:01,479
ability to have the FDA and the DEA sit

1202
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,760
down on the rest of the CBD industry

1203
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:06,199
saying No this is the active ingredient

1204
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,599
of our FDA approved drug you can't put

1205
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:10,759
it in your tincture or your gummy or

1206
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:14,359
your vape pen but you know there's the

1207
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:18,119
FD and C act which precludes the use of

1208
00:59:14,358 --> 00:59:21,199
FDA active ingredients in food feed or

1209
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:24,280
cosmetics and you know the CBD industry

1210
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:26,399
now Treads lightly on that entire

1211
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:28,880
regulation Ethan it sounds like you want

1212
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,559
to say something so go well it's a lot

1213
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,039
we could say we could spend the rest of

1214
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,519
the time talking about this but yeah you

1215
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:37,640
know how patents work initially they're

1216
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:40,880
very broad claims and then they're

1217
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:45,838
whittel down ultimately I think what GW

1218
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:49,798
was left with was a use patent for these

1219
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:53,078
severe epilepsy syndromes D lenux gesto

1220
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:56,880
and tuber sclerosis treatment

1221
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:59,240
there you know I don't know how much

1222
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:03,240
money they're making now taken over by

1223
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:06,959
Jazz but um certainly uh it's not an

1224
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:09,879
exclusive kind of use um and yeah there

1225
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,798
is this question now about the viability

1226
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:15,039
of the rest of the CBD industry however

1227
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:17,440
it's extremely extensive and it would be

1228
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:20,359
hard to imagine uh that they're going to

1229
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,920
be able to squelch that whole thing um

1230
01:00:20,358 --> 01:00:26,358
you know recently the FDA sort of

1231
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:28,599
abdicated abdicated responsibility

1232
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:31,318
uh for it at all and kicked it to

1233
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:33,280
Congress not that there's anyone there

1234
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:36,279
that's qualified to make these kind of

1235
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:39,640
judgments about complex scientific and

1236
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:42,160
medical issues um so it's a pretty sad

1237
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:42,159
State of

1238
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:48,519
Affairs there there's supposedly a quick

1239
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:52,240
a quick fix to this Ethan from what I

1240
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:55,199
understand so um similar to caffeine

1241
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:59,838
they could make an exception to the fdn

1242
01:00:55,199 --> 01:01:03,159
C act and that's just one signature from

1243
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:05,798
the Secretary of Health and Human

1244
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:07,920
Services just has to write a memo sign

1245
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:09,960
it and that makes an exception and I

1246
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,760
think that's how caffeine could be in

1247
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:15,000
cocacola but it could also be active

1248
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:19,520
ingredient in other

1249
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:23,199
medicines GW did have the world's first

1250
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:26,280
High CBD only variety uh that gave them

1251
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:29,399
a 10year lead in front of any other uh

1252
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:32,079
cannabis companies CU nobody else had it

1253
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:36,680
and uh I think that was a big help for

1254
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:39,359
them to to be able to grow uh

1255
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:42,199
basically uh almost pure CBD because

1256
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:46,000
there's always a little bit of THC in

1257
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:48,279
any CBD variety because the CBD synthes

1258
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,798
makes uh

1259
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:52,880
THC

1260
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:56,719
so also too you were talking

1261
01:01:52,880 --> 01:02:03,318
about well listen I am a natural guy

1262
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:06,639
that's me but we also had a patent for

1263
01:02:03,318 --> 01:02:09,599
uh analoges of anandamide because we

1264
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:13,598
were trying out anide for controlling

1265
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:15,318
glycom and uh we found out it actually

1266
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:19,079
did work better than any of the

1267
01:02:15,318 --> 01:02:22,318
classical cannabinoids and then we made

1268
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:24,559
from a nide we made analoges and we

1269
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:26,119
found ones that even worked better

1270
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:32,480
because the problem with most the

1271
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:34,720
medications are first it uh works really

1272
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,639
and then it it it doesn't keep the eye

1273
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:40,879
pressure constant it keeps it up and

1274
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:44,159
down and up and down and with with these

1275
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:46,960
analogs that we uh

1276
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:50,399
synthesized we were able to make it so

1277
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:55,639
that uh there was a gloma medicine which

1278
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:59,639
truly uh did have constant uh lowering

1279
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:59,639
of the eye and keeping it constant

1280
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:05,880
pressure very cool how did those guys

1281
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,680
know that they needed to like did you

1282
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:11,880
guys sell them did HOA Farm sell them on

1283
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:14,118
you need a high CBD cultivar and we can

1284
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:18,680
produce it or did they come searching

1285
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:20,519
for that no when we we first met them I

1286
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:23,879
I don't know what they were thinking in

1287
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:26,679
the back of their brains but both Rob

1288
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:30,680
and I told uh the Folks at

1289
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:33,679
GW Jeffrey guy and Brian Whittle who

1290
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:38,919
Brian Whittle is dead now but uh Jeffrey

1291
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:43,519
guy uh so we told them that if you take

1292
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:46,920
CBD in equal amounts to THC it will

1293
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:50,199
relieve a lot of the problems that naive

1294
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:52,358
users have with uh you know getting too

1295
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:55,960
high and getting scared and all that

1296
01:03:52,358 --> 01:03:58,880
kind of stuff and uh they they ran with

1297
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:01,400
it either it was m and Rob's information

1298
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:04,480
or information they gleaned other places

1299
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:07,720
but uh yeah so when they came to us they

1300
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:11,000
wanted CBD and they wanted

1301
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:14,358
THC yeah well we had talks with them too

1302
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:17,119
so sure Jeffrey guy started as a plant

1303
01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:20,000
guy a lot of his initial work um he

1304
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:23,599
actually had a patent on uh CH

1305
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,880
traditional Chinese medicine uh mixture

1306
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:29,039
uh to treat the first actually the the

1307
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:31,119
first plant patent in uh the UK and

1308
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:34,559
maybe

1309
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:37,079
Europe yeah so no he was uh real

1310
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:40,240
proponent uh at least in the early days

1311
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:40,240
of the Entourage

1312
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:50,759
concept then it was ironic that uh epid

1313
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:54,000
dialects wound up being a 98% pure CBD

1314
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:57,640
preparation which is not what I wanted

1315
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,798
um right so e Ethan doesn't that play to

1316
01:04:57,639 --> 01:05:02,679
S kind of like the heart of the issue

1317
01:04:59,798 --> 01:05:04,679
here which is that if if the cannabis

1318
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:07,078
plant teach teaches us many things but

1319
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:09,960
if it teaches us anything it teaches us

1320
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:13,160
again this Entourage or Ensemble effect

1321
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:16,119
which you just can't replicate in single

1322
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:17,960
ingredient single active ingredient

1323
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:20,760
medicine and

1324
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:23,480
so been preaching this gospel for a long

1325
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:25,880
time I know so where do we go from here

1326
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:28,159
man like

1327
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:31,240
important um you know there are plenty

1328
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:33,399
of detractors out there there's a guy uh

1329
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:36,879
who has taken Delight in publishing

1330
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:39,838
stuff about uh that the Entourage uh

1331
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,960
effect isn't proven or you know other

1332
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:44,798
theories aren't proven how much proof do

1333
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:49,318
you need there's a tremendous body of

1334
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:52,519
literature that's taken place since 1999

1335
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:55,239
when uh professor mulam and Ben Shabbat

1336
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:57,119
suggested that sometimes plants are

1337
01:05:55,239 --> 01:05:59,679
better medicines than the single

1338
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:02,680
compounds they pointed out that that was

1339
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:05,358
theoretical at that time but 24 years

1340
01:06:02,679 --> 01:06:08,078
later it's no longer theoretical it's

1341
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:10,038
proven we have many examples at what

1342
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,519
point do you say look we have the

1343
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:15,920
examples so the claim that it doesn't

1344
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:18,278
matter is it you know it's a done deal

1345
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,760
it's already been proven that uh you

1346
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:23,559
have Synergy of ingredience in certain

1347
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,920
situations so then it becomes a matter

1348
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:27,920
of trying to figure out the best

1349
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:31,240
combinations and that's the approach

1350
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:33,000
we're taking now at credos science and

1351
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:37,639
um

1352
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:40,798
developing you know complex mixtures of

1353
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:42,679
cannabinoids and turboid from the plant

1354
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:45,199
uh that are going to be fit for purpose

1355
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:47,519
whatever that may be uh and it means a

1356
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:50,838
different thing in different situations

1357
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:54,400
so that's my spin on the thing well

1358
01:06:50,838 --> 01:06:57,239
anybody who's ever smoked cannabis and

1359
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:00,160
if they were to smoke p pure THC 100%

1360
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:03,759
pure and then spike it with a little bit

1361
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:06,318
of lolene or marine or anything else

1362
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:09,079
then their doubt would

1363
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:11,558
disappear yeah we're trying um you know

1364
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:14,160
we're doing work now with Ryan vandre at

1365
01:07:11,559 --> 01:07:17,240
Johns Hopkins to show the

1366
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:21,639
Entourage and that is through using pure

1367
01:07:17,239 --> 01:07:25,558
THC and pure terpenoids um in the lab

1368
01:07:21,639 --> 01:07:27,639
double blind um so hopefully in the next

1369
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:31,000
couple of years we'll have papers

1370
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:32,480
showing further proof for these Concepts

1371
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,278
it's unreal that we have to prove

1372
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,358
anything because think of it this way

1373
01:07:34,278 --> 01:07:39,278
you're consuming something it has no

1374
01:07:36,358 --> 01:07:42,239
flavor it has no taste that's a single

1375
01:07:39,278 --> 01:07:45,039
methodology of consuming it now you're

1376
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:47,838
putting these flavors that you can taste

1377
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,640
and you can smell and of course they're

1378
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:51,358
going to add to it that would be like

1379
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:53,239
eating food that didn't taste like

1380
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:55,119
anything and suddenly someone gave you

1381
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:58,358
food that had wonderful tastes and

1382
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:00,559
smells that's a different experience I'm

1383
01:07:58,358 --> 01:08:03,598
so blown away sometimes that people are

1384
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:06,319
so unwilling to understand that when you

1385
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:08,640
smell something your old factory that is

1386
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:12,318
different from seeing and touching

1387
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:14,199
feeling hearing that smell and that you

1388
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:18,399
know that's what has probably attracted

1389
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:20,399
us to foods and to one another and to

1390
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:23,119
just all of these smells that that are

1391
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:26,838
out in the world it's amazing that

1392
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:29,640
Olympic system the sights of emotion

1393
01:08:26,838 --> 01:08:32,318
tapping into memory locking in memory

1394
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:35,400
exactly I've definitely got a few

1395
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:40,719
memories from very specific smells and

1396
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:44,318
that is uh reminds me of a story um back

1397
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:47,039
when in my neurology days um I saw a

1398
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:50,319
patient came back into my office and

1399
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:52,519
there was a smell of Afghan hash I'm

1400
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:55,560
going what the hell you know I don't

1401
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,920
have anything here like that saw another

1402
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:01,798
patient came back in again the Afghan

1403
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:05,480
hash so finally put the nose to work and

1404
01:09:01,798 --> 01:09:07,560
echol looc it and what it was was a a

1405
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:10,399
grapefruit that a patient had given me a

1406
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:15,400
couple of days before sitting on my desk

1407
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:17,920
I picked it up and um it had changed

1408
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:21,079
over the course of two days and smell

1409
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:24,119
very reminiscent of Afghan hash between

1410
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:27,920
the lyine and whatever cesare terpenoids

1411
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:29,920
there were in there um so yeah you know

1412
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:34,960
and

1413
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:37,359
uh n katone n n nud katone is the uh is

1414
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,279
the grapefruit turpine one of them and

1415
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:43,679
it's so interesting Ethan because the

1416
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:46,520
difference between none and

1417
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,759
venine is just a carbonal group it's

1418
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:51,640
like one

1419
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:54,960
oxidation turns a ch2 into a carbonal

1420
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:59,719
group and you go from valencian oranges

1421
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,719
to n katone n katone

1422
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,319
grapefruit I wanted to share one thing

1423
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:08,719
with you Ethan so my last correspondence

1424
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:12,359
with Professor mulam I sent him a link

1425
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:14,719
to the nose paper I I read the newspaper

1426
01:10:12,359 --> 01:10:17,759
and I had talked with Jeremy on

1427
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:20,960
clubhouse before it had come out and I

1428
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,840
think he had either sent me early draft

1429
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,359
of it but I read it and I was just was

1430
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:27,679
like oh man this is such a cool pap

1431
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:31,839
paper it was just I was like yes this is

1432
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:35,640
it you know and all of this news of lab

1433
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:38,119
shopping and THC inflation this is this

1434
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:41,719
is what I've needed to read this article

1435
01:10:38,119 --> 01:10:44,000
right so I sent a link to Rafi and he he

1436
01:10:41,719 --> 01:10:47,719
got back a couple days later and he

1437
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:50,520
loved the paper he just I didn't have

1438
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:52,560
the occasion to talk to him about that

1439
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:54,480
yeah I'll see if I can't I think it was

1440
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,760
just it was either a LinkedIn message

1441
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:58,799
that he sent he's oh this is this is

1442
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:01,880
terrific thank you you know if you could

1443
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,239
forward that I'd love it um I will

1444
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:07,239
really look for it I really will I

1445
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:09,399
believe Valen is a turpine founding

1446
01:11:07,238 --> 01:11:12,919
cannabis correct

1447
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:16,279
yes that's right large amounts but yeah

1448
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:19,039
you know these some of these very Trace

1449
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:22,759
Amounts of CES terpenoids make a

1450
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:25,920
tremendous difference and um as everyone

1451
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:29,000
will attest it doesn't take a lot

1452
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:32,800
a few molecules would be something that

1453
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:36,119
you can sense uh with your olfactory

1454
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:38,719
capabilities and um goodness knows what

1455
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:42,238
they're doing pharmacologically

1456
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:44,679
to right what I've been looking at

1457
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:48,119
recently is

1458
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:48,119
uh pure

1459
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:56,320
thca and I'm dosing it with FES let me

1460
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,800
tell you FES are Maybe a hundred or a

1461
01:11:56,319 --> 01:12:02,039
thousand times more volatile and

1462
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:06,520
stinkier than any tpine I've ever worked

1463
01:12:02,039 --> 01:12:06,519
with right I'm very

1464
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:16,039
curious do you have Sam I'm very curious

1465
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:20,119
to see if the thol uh do modulate or uh

1466
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:23,519
potentiate TC or any other cab that's

1467
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:27,039
the issue are they psychoactive right ex

1468
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:30,480
exactly do they tribute so is it the

1469
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:34,039
penal sulfide that you have prenal

1470
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:37,638
sulfides yes I I yes I have a couple of

1471
01:12:34,039 --> 01:12:39,319
them uh one of them is the one that uh

1472
01:12:37,639 --> 01:12:41,520
the folks that gave it to me I think

1473
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:43,238
from I I'm afraid I don't remember the

1474
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,679
name of the lab but it's the people who

1475
01:12:43,238 --> 01:12:48,119
publish the

1476
01:12:44,679 --> 01:12:50,800
paper Oswald

1477
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:55,719
yes I'm I'm bar curious and that's what

1478
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:58,039
I got this uh pure thca for to with the

1479
01:12:55,719 --> 01:13:00,000
th well that's uh that's when you got to

1480
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:03,000
invite Nick zegler on because that guy

1481
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,960
did 20 plus years of thol work with yaka

1482
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:10,039
mief Hops and he discovered over 1,400

1483
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:12,039
thol present in hops which is

1484
01:13:10,039 --> 01:13:13,560
unbelievable um when you really think

1485
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:16,399
about it how many could there be and if

1486
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:19,400
they're in such small amounts do we have

1487
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:21,279
to think of these profiles I personally

1488
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:24,759
I try not to say Tarpin all the time

1489
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:25,920
anymore I try to say volatile organic

1490
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:28,159
compound

1491
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,719
because when I say tpin I feel like I'm

1492
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:33,920
leaving out the Esters and the thil and

1493
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:36,560
the thiolates and all these other again

1494
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:39,840
an area that really needs investigation

1495
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:42,480
what are the psychoactive effects uh of

1496
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,440
the Esters because clearly they're

1497
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:46,678
really

1498
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:49,399
contributing um to the fruity Aromas

1499
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:51,520
that seem to be really preferred by a

1500
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:54,879
lot of cannabis

1501
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:58,000
consumers yeah that garlic smell go

1502
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:03,000
ahead you know very well Ethan that

1503
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:08,119
uh before the T work that Rob and I and

1504
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:10,560
other folks were doing with me uh it uh

1505
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:15,039
nobody really truly believed that the

1506
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:18,199
tpin were modulating uh THC or

1507
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:22,000
potentiating THC but uh we we proved a

1508
01:14:18,198 --> 01:14:24,559
pretty conclusively 20 years

1509
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,399
ago but you proved it in your apartment

1510
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,000
to Rand people what are you talking

1511
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:31,000
about that [ __ ] was like I didn't need

1512
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,238
to read any papers I was like okay

1513
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,920
that's cuz we didn't publish it it was

1514
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:39,599
for in-house work really to be honest

1515
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,600
and because I wanted to

1516
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:45,120
know well I loved your passion because I

1517
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:47,479
can still picture myself back in your

1518
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:50,519
apartment in early 2000 and I just

1519
01:14:47,479 --> 01:14:53,079
remember how excited you were sitting on

1520
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:56,320
the edge of the couch okay now try it

1521
01:14:53,079 --> 01:14:58,920
with the mercine like just so stoked and

1522
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:04,198
pumped uh on the on the you know on the

1523
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:04,199
edge of a a new discovery I love

1524
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:16,319
it when I told rafie about uh the tpine

1525
01:15:12,439 --> 01:15:19,119
work he was really excited and I I I I

1526
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:21,119
gave him all an explanation of

1527
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:25,039
everything how it all worked and

1528
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:28,238
everything and uh yeah yeah well did

1529
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:31,279
related to that um people may be

1530
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:35,198
interested to know that um The Taming

1531
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:38,439
THC paper resulted from his 80th

1532
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:41,319
birthday because there was a a symposium

1533
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:43,479
held in Israel in honor of that and it

1534
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:46,198
gave me the opportunity to publish that

1535
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:47,839
in a high-profile Journal a British

1536
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:50,759
Journal of of

1537
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:54,199
pharmacology um so you know that was the

1538
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:59,280
right opportunity to present that work

1539
01:15:54,198 --> 01:16:01,279
um so you know and to me um it all came

1540
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:03,238
from the concept of the

1541
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:06,639
Entourage um

1542
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:08,959
so have to give credit there um in

1543
01:16:06,639 --> 01:16:11,600
support of

1544
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:14,960
that what are the stats on that paper

1545
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:17,719
Ethan I must imagine it cited thousands

1546
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:20,119
of times it's it's been cited quite

1547
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:24,399
frequently and for four years it was the

1548
01:16:20,119 --> 01:16:27,000
most commonly accessed uh uh scientific

1549
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:29,879
paper on on cannabis I don't know where

1550
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,279
it Stacks up now but it was on top for

1551
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,279
four

1552
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:41,399
years the first place that I released

1553
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:44,679
the information about the tpin being

1554
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:48,399
able to modify and potentiate THC was at

1555
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:52,760
the ICS meeting uh I I I don't remember

1556
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:55,879
which one it was but uh yeah people

1557
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:57,880
there what hungry

1558
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:59,840
oh you're right it was it was hungry I

1559
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:03,199
remember you're right yeah because I I

1560
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:05,600
was with you prior to that hey Sam you

1561
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:08,039
were talking before about a movie that

1562
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:10,960
was made with professor mulam in your in

1563
01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:13,800
your grow does that movie exist on

1564
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:17,079
YouTube or can we see that not that I

1565
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:20,119
know of I've got a VHS I've got several

1566
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:22,238
VHS copies of it but I I haven't

1567
01:17:20,119 --> 01:17:25,760
digitalized it or anything have you ever

1568
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:27,759
seen that Ethan um I think you might

1569
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:31,840
have shown it to me when I yeah it was

1570
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:35,360
called not light and it was about uh Dr

1571
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:38,239
michul in the Cannabis was it wasn't I

1572
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:40,399
don't think it was subtitled it was yeah

1573
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:43,479
okay sure I think I I have vague

1574
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:46,559
memories of that um in terms of movies

1575
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:49,759
people might want to look for the

1576
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:54,840
scientist that's great yeah so that's an

1577
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:57,960
hour movie that um uh Zack Klein did um

1578
01:17:54,840 --> 01:18:02,639
mainly from interviews done in uh

1579
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,639
2012 um but a great

1580
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:09,199
uh great uh Testament to uh Professor

1581
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:11,400
mullum his early history all the the

1582
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:15,319
stuff we've talked

1583
01:18:11,399 --> 01:18:17,879
about it's hilarious with the the the

1584
01:18:15,319 --> 01:18:20,599
the little uh cartoon sketches where he

1585
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:23,600
says well I went and I had coffee with

1586
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:25,480
them so wherever he went he had coffee

1587
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:29,120
so he went and smuggled

1588
01:18:25,479 --> 01:18:31,039
five pounds a hash from the police over

1589
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:34,198
but he had coffee with

1590
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:38,639
them so wherever he went he had

1591
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:41,238
coffee but such a unassuming humble man

1592
01:18:38,639 --> 01:18:44,359
right I mean I think there's a lesson

1593
01:18:41,238 --> 01:18:46,519
for all of us in humanity absolutely but

1594
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:49,599
you know he was a scientist and he did

1595
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:52,520
have a competitive streak I I'll tell a

1596
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,280
story in relation to that so you know he

1597
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:58,080
and his colleagues had discovered all

1598
01:18:54,279 --> 01:19:00,359
these uh endoc canabo analoges some of

1599
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:03,479
them are seemingly active some were

1600
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:06,960
inactive and I must have asked him

1601
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:11,638
several times what about a docasa

1602
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:15,079
hexanoic acid derivative so uh DHA dcasa

1603
01:19:11,639 --> 01:19:17,480
hexanoic acid is a component of the cell

1604
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:20,039
membranes in our brain it's also what's

1605
01:19:17,479 --> 01:19:23,519
in fish oil and so it's the reason that

1606
01:19:20,039 --> 01:19:26,439
people take fish oil and every time I

1607
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:29,000
asked he was a Vas and sort of waved me

1608
01:19:26,439 --> 01:19:33,039
off um I couldn't understand it because

1609
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:37,000
he was usually so veiling uh of his

1610
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:40,238
knowledge um we were at some meeting and

1611
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:43,158
we're on a bus together and he whispers

1612
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:48,000
to me you were asking about docasa

1613
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:49,920
hexanoic acid derivatives and he said we

1614
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,119
have discovered that they were about

1615
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:58,560
1,00 times more

1616
01:19:52,119 --> 01:20:01,479
powerful um than the phyto canabo in um

1617
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:04,520
osteoblastic function building up

1618
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:07,919
osteoporotic bone just as work that he

1619
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:12,440
was doing with the late ETI Bob also in

1620
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:14,319
Israel um so you know he apparently had

1621
01:20:12,439 --> 01:20:17,238
been working on this and didn't want to

1622
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:21,079
say anything about it until he he knew

1623
01:20:17,238 --> 01:20:23,158
uh what the real answer was um but to my

1624
01:20:21,079 --> 01:20:26,238
knowledge nobody's carried that work

1625
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:29,519
forward um so you know if people thought

1626
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:31,559
geez you know everything's been done

1627
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:34,760
that's never going to be true in this

1628
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:37,880
field it is so deep there is so much to

1629
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:40,880
do and we've just scratched the surface

1630
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:44,159
of what the other phyto canabo can do

1631
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:47,119
there are 150 of them we know the basic

1632
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:49,279
pharmacology of about a dozen and you

1633
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:50,639
know all the bandwidths taken up with

1634
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:55,719
THC and

1635
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:58,359
CBD uh whereas CBG is a f fantastically

1636
01:20:55,719 --> 01:21:01,880
therapeutic compound and uh really

1637
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:05,359
hasn't gotten the attention um thcv

1638
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:07,840
again there's been some work but um you

1639
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:09,639
know goodness knows what we can get out

1640
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,119
of the other

1641
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:15,560
138 that really haven't had the

1642
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:18,519
attention um so with selective breeding

1643
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:21,480
and uh some funding for research there's

1644
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:24,000
a lot of great stuff to

1645
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:27,638
come yeah that was one of the problems

1646
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:31,238
Ethan in the past like before we started

1647
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:35,039
breeding for single canono cannabis

1648
01:21:31,238 --> 01:21:38,399
varieties uh was to get your hands on

1649
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:42,679
the material was uh incredibly expensive

1650
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:45,759
and difficult and uh that's why we set

1651
01:21:42,679 --> 01:21:48,239
about breeding varieties that had one

1652
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:52,079
single canabo so that there would be

1653
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:55,079
large amounts for uh research and so

1654
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:59,279
that you could use them as basic

1655
01:21:55,079 --> 01:22:01,679
like to paint a painting right yeah mix

1656
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:04,840
and match I have a question for you Sam

1657
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:06,920
how like how does one go about is is in

1658
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:09,199
breeding and Rob can chime in on this as

1659
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:11,560
well is it just standard knowledge that

1660
01:22:09,198 --> 01:22:14,399
you can there are breeding techniques to

1661
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:17,239
breed you know certain things to be

1662
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:19,119
produced singularly or is that something

1663
01:22:17,238 --> 01:22:21,678
you guys had to sort of discover along

1664
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:23,519
the way like how easy is it to just

1665
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:26,679
start growing a cannabis plant and only

1666
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:30,120
make it produce one can avonoid well it

1667
01:22:26,679 --> 01:22:32,359
it's actually fairly difficult it uh in

1668
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:35,960
fact most people including plant

1669
01:22:32,359 --> 01:22:38,679
breeders cannabis researchers thought

1670
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:41,600
maybe I wouldn't be able to do it but uh

1671
01:22:38,679 --> 01:22:45,000
we were actually incredibly successful

1672
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:48,679
it took four or five years so what we'd

1673
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:51,079
start with uh a variety that say had

1674
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:55,520
tiny amounts of

1675
01:22:51,079 --> 01:23:00,039
thcv uh for example uh

1676
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:04,199
we were using uh a South African variety

1677
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:07,639
a Afghan variety a Thai variety and uh

1678
01:23:04,198 --> 01:23:11,919
California Orange and that those

1679
01:23:07,639 --> 01:23:12,920
varieties all had you know one% or less

1680
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:16,480
of

1681
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:21,600
thcv so we inbred each of those

1682
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:24,039
individually self it uh two three four

1683
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,120
generations and each time would take the

1684
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:28,719
seeds

1685
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:33,039
that we produced and uh find the highest

1686
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:34,679
in the Target and kept doing that and uh

1687
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:38,800
the problem is after you inbreed

1688
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:40,119
cannabis three four times I mean it is

1689
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:46,800
the most

1690
01:23:40,119 --> 01:23:50,000
inbred uh like I I it has no Vigor it it

1691
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:53,600
it W sometimes it quits dropping pollen

1692
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:57,479
I mean it's it it just has no resistance

1693
01:23:53,600 --> 01:24:00,639
it's it it's because cannabis is a

1694
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:05,238
hetero zot plant and when you breed it

1695
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:08,960
to be uh basically closer to homos I got

1696
01:24:05,238 --> 01:24:12,039
it loses all of its uh resistant to

1697
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:14,639
diseases and problems but uh what we

1698
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:17,519
found out was that we took those four

1699
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:21,319
populations that we had done that to and

1700
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:24,920
combined them and then the uh hybrid

1701
01:24:21,319 --> 01:24:24,920
vager was restored

1702
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,960
that's

1703
01:24:27,399 --> 01:24:31,799
crazy I love the different sides of all

1704
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:35,399
of it you know from the from the

1705
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:37,159
chemistry that mulam practiced to the to

1706
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:39,879
the collecting of the seeds in hash

1707
01:24:37,158 --> 01:24:42,319
producing countries to the actual

1708
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:44,840
breathing uh work you know and then

1709
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:46,920
earlier we were talking about how it's

1710
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:49,319
all about you know the profile the

1711
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:51,800
Entourage all of these different sort of

1712
01:24:49,319 --> 01:24:55,639
profiles I'm just talking there

1713
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:57,400
buddy um that it's this it's this hole

1714
01:24:55,639 --> 01:24:59,520
that you want but then I you know I was

1715
01:24:57,399 --> 01:25:01,960
going to kind of ask Rob about this

1716
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,880
earlier as well in the sense that

1717
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:07,118
cannabis produces many different holes

1718
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,359
so we can say we want the whole profile

1719
01:25:07,118 --> 01:25:11,238
but we're certainly not using the

1720
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:14,839
cellulose and the fiber and the seed uh

1721
01:25:11,238 --> 01:25:17,559
the rich amino acid seed for that

1722
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:20,440
cannabinoid you know inhalation medical

1723
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:22,119
Das recreational experience so you can

1724
01:25:20,439 --> 01:25:24,599
take the resin and think that you have

1725
01:25:22,118 --> 01:25:27,238
the whole but really cannabis always

1726
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:29,159
seems to be about the one from the whole

1727
01:25:27,238 --> 01:25:31,238
at least from my experience that when

1728
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:34,799
I'm you know making if I want to make

1729
01:25:31,238 --> 01:25:36,399
seed oil or dehaul seeds that comes from

1730
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,079
the seed I don't need the fiber I don't

1731
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:41,439
need the cellulose I don't need the

1732
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:43,880
medicinal components and so it's just an

1733
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:46,319
interesting sort of concept that you can

1734
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:49,440
take the one from the whole if you're

1735
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:52,319
making clothing you know which Rob has a

1736
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:54,599
lot of experience with textiles and the

1737
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:56,599
history of of of cannabis and temp

1738
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:58,639
textiles and the difference like do we

1739
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:00,920
see that I mean I'm sure you've seen

1740
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:02,880
breeding for textiles even just

1741
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:05,440
naturally happening whether they knew

1742
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:06,840
what they were doing or not versus the

1743
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:09,879
same concept that we do for the

1744
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:13,039
medicines which are chemists now trying

1745
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:15,039
to figure out ways to like produce

1746
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:17,319
embryos and seeds that produce better

1747
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:19,479
fibers kind of just going on but chime

1748
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:25,519
in anytime

1749
01:26:19,479 --> 01:26:27,519
Rob oh you're muted it it's

1750
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,920
what do people mean by whole I mean I'll

1751
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,719
be cynical for a minute but whole plant

1752
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,880
extracts

1753
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:37,439
are extracts that include more than one

1754
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,000
class of compounds let's say okay you've

1755
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:42,279
got some tur beans in there it's a whole

1756
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,039
plant extract okay whatever whole flow

1757
01:26:42,279 --> 01:26:46,359
extract whole whatever it's I'm just

1758
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:49,238
being cynical but it's overused it also

1759
01:26:46,359 --> 01:26:52,719
can mean natural in some ways that

1760
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:54,879
people use it um it doesn't mean either

1761
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:56,920
of those things

1762
01:26:54,880 --> 01:27:00,159
Rob what it means is it's got to have

1763
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:02,840
every canono and every turpine and if it

1764
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:04,879
doesn't it's not whole right well that

1765
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:08,600
would be the ultimate definition but of

1766
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:11,440
course no no product no extract no even

1767
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:14,920
lab ever can do that things get lost

1768
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:17,158
especially volatile uh organic compounds

1769
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:18,840
they go by by real easy all they have to

1770
01:27:17,158 --> 01:27:23,079
just sort of think about it and they

1771
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:24,880
disappear so yeah it's it's an overused

1772
01:27:23,079 --> 01:27:27,039
thing I mean it it's back to kind of

1773
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:30,520
like the arguments years ago again

1774
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:32,399
natural versus organic until the USDA

1775
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:36,280
just co-opted the word organic and

1776
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:37,439
decided to rule it but it it's yeah they

1777
01:27:36,279 --> 01:27:39,559
they don't

1778
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:41,638
necessarily in a world of branding and

1779
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:45,320
marketing they tend to mean things um

1780
01:27:41,639 --> 01:27:45,319
considerably different than their actual

1781
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:48,759
definitions if that

1782
01:27:49,158 --> 01:27:54,638
helps yes absolutely just uh replying to

1783
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:56,639
some of the people in the chat room here

1784
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:58,239
people are enjoying the conversation

1796
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:29,000
like you guys got like 50 feet or

1797
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:31,639
something got the biggest snowfall in a

1798
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,198
100 years and then a week later before

1799
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:37,039
any of it's melted at all except on the

1800
01:28:34,198 --> 01:28:39,319
roads maybe it snows another four feet

1801
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:42,399
and then it snowed again so it's just

1802
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:45,079
like yeah well the water reservoirs in

1803
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:47,439
California needed it they do it's true

1804
01:28:45,079 --> 01:28:49,079
they need that but it's flooding like

1805
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:52,479
hell everywhere and it's just beginning

1806
01:28:49,079 --> 01:28:54,479
to think about yeah for all those huge

1807
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:58,399

working on right

1819
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:27,239
now um I'm

1820
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,960
just finished sorting through a lot of

1821
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:31,759
hemp Texs I just came back from turkey

1822
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:34,399
and over the last 10 years I built quite

1823
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:36,400
a collection of hemp rugs and grain

1824
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:39,439
sacks and a few saddle bags things like

1825
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:42,839
that um practical kind of hemp products

1826
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:44,238
heavy hemp not fine hemp things and uh I

1827
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:46,360
have a lot of them stored in a warehouse

1828
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:48,839
in Turkey so I spent four days all day

1829
01:29:46,359 --> 01:29:49,960
long going through those things and uh

1830
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,679
trying to figure out what to do with

1831
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:53,719
them largely um a lot of them were're

1832
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:55,480
keeping for collections Marcus is known

1833
01:29:53,719 --> 01:29:58,000
about this activity for a long time

1834
01:29:55,479 --> 01:30:00,599
because I do it with my partner Amir and

1835
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,840
Marcus introduced us back in the day so

1836
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:07,320
uh we had a great time doing this

1837
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:08,840
and made some serious decisions about

1838
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:11,118
what to do with things and then I came

1839
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:12,840
home and I I had shipped a lot of things

1840
01:30:11,118 --> 01:30:16,479
back to Turkey years ago I brought

1841
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:19,520
things home you know a few dozen kilos

1842
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:22,198
at a time sort of and got things DHL and

1843
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:24,679
filled up my house so I had I had more

1844
01:30:22,198 --> 01:30:27,279
than two tons of him things here that

1845
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:29,199
were were Turkish so I I got them

1846
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:30,880
shipped back to Turkey about five years

1847
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:33,559
ago and put in a warehouse so we could

1848
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:36,760
spread them out and and deal with them

1849
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:38,400
um but I kept some things of course as

1850
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:42,440
collectors do and I put them under my

1851
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:44,839
bed so I did the the what my my lady

1852
01:30:42,439 --> 01:30:48,319
calls the [ __ ] under the bed hemp and

1853
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:49,800
went through and uh organized it all

1854
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:51,599
which is cool cuz I managed to look at

1855
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:54,119
everything that built up in Turkey I

1856
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:56,360
bought a a lot of things after I'd sent

1857
01:30:54,118 --> 01:30:58,839
things back and i' never cataloged those

1858
01:30:56,359 --> 01:31:00,359
and still Haven but i' got to look at

1859
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:02,239
everything again so now I have a head

1860
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:06,319
around all of it and the project is to

1861
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:11,319
write a book about it of course what a

1862
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:14,439
surprise so yeah well

1863
01:31:11,319 --> 01:31:16,000
we selections and photographs and I've

1864
01:31:14,439 --> 01:31:18,519
wrote a bunch of text already over the

1865
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,760
years for our websites and things so

1866
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:22,639
yeah the pieces are there we just got to

1867
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,360
put it all together well I want to give

1868
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:26,679
a shout out to Amir because you

1869
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:29,639
mentioned him probably maybe quite

1870
01:31:26,679 --> 01:31:33,118

1877
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:56,279
order yeah I was just uh talking in

1878
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:58,319
private with Ethan in the chat room

1879
01:31:56,279 --> 01:31:59,679
saying maybe another 20 minutes if you

1880
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:02,599
guys have anything else you want to

1881
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:05,039
mention about Rafi or anything really

1882
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:08,199
just uh got to get going here after the

1883
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:12,039
2hour mark and get out of my hotel

1884
01:32:08,198 --> 01:32:12,039
and get back Homeward

1885
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:26,599
Bound well if um there is an incredible

1886
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:29,399
body of of work that exists and a lot of

1887
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:32,199
it is open share

1888
01:32:29,399 --> 01:32:35,319
accessible um I don't know what his

1889
01:32:32,198 --> 01:32:36,559
final total was Ethan I I think I must

1890
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:39,920
have about

1891
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:43,400
400 papers by I have a I know it's north

1892
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:46,840
of 600 North of 600 he was a tremendous

1893
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:50,079
collaborator it wasn't just his lab um

1894
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:52,159
one thing about the sci cannaboid

1895
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:54,000
scientific Community is that they're

1896
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:57,679
good collaborators

1897
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,639
a lot of these papers will have 12 or

1898
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:03,480
more people in different institutions

1899
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:07,039
it's like you know rafie does this part

1900
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:11,319
and Roger Perle does this part and Paul

1901
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:13,840
paker does this part and um so you know

1902
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:17,158
he he was a contributor and it wasn't

1903
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:20,000
just the the basic science stuff um I

1904
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:22,359
should point out he was highly involved

1905
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:25,319
in clinical

1906
01:33:22,359 --> 01:33:28,559
applications the first paper on

1907
01:33:25,319 --> 01:33:31,439
canaba uh for epilepsy wasn't in

1908
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,320
relation to the work at GW it was back

1909
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,559
in

1910
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:39,198
1980 uh collaborating with the

1911
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:42,039
Brazilians Kia Carini and that group um

1912
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:45,118
and when the International Association

1913
01:33:42,039 --> 01:33:48,279
for um cannabinoid medicines was formed

1914
01:33:45,118 --> 01:33:51,479
in 2001 he was there and he was at every

1915
01:33:48,279 --> 01:33:55,519
meeting um and helping to guide people

1916
01:33:51,479 --> 01:33:56,839
in what was done so um it wasn't a

1917
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,639
matter of

1918
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:05,039
making semisynthetic analoges that could

1919
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:10,039
be patented he really uh was into use of

1920
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:11,880
uh the natural cannabis extracts uh and

1921
01:34:10,039 --> 01:34:14,158
how they could be harnessed

1922
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:17,639
therapeutically um so that was the way

1923
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:22,319
he was a renaissance man he had

1924
01:34:17,639 --> 01:34:25,239
interest uh in all these different

1925
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:28,679
facets we all also were in contact with

1926
01:34:25,238 --> 01:34:32,879
the Brazilians and that influenced our

1927
01:34:28,679 --> 01:34:36,399
early CBD work because we bred uh a high

1928
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:39,079
CBD variety at that time it wasn't uh as

1929
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:43,158
high as the one I eventually licensed at

1930
01:34:39,079 --> 01:34:45,920
GW but it uh was good enough that uh

1931
01:34:43,158 --> 01:34:48,198
they were really interested in it uh in

1932
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:51,399
in Brazil because they they really

1933
01:34:48,198 --> 01:34:53,799
couldn't afford to get the CBD materials

1934
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:55,799
that they needed for their work yeah

1935
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:58,719
wouldn't have been been able to grow it

1936
01:34:55,800 --> 01:35:01,560
in the tropics very well

1937
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:03,520
either so Ethan when I asked before

1938
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:05,400
where do we go from here and you started

1939
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:07,159
telling us about all the exciting work

1940
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:10,359
you're doing at

1941
01:35:07,158 --> 01:35:13,319
Crudo how does how does how do

1942
01:35:10,359 --> 01:35:16,719
government and Regulatory bodies catch

1943
01:35:13,319 --> 01:35:19,279
up with where we're already at which is

1944
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:21,480
they need a different way of regulating

1945
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:23,439
this mechanism was that was that the

1946
01:35:21,479 --> 01:35:27,599
capitulation that they recently made is

1947
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:29,599
that cannabinoids don't fit in this mono

1948
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,320
single ingredient medicine so we need to

1949
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,320
create a different process for you I

1950
01:35:31,319 --> 01:35:35,319
really don't know how it's going to

1951
01:35:32,319 --> 01:35:37,079
shake out um irrespective of what they

1952
01:35:35,319 --> 01:35:40,359
or anybody wants they're always going to

1953
01:35:37,079 --> 01:35:44,039
be three echelons of activity herbal

1954
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:46,198
cannabis and its different uh forms um

1955
01:35:44,039 --> 01:35:48,679
the supplement industry hopefully with

1956
01:35:46,198 --> 01:35:51,479
some measure of quality control and

1957
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:54,279
finally the pharmaceutical approaches

1958
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:56,519
hopefully with phyto canabo

1959
01:35:54,279 --> 01:36:00,359
you know we're trying to focus on all

1960
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:03,760
three um more selective breeding uh

1961
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:07,679
development of rational um supplements

1962
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:09,960
and also pharmaceutical approaches um

1963
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:12,960
because anybody who thinks it stops with

1964
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:15,480
satx and epid dialects has got another

1965
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:18,158
thing coming there are fewer companies

1966
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:21,079
that are working on it but um we're

1967
01:36:18,158 --> 01:36:23,920
involved with two uh at this point in

1968
01:36:21,079 --> 01:36:28,198
Deer Pharmaceuticals out of Vancouver be

1969
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:32,279
and canera out of the greater Toronto uh

1970
01:36:28,198 --> 01:36:34,960
area um and it's not just canabo and

1971
01:36:32,279 --> 01:36:38,679
terpenoids the can flavens are of

1972
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:41,639
tremendous interest uh medically and um

1973
01:36:38,679 --> 01:36:44,600
poor tend to provide really great things

1974
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:47,319
in the areas of treating inflammation

1975
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:50,600
cancer and maybe even neur

1976
01:36:47,319 --> 01:36:52,279
neuroen neurodegenerative disease easy

1977
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:55,199
for me to

1978
01:36:52,279 --> 01:36:58,639
say and

1979
01:36:55,198 --> 01:37:02,279
that that that can coexist in framework

1980
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:06,359
where prohibition is ending and adult

1981
01:37:02,279 --> 01:37:09,198
use Recreation RS coming online well

1982
01:37:06,359 --> 01:37:11,679
these kind of things could coexist yeah

1983
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:13,399
there they aren't mutually exclusive

1984
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:17,199
there are plenty of people approaching

1985
01:37:13,399 --> 01:37:20,679
this on in their own way um hopefully

1986
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:22,719
it's a big tent in that respect and um

1987
01:37:20,679 --> 01:37:25,118
we don't get in each other's way too

1988
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:27,760
much

1989
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:30,880
the flavonoids is what we were

1990
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:33,159
interested in next after the Turpin we

1991
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:35,400
found that the tpes could modulate

1992
01:37:33,158 --> 01:37:38,679
potentiate the canabo and we were

1993
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:43,039
interested in the flavonoids and then Dr

1994
01:37:38,679 --> 01:37:46,158
Mulan told me that if flavonoids are

1995
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:49,319
combusted or vaporized they're de

1996
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:52,238
deactivated so they're effective orally

1997
01:37:49,319 --> 01:37:54,319
but they're not effective smoking and uh

1998
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:57,678
I I dropped the flavon after that

1999
01:37:54,319 --> 01:38:00,359
because I was I was really looking for

2000
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:04,079
patients that were smoking because that

2001
01:38:00,359 --> 01:38:07,960
at the time was the delivery form

2002
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:07,960
sure again more to

2003
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:12,839
do well the potent antioxidants and

2004
01:38:11,079 --> 01:38:15,559
maybe they have something to do with the

2005
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:18,360
overall stability of whole plant

2006
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:20,520
preparations right Ethan where maybe

2007
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:22,238
they're not doing something medically

2008
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:25,440
but they're doing something chemically

2009
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:29,439
on on the on the mixture so yeah why not

2010
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:31,759
um yeah it's a good point uh if people

2011
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:35,118
think that's not likely we can give the

2012
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:37,520
example of St John's wart H hypericum

2013
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:41,079
perforatum uh one of the so-called

2014
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:43,920
active ingredients as a treatment for

2015
01:38:41,079 --> 01:38:48,039
depression is a thing called hyperforin

2016
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:51,560
it's a weird molecule it's uh only

2017
01:38:48,039 --> 01:38:53,479
two-dimensional of it be like this in

2018
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:56,679
this plane but on its end it's like the

2019
01:38:53,479 --> 01:39:00,039
rings of Saturn you might not see them

2020
01:38:56,679 --> 01:39:03,480
if it's at a certain angle anyway

2021
01:39:00,039 --> 01:39:06,439
hyperforin when it is isolated is

2022
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:09,718
extremely volatile it has to be stored

2023
01:39:06,439 --> 01:39:13,039
under liquid nitrogen but in an extract

2024
01:39:09,719 --> 01:39:15,880
of the plant it's stable uh

2025
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:20,519
so you know there's a good reason that

2026
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:22,840
we've had galenical um you know tentures

2027
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:25,520
have been popular in medicine for at

2028
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:27,639
least a thousand years and the reason is

2029
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:30,760
it's a good uh extraction and

2030
01:39:27,639 --> 01:39:33,118
preservation system so they ain't going

2031
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:33,119
away

2032
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:43,880
either I'd like to thank Dr mulam for

2033
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:47,399
the the Gathering Place of the icrs I

2034
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:49,639
mean that that is where all of the

2035
01:39:47,399 --> 01:39:52,399
modern cannabis science has been

2036
01:39:49,639 --> 01:39:55,480
announced first and most of the people

2037
01:39:52,399 --> 01:40:02,519
doing the work while members but

2038
01:39:55,479 --> 01:40:07,559
uh Incredible World uh the ICS sure

2039
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:11,080
still going oh I I know in fact

2040
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:15,440
it's the first meeting I went to was uh

2041
01:40:11,079 --> 01:40:19,158
1993 in Toronto and uh the meeting this

2042
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:20,678
year is again in Toronto Y what goes

2043
01:40:19,158 --> 01:40:22,638
around comes

2044
01:40:20,679 --> 01:40:25,480
around fortunately it's in the

2045
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:28,840
summertime when it's nice in

2046
01:40:25,479 --> 01:40:32,638
Toronto but you don't like minus

2047
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:36,400
40 no I I live on Lake Champlain so I I

2048
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:36,400
yeah I get my taste of winter every

2049
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,000
year that's what's up so where where do

2050
01:40:40,399 --> 01:40:46,279
you guys see you know rafy's work going

2051
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:48,679
in the next 25 to 50 years who's going

2052
01:40:46,279 --> 01:40:50,679
to pick up the torch and where where is

2053
01:40:48,679 --> 01:40:53,760
cannabis chemistry heading what's what's

2054
01:40:50,679 --> 01:40:57,279
our Direction there there is no one it's

2055
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:59,800
more like throwing a stone into a lake

2056
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:02,759
and the ripples just spread out in a

2057
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:07,440
concentric Circle in all these different

2058
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:09,719
fields I mean as far as I could see yeah

2059
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:13,319
no his his legacy is going to be

2060
01:41:09,719 --> 01:41:17,599
remembered uh forever uh as far as this

2061
01:41:13,319 --> 01:41:20,559
field goes uh there's no worry there um

2062
01:41:17,599 --> 01:41:23,480
and there are plenty of eager young

2063
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:26,159
scientists interested in this stuff My

2064
01:41:23,479 --> 01:41:29,000
worry is can they find jobs after

2065
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:32,158
Graduate School uh it's a constant

2066
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:37,039
problem one of the great scientists I

2067
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:40,279
met at my first I ICS meeting in 1999

2068
01:41:37,039 --> 01:41:43,880
graduated and I had to go to work for a

2069
01:41:40,279 --> 01:41:47,279
tobacco company uh great loss to the

2070
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:50,118
field so um that's well the good thing

2071
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:52,519
about that of course is most of the big

2072
01:41:50,118 --> 01:41:53,839
tobacco companies now are diversifying

2073
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:58,040
into cannabis

2074
01:41:53,840 --> 01:42:02,760
so maybe he he what comes around goes

2075
01:41:58,039 --> 01:42:02,760
around yeah but maybe not

2076
01:42:04,359 --> 01:42:07,759
too true

2077
01:42:08,359 --> 01:42:14,359
enough yeah I mean I think it's it's

2078
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:17,399
it's um there's an old saying he's not

2079
01:42:14,359 --> 01:42:20,359
really gone if you remember him and you

2080
01:42:17,399 --> 01:42:22,759
keep him in your heart and so I think

2081
01:42:20,359 --> 01:42:24,639
about that when I think about my most

2082
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:27,679
favorite

2083
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:29,599
musician Mr Jerry Garcia who passed away

2084
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:33,679
a number of years ago and I listen to

2085
01:42:29,599 --> 01:42:38,360
Jerry's Music every day and I appreciate

2086
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:41,000
Rafi for his body of work I treasure the

2087
01:42:38,359 --> 01:42:44,198
correspondence I had with him and Ethan

2088
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:46,880
I'm now collaborating with Allan howlet

2089
01:42:44,198 --> 01:42:49,118
we're we're looking at some of these um

2090
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:52,440
minor isomers that are formed in this

2091
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:55,839
Delta 8 uh manufacturing process where

2092
01:42:52,439 --> 01:42:58,479
they're converting CBD into THC and

2093
01:42:55,840 --> 01:43:01,639
these ISO isomers are found along the

2094
01:42:58,479 --> 01:43:03,959
way so collaborating with Professor how

2095
01:43:01,639 --> 01:43:07,118
to understand do they behave like

2096
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:09,279
cannaboids from of these byproducts so

2097
01:43:07,118 --> 01:43:13,118
as you said Ethan there's just this this

2098
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:15,118
whole landscape of opportunity and we

2099
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:20,759
all stand on the

2100
01:43:15,118 --> 01:43:23,719
shoulders of Roger Adams and of Robert

2101
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:25,840
Sydney Khan and wood spiv in easterfield

2102
01:43:23,719 --> 01:43:28,880
those first three guys who the first

2103
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:30,520
people who made thisit and someday

2104
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:33,199
Marcus they're going to be talking about

2105
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:35,639
