1
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:24,028
hey guys bubbleman here with the

2
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,550
cannabis Reverend mr. Jeff Church in the

3
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:29,329
house and we're actually on a mission

4
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,859
for isopropanol

5
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,988
we need to clean the rigs can't bring

6
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,570
the rigs home dirty the mothership right

7
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:38,429
now is quite dirty and so we are walking

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,409
down one of the busier streets in

9
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:43,079
Barcelona one of the more famous streets

10
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:47,559
called the ROM Blas see kind of behind

11
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,210
us there and I see a little in front

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,410
it's definitely a lot of people walking

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,410
down this street on any given day

14
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,988
and we have discovered there's a

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,649
pharmacy up ahead one that's open till

16
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:04,319
11:30 which is in about 15 minutes and

17
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,280
one that's one that's apparently 24

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,989
hours at least the guy who we bought our

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,420
souvenirs for our kids and stuff that's

20
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:13,709
what he told us so now I figured we'd

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,070
take you guys for a little walk down the

22
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,069
RAM blasts

23
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:35,859

I have to mention that the ISO was $2.00

69
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,009
I don't know about you guys but that is

70
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:38,639
like the cheapest isopropanol I have

72

euros pretty good this we can take this

73
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:47,339
one right

74
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:51,839
Sun Sun Tan day or we can take the

75
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:53,189
McDonald's KFC one as well we're just

76
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,709
gonna go straight in or we're gonna go

77
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:58,079
out of the way and then back again

78
00:04:54,709 --> 00:05:00,829
because this is like a weird thing that

79
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,829
we just bring back

80
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:05,918
let's just go and see if we find out

81
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,919
where we're going

82
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:11,569
that's with flow with the go I mean the

83
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:14,779
sewage just smells so good down this

84
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:20,029
street right oh and with the garbage

85
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:22,039
that's a good combination well remember

86
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:24,439
when you're walking in Spain the puddles

87
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:28,100
in the middle of the street aren't

88
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:30,079
puddles now they're pissed pit mostly

89
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,930
piss yeah but yeah you want to make sure

90
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:37,129
you don't roll your suitcase through

91
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:39,199
that or do anything it's gonna do that

92
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:41,149
sort of thing well this will be

93
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:46,459
interesting to see if this road gets us

94
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:53,709
to the church I'm pretty sure it's going

95
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:57,680
to that was pretty wild did they sit

96
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:59,599
yeah I'm not overly surprised by it

97
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:08,620
looks like they're doing garbage pickup

98
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:08,620
tonight huh garbage pickup it's good

99
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:26,560
I wonder where we're gonna end up here

100
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:35,369
streets are so incredible confusing they

101
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:43,718

103
00:06:43,718 --> 00:06:58,149
tagging going on oh well it's got to be

104
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:59,889
this way because that's where the

105
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:01,779
McDonald's in the KFC are that's what we

106

here at all one of these side streets

151
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:39,480
with a really beautiful gothic apartment

152
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:42,039
for three bedrooms for 120 euros a night

153

155
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:50,109

used to push through here

163
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,650

164
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,870

228
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,708
eventually find yourself that's the

229
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:04,808
thing about walking around here all

230

233
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:16,540

234
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:18,370

235
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:22,509

236
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:27,610

before I leave

329
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:18,590
just just don't keep it going

330
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,470
make sure the plate was relaxed and

331
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:22,669
clean up some dry boom that's what we're

332
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,930
gonna do we're gonna do a little bit of

333
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,960
card and we're gonna do a little bit of

334
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:29,049
the static trick and tell us about this

335
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,289
paper you guys

336
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:36,109
ended up using lost rather than the code

337
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:38,629
I've ended up just have any possible

338
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:40,939
paper buddy seems to what are you using

339
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:43,540
this this side you have the center how's

340
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,539
your outside

341
00:23:46,380 --> 00:24:04,000
nice the 75 micron mesh that's actually

342
00:23:50,769 --> 00:24:08,279
pretty small what do you do what I would

343
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,980
suggest is get a 250 micron one of these

344
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:14,230
and then when you clean this hash run it

345
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,420
through the sieve before you put it on

346
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,700
this screen and so what it falls is

347
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,230
milled and like like flour and then I'm

348
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,240
telling you it would be much more

349
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,710
effective when you do this there's just

350
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,480
super because there's little balls in

351
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,190
here and stuff that morning you don't

352
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,370
right yeah it has to go through like a

353
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:34,600
sieve I wish we have to just trying to

354
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:37,659
think I see that box away 130s

355
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:40,689
maybe won't work a little bit you know

356
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,340
you might lose some heads but let's just

357
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,910
test it out here this is the bottom one

358
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:47,709
no hold that if you want there's a nice

359
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:55,029
amount of contaminant you've already

360
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:58,230
pressed through give me use a brush I do

361
00:24:55,029 --> 00:25:02,250
but it's just like hisses to reanimate

362
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,250
so make sure your situation

363
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:52,549
a little bit of that through here and

364
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:56,830
nice a little bit should fall real nice

365
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:59,740
and even in a little circle that's a lot

366
00:25:56,829 --> 00:26:02,740
okay it's okay

367
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,740
mm-hm

368
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:15,029
and that's a good every month I'm just

369
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:15,029
gently card that through

370
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:36,049
you see a makeup brush we do the job

371
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:38,330
yeah I mean if it was a 250 you could do

372
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:41,569
it with a makeup brush or you know a

373
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:43,399
shaving brush that this should that

374
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:48,619
should be more than enough actually just

375
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,120
for now yeah and then it falls nice and

376
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:52,909
even and there's no little bumps those

377
00:26:50,119 --> 00:27:02,359
little bumps are problematic in the

378
00:26:52,910 --> 00:27:15,559
carding and in the static tracer cutting

379
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:18,139
away the excess cutting it away this is

380
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:20,119
what we do right before we leave it's a

381
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:23,210
real 1:30 in the morning crowd over

382
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:26,239
there right now I like it and then it's

383
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:29,150
all I'm quiet except me and [ __ ] cuz

384
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,319
we just did smacks yeah we just say it's

385
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:40,550
max yeah smacks claw

386
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:43,460
1:30 a.m. smack attack there we go

387
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:47,329
that's a good amount where do you have

388
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:49,819
an area where you can like put your nice

389
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:52,639
clean headies I was using this for the

390
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:55,389
other pile of the bass let's see it real

391
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,390
close for a second

392
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:05,049
oh yeah you have two distinctly

393
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,390
different colors here the one on the

394
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:09,730
right is a more contaminated version but

395
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:13,140
right on the edge it looks like it's a

396
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:21,130
white hash all the way out hmm

397
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:24,220
those are pure heads for sure can really

398
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:27,130
see it down here just white follow it

399
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:29,170
all the way up so you obviously know to

400
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,790
try and split those two piles up eh yeah

401
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,279
that's a harder part I'll show you

402
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:37,899
another thing with this that'll help

403
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:40,119
when you card with it instead of going

404
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:42,790
like this like with the side of the card

405
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:45,159
okay just use the flat part of that and

406
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:46,960
just literally go like a very small

407
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,730
distance and then lift it up and you

408
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,079
should have even more than that on and

409
00:28:48,730 --> 00:29:02,200
it should be like right across this

410
00:28:50,079 --> 00:29:05,379
whole flat yeah nice some haze over here

411
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,970
but I was gonna get to uh yeah and see a

412
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,620
card works perfect for this as well it's

413
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,600
nice to have a brush if you do but sure

414
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:16,829
if you don't it sure is easy enough to

415
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:16,829
do the card pressure these

416
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:30,630
just looks like regular old sins

417
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:34,160
Passover my dad that just once even is

418
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:36,480
you'd be surprised how fast it'll happen

419
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:40,560
you kind of get it at an angle

420
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,329
I miss gathering right there yeah this

421
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,000
side right there and then you might have

422
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:47,159
some no this one's all contaminant yeah

423
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,109
so it's mostly right there you kind of

424
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,910
learn to way the whole the way to hold

425
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:53,659
it and how much to use

426
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:57,509
yeah wipe that off first along a little

427
00:29:53,660 --> 00:30:01,920
give it a little go a little show when

428
00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:03,569
you got there some turps terms snarp a

429
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,230
turkey thing so thanks for cheat

430
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:06,230
concentrate

431
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,789
you
