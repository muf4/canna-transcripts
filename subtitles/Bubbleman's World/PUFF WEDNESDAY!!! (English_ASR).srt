one of the great reasons to go and visit

131
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,799
parks there was 10 great reasons to go

132

and visit national parks and you know

133
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
one of them one of the ones that really

134
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,959
sort of that I connected with was that

135
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,199
it brings out your inner child you know

136
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:59,680
it brings out your inner child to get

137
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,038
into um epic beautiful nature whether

138
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,879
you're hanging out on the ocean or a

139
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:07,038
lake or under a waterfall it's just so

140
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:10,000
inspirational to be able to be in those

141
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,360

right up that is the Sunshine Coast and

151
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,519
they do call it the Sun Coast for a

152
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,080
reason they do happen to get uh quite a

153
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:39,159

Shannon was uh

164

165
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,038
putting it when the first Highway was uh

166
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:10,198
was was taken down so even when you're

167
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,439
in Epic Beauty you're still reminded of

168
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,000
the humility of Life the fragileness of

169
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,478
life we're all here for such a short

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,160
period of time even me talking to you I

171
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,878
could [ __ ] step off this Cliff right

172
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,479
now and crack my head open and be gone

173
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,199
forever so uh you know treat the people

174
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,038
around you and in your life and the ones

175
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,800
that you engage with even strangers as

176
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,959
potentially positive as possible we're

177
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,199
all going through through things and

178
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,598
we've all got stresses but uh it makes

179
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,840
it easier if we have a little bit of

180
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,079
empathy and compassion for the people in

181
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:41,439
our immediate surroundings and even

182
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:43,598
those in our extended

183
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,598
surroundings Hey Ron Jones you're

184
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,279
welcome most welcome most welcome how

185
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,719
are the stars at night Jim good boy

186
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:54,279
they're epic epic that's what they

187
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,759
are oh Spencer I'm so sorry to he bro

188
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,478
I've had it happened as well I

189
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,800
definitely wasn't saying it like lightly

190
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,478
making fun of it or anything uh I had a

191
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,280
friend jump out of a tent on acid in the

192
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:04,598
middle of the night and he he forgotten

193
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,878
that he had put his tent right on the

194
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:10,279
edge of a of a cliff and he dropped uh

195
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:13,840
like 50 ft and passed away as well so

196
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:17,000
it's it's scary it's scary how fragile

197
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:21,119
life is you know we get caught up in the

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,079
day-to-day stresses little things I saw

199
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,478
someone I think it was Addison actually

200
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:28,318
who's going through some things right

201
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:30,680
now uh Salo Salo from Chile uh in

202
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,278
regards to um what's important to you

203
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,360
what are you grateful for he asked what

204
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,320
are you grateful for and you know

205
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,839
jokingly I replied great hash even

206
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,680
though not really jokingly obviously I

207
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,080
am grateful for that but not quite as

208
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,759
grateful as you know Todd McCormick was

209
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,278
when he was in a wheelchair and all he

210
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,159
wanted to do was be able to go to the

211
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:49,639
bathroom and wipe his own ass and get

212
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,199
back up and walk

213
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,879
away these are the the the humble

214
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,240
lessons of life um you know Mike Tyson

215
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,480
said if you are not humble in this world

216
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,039
this world will dress humility upon you

217
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,639
you so I choose to be humble rather than

218
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,199
to have it dressed upon me that [ __ ]

219
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,240
scares

220
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:13,720
me I got a really nice Blast from that

221
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:17,320
rosin hit and it is sunny the sun came

222
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,879
out so strong right after I hit that I

223
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,920
wonder if I'll be able to balance this

224
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,958
again

225
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:26,240
without breaking

226
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,119
anything

227
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,079
sketchy

228
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,519
sketchy

229
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:33,519
oh I think that's the best I can

230
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:39,399
do yes Derek I

231
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:41,159
agree awesome Ron you know I'm grateful

232
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,919
for the panelists as well I do really

233
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,879
have to give it out to them it's uh it's

234
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:46,958
been a little bit of a difficult Road

235
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,320
and dealing with all the different

236
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,119
personalities and trying to keep

237
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,959
everyone happy and we've lost a few

238
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,959
along the way but uh I think for the

239
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:57,319
most part it's a pretty cool Core group

240
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:59,399
and uh I just I'm extremely grateful to

241
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,760
all of them for spending their time and

242
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,799
coming in there's no side deals or any

243
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,399
payments going on it's really just uh

244
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:07,199
they're choosing to share their time

245
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,240
with all of you and it's uh it's

246
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,879
exciting you know the fact that we even

247
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,519
have an audience like Todd said we used

248
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,639
to shout at the top of our lungs on the

249
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,799
sides of street corners and to be able

250
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,120
to have like uh this sort of Technology

251
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,399
available and then have actual people

252
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:27,799
like you guys that actually want to hear

253
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,799
it it's incredible man Master

254
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,599
Scout

255
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,039
Master

256
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,519
Scout flower rosin not always hitting

257
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:37,958
flower rosin uh Horatio didn't go

258
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,959
anywhere I just stopped sending him the

259
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:42,159
link we sort of had our own experiences

260
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,439
our egos clashed a few too many times

261
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,120
and I just started feeling silly sending

262
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,079
him the link we weren't getting along

263
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,679
and I have nothing bad to say about him

264
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,120
and I I'd hope that he has nothing bad

265
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,519
to say about me but uh hash church is

266
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,078
bigger than me in htio and so uh I just

267
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:00,799
wanted to keep uh keep the Purity there

268
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,838
without uh any any negative feelings cuz

269
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:06,719
I can honestly say that the panelists if

270
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,600
they're on hash church I'm 100% okay uh

271
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,959
with them and and I'm comfortable with

272
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,159
them but you know when you start your

273
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:15,239
thing it's it's just an ego thing really

274
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:18,639
it's a bummer but uh it is what it is

275
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,839
and my part is is that I play 50% of it

276
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,600
I'm I have an ego and he has an ego and

277
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,040
our ego started to

278
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,079
clash and uh yeah you know it probably

279
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,480
released him to have more time he was

280
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:33,799
always so stressed out about not having

281
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,399
enough time hey welcome MC West Mike is

282
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:37,399
another person that I I would love to

283
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,600
see come into hash church as often as

284
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,159
possible uh and I'm sure he does you

285
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,800
know when he comes in he lays it down

286
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,759
and he shares the knowledge and uh what

287
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,039
more can you ask for

288
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:52,039
really yeah Kyle well you know it's a

289
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:55,439
trip right cuz the ego is

290
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:57,519
um it's kind of like who your

291
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,560
individuality it's your you know it's

292
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,639
your choice and it's the voice that

293
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:05,559
pushes and directs you it's your little

294
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,200
motor that runs and so it's important to

295
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,399
have an ego uh I'm sure that probably

296
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,480
where we come from before we are born

297
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,480
and probably where we go after we perish

298
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,320
uh is a very egoless place where all and

299
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,159
everything is connected and it's you

300
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,800
know it's not this unique uh aspect of

301
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:26,439
life which is to be fractioned off into

302
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:29,120
this Singularity which is your own

303
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,639
uniqueness which is your ego so I'm down

304
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,399
with it um I don't mind it it's good to

305
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,680
keep the ego in check but I'm definitely

306
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,120
not someone that is tries to have no ego

307
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:42,679
because my ego uh is my passion it it's

308
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,639
the thing that uh that that drives me my

309
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,958
driving

310
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:48,440
force yeah well we come from the truth

311
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,559
and we go to the truth and uh so this

312
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,519
experience is kind of a unique small

313
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,078
small experience where we're outside of

314
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:56,240
that and there might be other things to

315
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,319
explore uh so many people are trying to

316
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,480
get back to where we came from or get to

317
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,480
where we're going going I'm more focused

318
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,320
on being here where I am and uh just

319
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,440
exploring that while it while it occurs

320
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,399
you know from our limited experience

321
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,519
what we know about it is that it's uh

322
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:18,278
it's very

323
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:22,078
um it's short it's very short so enjoy

324
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:25,360
it while it's here live life eat well be

325
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:29,000
kind have empathy and compassion and of

326
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,759
course enjoy incredible phyto canabo

327
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,399
whether for the recreation or the

328
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:35,799
medicinal or even the preventative uh
