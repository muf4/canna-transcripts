1
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:30,159
for 99% of everybody else I people who

2
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,260
have Alzheimer's people have cancer

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,960
people who have Apple are say right of

4
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,989
course a whole plant extract is is gonna

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,149
be a superior cannabis medicine should

6
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,070
people have the right to get isolates of

7
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:45,429
course people should have the right to

8
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,619
choose whatever cannabinoid formed they

9
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:50,320
want I mean that's we were all given

10
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:55,659
endocannabinoids systems like there for

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,549
a reason we've learned I think a lot of

12
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:59,529
people or endocannabinoid deficient and

13
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:02,198
I love the idea of cannabinoids being

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,510
fortified into foods and put into drinks

15
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:10,989
and just like for people to have more

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:12,820
access to them as well yeah of course

17
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:15,969
right it's the largest neurotransmitter

18
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:18,939
system in the human body and in most of

19
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:21,609
the world for most of you know at least

20
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:25,629
the last 50 years people have been

21
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:28,569
deprived of the nutrient that engages

22
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:32,859
with that neurotransmitter system so

23
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:36,759
it's crazy you know when this period is

24
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:38,590
looked back upon it might be a hundred

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,560
years before it's looked on from this

26
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:44,790
perspective but prohibition of cannabis

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,980
will be recognized as this like bizarre

28
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,930
thing where you in beings willingly

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,210
divorce themselves from the most

30
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,380
valuable plant on the planet yeah and

31
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:59,619
people will look at it just

32
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:01,390
incredulously mm-hmm but there it is

33
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:06,100
right maybe this is the human race

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,560
learning a valuable lesson you know like

35
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:11,129
we were talking about earlier

36
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,080
we're just making a big - very valuable

37
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,840
though the regulation and the changes

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,350
are happening today are that they're

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,200
actually making you test dose exhibit

40
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:23,939
show strain value like whether to C or

41
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:28,189
CBD so you can make educated decisions

42
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,189
on what you're consuming because

43
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:36,180
consumer protection container protectors

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,830
that is the best part of the new

45
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,159
regulation - there's a lotta really

46
00:02:37,830 --> 00:03:20,579
really really personally who's eaten a

47
00:02:41,159 --> 00:03:23,419
really hardcore edible yeah thousand

48
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:27,930
milligrams that they're sitting you know

49
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:34,560
probably face apart for most people like

50
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:38,359
to go walking on Queens day well look

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,359
you know everybody's system is different

52
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:50,669
but I think CBD CBD is gonna be a bubble

53
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:54,269
and that bubbles gonna break you know

54
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:56,639
what we know from a fully legal mature

55
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,200
cannabis market where people have access

56
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,869
to the full spectrum of cannabinoids

57
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,859
yeah very few people choose the CBD

58
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:07,939
isolate any worse and

59
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:11,180
and most most people prefer I'd say of

60
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:14,240
all of our CBD rich formulations whether

61
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:17,720
it's a flower or a tincture or a capsule

62
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:22,120
one to one is really the the most

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,120
preferred animations and TFC in there

64
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:28,609
Bruce founded weed md in canada and so

65
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,500
he worked in before that he worked in

66
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,600
like old folks homes so he came from a

67
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,339
highly regulated business already

68
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,470
something everyone was a cannabis

69
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:39,409
industry so regulated Bruce was just

70
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:42,770
like well it wasn't just bad regulation

71
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,610
knowledge variance it was more around

72
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:49,060
the polypharmacy issues with seniors and

73
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:52,009
looking at seniors suffering over

74
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,418
prescribing of opioids and antipsychotic

75
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,740
drugs and looking at the value of

76
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,168
cannabis that could actually treat some

77
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,050
of these indications and that's really

78
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:18,469
what like made it for me valuable to get

79
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:20,569
involved and I'm like you know this

80
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:24,430
could be a really interesting safe way

81
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:27,050
of my career path and you know what I

82
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,720
still teach and provide value for

83
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,030
seniors and do it differently and when I

84
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,470
maybe my first business card and a

85
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:35,478
canvas sleep on the back people that

86
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,250
didn't like it was an alien like like

87
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:39,379
the pharmacies and the corporate world

88
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:45,949
and like they're like are you insane

89
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:48,100
Mike boy maybe I am but you know it's

90
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:51,110
evolving and it's developing and I'm

91
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:54,080
super glad that I took chose this path

92
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:57,229
to go on with you guys on this adventure

93
00:05:54,079 --> 00:06:00,139
for the pioneers and really have blazed

94
00:05:57,228 --> 00:06:01,789
the trails and like really unloaded

95
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,099
didn't figure out the science for what

96
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,110
we're doing here and I'm learning every

97
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,510
day I'm no idea what's going on from

98
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,040
2012 today

99
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:11,490
that's like six or seven years of

100
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,020
hardcore intensive sort of training I

101
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,040
mean it's a lifetime and every day is a

102
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:17,289
new day and every day you learn

103
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,520
something totally new and it's a very

104
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:23,830
complex world and just like everything

105
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,139
that's happening in THCA and this and

106
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:28,569
that and terpene thought of using what

107
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:31,300
are the effects and it started with

108
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:37,269
sativa as a make you feel awake and you

109
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:38,620
know indicator narrow leaf so it's like

110
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:40,839
all these things that we're learning

111
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,560
about this industry that's some nice

112
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:46,810
medicine and this herb in this

113
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,000
incredible plan but makes the soul

114
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,639
unique and valuable just lemon the

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,680
journey and that's why you caught that

116
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:59,289
in insanity right which I call a divine

117
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,259
madness right I mean we are we are we

118
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,360
have all been called by something right

119
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:06,879
which is I don't I don't think we've

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,590
fully wrapped our minds around hearts

121
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,870
around or certainly our brains around

122
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:12,939
what this thing is but we're all being

123
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:17,379
being called by the same force at the

124
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:18,910
same just like a really great feeling at

125
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:21,310
the end of the hall and you know what

126
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,590
the end of every day when I was in the

127
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,149
long-term care world I'd come home and

128
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:26,589
I'd actually have this feeling of like I

129
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,929
actually just actually provided for the

130
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:31,719
world today I'd like people died and we

131
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,639
took care of them we let them live their

132
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,650
lives with integrity we celebrated their

133
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,300
life for as long as they lived in these

134
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:39,639
homes and like all this stuff you know

135
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,470
and when I in transition of this career

136
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,419
and I was thinking how can I compare to

137
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,850
this value my life and feel the same way

138
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,410
about and interested in something but

139
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,050
this has actually done that for me and

140
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,730
so I'm you know this experience has

141
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,740
actually provided that value for me with

142
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,060
all the patients and all the lives that

143
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,670
are changed and all the incredible

144
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,170
stories that are shared with me over the

145
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,590
last seven years that I've been involved

146
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,540
in

147
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:03,539
I feel very fortunate to be included

148
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:10,870
cannabis in any senior facilities in

149
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,850
Canada than that many I have act

150
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,459
I had actually like corporate contracts

151
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:18,490
and seniors facilities to provide

152
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:22,419
prescriptions with the doctors to treat

153
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,400
medical indications like for real with

154
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,720
cannabis like that's what's going on

155
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,909
right now there's an animal patient he's

156
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,130
long to look there to all of it and

157
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,279
people are interested and they're you

158
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:35,019
know it's not the 90 year olds that are

159
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:37,419
like looking at this so intensely it's

160
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:39,549
the children of the seniors that are

161
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,348
looking at their poor parents like being

162
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:43,839
all doped up on opioids and drooling on

163
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,430
themselves and are non functioning well

164
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,139
let's just try this room and see if they

165
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:48,519
respond awesome they're walking around

166
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:53,470
holy [ __ ]

167
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:54,699
Greg hasn't walked in two years sitting

168
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,240
there drooling on herself we thought she

169
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,530
was done

170
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,000
well she's dancing having fun yes it's

171
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:07,720
freaky it's hard to feel bad when you

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:10,419
feel good like it is that's the truth

173
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,529
though then this happens well so I'm

174
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,909
nervous

175
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:16,470
one of the things we're going to do on

176
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:29,740
this trip is visit a elder community

177
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:31,600
down well for ten hours okay the one

178
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,820
that you went to know I'm getting ready

179
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,700
to go to right it's an elder community

180
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,190
the features of vegetarian diet that

181
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,750
incorporates nutritional cannabis into

182
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:46,480
that diet

183
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:49,149
cannabis medicines and and topical

184
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,830
treatments awesome and so I'm getting

185
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:52,840
ready to go down there and see it but

186
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:56,650
you know the organizers are just

187
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,149
reporting amazing amazing how those I'll

188
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:00,909
tell you try to leave

189
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:02,620
night we will see all the lights on the

190
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:03,159
mountains that yeah that made me so

191
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:09,070
happy

192
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:14,139
me too thank you really looks like it

193
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:15,340
looks like stars way it's certain points

194
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:17,949
you can see like you know these are

195
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,230
little family communities that's so

196
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,520
crazy I sure wouldn't be hard to find I

197
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,879
think we should go see you grow there's

198
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,759
100 of them remember that all of those

199
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:42,429
firms are growing vibrates oh yeah

200
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:48,069
they're growing but try this actually do

201
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:50,859
you want to go that they discovered yeah

202
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,810
he's like saw the Sun emerge so there's

203
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,190
these key figures and so L got to was

204
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:55,899
think one of the guys that went up into

205
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,490
the hills new Maren barrows and he

206
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:59,049
showed them how to extend their life

207
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,360
cycles all those lights a lot of them

208
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:03,189
are there because of him I told him I'm

209
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,259
like dude that's like epic like you're

210
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,150
like Mustapha the Nigerian that brought

211
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:10,659
slipping these screaming techniques to

212
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:13,659
[ __ ] Morocco in 1965 and started this

213
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:15,189
huge thing like imagine being the one

214
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:17,259
dude that went to Morocco I was just

215
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:21,280
like did you guys know about this have

216
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:25,960
you ever seen this before like 150 miles

217
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,250
of cannabis just kept planted so anyone

218
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,580
that says one person can't make a

219
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,379
difference I don't buy it yeah you know

220
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,240
it takes a lot it takes all of us but

221
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:37,240
there are certain key people at certain

222
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,600
times that just crack it out of the park

223
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,580
without even trying you know yeah but

224
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,350
then you you know you always wonder

225
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,450
right boys at the time or was it the

226
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,779
person then yeah or not it's like it's

227
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:53,020
taken an army of thousands of us tens of

228
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:55,179
them I mean it's very the point of all

229
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:57,759
this is this doesn't go back to the to

230
00:11:55,179 --> 00:12:00,459
the 20s and the 30s like that's [ __ ]

231
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,919
you know it's strange years maybe

232
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:06,389
thousands so in the European tradition

233
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,789
I would I would put the date at around

234
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:10,189
300

235
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:13,099
teachers like the Roman Empire adopted

236
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:16,490
Christianity as its official religion

237
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:19,850
and then bishops were sent out all

238
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:23,389
across Europe to cut down the sacred

239
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:28,459
groves of trees to poison the sacred

240
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:30,289
Springs to burn the sacred books and

241
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,599
knowledge the Muslims redeem innocent

242
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:34,730
women not just the Christians I don't

243
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,100
know if it was 14 their 16th century in

244
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,480
Cairo but the Sufis the Muslim Sufis who

245
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,399
were hash eaters they were having their

246
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,449
teeth wrenched out in the squares they

247
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,639
would put their fingers down their

248
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:45,799
throats if they threw up green and it

249
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:52,399
was cannabis they can pull their teeth

250
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:53,958
and guess what yeah no it's a that's one

251
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,970
of my one of the stories that I tell

252
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,919
about this too if you actually if you go

253
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,709
back in history what you find is that

254
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,909
cannabis has always been an object of

255
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:07,698
suspicion by elites financial elites

256
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:09,708
racial elites religious elites any kind

257
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:12,859
of a leak and I think the reason for

258
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:15,229
that is that the authority of the direct

259
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,870
spiritual experience that we have with

260
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:20,360
an abyss is stronger than any other

261
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:26,299
intervening mediating authority they

262
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:28,759
can't send it back it's so true it's

263
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:31,698
always been that like seemingly forever

264
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:33,230
where people have just and it's people

265
00:13:31,698 --> 00:13:36,049
who don't use it that have this massive

266
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,209
problem with it you know I think it was

267
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,979
dr. David Allen that talks about the

268
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,828
enemy

269
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,810
hijacking the little switch that's fight

270
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:45,399
or flight and he talks about the

271
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:49,000
endocannabinoid system and how this

272
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:52,000
little switch gets like rusted in to

273
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,089
flight mode and so a lot of people that

274
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,528
are like really severely severely

275
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,000
endocannabinoid efficient are like they

276
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:59,230
want to be prison guards they want be in

277
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
the army they want to work for the

278
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,610
police they want to like have control

279
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,139
and rule over people and it's like those

280
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:17,139
are the people that have the most

281
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:20,230
problem with people using cannabis it's

282
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:26,589
like like Steve said and 100 years from

283
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:29,519
now what we have never had before right

284
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:32,410
is with the reforms that have happened

285
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,948
and the sciences happened

286
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:41,588
we now have an ability to absolutely

287
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:43,240
document everything that we say so now

288
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,010
modern talking about is coming along

289
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:54,430
like for years yeah it would be like oh

290
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:58,028
yeah you can go look at the old oh now

291
00:14:54,429 --> 00:15:02,638
take a look no we have the human

292
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:06,539
clinical trial analysis in computers

293
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,528
yeah with people that you see and

294
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:16,539
holding everything in the palm of their

295
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:17,799
hand like access to all you know say

296
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:19,539
what you want about those things but

297
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:21,458
they're definitely like a part of the

298
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:23,860
revolution you know like people

299
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:26,559
revolting because of what they learn on

300
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,389
these on these phones totally a part of

301
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,879
it okay two different the difference

302
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:33,579
between before internet and afternoon

303
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,409
today right when I first started doing

304
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:38,528
activist work if I wanted to catch the

305
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:40,448
government and a lie I had to sneak into

306
00:15:38,528 --> 00:15:42,659
the university library which was like

307
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:44,128
you know at the two-hour bus ride away

308
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:45,778
it was too young to go into the

309
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:48,300
university right I'd have to go through

310
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:51,059
these card catalogs and I'd have to find

311
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:53,818
these old dusty values of like original

312
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,768
material then I have to copy them right

313
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:57,299
then I have to like get this stuff if I

314
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:58,620
wanted to share it with anybody I'd have

315
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:00,990
to like run it off on this old

316
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,750
technology called a mimeograph machine

317
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,818
and fold it on put it on some wood

318
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,309
stamps on it and take it to the post off

319
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:10,649
right it took forever to find how the

320
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:12,778
government lying debunk it now right

321
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:15,059
it's like I see so the piece of [ __ ]

322
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:17,039
that comes along ago debunk and I put in

323
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:18,750
the name of the study and usually like

324
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,278
I've got six or eight people around the

325
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:24,089
world who have already analyzed the

326
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:25,919
thing proving it to be false right my

327
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:28,439
forty thousand followers know about it

328
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:36,750
and they're spreading it on the Internet

329
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:40,068
oh yeah oh yeah did you see the RCMP

330
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,068
what they announced in Canada recently

331
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,879
they said this Lego gummy was such a

332
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,610
high milligram dosage it was enough to

333
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:52,500
kill a toddler oh my god they have since

334
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:54,568
retracted their track it's amazing

335
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,659
they're like we took a 25 pound dog and

336
00:16:54,568 --> 00:16:59,370
injected it with three ounces of extract

337
00:16:56,659 --> 00:17:01,469
intravenously and we surely thought it

338
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,078
would die and a day and a half later to

339
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,909
our surprise it was fully recovered then

340
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,038
we took another dog and injected seven

341
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:10,230
grams of pure extract into it you know

342
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:11,970
and they're just like it to our surprise

343
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,779
once again there's no dose we can give

344
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:17,459
these dogs to induce yeah like yeah they

345
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:20,189
could have just like gone back to the

346
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:22,380
East India Report which the English

347
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:26,009
Parliament commissioned it was published

348
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,650
in 1894 and they already tortured dozens

349
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:31,500
of dogs to prove this way back then they

350
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,419
did not need to do any more dog work

351
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:38,190
I don't know if you've ever been to the

352
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:40,950
ICRS the so I was there in Leiden in

353
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,750
March and the first day was great I went

354
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,460
with Dave Watson and some other friend

355
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,440
from Sager a tissue culture company and

356
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,980
you know the first day was all junket

357
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,250
partland

358
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,048
it was in you know a John Portland spoke

359
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,119
and he was great he's a character he was

360
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:56,038
doing the pollen study where the pollen

361
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:57,750
was found and it's tracing the history

362
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:59,339
of cannabis through these pollen tests

363
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,169
that they've done and it was great all

364
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:04,288
plant-based but the next day it turned

365
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:06,538
into like we tortured these mice for 14

366
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:08,940
hours at a time and they're like they

367
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:11,220
have to give them so much smoke because

368
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,019
and I asked the guy said why do you have

369
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,159
to give them like that much smoke that's

370
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:15,720
the equivalent of what the person

371
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,700
smoking 10 pounds and he's like well

372
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:27,000
when we give them a small amount we

373
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:30,000
can't tell I'm like yeah walk them

374
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,710
across an aboard of nails to see how

375
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,909
fast they react I'm just like listen

376
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,500
there's got to be better ways for us to

377
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:36,330
figure out mechanisms in the brain like

378
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,069
maybe maybe we could take psychedelics

379
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:39,899
and learn about some of this stuff like

380
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:41,099
why do we need to torture animals I

381
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,890
couldn't sit through it

382
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,959
these are monkeys and dogs and rats and

383
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,820
mice I was just like man this is like a

384
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,950
part of being the science that I'm not a

385
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:52,589
big fan of there's got to be another way

386
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,840
we can create a system that can still

387
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,428
produce results we can learn these

388
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:58,189
mechanisms we can learn how they work

389
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,600
without

390
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,840
creating that karmic debt one oh let's

391
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:07,109
see here in all of recorded human

392
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,750
history there is not one death that's

393
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:13,469
been introduced by cannabis they know

394
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:16,319
this so we can't have human trials we

395
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:19,288
instead need to torture animals who

396
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,450
don't have the ability to give informed

397
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:23,970
consent there's plenty of human beings

398
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,980
happy to give anything or consent to

399
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,470
participate cannabis [ __ ] with a

400
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,679
nelson research that guy he's been

401
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:33,360
smoking pot for 50 or 60 years like it's

402
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,100
unbelievable how they

403
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,019
look at it like still to this day I

404
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:38,879
think that until they acknowledge that

405
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:40,529
it's not dangerous that we don't need to

406
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,370
protect children from it that maybe we

407
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:43,470
should protect children from

408
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:45,750
pharmaceutical drugs like fentanyl and

409
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,390
alcohol like that those could those

410
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,890
things have very low ld50 numbers the

411
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:53,070
amount which is also a sick if you know

412
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,630
what ld50 means right back to testing in

413
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:56,970
animals and it's the amount of the dose

414
00:19:54,630 --> 00:20:03,150
that they give the animals when a 50% of

415
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:06,900
the subjects and that's of course

416
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,970
there's an open story I mean but then

417
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,830
it's not such a worry the way they treat

418
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,929
cannabis like plutonium you have to have

419
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:15,329
a biometric three-foot fixed safe with

420
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:17,880
rebar in force and it's like treating it

421
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:20,220
like it's plutonium is a part of yeah to

422
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,049
me it's just part of an ongoing the way

423
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,589
their homes and their bars are sitting

424
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:27,539
out on their owners yeah of course you

425
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:31,619
know you're totally right you know that

426
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:34,230
they they still regard cannabis as a bad

427
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:35,909
plan and as a dangerous plan and that

428
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:40,890
informs everything so in California

429
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:44,580
right now we have basically a California

430
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:48,870
right now the since legalization for

431
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:54,529
adult use on one 118 we lost about 50%

432
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:57,629
of the previous legal consumer base

433
00:20:54,529 --> 00:21:04,349
because the tax rate went from around

434
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:06,330
10% to in some places above 40,000 and

435
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:10,019
everybody who is in the market before

436
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:12,418
January 1st 2018 was somebody who had a

437
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,730
recommendation from their doctor a lot

438
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:16,830
of them were veterans a lot of them were

439
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,329
seniors a lot of them were families with

440
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:21,089
children and they were the parents

441
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:23,250
generation for the for the medicine for

442
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:25,829
the medicinal part didn't get

443
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:28,589
consideration in the tax there is there

444
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:31,289
was a split right there is a very small

445
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:33,569
enormous count which can be given okay

446
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:35,579
but in order to receive that discount

447
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:38,189
you have to have a doctor's

448
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:41,579
recommendation and you have to have a

449
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,950
state-issued canvas cart when you start

450
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:46,679
adding up the cost what everything

451
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:49,500
doctor requirements visit right the time

452
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,810
that you take off of work going down to

453
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,599
fill out the application picking your

454
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:57,179
card back up again you have to be you

455
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:00,119
know quite a heavy consumer to be able

456
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,560
to justify spending what amounts for

457
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,019
most people to four or five hundred

458
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:07,529
bucks to get a discount that's about

459
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:12,480
seven and a half percent yeah so I it

460
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:14,809
the the treatment of cannabis as a sin

461
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,019
product instead of a wellness product

462
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:21,539
has as sent you know the people who need

463
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:23,609
a legal regulated market than most

464
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:26,819
people who are vulnerable who have

465
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:29,459
compromised immune systems back into the

466
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:32,700
illicit market where the cannabis is is

467
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:36,930
untested right so you you see it

468
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:39,230
everywhere we I mean the tax rate a tax

469
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:42,509
rate of cannabis and California is

470
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:45,990
magnitudes higher than the tax rate for

471
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:50,400
alcohol so the state is incentivizing

472
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:52,799
people to consume a substance which we

473
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,920
know makes them reckless and violent

474
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:59,099
right and disincentivize people from

475
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,420
consuming a product that makes them gin

476
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:03,389
you know you raise a good point because

477
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,730
like I still talk to the people you know

478
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:08,009
in Canada and we're we're like you know

479
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,630
there's heavy taxes on this product and

480
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:12,450
they can go still visit their buddy

481
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:15,300
bill and grab their bag and don't pay

482
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,590
taxes on that but I'm like how crazy is

483
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,649
it that we've evolved to the point where

484
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:20,639
you can actually go in and out have an

485
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,120
educated decision but the product you're

486
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,150
gonna buy it

487
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,529
I mean to get to that point but the

488
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,780
testing and all everything that's

489
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,700
required to ensure that the grow and

490
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:32,129
everything is clean and tested and

491
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,440
profiled there's saqqaq there's a

492
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:37,410
there's a serious cost of that and i

493
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,029
think there's value to that I agree

494
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,920
absolutely first definitely no

495
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:42,180
definitely look I'm late and I'm talking

496
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,220
I'm talking to guys that are like well

497
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,808
often like can actually

498
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,610
for this and they're like saying oh I

499
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:50,250
still buy it off Bob because I get it

500
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:51,298
for 40 bucks for a half an ounce what am

501
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,869
i do what are you smoking

502
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:56,190
I wouldn't like we've evolved like this

503
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:58,709
is something that you know to the

504
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:01,080
dispensary you know this is this this is

505
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:03,600
that you can see the profiles like get

506
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:06,029
involved when see learn about what works

507
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,279
for you it's something that cannabis

508
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:11,519
consumers have a right to okay every

509
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:14,009
other product for human consumption to

510
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:17,308
make sure 8 it's safe so the idea that

511
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:20,129
that that the only way that you can get

512
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:24,298
a cannabis product that has been tested

513
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:26,100
and is safe is to pay 50% or 75% more

514
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:28,349
than you would need to on the

515
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:30,418
unregulated market it's just another one

516
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:32,038
of these examples of where the stigma

517
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,259
that attaches to cannabis

518
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:43,579
just continues to create all kinds of

519
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:46,529
social harm to get that to accuracy you

520
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:48,928
know it's not the cost of the testing

521
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:51,359
that's raising the price of cannabis at

522
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:53,580
least in California yeah there's yeah

523
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,788
look there's some cost that's tested

524
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:59,879
okay but what's really driven the price

525
00:24:56,788 --> 00:25:01,710
high is the fact that the taxes are so

526
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,230
high and the reason the taxes are so

527
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,548
high is because there's a whole

528
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,529
constituency of the state of California

529
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:10,529
that would prefer to keep cannabis as

530
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:12,899
inaccessible as they can for as long as

531
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:16,079
they possibly can in the misguided

532
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:18,120
belief that they are protecting society

533
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,949
by doing that and many of them actually

534
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:22,500
think that they're doing the right thing

535
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,929
I mean you you're a hundred percent

536
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,538
right and I agree with you wholly that

537
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:30,120
the cost of the testing isn't raising

538
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:32,788
those prices but it's a cost of the

539
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:35,129
production to meet the criteria for the

540
00:25:32,788 --> 00:25:37,140
testing for release for distribution

541
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:40,559
that's where the money is

542
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:43,429
I know but what above life what we get

543
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:46,288
in return for having to bear those costs

544
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:48,419
is the ability to scale and if you can

545
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:52,140
scale efficiently yeah then you think

546
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,540
our videos cost I and that's why I'm you

547
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,070
know

548
00:25:52,539 --> 00:26:00,190
much as I love small right no man I mean

549
00:25:57,069 --> 00:26:03,279
nice I did this here place where

550
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:06,430
cannabis consumers deserve what every

551
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:09,190
other consumer haves okay and yes we

552
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,560
should always be able to get good craft

553
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,360
cannabis I agree we should also be able

554
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,309
to get cannabis that's grown an

555
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:18,369
efficient scale that maybe a lower price

556
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:20,470
and we should always be cannabis in our

557
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:24,039
own homes right

558
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:26,710
a guru so but there should be a

559
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:28,450
multitude of ways for us to get cannabis

560
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,230
because there's a multitude of cannabis

561
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:34,920
consumers with different types of Altru

562
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:38,259
and there's a there's a huge new

563
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,730
infusion of into the cannabis culture of

564
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:41,980
all these young people that were never a

565
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:55,360
part of it before so we have to be open

566
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:57,430
with our arms and we were at a meeting

567
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,629
one time ago the gap it involves it's

568
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:13,269
since the beginning you know around

569
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:15,400
2012-2013 well I got my 25 years in you

570
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:17,349
know for us we started very young Jack's

571
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,820
book we were in our teens we've got

572
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:22,689
Jack's book we started reading it real

573
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:24,759
like kidding me this is crazy and we

574
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:26,259
were living in Manitoba and so we were

575
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:28,250
like how are we gonna do my dad pulled

576
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:30,200
me aside

577
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,730
thing better do it right didn't want to

578
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,830
get in trouble so me and my friends were

579
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,420
like let's become a head back to this we

580
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:36,980
learned all this [ __ ] from Jax club we

581
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,630
live in the prairies let's create a

582
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,309
document get some minused meetings with

583
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,890
our Minister of Finance and our Minister

584
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:45,859
of Agriculture and let's propose that we

585
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:48,230
grow hemp in the prairies and we went in

586
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:50,689
and our deck set on the front pages of

587
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:52,880
the trillion-dollar crop and the guy is

588
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:55,120
just like what you know world ready

589
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,120
dough

590
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:04,519
students Terrance and they're just he's

591
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:07,279
just like you know what is this guys and

592
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:09,349
we're like to make sure mate

593
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,819
it says the billion dollar crop and he's

594
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:13,339
like what's this I'm like well that's a

595
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:17,059
a magazine cover from Popular Mechanics

596
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:18,649
in 1932 and I'm pretty sure it was the

597
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:21,019
first time Billy and a dollar had ever

598
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:23,120
been used in an economic statement and

599
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:26,299
all his ears perked up I think he saw

600
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:28,399
what it was a real you know it was a Oh

601
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:36,529
cousin pages out of Jack's book he's

602
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:38,090
gonna believe an 80 year old man anyway

603
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:40,129
it took nine months

604
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:41,959
and we got a license to grow him we

605
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:46,760
planted our first 5 acre experimental

606
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:49,519
field in Manitoba in 1995 by 1998 all

607
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:52,369
the groups across Canada had organised

608
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,079
and changed the law from experimental to

609
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:56,359
commercial that was when the hemp seed

610
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,369
company started being coming into play

611
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,740
that year we started a fight or

612
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:02,599
remediation program in the Ukraine to

613
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,000
remove radioactive nucleotides out of

614
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:06,829
the soil using hemp we didn't know that

615
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,619
that could happen but the people who

616
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:11,869
grew in Ontario were tobacco farmers Joe

617
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:13,879
Strobel and Jeff came in 1994 think

618
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:16,069
about SARS licence oh well they spray

619
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,050
radium-226 on their tobacco fields it's

620
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:19,939
a radioactive nucleotide that raises the

621
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:21,490
levels of nicotine not allowed to do it

622
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,230
in a lab but you can do it under the guy

623
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:25,450
an herbicide and a pesticide that they

624
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,220
have to wear like hazmat level seven

625
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:30,100
suits or whatever super poisonous [ __ ]

626
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,870
so they have to test their field and so

627
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:35,259
after the hemp crop they tested it and

628
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:38,019
they were like this is here like where

629
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:40,480
did it all go happened then they tested

630
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:42,369
they happen they realized all hemp is

631
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,470
pulling out radioactive nucleotides so

632
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:46,449
that turned into a trinova project and

633
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:48,700
it turned into this pretty cool thing

634
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,380
that kind of all it was this it was a

635
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,880
the company was called consolidated

636
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,200
growers and processors and it didn't go

637
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,120
anywhere I mean the woman that was in

638
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,980
charge of it maybe was a con woman

639
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,859
I don't know she ended up in prison the

640
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,870
company kind of folded but my partner's

641
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:04,539
started Manitoba harvest and so that

642
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:05,819
company recently sold Oh about three

643
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:08,079
years ago it sold to the Compass Group

644
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:11,220
433 million and then the Compass Group

645
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:14,019
just sold it to tilray for 419 million

646
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,880
so a hemp seed company you know like

647
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:19,240
that was just kind of started by a bunch

648
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,800
of dredges that were like English and I

649
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,200
was in the has finished read when that

650
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,058
would all that man anything you know I

651
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,289
started my company evolution

652
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:28,029
I remember a pollution we were

653
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:30,099
supporters we sold it out our hemp store

654
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:32,440
the hemp exchange yeah we used to buy

655
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:34,569
evolution that was one of very few I

656
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,519
mean what was a 2-star dog came down

657
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:37,990
later on down to show dog there was a

658
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,210
little after up there's a couple other

659
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,460
companies I mean Danny always had access

660
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,740
to good stuff and Rob was you know

661
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:46,000
another good source but Rob's doing hemp

662
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,640
again now I don't know if you know about

663
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,140
Rob Clark's project Anarchy he's got

664
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,660
this beauty he's doing beautiful rugs

665
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:55,270
and all sorts of you know it's called

666
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,740
hemp boutique I believe meant he's

667
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:58,960
working with a good friend of mine from

668
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,819
Turkey Amir and they've got beautiful

669
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,170
stuff they got like drumsticks that are

670
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:07,178
stops like the fibers okay

671
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:09,190
we got to remember to talk to rob about

672
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:13,360
it yeah get rumble call he'll be stoked

673
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:14,980
so do you I do it did is well let me

674
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,229
tell you all story because I'm not gonna

675
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,759
ask if you know it because probably one

676
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,920
or two of you might write but if you

677
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:23,960
take a look at the Indian flag of India

678
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:26,420
you'll see that there's a circle

679
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:30,529
and that circle is a spinning wheel and

680
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:33,170
the reason that it's there is because of

681
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:36,289
the role that textiles played in the

682
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:38,660
indian movement for independence so back

683
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:41,269
in the days of the English Empire when

684
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,850
it was ruling India they would buy

685
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:46,940
cotton from Indian farmers at very very

686
00:31:43,849 --> 00:31:49,129
low prices they would ship it all the

687
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,230
way to Manchester they would mill it

688
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:53,630
into textiles and then they would bring

689
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:54,829
it back to India and I ridiculously huge

690
00:31:53,630 --> 00:32:00,410
profit

691
00:31:54,829 --> 00:32:03,649
so Mahatma Gandhi started a movement for

692
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:07,430
Indians who supported independence to

693
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:10,100
spin their own cotton and weave their

694
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:12,890
own I'm like an 8 foot backstrap loom or

695
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:15,319
whatever mm-hmm exactly right that's the

696
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:18,980
same and and the fabric that was

697
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:22,519
produced is called Cuddy and Cuddy has

698
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:27,380
this very distinctive rough texture it

699
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:30,619
looks just like yeah and it became the

700
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:32,990
symbol that supporters of the

701
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:35,569
independence movement always were fewer

702
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:37,880
supported the independence movement then

703
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:41,419
you work haughty you wouldn't think of

704
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,430
buying fabric that was produced in the

705
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:46,490
English factory an amazing be English

706
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:50,180
empire arete right so I think the time

707
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:52,160
has come now for us to embrace that

708
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,890
vision for the cannabis right for a long

709
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,440
long time it was difficult to find him

710
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:59,120
products that were reasonably stylish

711
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,289
enough that they could catch traction

712
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:05,389
but I think that's changed now and as

713
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:06,920
soon as as soon as I start finding some

714
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,480
more really very kind of stuff I'm just

715
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,630
I'm going to start wearing it all the

716
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,089
time

717
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:15,210
about it right here bezel that is

718
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:16,919
another thing that we can do to to break

719
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:20,039
down stigma and educate people about

720
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:23,279
cannabis that's very easy Oh take a look

721
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:24,779
at my jacket did you know yeah

722
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,119
well surely is something that he'll

723
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:29,549
probably find interesting and appreciate

724
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,199
what we have I mean I was so involved in

725
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:34,289
the hemp projects from the beginning I

726
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,940
moved out to BC very early on 96

727
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:37,950
we got hemp going I was like okay my

728
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,990
furnace I'll go to BC be our pioneer

729
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,460
well he just stayed in Manitoba and did

730
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,289
this hemp thing I ended up hooking up

731
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,150
with Hilary black becoming the first

732
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:46,259
grower for the BC compassion club she

733
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,550
was like kind of in love with Todd

734
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:49,049
McCormick she was like should I go back

735
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:50,759
down to California and live in a mansion

736
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:53,099
next to the Reagan's a real weed and I

737
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:56,970
was like or should I stay in Canada and

738
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:58,859
start a compassionate Club that's like

739
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,019
she became a servant to the people this

740
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:02,639
girl who grew up like fairly like you

741
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,920
know in West Vancouver when a well-off

742
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,290
family gave up everything and just went

743
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,300
and her integrity was so high she just

744
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:09,840
like didn't make any profit for like 20

745
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,379
years

746
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,240
and so I felt you know that experience

747
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:16,889
of getting to grow for those people

748
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,168
they're all terminally ill this was 97

749
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:20,669
98 so it was a lot of AIDS patients

750
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:21,960
suffering from wasting syndrome it was a

751
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:24,359
lot of junkies out on the street that

752
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,769
had acquired all sorts of heinous

753
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,419
diseases like some of them were stacked

754
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:29,309
like five or six and they had mental

755
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,168
health problems and it was it was the

756
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:32,969
beginning of civil disobedience where we

757
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:34,648
were kind of like you know we can't do

758
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:35,789
this for headaches it's gotta be

759
00:34:34,648 --> 00:34:37,049
something serious

760
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:38,519
you know where it got you know

761
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,019
California of a sudden some years later

762
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:41,219
it's like all they're just the one for

763
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:42,898
headaches like as if it works for

764
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,178
headaches little did they know healthy

765
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:47,638
for the rabbit hole where people are

766
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:50,550
just always trying to you know downplay

767
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,300
the the effects but yeah just moving out

768
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:55,490
to BC was it was

769
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,470
you know meeting Hillary doing that for

770
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:59,299
the club getting busted at a roadblock

771
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:00,769
was 16 pounds and a bunch of cash

772
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,180
because people were breaking into her

773
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:03,320
club they were driving cars right

774
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:05,329
through the front windows and then

775
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,039
trying to steal the safe so I took home

776
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:08,569
some herb one day and got popped at a

777
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,239
roadblock with it and became one of the

778
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:13,550
first compassion club cases in Canada

779
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:15,799
Richardson versus Regina was my case

780
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:17,930
John Conroy was my lawyer and it was I

781
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,760
had no idea that had anything over three

782
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:26,629
kilos in Canada at the time was a

783
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:29,090
maximum fine of anyone guess 25 years

784
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:31,460
for just over and I'm like whoa like

785
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:33,410
just a second like this is just flowers

786
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,630
like what you guys talking about I don't

787
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:37,699
think anyone's ever been given it unless

788
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:39,860
you know there was other circumstances

789
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:43,429
going on but it still freaked me out to

790
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:44,720
face that and in that moment I was it

791
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:46,309
was a cop who busted me in a roadblock

792
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,319
and I remember thinking like is this a

793
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:50,539
is this a costly mistake or a valuable

794
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,769
lesson now I lost all this stuff for the

795
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:53,239
club and I felt like I had to pay it

796
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:55,070
back and then I had to pay a lawyer and

797
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:57,769
I had to do all this stuff and I didn't

798
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,960
know what to do and I started the bubble

799
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:02,150
Bank company that was and I thanked that

800
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,099
cop years later at a roadblock even

801
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:06,110
Constable John Lowe I pulled up to a

802
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:07,279
roadblock I was like John he's like he's

803
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,660
the clues man I'm like Mike Richardson

804
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,850
you don't remember you busted me at the

805
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:15,649
roadblock end of the bridge I said

806

809
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:26,179

said earlier I think we're all being

822
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:00,350
called by a force that's too big for us

823
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,210
to comprehend right and that force works

824
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:03,429
and

825
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,220
really mysterious ways and sometimes

826
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:08,529
brings us pain so that we can be

827
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:09,429
motivated to make the changes to this

828
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,440

00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:23,169
for a long time being in the industry

834
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:24,519
for so long I've admired the things that

835
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:26,639
you've done the moves that you've made

836

00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,800
exactly a hundred and ninety a glass of

847
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:59,199
memory

848
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,880
I never forgot any case the important

849
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,129
part of the stories that I got posted in

850
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,190
1999 couple hundred pounds of weed

851
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:12,579
fairly serious I charged in the United

852
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:15,369
States at that time and [ __ ] MERIS ago

853
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:17,589
so I get busted I [ __ ] lose

854
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:19,660
everything that I've worked for I all

855
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:25,139
the cash the house everything

856
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:28,179
everything's gone like 45 years old and

857
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:30,009
and I'd already been in the process of

858
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:33,489
moving to California got out to

859
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:36,069
California and I got like nothing so I

860
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:39,939
go into the dispensaries and I see these

861
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:44,739
ugly little balls of black goo that are

862
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:47,710
supposed to be water hatch and and I was

863
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:50,379
like I tried it it was just it didn't

864
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:53,500
work for me but I had read Rob Clark's

865
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:56,980
book right so I understood the process

866
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,630
right and he's one yeah as I said where

867
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,730
where he had instructions for making

868
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:03,250
water - right my first I started that

869
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:05,230
was the Mafia's own right I start off

870
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,358
with the coffee cone so I was like

871
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,280
familiar with the technology in fact

872
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:12,578
when I used to go down to Mexico I would

873
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,100
bring coffee cones with me so that I

874
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:14,840
would be

875
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:17,799
you know have some good hash to smoke

876
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:20,360
well while I was while I was down there

877
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,940
but but I took a look at this situation

878
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:25,550
I was like alright there's an

879
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:29,829
opportunity here so I got your bubble

880
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:33,320
bags size of those bubble bags up to

881
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:35,179
Mendocino calico and I started

882
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,010
collecting everybody's trim which at

883
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:38,809
that point they were like oh you want to

884
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,970
take it away from here hello yeah I'm

885
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:44,360
getting ready to compost it he changed

886
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:46,519
all the way right and and so what I did

887
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,460
differently was drying and sipping the

888
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:52,340
product and and then branded Shiva

889
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:57,530
Crystal's was the brand and and we hit

890
00:39:52,340 --> 00:40:01,730
the market probably like 2003 is my is

891
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:04,160
my guess so man you you know your bags

892
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:06,050
helped me because the business that

893
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:14,420
allowed me to get back on my feet

894
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:17,780
time to start Harborside I tell you it

895
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:20,539
wasn't too like 2003 2004 I get calls

896
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:25,150
from guys from Eureka Trinity County all

897
00:40:20,539 --> 00:40:25,150
in that area Mendocino maybe like

898
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:37,050
[Laughter]

899
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:42,410
touches my heart man like I mean I'm

900
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:44,059
just selling bags you guys are the ones

901
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:45,440
putting them to use you know I'm just

902
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:47,119
putting the information out there and

903
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,470
teach them people and it's been it's

904
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,819
been one of the biggest blessings of my

905
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:52,369
life being able to do that you know

906
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,960
going to Jamaica in 2000 bringing bubble

907
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:56,449
bags turning all the farmers and orange

908
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,889
hill onto it giving bubble bags away you

909
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:59,239
know to the tune of a couple grand each

910
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:01,849
trip that I did it because I knew no

911
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:04,009
one's gonna be able to buy $250

912
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:07,429
you know bags but just teaching people

913
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:07,960
that was so rewarding and being in the

914
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:09,608
grill

915
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:13,389
when they had the one hi Times Cannabis

916
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:15,219
Cup can't remember 2014 maybe they're

917
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:17,858
announcing the winners for the hash it's

918
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:21,069
like you know third place is this guy

919
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:23,049
Winfred he's he's he's one of the guys

920
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:25,088
that gave back to second place is junior

921
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:28,119
he's like one of my Bros that I taught

922
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:29,889
personally first place is Ziggy he's the

923
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:34,150
guy that I gave him the first banks to

924
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:36,940
in Jamaica like it was unbelievable it

925
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:38,619
just makes me feel so good of course and

926
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,838
to see the pride in their face you know

927
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:43,150
like I took this skill I've kept it over

928
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:45,909
the course of 19 or 15 years and I I

929
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:49,088
worked it and I if you listen to the

930
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:50,769
bags they can direct you to finding the

931
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:52,299
cannabis that you're looking for you

932
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:53,679
know or growing better cannabis or

933
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,410
figuring out how to get a plant to

934
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:58,838
express those profiles to the maximum

935
00:41:56,409 --> 00:42:01,659
you know effectiveness of its abilities

936
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:03,130
and so people a lot of people didn't get

937
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:05,858
that and the people who had great weed

938
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:09,519
they may bubble hash with like this is

939
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:11,409
genius but 80% of everyone else were

940
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,030
like they made that black goo balls and

941
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:15,279
we're just like nah this is what let's

942
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,869
just make butane there's no matter how

943
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,540
shitty your weed was Beauty always kind

944
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:21,608
of came out as a gold oil so tool to a

945
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:22,750
lower level kind of connoisseur or

946
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:24,670
someone that's just getting into it

947
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:26,199
that's good quality that's like look at

948
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,240
the quality it's like nothing like and

949
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:30,250
the same resin would be like sand

950
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:32,139
you couldn't press together if we made

951
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:35,108
bubble out of it and the number one

952
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:37,329
question for bubble hash makers is how

953
00:42:35,108 --> 00:42:39,670
do I get my hash to melt like yours

954
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:41,588
and I always have to say well I don't

955
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:44,260
want to be a dick but you have to grow

956
00:42:41,588 --> 00:42:46,299
better herb like you have to and if you

957
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,950
listen to the bags they're there they're

958
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,750
your word of God they'll direct you you

959
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:51,669
just just keep trying new things making

960
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:54,039
mistakes learning and and you know

961
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:57,130

00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:15,670
particular with cannabis to share the

970
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,470

978
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:38,980
belief is that the that the existence of

979
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:42,460
our species and possibly the existence

980
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:45,099
of this planet is right on that you take

981
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:46,960
a look at all of the ugly things that

982
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:49,989
are happening in the world today in

983
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,750
people's hearts and minds and in the way

984
00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:55,209
that we're treating the planet a wake-up

985
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:57,130
call is clearly needed and you just

986
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,360
start thinking a different way of acting

987
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,789
in different way I don't know of

988
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:04,329
anything well I know some other

989
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:06,219
visionary plants but yeah in terms of

990
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:08,319
what's realistic in today's world I

991
00:44:06,219 --> 00:44:10,599
don't know anything else is capable of

992
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,850
making that change in the time that we

993
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:16,769
have less what is it twelve years that

994
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:24,819
we supposedly have left to dial down

995
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:28,000
global warming before yep

996
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:29,470
so scream it right I mean that's what

997
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,820
we've been doing all these years and we

998
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:32,319
just got to keep doing but here's the

999
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:35,050
good thing oh yeah like what I've seen

1000
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:39,460
here in these two conferences in

1001
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:42,100
Colombia is that you know how how under

1002
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:44,530
prohibition it kept us all isolated into

1003
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:47,889
these really really small communities

1004
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:50,530
and we couldn't be open so we had our

1005
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:53,859
own small circles of tight people that

1006
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:55,990
we trusted and and and that operated on

1007
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,849
a local level and operated on National

1008
00:44:55,989 --> 00:44:59,859
Lab all right and now with reform

1009
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:02,980
actually reaching multiple different

1010
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:05,410
countries around the world right we are

1011
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:09,280
able to come out of our hiding places

1012
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:13,319
we're able to like say oh hey you look

1013
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:17,650
kinda like me yeah kind of talk like me

1014
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:20,620
you even kind of dress like me oh maybe

1015
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:23,170
maybe are you in my tribe today right

1016
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:25,719
you know so we're seeing this like

1017
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:27,519
coming together of this cannabis tribe

1018
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:29,349
that has been existing all around the

1019
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,929
world for all of these years but we've

1020
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:34,869
been forced and dispersed into this like

1021
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:37,839
hidden diaspora right yeah and now we're

1022
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:40,690
coming out of those hiding places and we

1023
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,700
are meeting each other linking like it

1024
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:44,559
is all these little learning linking

1025
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:46,149
teaching right that's a teaching

1026
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:47,739
function that we've been doing I think

1027
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:52,000
if you teach correctly you're always

1028
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:53,529

1029
