right here I can do that as well um well

43
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,718
you know what one thing we have to have

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,878
is of course venting you you need air

45
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,840
air movement I say is the key with

46
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,120
everything it's definitely really you

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,519
you lack air and one of the things I've

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,640
noticed in a lot of gardens that I've

49
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,319
shot over the years that one thing they

50
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,359
have in common with a lack of air is

51
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,000
they usually either have a high amount

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,640
of mildew or they have a high amount of

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,800
bugs bugs don't seem to like the big air

54
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,878
Mo movement you know when you you keep

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,599

139
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,120
garden understand that you're not a

140
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,160
professional sometimes in all the

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,720
different aspects and if you're not a

142
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,639
professional maybe the best thing to do

143
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,599

164
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,360
products are an imperative part on

165
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,120
growing properly the little things you

166
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,639
think you don't need like the simple

167
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,280
timer becomes the biggest nightmare you

168
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,800
could ever possibly imagine trying to

169
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,878
wake up twice a day to turn your lights

170
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,038
on and turn them off and all that it's

171
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,360
ridiculous and then one extension cord

172
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:23,639
per each timer and like dude please no

173
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,000
that that's what they talk about people

174
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,918
are causing fires and stuff cuz they're

175
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,360
being unsafe they do the key things yeah

176
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,799
it's just little things temp so you hook

177
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,680
your fan up to this so if it actually

178
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,800
gets a little too hot therat thermostat

179
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,680
turns on so your room is never above 80°

180
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,759
cuz this will always vent out off of

181
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,560
that another great idea uh to make up

182
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,639
for potential human error and to make up

183
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,079
for things that we can't foresee like

184
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,400
those random days where it's supposed to

185
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,158
be 15 or 20° which I guess would be

186
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,079
about 65 or 70 Fahrenheit for the

187
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:55,918
Americans and all of a sudden it's uh

188
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:57,439
you know 30 or 40° that day Celsius

189
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:03,639
which would be about

190
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:05,598
110 f so therat perfect buddy I got you

191
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,960
that and then of course I got you the

192
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,199
human thermostat that's key you know so

193
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,638
that way you know and with this one here

194
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,038
you get set so you know your minimum and

195
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,478
maximum so when the lights go off you're

196
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,519
going to know your humidity I can't

197
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:17,680
actually imagine not having this simple

198
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,639
piece of information uh John brought one

199
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,158
by with the first tent that we set up uh

200
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,720
in my office and uh every day I look at

201
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:27,158
my humidity and my temperature every day

202
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,960
I used to write it down I knew

203
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:31,439
everything I wrote everything down for

204
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,759
years the how everything fluctuates so

205
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,519
in fact the hyper fan because before you

206
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,838
brought the hyper fan really is a

207
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,000
testament

208
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,959
to the the temperature that it keeps my

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,440
tent at on 35% I never have to turn it

210
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,879
up full just on 35% which is as low as

211
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,320
you can go with a hyper fan it's got a

212
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:54,519
variable re uh little uh dial and you

213
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,160
can only turn it down to 35% power and

214
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,919
it it it's pretty quiet at that point

215
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,559
but it's still working um it keeps my

216
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:02,958
tent at 7 75° it never goes warmer even

217
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:06,439
the other day when it peaked at about

218
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,518
20° my tent was like 76° oh that's sweet

219
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,640
yeah so these are definitely also I

220
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,639
would really say this is an important

221
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,278
part of of your grow

222
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,278
tent excellent so maybe we'll get the

223
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,759
table out we get the table out we'll set

224
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,360
up the camera at a different angle and

225
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,679
we'll show you guys all this stuff sort

226
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,000
of uh oh well we also have the tent we

227
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,159
got to get the tent out we haven't even

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,360
shown you the tent is these hard hard

229
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,399
trays you were talking about oh those

230
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,240
are key as well little key things here

231
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,399
get rid of some of this stuff the idea

232
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,440
is we're going to pull this table out

233
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,000
we're going to set everything on the

234
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,200
table so we can work off of it and uh

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,679
this is all you need you can set

236
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,240
everything up here that's it rough cost

237
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,838
here is you know going to give you the

238
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:49,159
cost of everything here which is roughly

239
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:52,360
about about 15 16 I think retail yeah

240
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:56,838
perfect work off a table all right so

241
00:09:52,360 --> 00:10:01,039
this is it is a 4x8 secret jarden it's

242
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:04,959
the dr24 w same one I got at home the

243
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:08,719
secret jardan yeah I love it dark

244
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:12,639
room Dr what does it say that oh it's a

245
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,680
dark room it's a dr40 w the dr40 W I

246
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,879
started off with one of those and then

247
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:18,838
moved over to uh a good friend of mine

248
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,399
and he has it all going right now you're

249
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,279
a good guy John and then I gave another

250
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,039
one away you know what these things are

251
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:25,720
key for people growing their medicine

252
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:27,519
and this what we talk about is being

253
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,680
able to grow your own medicine at home

254
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,360
and we're going to show you how we all

255
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:33,039
grow our own medicine at home you know

256
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,360
for the for the cost of maybe under

257
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,799
$22,000 you can have a setup where you

258
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,039
start producing resin and one of the

259
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,719
great things about these videos that

260
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,519
John and I are showing you right now and

261
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,000
you can check out John H Bell's Channel

262
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,278
at John H Perell on YouTube as well for

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,078
his own separate grow videos is that I'm

264
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:50,600
going to show you how much resin you can

265
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,679
grow in one of these tents I'm not going

266
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,440
to tell you well I mean I am going to

267
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,679
tell you how much bud I get as well but

268
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,360
it's not going to be weighed dried

269
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:02,679
trimmed it'll be uh look I got this much

270
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,519
wet I ran it I got this much dry resin

271
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,879
it's going to be about resin production

272
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,879
so I'll be able to tell you how much

273
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,639
square foot you need to produce how much

274
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:14,320
resin per month to set yourself up for

275
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,039
your I love that you know what like

276
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,920
everybody's asking with me how much how

277
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,799
much do I need to grow to grow myself

278
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:23,000
one gram a day that would resin that's

279
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,679
the question that's the question we're

280
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,240
going to answer in the upcoming months

281
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,399
so this is what this is all about right

282
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,278
now this is awesome yeah dude let's get

283
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,200
the table out let get it going you know

284
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,360
what all right so we got the tent ready

285
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,920
to

286
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:41,000
basically pull

287
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:41,000
out open the box up

288
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:48,799
anyway all right okay this is all in a

289
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,200
nice bag it comes in a bag are you

290
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,359
serious that's really

291
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,680
nice get

292

00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:02,399
bag look at that so

294
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,320
these are the corners so this why nice

295
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,958
to have the table R besid you hear

296
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,560
absolutely there's the

297
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,039
instructions yes inst stret this tells

298
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,479
us how to put this bad boy together that

299
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,799
will be

300
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,879
required we have many different bags of

301
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:20,439
post actually going to show you how this

302
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:23,838
go together I would suggest that these

303
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,279
bags of posts are not to be all mixed up

304
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,279
immediately oh no no you keep defitely

305
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,278
St

00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,719
and

307
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,000
[Music]

308
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,639
uh here's the liner that goes on the

309
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,159
inside here excellent so this will be

310
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,879
the inside

311
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,159
liner and uh that will be for the hooks

312
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,958
this is going to be your little Windows

313
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,439
a yes

314
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,879
little and the bag will come useful for

315
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,519
when we uh move it to uh someone else's

316
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,000
place yeah exactly it will and we'll

317
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,240
have that on film as well so there's

318
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,240
those hooks

319
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,360
the first thing we're going to do is

320
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,440
we're going to actually put this

321
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,639
together I always do first yes

322
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,000
absolutely so every one of these are

323
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,720
numed we have a e

324
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,039
b

325
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,879
b these are going to be our rails we can

326
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,480
take just right across the thing I done

327
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,320
so many of these I've actually probably

328
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,680
set up like 30 of these okay so um this

329
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,160
will be our top so we can just move

330
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:24,599
these right out of the way for now don't

331
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,519
have to be in our area excellent put

332
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,120
them over here on the snowmobile there's

333
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,078
going to be our four main Corners so let

334
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,039
going to start our bottom base excellent

335
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,039
so we'll open those

336
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,079
up the

337
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,360
direction the directions are never a bad

338
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,638
idea so now we're going to get all the

339
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,440
A's fairly simplistic directions too

340
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,919
it's pretty easy so we have all our A's

341
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,079
I do this so I can get my bottom base

342
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,679
and then you know how big your tent's

343
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,719
going to be see like this yep and then

344
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:54,359
the other one goes there these are the

345
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,519
two metals it just shows that these four

346
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,519
corners see these Corners are those not

347
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,240
these yes I said so perfect that's all I

348
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,440
was trying to make sure we have that

349
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,759
right it's always good to have a friend

350
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,519
to go over this with make sure yeah a

351
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:15,440
couple sets of eyes are better than

352
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,440
one said3 still going to read the

353
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:20,000
instructions I'll show you the

354
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,839
instructions too real quick it's a nice

355
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,919
little sheet

356
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,759
here dark

357
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,799
room and then it's also got a step by

358
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,919
step so we're basically in this step

359
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:34,479
right here we're going to set up the

360
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,919
base and once we get that done we'll

361
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,199
move on to the next point of business

362
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,078
what just getting the we just basically

363
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:45,799
set this Frame Up ever so

364
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:49,919
simply so that was real

365
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:53,599
easy we SC we got that put together our

366
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:57,719
frame pull those bees out pass me three

367
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,159
bees one two two three and three and

368
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,839
these are tapered one end so you can

369
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,838
actually put the top together and make

370
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,000
the height perfect so that's a good idea

371
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,959
if you uh heard what John said the

372
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,440
tapered end goes up because you're going

373
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,799
to be adding the extra metal piece to

374
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,800
get the

375
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:20,198
height okay so that's oh you want me to

376
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:22,799
plug that in but that doesn't plug in

377
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:23,758
Stand It Up Stand what up stand up oh it

378
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,719
stands

379
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,759
up and then we're going to put the top

380
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,959
one pieces at a time yeah I think all at

381
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,879
once would be sweet okay

382
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:34,958
if it's you know cuz it's so not heavy

383
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:37,159
it's not it's we can do it we can do it

384
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,679
and we're grabbing just a plastic and it

385
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,719
seems like all the parts that could fall

386
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:45,359
out have already fallen

387
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,680
out have already fallen out so I'm just

388
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,680
going to

389
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:59,079
grab I'll just come over and plug them

390
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,838
all in yeah I figured if I don't move

391
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:04,519
oh that's beautiful oh that's a

392
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:07,120
beautiful okay so inside and now we're

393
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:11,639
at the point where we just have to

394
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,639
basically zip it together zip it

395
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,000
together so let's pull this pop over and

396
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,680
then we can zip it down is there a top

397
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,720
oh yeah there here but I was trying to

398
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:22,719
do in the beginning what I was

399
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,839
oh that's a

400
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,839
tent Johnny all right

401
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,480
tent

402
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,079
accomplished

403
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,720
excellent

404
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:16,159
so you should open up the front door and

405
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,160
take a look inside

406
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:24,318
yeah how's that people we just got

407
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,038
ourselves so this is how I mount my fans

408
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,399
in my tent and because there isn't that

409
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:30,279
much room I like to get them up high so

410
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,519
what I do is I've just started taking

411
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,038
this out of the

412
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:38,440
box get this out of the box and I drill

413
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,640
holes in the bottoms and you know what I

414
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,480
always like to go right through the

415
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,160
bottom like this cuz you kind of want to

416
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,599
keep it close because of course it's

417
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,440
just a pull on each side right

418
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,798
yeah

419
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,120
so know the light is in here here's our

420
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,720
switch that's going to blow down and as

421
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,439
you can see and now the Fan's perfectly

422
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,200
mounted in the corner you can adjust it

423
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,320
and it blows the wind on the plants

424
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,400
we're going to put these in all four

425
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,439
corners beautiful and that's just the

426
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,720
way I mount my fans excellent man yeah

427
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,640
all right so we've got all four of our

428
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,038
fans mounted two on the left side two on

429
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,280
the right

430
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:15,440
side a quick zap strap tip from John B

431
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:17,240
now we're going to take this little

432
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,279
piece of grate and this is how I'm going

433
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,880
to mount the little timer cuz the way

434
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,440
they have it is they make it difficult

435
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,679
but I came up with this ingenious little

436
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,360
way of I cut this down and we're going

437
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,240
to tape this on there and zap strap it

438
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,319
to the side and then we're going to

439
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,759
mount the timer next and that way we can

440
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,759
start plugging things in and then we're

441
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,400
going to take the piece of board to

442
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,319
mount the fans well I'm just going of

443
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,640
come in here like this and pretty much

444
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:44,480
cuz our power and everything is running

445
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,520
off of this corner right okay okay

446
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,679
that's where you want the power so we're

447
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:51,000
going to mount this little thing like

448
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,320
this and I got this uh handy little tape

449
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,599
cuz it's you know tin foil tape looks

450
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:56,599
nice too

451
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,038
[Music]

452
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:05,639
just like

453
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,760
that just like that just little handy

454
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,000
tips make like easy you know yeah and

455
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,000
then we're going to put some zap strap

456
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,359
so I'm going to make sure it's really

457
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,839
good and tight and we're going to zap it

458
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,399
again all right and then we're going to

459
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,279
mount the fire extinguisher up here okay

460
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,080
and then the lights will be right here

461
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,440
perfect yeah all right just little

462
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,759
stages all right the master lighting

463
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,600
control see what what we

464
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,440
got to verify the ballasts you plan to

465
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:38,839
run with the mlc or properly internally

466
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:42,320
connected to 12240 volt operation all

467
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:46,199
right so what do we got here we got

468
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:49,480
ourselves a mlc 4X Master lighting

469
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,720
control so check this out so just me

470
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,720
being

471
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,038
jie

472
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,558
this turn into it perfect yeah yeah that

473
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:00,839
makes perfect sense

474
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:03,480
let's get that done all right so John

475
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:07,000
be's mounted that really quite nicely

476
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,599
it's in place and ready for ready for

477
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,679
the next adjust a wing so we're at that

478
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,399
point yeah my my favorite I love these

479
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,400
things medium size for a tent it's all

480
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,240
you need those big ones are great but

481
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,280
they're definitely not going to come

482
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,480
inside of there right so I got that nice

483
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,200
little package and how these come apart

484
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,279
here is really quite how they I love how

485
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,440
they do this they put a little

486
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,319
protection on it

487
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,080
open it

488
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,519
up and boom and on the other side is

489
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:38,558
this little blue conone we're going to

490
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,519
peel this off and we're going to put

491
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,038
this thing

492
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,558
together look at that you do this as you

493
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,640
can see putting together these little

494
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:50,240
grow tents are very very easy it's

495
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,080
really a a no brainer in a sense like

496
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,279
anybody can really do it you have the

497
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,639
hooks on each side

498
00:20:54,279 --> 00:21:00,720
here as you can see we put these

499
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:04,038
together and you slide it that's it

500
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,480
that's it then the next step as it shows

501
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:08,519
here you put the little folds on the top

502
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,000
which you've got right

503
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:14,519

504
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,079
uh

505
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:20,440
product I I really enjoy this part cuz

506
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,158
they're just so easy and then simply use

507
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,038
the wires to loosen or tighten them

508
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,480
angle the lights at different angles

509
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,359
going to mount look at how easy this

510
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,599
comes beautiful local socks completely

511
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,879
attached it mounts on the underneath all

512
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,558
we have to do is wire that into the

513
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,039
ballast just plug that in yeah to the

514
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:41,798
ballast right into the ballast beautiful

515
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:44,480
I know so simple they make it and this

516
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:45,278
is all the CSA you know it's all great

517
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,558

in Canada and that's Plug and Play the

522
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,919
majority of ballasts will oh that will

523
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,960
all balles yeah all the older ball you

524
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,960
know what most balles are all the

525
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,319
same so so now you're going to mount

526
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,319
that in

527
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,159
there right so we just screw that little

528
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,159
guy right in

529
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,159
there and I got the other on the other

530
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,000
hand need a hand holding that or there

531
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,520
you go thank you sir let me get that for

532
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,519
you there we go

533
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,240
and is it

534
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,278
grabbing pretty easy here we're just

535
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,519
going to like unwind them and as you can

536
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:41,679
see each end's got two this one here is

537
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,119
got the different holes yeah and this

538
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,080
one here has got the single so I'm just

539
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:48,278
going to

540
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,759
proceed with putting this one right in

541
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:50,759
this side

542
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,880
here all right and I'm going to set this

543
00:22:53,798 --> 00:23:00,440
one off to the

544
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,440
side and the best part about these

545
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:07,880
is they just bend they just bend they

546
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:11,038
just bend we can stick this in here like

547
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,039
this wrap this around here like this and

548
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:14,519
then pick your your length that you want

549
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,038
it at well you can actually pick your

550
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,798
your different sizes there exactly right

551
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,519
which decides the length of the cord

552
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:24,679
which decides how

553
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:27,079
angled there we go the reflector

554
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,720
becomes beautiful so that one's open but

555
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:31,439
if we got the tent there we can kind of

556
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,720
give her another full yeah no problem

557
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,320
and go into this one simple simple

558
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,919
simple

559
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,918
simple they're nice little almost not

560
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,640
very metallic are they that's a

561
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,278
plasticky like yeah they work pretty

562
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,840
well you

563
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:48,720
know I have

564
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:52,038
simple yeah I've definitely seen them at

565
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,240
the great gardeners Matt's got them now

566
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:56,558
you got

567
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,960
them and the easiest part about it is

568
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,278
there's just no no screws no nothing

569
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,079

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:07,759
beautiful like

594
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,759
that and undo

595
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,640
this have the little button here so we

596
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,640
can kind of do

597
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,679
this and all we do is you lip this

598
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:21,759
around and then we hang it and then just

599
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:25,080
put one on each side and one on each

600
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,440
side excellent excellent just like my

601
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,879
light in my tent right now just like the

602
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,960
lights in your tent right now right now

603
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,720
and then we're going to mount those

604
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,159
balles right on that little board

605
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,480
underneath of that other one we have

606
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,480
over there and you know

607
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:40,480
what let's go rock this

608
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,360
in really quite easy

609
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,429
[Music]

610
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,599
and there's a light or a or a reflector

611
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,640
with ready for a

612
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:18,719
light and now we're just showing you how

613
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,080
we get this we adjusted properly and how

614
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,319
Mark wants to have them in here if he

615
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:25,558
wants to have them sideways and stuff so

616
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:29,639
pretty

617
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:32,879
much how easy it can be look at this I I

618
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,559
I love this cuz normally I have one Bast

619
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,720
in here and a 600 I had a 400 on the

620
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:40,278
track is what I have before but this

621
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,798
here is just so convenient would you

622
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:45,200
like me to give you a hand there at all

623
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:46,398
or um you know what if just hold that

624
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,080
there and then you've got both your

625
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:50,398
hands yeah I like that I'm going to move

626
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:53,720
it down about that much be able to put

627
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:53,719
the zap strap through the back

628
00:26:56,398 --> 00:27:01,398
here and we're going right around around

629
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:05,398
how we did the last one coming in like

630
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:08,000
this strap in strapping it

631
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:10,000
in we like zap straps they seem to work

632
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,960
quite well boom yeah zap straps are

633
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,960
great zap zaps are

634
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,640
great so I want to go kind of through

635
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,840
the back like that I just did that other

636
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,360
one okay I went through here like this

637
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,480
oh that's a great idea yeah was just

638
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:23,759
kind of you know what make sure make

639
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,519
sure it ain't going to go side to side

640
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,278
or anything like that yeah I mean that's

641
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,639
something you'd want to have nicely uh

642
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,200
secured

643
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,278
other things you got to look at safety

644
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,720
but uh once again we're going to cut

645
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,159
this one off here how we just did the

646
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,120
other ones make it look all nice and

647
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:43,440
clean absolutely hyper fan time hyper

648
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:46,639
fan this is my favorite part John I'm

649
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,038
not going to lie this love the [ __ ]

650
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,320
hyper of course here's a little remote

651
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:55,919
control there oh yes yes and it's like

652
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:59,079

768
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,200
all of our fans plugged in on this side

769

00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,519
than she's ever had so you can really

776

bored for whatever reason we haven't

803
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:27,118
figured out if it was a fuse or whatnot

804
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,280
so we replaced the fuse with the

805
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,800
Sentinel and d uh

806
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,720

yeah I mean when you turn it down to 35%

816
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,199
it's still pumping good air and you can

817
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,640
honestly barely hear it so yeah we've

818
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,439
staked up these plants they were all

819
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,838
being held up by themselves in the

820
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,039

Astro Boy sitting in there already and I

823
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:16,559

00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:19,280
some of these guys down I put them

825
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,039
