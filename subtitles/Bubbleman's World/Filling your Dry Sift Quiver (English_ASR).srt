00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome to Bubble Man's World and

3
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,720
welcome to filling up your dry sift

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,240
quiver. That's the title of the video

5
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,799
today that we're doing. And what I've

6
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:34,479
got here is I have a whole variety of a

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,960
different um sizes and and actual screen

8
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,119
sizes. Both obviously you can see that

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,679
these are a much different size screen

10
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,599
in just their actual size, but also the

11
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,439
holes themselves are different as well.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,480
So I'm going to get into talking a

13
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,799
little bit about that. Um I've got three

14
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,599
things that I'm going to cover today.

15
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm going to cover um the simple trick

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,800
that everyone's been talking about. Um,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,759
two screens are used, a 250 micron as

18
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,919
well as a 180 micron. Uh, that's these

19
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,000
two right here. So, these are u my

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,640
mediumsiz screens and they come in a two

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,079
and a four screen set. So, I'm not sure

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,719
if you noticed when I lifted up the

23
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,039
screen, but I've cut my screen in half

24
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,798
here. So, you can see that with the

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,280
fresh heavy screens because we put them

26
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,520
on properly that even a rip from one

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
piece of the metal to the next, I can

28
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,200
still use this screen. And I'm going to

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,600
show you how. Of course, I will

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,280
eventually replace it, uh, as using the

31
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,879
best possible tools is always the best

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,560
possible idea, but I'm just showing you

33
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,319
that you can actually, um, use these,

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,118
uh, screens even once they've been

35
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,158
potentially damaged. So, I guess the

36
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,400
first way we're going to do today, um,

37
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,439
mentioned the three methods. I guess I

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,680
could do that right over there,

39
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,919
actually. So, I've got a little bit of

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,680
nugget in this screen here. I'm going to

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
change the camera angle for you guys.

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,439
bring it a little closer so you can see

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,200
what's going on here. Okay. All right.

44
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,919
So, what I have here is a tiny little

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,079
bit of bud that I broke up uh over top

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,240
of this screen and to show you this

47
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,039
process really to show you how

48
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:10,560
absolutely delicate it is. It's really

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,560
just a matter of dropping the herb.

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,520
That's probably more than I needed to do

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,560
right there. Okay. So, we lift up our

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,560
first screen and you can see on

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,120
it right here, you can see that it's

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,878
captured some contaminant. So, if I move

55
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,878
in for you there, you can see that that

56
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,318
is contaminant. It's sitting on top of

57
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:34,840
the screen and it's very delicate, this

58
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:38,159
contaminant. Okay, this contaminant can

59
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,080
fall so easily. So, what we really need

60
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,840
to do is we need to lift up the screen

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,200
like this, both of them at a time. And

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sorry that I don't have this on the

63
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:51,639
all white part of this screen, but we

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,719
can just do this. So that was the sift

65
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,878
wizard technique. I don't usually give

66
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,680
him much of a shout out cuz I find it be

67
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,359
a little bit negative. So this is what

68
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,120
you would call a very high percentage of

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,959
heads, possibly um upwards of 80 to 90%.

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,759
And that's because I've already run this

71
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,959
material once. So it's it's sort of at

72
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,479
the end knocking over the parchment. And

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,479
so another thing you can do with this

74
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:20,959
process is you can you can kind

75
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:22,560
of gently mix the the herb across the

76
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,680
screen. This is going to release a lot

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,080
of contaminants.

78
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,599
But what you can do with this method is

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,799
once you've collected your your your

80
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:35,039
your higher grade, you can produce a a

81
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,640
secondary grade that is going to be much

82
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,039
more contaminated. I can see already

83
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,759
that the color is is much darker. Keep

84
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,239
in mind this was only about 7 g of

85
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,518
cannabis uh total that I broke up here.

86
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,719
I just wanted to kind of give you guys

87
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,879
an idea of how the sift uh trick works.

88
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,359
And so you can also give this a little

89
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:56,239
shiggy

90
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,080
shiggy. And what we get here is gentle

91
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,560
gentle contaminants sitting on top of

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,879
this screen. And it's best to just keep

93
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,158
those off to the side. And then we can

94
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,919
take this sift. Now this trick can be

95
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,519
used over and over and over again. And

96
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,158
it doesn't just need to be used with

97
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,560
herb. You can actually use this trick

98
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,358
with sift as well. I'll show you how we

99
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,040
can do that real

100
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:24,478
quick. Just get this guy

101
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,479
out. Put the herb on the screen

102
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:31,959
here. Okay. Give it a quick

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,478
rinse. All right.

104
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:37,359
So now another way you can use this

105
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,758
trick is I've got my I guess my

106
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,639
colander. Uh this is a 250 micron

107
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,000
screen. I use it uh mostly just to to

108
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,680
get the hash evenly to fall so it's not

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,600
in clumps. As you can see here, I've got

110
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,199
a little bit of the barb. It's clumped

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,800
up. We can drop it in here gently. Not

112
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,439
going to use a ton because I just want

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,079
to show you the process. And I can

114
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:04,478
gently rub this over the screen, break

115
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,478
these little balls down. You can use my

116
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,439
finger to to break these balls down.

117
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,680
They don't they're not that

118
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,759
tough. Little bit tougher than um than

119
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,000
the brush will allow. Once you've got

120
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,000
these components broken into smaller

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,839
little pieces where they'll actually run

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,839
through the screen, then it's just a

123
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:26,959
matter of rinsing and washing with the

124
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,198
brush over and over again to push this

125
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,918
stuff through. And what you'll often be

126
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,879
found with at the end is you'll end up

127
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:38,959
with a tiny little bit of

128
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:41,800
contaminant. So, as well as a couple of

129
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:46,239
balls that just don't want to break.

130
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,240
So give you that little show right

131
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:51,519
there. So this is a lower grade right

132
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,478
here. It's completely covered in cy with

133
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:57,038
hairs and captate

134
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:59,038
stocks. So just from that without doing

135
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,839
anything else, without banging or

136
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,599
touching anything too

137
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,679
harsh, we can see that barely anything

138
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,080
fell through. So we're going to give it

139
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,079
a gentle card.

140
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,399
Just a gentle card to get some of this

141
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,439
resin to come through. This is a little

142
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,719
bit different than the herb

143
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,279
process. But what this will do is it'll

144
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,840
drop these resin heads and these

145
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,198
contaminants

146
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:27,758
through. And you can see now on my

147
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,759
secondary

148
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,560
screen that I have all of this

149
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,240
contaminant sitting right here on top of

150
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,560
the screen. To the naked eye, it may not

151
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,400
look like contaminant, but when I get my

152
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,319
macro lens out and I show you what's

153
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,719
going on here, you guys will see it as

154
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,240
clear as a

155
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,280
day. All right.

156
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,840
So, gather up a little bit

157
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:55,159
more. And so, this is from the barb. Get

158
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:58,000
that one over there cuz it was a little

159
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,080
different. So, here they have some pure

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,319
heads from the barb. Now, you can see

161
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,519
that the process is really giving us a

162
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,199
small amount each time. And so, that's

163
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,318
why today I wanted to go over a

164
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,879
multitude of process. All right. So,

165
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,800
back to the distance shot here. I want

166
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,879
to show you with the two screens what

167
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
I've done here, which is a fairly

168
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,120
important component. It's on the bottom

169
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,478
side of this screen. What I've added is

170
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,160
I've added four little spacers and I've

171
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,918
glued them to the bottom of the corners.

172
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,000
Now, these spacers came from one of my

173
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,159
Pelican cases. It's simply the foam that

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,160
was inside the Pelican case. I pulled

175
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,039
out two little strips for each corner.

176
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,800
Cut them about 2 in long and I glued

177
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:42,560
them to the bottom of the screen. So the

178
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,439
top screen sits like a dish, right? But

179
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,280
the bottom

180
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:50,879
screen sits upside down. So the screen

181
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,038
is flush to the frame. So you get the

182
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,120
two like

183
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:57,439
this. Okay. And this process is great

184
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,519
for having at your office next to you on

185
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,439
your desk, having it set up in your home

186
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,079
somewhere always. So, it's just sitting

187
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,560
there. You've got a nice um sheet of

188
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,198
plexiglass or glass or whatever you have

189
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,959
cut to fit your screens. I use this

190
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,560
little piece of white paper because I'm

191
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,519
constantly moving them around. It seems

192
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,000
to be easiest for me. Uh very easy to

193
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,680
brush off as well. And one of the things

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,959
I should mention that the reason this is

195
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,959
all going to work today is because it's

196
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,318
very cold outside. It's extremely cold

197
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,918
outside right now. It must be close to

198
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,399
below zero. Which is why dry sifting uh

199
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,158
a with the properly dried material and b

200
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,278
in the proper setting with the proper

201
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,799
variables i.e. it being cold and dry. We

202
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,038
don't want a lot of humidity in the air.

203
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,718
We want it to be cold and dry. And

204
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,120
that's what it is right now. No doubt

205
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,000
about it.

206
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,120
So, I guess uh I guess we could cart a

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,399
little bit of more of this gently

208
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,039
through. Not even carding it because the

209
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,958
hole is so big. I can actually just use

210
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,399
the

211
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:00,399
brush. And so, gently, gently,

212
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,080
gently. That's going to produce an

213
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,799
enormous amount of

214
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,600
contaminant, but a small small amount of

215
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:14,799
the goods. I just don't have enough

216
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,639
room. There we go. There we go. It's

217
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,439
always good to set everything up so you

218
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,838
have

219
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,959
room. Okay, get three nice little piles

220
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,360
here. Now, keep in mind, we've used a

221
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,278
very small amount. We used about 7 g of

222
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,959
bud to get these two little piles, which

223
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,639
I've already gotten all the good stuff

224
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,719
from that bud. Unfortunately, I wasn't

225
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,480
able to show you the fresh bud being

226
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,399
crushed up and then being used, but I

227
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,080
kind of want to show you guys you don't

228
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,720
have to have bud. You can use older

229
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,720
material that's trim or or or lar bud

230
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,800
that's been crushed up. Uh you can of

231
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,440
course use beautiful top quality bud,

232
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,000
which I urge you to do. And of course,

233
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,000
you can use sift as well like you saw us

234
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,519
do with this. And you could run it over

235
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,679
and over and over again through these

236
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,679
screens, throwing it down gently,

237
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,679
lifting up the two screens, collecting

238
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,679
the small amount of what's there, and

239
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:07,359
just putting it onto the side. This is

240
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:09,199
one technique. This is one method and I

241
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,000
urge you to have it in your hash quiver.

242
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,800
This is a 60 lines per inch as well as a

243
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,240
90 lines per inch, which is 250 micron

244
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:20,159
for the 60 and 180 micron for the 90.

245
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
The numbers are counterintuitive and

246
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,278
don't match up. As you might have

247
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,159
noticed, lines per inch is a much

248
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:29,200
smaller number to equal a much higher

249
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,519
micron number. So, I guess what we're

250
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,160
going to do is that's enough with that

251
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,159
process. I've shown you pretty clearly

252
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,159
what you can do with that if you need

253
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,640
be.

254
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,120
So now I guess we'll talk a little bit

255
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,639
about the other two screens. Now the

256
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,519
other two screens uh are the 110 lines

257
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:56,078
per inch and the 200 lines per inch.

258
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,679
This is a 110 right here. And what I

259
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,519
would do with these is is pretty much

260
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:03,278
the same thing. Uh you don't need the um

261
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,679
the the spacers, but you can put them on

262
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:08,000
as well. And what I do is I have the top

263
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,919
one right side like this. So it's like a

264
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,879
dish that my material can fit in.

265
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:17,439
Whether I'm cleaning sift uh whether I'm

266
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:20,240
cleaning uh cannabis bud or or or dry uh

267
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,880
or or um trim. Regardless of what I'm

268
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,519
cleaning, I always have this one upright

269
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,360
like a dish. We're not going to be using

270
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,320
it because I've already acquired the

271
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,278
secondary material that I want to use.

272
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,160
So, we're going to get right into

273
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,639
carding. And so, a lot of you know the

274
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,958
process of carting. It's uh simply put,

275
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:42,039
we can take a little bit of

276
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:45,599
resin, get it

277
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,599
into into

278
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,680
here. Always the bumps want to fall out

279
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,959
first. That's

280
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:57,319
uh just the way it's going to be.

281
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:59,719
Oops. Get rid of that

282
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,240
stuff. There we

283
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,920
go. And I would also suggest that you

284
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,200
get a couple of brushes. I clean mine

285
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,199
all the time, but it's nice to have one

286
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,278
brush that you can use for plant matter

287
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
and another brush or two that you can

288
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,078
use to scoop up your resins. Even when

289
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,000
you're dealing with um the cleaned resin

290
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,479
that you've already cleaned, it's nice

291
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,600
to have a separate brush for the

292
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,959
contaminant as opposed to for the the

293
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,240
pure heads.

294
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,679
So, we'll take

295
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,560
this. We'll run it through the colander

296
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,559
real

297
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:32,559
quick.

298
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,720
Right. And this just gets it even. This

299
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,360
is just like taking your flour and

300
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,160
milling it. We do this because um it's

301
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,278
going to remove a tiny bit of

302
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:50,559
contaminant, which I will show you in

303
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,879
the corner here again.

304
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,359
Yeah, that's just

305
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:55,360
nasty, nasty,

306
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:02,159
nasty. All right. And then carding. So,

307
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,000
standard carting that I've been showing

308
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,759
for quite a few years now, which is just

309
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,159
to take the resin and gently card it

310
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:14,078
back and forth on the screen. Okay. So,

311
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,719
what this is doing is a multitude of

312
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:19,278
things. It's going to push the resin

313
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,959
that is non-resin, i.e. the contaminant,

314
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,278
the plant matter contaminant, which can

315
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,359
be

316
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:26,200
capac hairs and a variety of things that

317
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,879
are

318
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:32,320
indeed appear to be glandular to the

319
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:34,000
naked eye and have a very golden color.

320
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,920
And you'll notice I'm able to card this

321
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,679
fairly

322
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:39,919
fast. Well, that's because I'm working

323
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,000
in a very cold environment and I can

324
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,599
feel that it's it's a slow process. I

325
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,278
can feel that there's a lot of

326
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,040
contaminants and very few heads.

327
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,958
But this process what it'll do is it'll

328
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,958
push those capitate stocks, those cy

329
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,039
hairs and any of those other non-glular

330
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:58,879
components. It'll push them through the

331
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:00,559
70 micron 110 lines per inch screen. And

332
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,120
what you'll end up doing, this is a this

333
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,799
is a process that definitely takes time.

334
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,278
Um, what you'll end up doing eventually

335
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,399
is pushing so much through that the

336
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:13,519
percentage of heads that you have on the

337
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:15,198
top starts to really unveil the quality

338
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,360
that you have. Once you can acquire that

339
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:20,240
purity, you'll really start to unveil

340
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,240
the the the quality. So, I'm not going

341
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,159
to show you this for an hour, but this

342
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,320
is a very slow process, the carding

343
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,719
process. And the next tip that we're

344
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,199
going to show you is actually the

345
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,160
carding process improved. And

346
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:36,919
so, just to see if even that worked to

347
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,679
the

348
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:44,799
slightest, let's see what we've got

349
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:46,919
here. Oh, yeah. Yep. Get rid of that

350
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:50,000
herbs that fell

351
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,159
through. Just to show you just from a

352
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,679
small amount of carding, a very small

353
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,198
amount of carding cuz this this was

354
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:59,000
clean before I even

355
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:02,278
started. You can

356
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,759
see that I've

357
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:08,399
cleaned probably close to a half a gram

358
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,319
to a gram of contaminant. So, that is

359
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,559
the contaminant that I pushed through on

360
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,560
the screen.

361
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,519
And uh it's it's I'll photograph it for

362
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,159
you guys. I'm guaranteeing it's going to

363
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,159
be an enormous amount of cy hairs and

364
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,360
capitate stocks and some heads that are

365
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:28,078
smaller than 70 micron. So um that's the

366
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,199
carding process you've seen. Um I hope

367
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:30,799
that you guys aren't going to be

368
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,639
disappointed that I'm not spending 20

369
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,240
minutes on each process. These are

370
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,639
really simple and what I really want to

371
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,159
inspire in you is questions. So if you

372
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,879
have questions about this particular

373
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:44,799
video, I will make a second video um and

374
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:46,799
I'll of each process specifically to um

375
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,559
reply to your questions that you have

376
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,078
because maybe I forgot things. I know I

377
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,000
went over the two screen trick really

378
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:52,958
quick and I'll explain you. One of the

379
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,120
things that's happening in that

380
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,119
two-creen trick is you have these two

381
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,639
micron screens very close together with

382
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,639
a little space in the middle, but you're

383
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,560
using screens that are much larger than

384
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,759
we normally use when it comes to dry

385
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,000
sifting. And that's where the trick

386
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,240
comes in. When you drop the material

387
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,679
onto the screen, the heads are going to

388
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,320
fall like rocks. They're going to go

389
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,159
straight down like this. The contaminant

390
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,759
is going to fall more like feathers. And

391
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,679
what they happen to do is they stick

392
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,159
into the secondary screen. Even though

393
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,120
the hole is very big and under normal

394
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,240
situations, if you were thrashing or

395
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,240
tumbling, everything would go straight

396
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,480
through. In this situation, the

397
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,959
contaminant is falling like a feather

398
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,360
and then getting stuck in the bottom of

399
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,679
the secondary screen. So that is why

400
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,519
that process works. This process works

401
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,679
because the screens are so tight on the

402
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,399
secondary screen. the 70 micron if you

403
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,399
can imagine the carding is going to

404
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,839
break up the non-glandular material and

405
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,000
that's why the cold is important and

406
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,079
that's why dry is important any moisture

407
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,399
any heat any humidity are going to work

408
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,758
against you in this process so you

409
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,600
really want to make sure you have a cold

410
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,278
environment and really really dry

411
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,360
material and then you'll see things like

412
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,120
carding really have an effect because

413
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,639
you're running this material over a

414
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,519
screen back and forth and on a

415
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,240
microscopic level what's happening is

416
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,480
the small contaminant the system hairs

417
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,160
and the capitate stocks over time are

418
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,919
breaking up and disintegrating into

419
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,240
smaller parts much like the way the

420
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,079
ocean will break down uh you know large

421
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,519
rocks into smaller pieces and eventually

422
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:23,599
into sand. So what we're going to do now

423
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,838
for our third process and this is the

424
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,959
newest trick that I've come across um

425
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:31,200
via online and through my friends. Um I

426
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,240
saw a gentleman do this some months ago

427
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,080
now and he was taking a DVD cover. I

428
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,120
actually have a Wii game, Scribble

429
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:42,240
Knots, one of my kids games. And he was

430
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,798
using parchment paper. So, we will pull

431
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,720
out a little parchment paper and we will

432
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,359
wrap this movie. And I guess what he was

433
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,720
doing, what I really like, uh, because I

434
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,319
played around with the static a little

435
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,960
bit myself. But one of the things I

436
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,159
really liked about this was that I

437
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,880
wonder if there's going to be anything

438
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,279
to rip this

439
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:05,039
with. I don't think there is. All right.

440
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,038
Well, let's see what we can do here.

441
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,440
All right.

442
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So, get this parchment paper. Now, I

443
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,400
guess this works on a principle of like

444
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,960
static, but it's also working really on

445
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,519
the principle of what I'm seeing is it's

446
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,279
extending the size of the card that

447
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,558
we're using to push through

448
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,000
contaminants. And so, that's one of the

449
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,480
things that I was really interested

450
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,839
about. Um, I've only tried this process

451
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,440
a few times. Uh, D420K was really

452
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,159
excited about it the last time I talked

453
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,240
about it. He said that it helped him uh

454
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,400
clean up his carding game, you know,

455
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,558
tenfold. So, I thought, you know what,

456
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,080
I've got the audience. It's probably

457
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,000
very important for me to share this

458
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,159
because I want everyone to share uh to

459
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,319
to pick up their game of Tenfold. I

460
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,919
don't want people to be carding for 20

461
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,399
hours if they can be carting for a

462
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,120
shorter period of time. So, we wrap the

463
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
DVD in

464
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,840
parchment and then we push it through.

465
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:13,279
And you can see right off the

466
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,279
bat there's some heads that stuck to

467
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,080
it. Right off the bat, little bit of

468
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,348
pure headies

469
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,348
[Music]

470
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,720
here. All right. So definitely a very

471
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,160
cool

472
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,839
process. The fact that there's a little

473
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,440
bit of heads sticking to the parchment

474
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,759
each time and it's a very pure pure pure

475
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,519
uh form of heads. I think that this is

476
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,319
something that people could really learn

477
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,119
to use as an advantage to their dry

478
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:50,159
sifting method. We're getting that tiny

479
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,359
little bit of of pure heads stuck right

480
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,480
to the to the edge of the uh parchment

481
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:58,240
paper. And I have to say I like it. So

482
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,919
this is one more way. This is why we

483
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,558
have a quiver and this is why we got to

484
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,360
stop uh fighting with one another about

485
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,879
what the best process is when we really

486
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,759
what we should really be doing is we

487
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,200
should be discussing with one

488
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:14,640
another how we can move this forward.

489
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,840
And I'm definitely liking this large

490
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,600
sort of movie theater sort of parchment

491
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:24,159
paper movie DVD game whatever you use.

492
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,000
It's not too shabby at all. You can see

493
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,000
here I've got a nice little pile right

494
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,679
here, which

495
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,798
is much faster than the two screen

496
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,080
method. It's

497
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:37,000
probably get this taped probably next

498
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,119
time. All

499
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,798
right. So, we're just working it,

500
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,399
working it, working it. And you can see

501
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,960
that what we're doing is we're not only

502
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,200
picking up, but more importantly, what

503
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,038
we're doing is we're pushing through.

504
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,519
We're pushing through the contaminants.

505
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:54,919
And you can see that the material that

506
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:58,599
has been left on this particular screen

507
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:01,440
here is of a lower quality than when we

508
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:03,599
started. And you can see straight up

509
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,880
that what I've done is I've removed a

510
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,558
much lighter uh head from the darker

511
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,080
heads. So, what I'm going to do right

512
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,918
now is I'm going to get my macro lens

513
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,240
out and I'm going to photograph the

514
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,320
varieties that I did with the dry sift

515
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,919
tech with the two screens, the 60 and

516
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,599
the 90 LPI. Then I will show you a

517
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,038
little bit of the contaminant that I

518
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,798
pushed through with the carding

519
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,038
technique. And then we're going to move

520
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,400
right into macro photographs of this

521
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,359
process. I want to be able to show you

522
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,159
what I carded, what I took off the

523
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:38,639
parchment paper, and even what was under

524
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,559
the the screen of the 70 micron. So, I

525
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,559
hope you guys have learned something in

526
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,000
this quick little tutorial. I know that

527
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,399
the real thing that will open up our

528
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,240
minds is the macro uh photographs. So,

529
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,400
I'm going to go do that right away. I'm

530
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,159
going to take a dab of that, go do the

531
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,200
macro photographs, and I'll get back to

532
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,799
you guys with a little sort of finish up

533
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,360
um discussing what we've done

534
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:04,639
here. Okay, so I've been playing around

535
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,000
and um I took a few macro shots. I just

536
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,960
want to show you guys what's going on

537
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,079
here. I got the DVD, right? Here's the

538
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,600
three kinds from the DVD. I got in the

539
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:18,879
middle um three different kinds from um

540
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:21,599
carding on the three piles on the white.

541
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,960
Um the connect sign are from the two

542
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:29,719
screen trick, the 60 and the 90 LP. And

543
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:34,079
then I added these three on the corner

544
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:37,679
here, which is um a different kind of

545
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,960
hash that I did the DVD trick to. So we

546
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,120
got these over here. here. And you can

547
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,159
see probably out of everything, I'd have

548
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:46,079
to say the nicest material was this. It

549
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,200
was a I think it was a chemo material

550
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,960
that I had, chemo hashplant. It turned

551
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,519
out really nice. You can really see how

552
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,360
it pulled out an almost redlike head

553
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,359
compared to the contaminant, which is

554
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,038
very green and and powdery. Also, in the

555
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,558
middle here, you've got a very green

556
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,440
contaminant that came out of these two

557
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,918
much lighter components. And you see it

558
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,480
as well on the DVD. So, what I'll

559
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,759
actually

560
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,679
do, I'll give you guys a little bit of a

561
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,640
better show here rather than holding it

562
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:18,240
up at a weird angle. So, we'll show you

563
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,360
our DVD kinds. Boom. Boom. Boom. So,

564
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,159
this was um what what did we have here?

565
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:27,038
We had uh this was our best. This was

566
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,280
our second best and this was our swag.

567
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,960
And so, we've got it as well here. We've

568
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:36,079
got uh the best, second best swag, and

569
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,679
then we have the best, second best swag.

570
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,199
And then these three I have a hard time

571
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,559
figuring out cuz if you go closer to

572
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,000
them, you can kind of see a golden

573
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:45,599
material underneath. Like it got a

574
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,960
little hard. It got worked. So, this

575
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:51,439
resin could be potentially cleaned as

576
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,519
well. So, there you have it. All the

577
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,440
different processes right there. We can

578
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,918
show you what a raw sift looks like as

579
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,919
well on there just to give you that

580
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,320
color

581
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:04,159
effect. Quite dark, a little bit green.

582
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,119
Not the cleanest of sift. You can see

583
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:10,799
when I go into sift like this, how you

584
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:13,599
could see this come out of it. This one

585
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:16,240
right here is definitely what has

586
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,399
happened from Matt um over spinning his

587
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,159
material, which is no problem because

588
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,480
with the ability of cleaning it, you

589
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,278
can't really ever overspin it. From a

590
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,200
hashm perspective, you know, we like

591
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:30,400
gentler. It's definitely the way we want

592
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,319
to go. But if you want to make sure you

593
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,320
get every last little bit of that resin

594
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:36,879
off of your plants, I totally understand

595
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,038
it and I support it. So, I will be

596
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,039
putting in the macro photographs both

597
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:43,359
throughout as I'm taking the as I'm

598
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,679
talking about the resins. I'll show them

599
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,918
right at that point, but I'll also put a

600
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,000
little slideshow in at the end of the

601
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,480
video so you can see all the macro

602
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,640
photographs that we got. So, thank you

603

for watching Bubble Man's World. I hope

604
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,320
that you guys learned something from f

605
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,679
about filling your dry sift quiver. If

606
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,200
you guys have any tips or tricks that

607
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,798
you've acquired on your own and you want

608
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,880
to share them in the comments, please do

609
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,720
so. That would be wonderful. And if you

610
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,400
guys have any questions in regards to

611
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,000
things that I've shown here today that

612
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,798
wasn't clear or that you didn't quite

613
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,880
catch on, please ask the question. I

614
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,440
will make a point of surfing through all

615
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,840
the trollish comments to find the valid

616
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,840
comments and answer them for you. So,

617
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:25,399
right on guys, keep puffing that full
