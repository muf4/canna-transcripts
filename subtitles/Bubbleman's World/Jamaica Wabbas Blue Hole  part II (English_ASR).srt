00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,840
beautiful smell to it real exotic it was

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,079

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Jamaican herbs and this has it uh this

17
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:00,239

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,879
sham shamrock no

19
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,518
uh so this herb was given to me by my

20
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:06,599
buddy shadrock and shadrock runs the

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,680
vegan uh restaurant side side of the

22
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,158
road kind of restaurant called Ras Ries

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,520
and it was funny cuz when I walked up to

24
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,280
him and I told him who I was he said man

25
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,239
he said if it don't bubble it ain't

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,799
worth the trouble and I said how do you

27
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:23,158
know that and he said you showed my

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,640
father Ras roie how to make bubble has

29
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,359
like 12 or 13 years ago and I I couldn't

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,159
believe it it was quite a trip to now

31
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:31,759
realize how old I am that the people

32
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,600
that are recognizing me here are the

33
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,159
sons and the daughters of the men and

34
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,839
the women that I shared my knowledge

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,799
with uh almost 15 years ago today so why

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,560
don't we have a big old raw monster

37
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:48,799
Rosen hit got a nice little blob of gold

38
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,478
here and uh we're heated up we're using

39
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,880
the quartz Halo now so I've now shifted

40
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,280
from the uh Sapphire which obviously I

41
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,158
broke in the last uh pre

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,799
video quartz Halo is really I have to

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,680
say it's right on par with the with the

44
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,000
sapphire I've noticed very little

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,719
difference so far so Props to those guys

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,038
for pulling it off um going to do an

47
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:12,359
interview with uh shadrock and we're

48
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,159
going to uh go over and show you his

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,959
kitchen and show you a little bit of his

50
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,919
ital food and kind of try to promote his

51
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,400
business a little bit because right now

52
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:24,878
he's one of very few people producing

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,159
true ital uh food here in uh N Grill

54
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,318
which I think is a fairly important

55
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,280
thing when you're coming on a vacation

56
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:31,560
to be able to have access to the good

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,759
food not all this burger and crap and

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,199
pizza stuff that uh you know most of the

59
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,399
places are trying to trying to make here

60
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,399

61
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:55,719

67
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,199
though I sort of broke the top of it a

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,200
