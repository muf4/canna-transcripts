nice 5 ml vials of Sour Diesel which is

60
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:15,770

68
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,250
so all sorts of different terpenes I've

69
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,379
been talking to the cannabis culture

70
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,330
guys actually I see Ollie as texting me

71
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:45,500
right now over there on BD Street if you

72
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,239
guys are around and want to support

73
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,489
cannabis culture they have been sort of

74
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,259
the longest acting activists in the city

75
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:52,849
and now they have a dispensary I'm

76
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:55,789
hoping on getting them some Blue River

77
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:57,919
terpenes I've also been talking to the

78
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:59,239
sunrise wellness center Max and Dom

79
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,609
they're going to be carrying these

80
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,489
terpenes and on Vancouver Island you can

81
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:06,560
check them out at leaf compassion one of

82
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,310
the five or six stores that Kyle has

83
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,629
there he's been absolutely killing it

84
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,969
and in the meantime I guess it's gonna

85
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:16,159
be time to do some turf dippin because

86
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:19,850
we can show terpenes but we certainly

87
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,530
better be enjoying terpenes as well you

88
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:25,460
guys can't really see off-camera but

89
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:29,029
I've turned my Pelican case into a

90
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:30,469
turbot case what better way to hold your

91
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:33,619
and secure your terpene

92
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:36,080
and jamming them into that Pelle case of

93
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,139
course for my little mini personals I've

94
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:42,259
got these ones which is a wonderful wave

95
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,779
to carry around a variety of terpenes I

96
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:46,599
think it fits like eight eight little

97
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:49,369
packages so you can see right there

98
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,410
nicely fitting close it up keep it

99
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,899
upright in the pocket I hate the idea of

100
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,840
the terpenes tipping and spilling over

101
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:59,689
even though we do have the proper lids

102
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:01,549
here at Blue River you're not going to

103
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:04,399
get any plastic degradation because it's

104
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:07,280
a special PTFE plastic that doesn't

105
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:10,519
degrade by via a hydrocarbon or or

106
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:14,629
terpenes so hey welcome Robert WI Laurie

107

terpene Tuesday on his channel and I

119
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,129
suspect while I'm there I'll acquire a

120
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,250
little handful of each of the Nuggets

121
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:46,370

00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:35,000
open it people are just like what the

140
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:37,069

149
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:07,759
breath dip it into a little of this

150
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:10,759

153
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:18,168

159
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,168
Calum they're going to be available in

160
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:40,759
both America and Canada you know one of

161
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,528
my big parts of bringing Blue River up

162
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,598
to Canada was because Canadians couldn't

163
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:46,819
access this product we were supposed to

164
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:48,678
watch the social media watch the hash

165
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:50,749
churches watch Tony and all these guys

166
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:52,788
have these amazing cultivar flavors and

167
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:54,739
we weren't to have them well I just

168
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:57,498
wasn't having it so that's why I started

169
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:59,868
Blue River Canada and have been making

170
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:02,599
it my mission to bring these terpenes up

171
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:05,539
to Canada for you guys all to be able to

172
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:07,069
have and we are doing something that

173
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:10,459
most people are not doing we're using

174
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:13,098
very very high grade cannabis grown in

175
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:15,619
greenhouses or organically or out on the

176
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:17,598
fields in Jamaica to produce these

177
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:20,659
terpenes these are not cold trapped

178
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:23,658
butane slab terpene these are not trim

179
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:26,178
run terpenes these are about as high

180
00:08:23,658 --> 00:08:28,248
level of terpene extraction that you can

181
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:32,179
make it prawn is going to make it into

182
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:35,180
Canada soon Stephen I know that you can

183
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,888
has been discussing with Farah can in a

184
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,109
way for them to potentially bring the

185
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:42,740
technology up here and be able to start

186
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:45,379

187
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,870

189

196
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:21,708

you brother Newfoundland I've never been

198
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:27,099
I can only imagine that it's an amazing

199
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:30,830
place ie the rock east coast of Canada

200
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:36,080

201
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:37,610
lot of history to work through hey

Benjamin nice to see you I will break

203

I'll have the Swiss perk I got my

205
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:47,259
straight fab closeby but you're right

206
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:55,789
the Swiss perk should be representing

207
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:58,819
who love me some dizzle man I'll tell

208

210
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:17,088
you actually get nice Jen Bennett um

211
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:20,060
greetings Jeffrey from Flint Michigan

212
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:22,790
USA I would love to know what everyone

213
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:24,528
is puffing on and simultaneously I would

214
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:27,679
love to know where everyone is puffing

215
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:29,208
in so I want to see this the cultivar

216
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,719
that you're hitting whether it's flower

217
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:34,549
hash or rock or oil and what city you're

218
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,278
currently residing in while you watch

219
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:39,278
this little bubble man live feed

220
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:48,000
[Laughter]

221
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,100
yeah I love using these this is a little

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,509
trick that I started doing I realized

223
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,450
that these are the jars that the West

224
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:56,850
Coast concentrate guys make our perfect

225
00:10:54,450 --> 00:11:01,230
fit on this on the halo dish and so what

226
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:03,570
I've noticed is if there is any residue

227
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,000
in the jar it heats up from the heat of

228
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,830
the of the nail and it slowly melts down

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,629
you get these little ninja rips where

230
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,680
you're you know you're dabbing out and

231
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:12,570
you're trying to carve your hip but

232
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:15,539
you're getting more of a hit because

233
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,190
it's dripping off of the jar so that's

234
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:24,599
what's constantly happening here with me

235
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:27,990
oh yeah that's delicious absolutely

236
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,940
delicious well hopefully I will be

237
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,720
heading down to these shops in the near

238
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:38,880
future to go see Ollie at the CC HQ and

239
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:41,160
to go see the max and Dom at the the

240
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,439
sunrise well in the center and more

241
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,509
people in Vancouver will have access to

242
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,460
being able to go and walk right into

243
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:48,629
these shops and purchase it's nice to be

244
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,180
able to smell what you're about to

245
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:54,870
purchase and for those of you that are

246
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:57,269

247
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,730

250
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,379

251
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:09,059
little dab to send you all on your way

252
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:13,080
I'm thinking cookies Roz and that's what

253
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:16,529
I'm thinking I'm thinking cookies rasen

254
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,780
and I'm thinking orange creamsicle

255
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:21,149
orange creamsicle and and and the

256
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:23,879
cookies it goes nice and there that

257
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:26,970
that's why Tony did the the orange

258
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:30,360
cookies actually which is the creamy

259
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:33,870
creamy creamsicle cultivar mixed with a

260
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,909
cookies melt one as well I got so many

261
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,159
people sending me messages while I'm

262
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:40,049
doing this at celeriac I'll join the

263
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,089
live feed brother I'm having a hard time

264
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:43,709
reading your messages and the messages

265
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,180
that are coming in Kyle from leaf

266
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,639
Compassion's hitting me up right now

267
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:50,489
he's got some interesting news as always

268
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,350
he's a frontline cannabis warrior open

269
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,610
up shops faster than most people shop

270
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,769
for socks

271
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,399
[ __ ] love it and let's do this last

272
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:58,399
dad shall we

273
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:20,819
well that one got me not gonna lie that

274
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,579
was absolutely stupendous it's a unique

275
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,269
thing with the terpenes you've never

276
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:25,919
really know how they're going to

277
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:28,379
interact with different flavors

278
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:31,799
obviously those cultivars that you're

279
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,509
hitting whether in a hash or oil have a

280
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,159
terpene profile of their own and

281
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:37,409
therefore they're going to intertwine

282
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,809
and mix with the terpene profile that

283
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:43,399
you've added on and I definitely prefer

284
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:55,849
it much much much much more than adding

285
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:55,850
terpenes to a flavorless isolate alright

286
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,159
good to keep the halo clean if you know

287
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,560
what I mean a little bit of q-tip tepco

288
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,480
that will keep things nice and fresh in

289
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,338
the meantime I have to go but I do

290
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,170
appreciate all of you guys and girls

291
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,680
coming and hanging out and enjoying a

292
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:15,929
little bit of a session here with me I

293
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:18,120
will try and make it on later today and

294
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:20,909
we'll do this again in the meantime may

295
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,379
the full melt bless your bowl sooner

296
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:24,379
than later peace out everybody
