what sweetly utterly disgustingly okay

7
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:24,479
ridiculous I didn't bring the dry sift

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,080
you no dry sift no dry sift I didn't put

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,240
the hits on each Dabber the way I did

10
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,799
last time so we will stop again we will

11
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,959

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,399

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,000
Bubble man's world welcome to Puff

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,280
Wednesday with my good buddy Johnny B in

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,600
the house this is our third attempt at

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,280
filming this small sequence as the first

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,679
time I set up the camera I had left it

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,000
on time lapse so if you want to look at

23
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,280
what our our first session looked like

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,799
on time lapse this is here now there it

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,920
is yeah and so uh in the meantime I was

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,240
thinking maybe Johnny B and I could what

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,840
we wanted to do was come out and show

28
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:15,199
you guys a it's snowing like crazy here

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,079
in British Columbia right now been

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,640
dumping all morning it's been dumping

31
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:21,000
all month yeah I hit it has well it's

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,920
been dumping all winter we don't get

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,879
Winns apparently we did this year yeah

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,519
that's what I'm

35
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,239
saying it was next level it definitely

36
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,719
snow maybe once or twice tops it's been

37
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,039
snow every every single month of the

38
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,118
year we should start seeing the polar

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,600
bears in the bab pretty soon I'm telling

40
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,879
you they'll be back they they're coming

41
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,879
back

42
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:45,438
apparently come on there we go so there

43
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:49,959
we go we were talking

44
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:51,559
about me not getting a TP dip last time

45
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,399
so we're definitely taking care of that

46
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,159
this time good call good call Swiss

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,439
tsunami just the way there you go the

48
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,200
way life

49
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,639
works and the way things happen since

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,079
I'm wearing the Blue River shirt I'm

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,239
also be doing a Blue River dab sounds

52
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:10,038
like a

53
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:13,159
plan oh yeah

54
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,598
so one thing we've realized turps taste

55
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:15,479
so much better when it's cold though

56
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:18,199
yeah

57
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,399
not we're completely kidding but you

58
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:23,000
know it does add a little added extra to

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,000
the shiver three attempts at this John

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,560
that was pretty fun I like that

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,680
because I only had one dab though so

62
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,759
this is three attempts two dabs

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,560
3 plus two so that means we're going to

64
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,799
do five more there we go see there's a

65
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,400
system to our system well our plan was

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,840
to come out here hit a couple of dabs

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,840
move ourselves inside where we hit more

68
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,120
dabs show you the quality of the dry sip

69
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,360
that I separated it into these different

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,400
piles and then maybe if we still had

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,560
time to take the lower quality piles and

72
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,800
send them through the sasquash uh

73
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,680
unfortunately I only have my V1 set up

74
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,959
right now uh as I'm still waiting for

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,680
the foot pedal on the V2 but but

76
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,680
uh we still can

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,439
press there we go little bit of look at

78
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,479
that little little sizzling on there

79
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,479
from the ice that dripped

80
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:19,679
through these are ice

81
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,039
dabs ice dabs beautiful let me clean

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,280
that for you we're definitely getting

83
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,280
ice

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,519
dabs so best thing about this I'm a

85
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,680
little thirsty I got a little bit of ice

86
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,680
right

87
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,598
here it's actually slowing down a little

88
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,039
bit the snow's changing we had these big

89
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:43,560
white flakes now I see stuff melting

90
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:45,840
around me yeah little bit of warming up

91
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,479
happening well you know what it is

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,920
March it is March but I'll tell you what

93
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,878
they say about

94
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:57,000
March in like a lion no in like a lamb

95
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:59,000
out like a lion I only have heard that a

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,438
million times due to my birthday being

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,039
in March his birthday's coming up it's

98
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:09,239
true yeah it is it's at the end of

99
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,519
March isn't it yeah it like I'm leg I'm

100
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,239
not going to give it a

101
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,239
days I'm not going to say

102
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,000
it well there's one thing that's pretty

103
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,639
cool about this whole

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,639
scenario it's a great time to make hash

105
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,160
cuz it's cold up like you know how hard

106
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,879
it is to make dry sift to do your

107
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,840
sifting when it's like 33° though to 32°

108
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,439
and you're sitting it doesn't go over

109
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,319
that well so when it's snowing on it's

110
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,959
cold pull out your screens pull out your

111
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,918
bags this is the best time to start

112
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,198
making and and actually processing your

113
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:43,319
hash keep it cold we always say these

114
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,960
two you always told

115
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,439
me yes indeed sorry I'm just counting in

116
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,159
my head so that's

117
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,639
okay cuz the cell

118
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,400
[Music]

119
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,519
phone well that was in the first

120
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,679
episode I like that this is the under

121
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:02,038
the table dab keeping it warm making Mak

122
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,800
it sure he's not getting the extra added

123
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:08,599
snow dab like I

124
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,600
got he do not get an ice dab he's oh he

125
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,079
might so pretty

126
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,918
much everybody's headed to Barcelona

127
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,599
right

128
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,599
now yeah everyone's at spannabis

129
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:28,519
spannabis maybe you're there right now

130
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,160
watching us do puff Wednesday in the

131
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,719
snow and you're probably in 30°

132
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,360
weather

133
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,639
well we're okay with

134
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,280
that cuz we yummy I hit the Tangi we got

135
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,400
the best hash and TPS in the world right

136
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:45,918
in front of

137
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:48,799
us kind of works out that

138
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:51,758
way well some of the best as well that's

139
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,879
the beauty of sharing the knowledge and

140
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,520
helping educate others as to how to do

141
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,680
this that you can be anywhere in the

142
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,038
world and have the greatest hash in the

143
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,840
world

144
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:04,399
we're going to head

145
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,918
inside after some tasty dabs and we will

146
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:10,079
see you in a few

147
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:12,240
peace hey guys uh I'm back inside now

148
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,000
unfortunately Johnny B is no longer with

149
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,800
me that kind of sucked we blew a bunch

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,598
of time and um he actually had a um

151
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,319
situation arise where he had to go back

152
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:24,639
to his office and take care of some

153
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,720
business so I don't know um we ended up

154
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,240
breaking up the dry sift uh ended up

155
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:34,919
with 60 G of heads versus um I guess

156
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,598
just over 42 G of what I would call

157
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,598
contaminant but still a squishable

158
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:39,680
product I really wanted to squish it for

159
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,279
you guys I thought it was going to be

160
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,280
kind of fun but he told me off camera

161
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,439
that he actually wanted to give it uh to

162
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,598
the gentleman who produced it so that

163
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,199
makes sense that he would want to see

164
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,279
the quality differences and everything

165
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,319
that got separated so maybe next time

166
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,839
we'll get to squish that in the

167
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,000
meantime I just put a little bit of my

168
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,839
really high-end dry sift in this little

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,839
packet just a small amount Maybe a half

170
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,959
gram maybe a gram I don't even know how

171
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,799
much it was exactly but I figured we'd

172
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:08,878
do a little sasquash press I've got my

173
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,280
V1 back in Action as I'm still awaiting

174
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,319
uh the foot pedal to set up my air

175
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,000
compressor to the V2 which is actually

176
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:19,759
just at the foot of the um tripod here

177
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,240
so I guess waste no more time let's uh

178
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,319
get a little squish in and see what we

179
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,319
can produce from this dry

180
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,120

I yes and I also

198
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,278
got all right so that was a fine little

199
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,720
squish ended up with this sort of

200
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,240
buttery like substance took some macro

201
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,399
photographs of it to give you guys a

202
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,759
little bit of a better idea as to the

203
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,799
Quality uh of what we're dealing with

204
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,000
here I didn't weigh the first amount but

205
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,439
it was a very small small amount of hash

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,278
probably less than half a gram and it

207
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,040
looks like I got almost half a gram back

208
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,519
so good return I would say

209
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,759
pressed out a little bit of that dryy

210
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,639
sift as

211
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:39,360
well which we can see the quality of

212
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,759
right here although better than that um

213
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,879
better than that I can show you the

214
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:47,399
unpressed hash uh there was 60 G of

215
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:50,519
heads if you can believe it and uh here

216
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:55,480
is my

217
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,480
chunk kind of get an idea of the quality

218
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,159
here let me see if I can't get in even

219
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,560
closer for

220
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,559
you here we

221
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,360
go all right so as you can see by the

222
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,399
color not by the smell cuz you can't

223
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,879
smell it but I can

224
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,958
attest there's a difference in the smell

225
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:32,000
of 99.9% gland head when you clean it up

226
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,719
and you get it to this perfect perfect

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,480
place that uh you just lose that

228
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,120
whatever that sometimes it's almost

229
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,680
haish almost greenish almost plant

230
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,078
matter esque I've seen it in bubble has

231
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:47,838
I've seen it in dryft butth this is void

232
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:49,879
of all of that it's a very very Sandy

233
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,399
and thick texture when you touch it it's

234
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:55,879
hard it's not fluffy and light it's

235
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,879
really thick and hard so why don't we do

236
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:59,958
um a quick little rip got the sapphire

237
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,720
all cleaned up here as you can see

238
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,879
hitting hitting a little warmer than

239
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,480
usual actually it's at 660 de I'm

240
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:09,200
usually more out of

241
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,720
580 but um with the dry sift I like to

242
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,278
hit it a little hotter um with the rosin

243
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,480
I usually turn it down a little bit so

244
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:20,320
why don't we put a little of this dry

245
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,120
sift mixed with a little of this buttery

246
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,240
kind of cake batter

247
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,039
rosin there we

248
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,799
go nice dab and then let's do a Blue
