a little bit heavier and uh he's been

195
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,120
first of all John didn't even get into

196
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,639
the tip of his story he fell like 30

197
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,240
feet off of a scissor lift like 20 years

198
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,879
ago and broke like most of the bones in

199
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,120
his body smashed his head on the second

200
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,320
floor coming down as he was spiraling

201
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,039
off the scissorlift and shattered his

202
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,720
jaw and broke his neck and broke his

203
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:08,360
back and shattered his arm and shattered

204
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,720
the whole side of his body oh and was

205
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,519
completely addicted to pills he was a

206
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,120
zombie he used to carry around this big

207
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,120
cooler and in it were all these pill

208
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,600
bottles of oxy Coen and all these other

209
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,240
horrible things that uh that were that

210
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,200
were that he was taking and he was just

211
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,120
a full zombie and he fought he was one

212
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,560
of these guys that had like Signs out in

213
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,039
front of his house because he was like

214
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,759
not suing uh workers compensation but

215
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,719
they were really trying to [ __ ] him over

216
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,838
huge so he's kind of he had that whole

217
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,879
thing going on and eventually he got on

218
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,079
to canabo and and essential amino acids

219
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:43,919
and like linked up with Dr Paul Hornby

220
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:46,759
and got off all of these drugs and uh

221
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:49,799
you know JN is a super unique character

222
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:53,519
but he is the most incredible amazing

223
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:55,919
guy in the sense that uh his his drive

224
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,440
and his discipline is kind of Second To

225
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,000
None when when you really uh get to know

226
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,480
him he's helped build this company

227
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,360
medtainer without even owning it I think

228
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,240
most people thought he owned the company

229
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,919
the way he put the energy into it and

230
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,720
the way he sold that product uh and just

231
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,479
an overall [ __ ] awesome dude good

232
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,278
good guy not a victim at all although he

233
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,440
could be he could easily be oh I'm a

234
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,799
victim poor me woe is me but he's more

235
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,800
like [ __ ] this I just got to get better

236
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:25,958
and then honestly since he broke like

237
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:27,759
almost every bone in his body he's

238
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,239
probably been in another three or four

239
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,639
accidents it was less than months ago he

240
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,159
got T-boned by a truck he even has video

241
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,519
footage of this truck just going like

242
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,519
100 kilometers an hour and smoking him

243
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:42,200
and flipping him upside down into a

244
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:44,879
ditch like it's it's it's pretty wild

245
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,639
dude you can't you kind of can't even

246
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,639
believe what Johnny B's been through but

247
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,519
here he is he's in our group and uh we

248
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,560
we love

249
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:58,759
him life has been happening for me not

250
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:01,239
to me that's the way you got look right

251
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,039
that attitude 20% of the problem 80% of

252
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,159
the

253
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,199
solution that's how we move forward in

254
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,399
life because we all have stories and we

255
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,720
all go through stuff times strong weak

256
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:14,919
people make weak times right weak times

257
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,639
make weak people strong people make

258
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:18,599
strong times strong people make great

259
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,639
[ __ ] times and that's why we're all

260
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,639
here making great times in life because

261
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,240
everybody here has a unique heroic

262
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,959
identity of what they've done in life

263
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,360
and where they're going which makes it

264
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,319
just so much more rewarding of being

265
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,560
able to connect with everybody to push

266
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,920
to that next level and here we help

267
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,078
inspire people to do what they need to

268

303
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:00,838
Botanical tpin uh and it's an article

00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,479
kind of open up this conversation

311
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,078
because to me it's there's the least

312
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,759
said about it and uh you know I just

313
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:21,799
love the idea of this sort of you know

314
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,000
on one side we call it the somaler

315
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:26,359
aspect on the other side you know Nick's

316
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,720
more calling it the sensory science

317
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,519
which is really really what it is so uh

318
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,560
introduce both of you guys to one

319
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,720
another yeah I'm excited for this

320
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,958
because i' I've read some of his

321
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,000
articles and I'm really interested in

322
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:41,239
discussing it more and I I think it's

323
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,320
important to to to note that um they're

324
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,440
not different things they're different

325
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,959
sides of the same coins soia aspect is

326
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,560
more curating it to what the individual

327
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,159
is after and the sensory science of it

328
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:52,599
is analyzing what's in there and

329
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:54,719
analyzing people's reaction to it and

330
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,519
trying to understand what drives the

331
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,440
experience so it's a um one is is is

332
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,639
sort of um experience focused and

333
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,959
customer facing and the other is much

334
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:09,600
more about understanding the

335
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:12,119
interactions between people's um sort

336
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,120
of sensory or the organoleptic

337
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,320
properties or ortic sensors that they

338
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,240
have and and what they derive from from

339
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,519
the material so it's

340
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,519
exciting yeah I I really appreciate that

341
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:30,278
um I think you know what this all

342
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:34,039
stemmed from at least for me was a drive

343
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:36,799
for Quality because you know um any

344
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:40,120
seasoned cannabis consumer is going to

345
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,240
want to fine-tune and explore the all

346
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,639
the different nuances that cannabis can

347
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,639
offer and I got really frustrated during

348
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:52,919
legalization seeing cannabis menus being

349
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:55,240
displayed as THC percentage maybe CBD

350
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:58,120
percentage and then the brand and then

351
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,039
the cost so it just trained the industry

352
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,639
to think hey you know what so potency

353
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:07,399
equals value and that's what people and

354
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,919
people are always driven by value and so

355
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,360
as this training this Market training

356
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:15,000
happened it drove the industry to really

357
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,639
push for high potency product but then

358
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,480
you know you forget about the flavor

359
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,639
experience which is the sensory

360
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,560
experience and you know as I was really

361
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,079
getting deeper and deeper into this I

362
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:32,838
wanted to stimulate a discussion about

363
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:36,359
what um Quality is and it really starts

364
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,720
with uh input right like what Marcus and

365
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,720
everyone here is talking about so it's

366
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,480
the cultivar first right how did the

367
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,319
breeder or the flower itself get to a

368
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,399
particular point where the flavor is so

369
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:52,719
exceptional that and then it gets

370
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,240
cultivated what are the inputs in the

371
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,800
cultivation process that leads to better

372
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,879
quality and then that leads to a better

373
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,919
sensory experience where that is the

374
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,799
smell the taste right and then even the

375
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:08,639
touch I for me I love it when I roll up

376
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:10,679
a joint and it's so sticky that the

377
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,639
joint just sticks to itself and it rolls

378
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,159
to itself like that's an indication of

379
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,079
quality to me but I wanted to open it up

380
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:20,559
to this you know group of experts here

381
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:24,039
and talk about that that definition

382
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:27,198
because um you know I think if we can

383
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:29,399
Inspire and encourage the General market

384
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,838
to say hey you know what it's not just

385
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:37,480
driving for high potency products but

386
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:40,199
it's also you know the the um all the

387
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,319
the things that make this particular

388
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:46,318
product especially for cannabis flow so

389
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:48,278
unique and then this all drives down to

390
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:49,719
you know what the triome and what hash

391
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:51,559
and all the derivatives that you can

392
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,079
make out of it but it starts off with

393
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:56,599
the plant so that's why I'm here today

394
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:59,318
thank you Marcus thank you Nick thank

395
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,360
you um when you talk about uh quality

396
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,360
that's that's I think it's a really

397
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,160
interesting I think that's sorry I just

398
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,879
open the YouTube link uh that's that's a

399
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,600
really interesting distinction because

400
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,079
um one of the things that that um I

401
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,359
worked on a lot was sort of

402
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:20,759
differentiating quality from character

403
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:24,198
because quality is is to me defined by

404
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:25,318
you know um terms like hup so like you

405
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:26,839
know Hazard analysis and critical

406
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:28,558
control points where there's no danger

407
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,319
to the consumer that it's meeting

408
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,480
certain certain standards that have been

409
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,000
set so that it's like you know it is it

410
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,038
is what it says on the on on the label

411
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,240
like it is it does have the the

412
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:39,919
cannaboid content that it's that it

413
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,599
claims um there's no pesticides or any

414
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,280
harmful fact or any harmful things like

415
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,918
that it's got a good shelf life there's

416
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,399
no mold or mot toxins or apot toxins all

417
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,000
those aspects um whereas character is

418
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
much more of the sort of descriptive

419
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,519
aspect of it so this is like yes this

420
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,000
meets our quality standards this is good

421
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,359
enough for consumers to to have um it's

422
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,240
at the right moisture level it's not

423
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,959
going to rot or anything like that um

424
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,359
but uh when we talk about character

425
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,279
that's more of a descriptive analysis of

426
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,439
what is in the the the material what is

427
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,879
the experience the user might derive

428
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,558
from that so that we know all the

429
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,240
components of it and what it smells like

430
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:19,279
um what it feels like what it looks like

431
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,640
um and I think I think it's important to

432
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,440
to to consider both because they they

433
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,559
are linked but I think that it's it's

434
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,600
also important to differentiate them um

435
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:32,839
especially as the industry matures um so

436
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:35,399
good quality for me is much more about

437
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:37,480
um you know meeting certain standards

438
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,840
that we've set as an industry uh which

439
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,839
is one of the reasons that I I I do like

440
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,918
um the idea of Regulation just for

441
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:44,959
Consumer Protection um I think that you

442
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,440
need to have people that know what

443
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,798
they're doing on those regulatory bodies

444
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,558
um and are familiar with the product

445
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:54,240
rather than just sort of abstract uh

446
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:57,158
abstract individuals um but I think that

447
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,279
it is very important to distinguish um

448
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:04,480
sort of the descriptors of of material

449
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:06,960
from the uh from quality components I

450
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,919
guess um and I'm not trying to to to you

451
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,120
know sort of like assert my vision but I

452
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,520
think it's an important discussion to

453
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,879
have well it's extremely important

454
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,279
because here we are in California we're

455
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,679
four years in with our head up our ass

456
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:22,918
because the the department of cannabis

457
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,038
control can't seem to understand that

458
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,960
cannabis is an unstable product and so

459
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:29,558
they're not dealing with you know air

460
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,519
quality control control inside of

461
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:34,399
packages so we're dealing with

462
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:37,400
oxygenation which as we know is causing

463
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,480
you know anerobic decar

464
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,000
carox all kinds of problems that are

465
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,679
inherent they're not keeping it

466
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,960
refrigerated so it's stable what like

467
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,880
they do with alcohol and other products

468
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,519
so just they're inherent because the

469
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,159
majority of these people are policy

470
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:56,759
wonks and not actually users of cannabis

471
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,760
this is one of the major reasons why

472
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,839
California Cannabis is struggling right

473
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,640
right now is because they can get better

474
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:06,439
fresher product from their local plug

475
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:10,280
than this decaying you know anerobic

476
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,880
decomposed cannabis that is oxidized red

477
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:15,839
you know if it's three as you know six

478
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,240
or nine months old it it changes

479
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,439
chemically because of the oxygenation

480
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,519
trapped inside and if they were actually

481
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,960
using something like combinations of

482
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:28,240
nitrogen and CO2 in the flour into the

483
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,880
concentrate to stabilize it so that

484
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,279
oxygen ation doesn't continue to happen

485
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,720
I think California consumers would find

486
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:38,639
a more stable product available to them

487
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,159
closer to the representation on the vine

488
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,520
than whatever the [ __ ] they're getting

489
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,039
in the end and I want to say [ __ ]

490
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:48,158
pre-roll cones thank you well one thing

491
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:51,158
I wanted to point out is U I think you

492
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,240
know as we became you know domestic

493
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,159
producers and not importers of of the

494
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,200
product this is the conversation I had

495
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:01,440
last week with Rob Clark and mve was we

496
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,600
historically are still trained that you

497
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,679
know these these feelings are the

498
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,359
driving factor from this era that where

499
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,360
we didn't really understand what tpine

500
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,038
profile was because we were importing it

501
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,678
by the time it got to us we didn't

502
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:16,158
really know these flavors or never

503
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,080
experienced them until really the till

504
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,960
we started producing it here you know in

505
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,399
the states and we got like you pointed

506
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,360
out at the end fresh cannabis and we

507
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,519
with that we have these profiles that we

508
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:28,240
had never really seen before and what's

509
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,079
really fascinating is as we go forward

510
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,759
into

511
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,759
production like Nick just beautifully

512
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,278
you know pointed out and others we we

513
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:40,158
don't really have a standard for what

514
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:43,119
should happen um during growth in the

515
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,000
middle of growth and when you know post

516
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,759
Harvest happens there's there's no

517
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,079
everyone has their own Sops and their

518
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:51,839
own version of what should happen and

519
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,519
that you know creates a lot of holes and

520
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,278
it creates a vacula that we all can't

521
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,960
stand on right so with that you know

522
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:00,200
there's there's so many things like you

523
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,720
said there's there's no you know you

524
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,278
just put it in whatever jar you know

525
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,759
there's Headroom there's that that

526
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:06,440
chemistry that's happening all the way

527
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:09,000
up until you finally stuff it in your

528
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,360
bowl or vaporize it whatever your use

529
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,599
case is is chemistry is happening you

530
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,359
know and and there's a lot of things

531
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,319
that we have yet to agree on that need

532
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,119
to happen to make sure that that product

533
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,399
or that that particular varietal is

534
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:25,278
represented from the moment that people

535
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,000
like us see it which is Super Fresh and

536
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:29,480
really volatile and lots of amazing

537
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,159
flavors and tastes and smells

538
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,319
um but to your point there's broken

539
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:34,960
systems that are jammed in between all

540
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:37,278
this this all these things that we're

541
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,319
talking about that make all of this

542
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:41,960
stuff even more difficult because we

543
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:44,319
have standards that once it leaves the

544
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,679
farm what are their standards right

545
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:49,639
until it gets to the to the the dist you

546
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:53,120
know not even dist to the retail shop so

547
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,640
I think there's just a lot to talk about

548
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,678
before we even get to you know

549
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,880
cultivation um because it's there's

550
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,600
psychology there's there's you know

551
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,039
there's a lot of years of

552
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,119
misinformation um you know and I think

553
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:08,359
that's what you know we're talking about

554
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,759
here is trying to demystify a lot of

555
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,759
those things that that we just quite

556
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:15,480
frankly don't truly

557
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:19,240
understand what what I wanted to say is

558
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,960
even taking a step um behi behind that

559
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,720
even before cultivation is really

560
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,919
looking at all the work that the

561
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,000
greeters have have done to create a you

562
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,440
know variet

563
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,640
that is stable that is distinguishable

564
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:39,558
because when we're looking at quality we

565
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:42,120
have to Compare Quality for within what

566
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:44,639
that variety is supposed to express like

567
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,199
not you know having a standard like of

568
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,278
course cultivators are not going to have

569
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,000
a standard way of growing all flowers

570
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,319
right um but I think having a true

571
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,240
understanding of what a particular

572
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:59,158
cultive bar and its typical attributes

573
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,319
should be and looking at okay let's

574
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:04,080
let's compare it to that right and so

575
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,158
you know and the reason why this

576
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:12,519
triggered me was because um I would I

577
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:15,760
smoked a uh a GMO right but I got no

578
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:18,599
garlic you know I got some mushroom and

579
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:21,000
I didn't really get the onion I got more

580
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,278
dirt and mushroom and I'm and I'm

581
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,200
thinking okay the breeder that created

582
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:29,000
GMO um put the word garlic first so I'm

583
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,519
assuming you know the flavor connection

584
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,960
to garlic should really be there and um

585
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,679
and I'm so glad that there's you know um

586
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,120
a lot of scientists here because I've

587
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:43,159
also been in uh Grow rooms where yes

588
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:45,719
particular Aromas are so pronounced at

589
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:47,520
the beginning in the grow stage right

590
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,200
but then by the time it gets packaged

591
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:53,158
and shipped out I I wonder you know what

592
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,919
volatiles have left and I want to go

593
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:59,399
beyond tpin um Nick I have a question

594
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:04,559
for you about uh Esters and

595
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:07,519
because Aroma of skunk and the aroma um

596
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:10,158
of cheese that's not a combination of

597
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:13,038
Tarpin that is a combination of other

598
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,720
chemical compounds right yeah so so the

599
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:20,119
cheese garlic onion um are typically

600
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,038
thol and thoats um as well as some of

601
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,319
the components that are are associated

602
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:27,038
with diesel and gas um you get some of

603
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:31,119
the tries and the daines and and some of

604
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:33,640
those um volatile sort of components

605
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,038
that are more sort of ethereal and more

606
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,080
solvent and those in conjunction with

607
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:42,000
those thoits give the um give the

608
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:43,639
impression of some of the gassy notes um

609
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,480
and it's it's really interesting what

610
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,320
you're saying about uh variety because I

611
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,319
I have a slightly different take on it

612
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:53,720
um and that is that uh and this is going

613
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,879
to be a little bit of long-winded thing

614
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,960
so I think variety and and the and the

615
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,320
Breeders intentions are are

616
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,120
very important um but there's two

617
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:07,558
aspects to consider is that one the

618
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,639
breeder Brad this under in their

619
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:12,639
particular micro environment and their

620
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,278
particular growing system and they

621
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,240
arrived at this final kovar this is what

622
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:22,278
it it it it expressed in their system um

623
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,679
cannabis has a tremendously strong GB um

624
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:25,440
sort of interaction in genics by

625
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,399
environment that depending on how it's

626
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,200
grown where it's grown how it's treated

627
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:30,319
it will Express different components

628
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,038
then you have the whole aspect of

629
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,599
harvest time when you mentioned this

630
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:35,359
earlier like you know you know these

631
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,319
volatiles early in early in the growth

632
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,479
period will will smell like one thing

633
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:41,319
and then later on we'll smell like

634
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,720
another um and rather than that be sort

635
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,960
of a limiting factor I think that's sort

636
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,558
of an

637
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,558
expansive opportunity for for for

638
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,278
Growers to express what they want to

639
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:54,119
come out of that particular varietal and

640
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,839
I think that's really fun and rather

641
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,239
than sort of limiting ourselves to like

642
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,639
this is these are the narrow boundaries

643
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,558
that GMO must Express these are the

644
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,880
narrow boundaries that grape a might

645
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:06,079
Express or so on so forth um you can

646
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,880
choose to harvest uh at different times

647
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:11,678
to get different expressions of that of

648
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,120
that material of that plant um and I

649
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,798
think that's that's a beautiful thing

650
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,158
because I I tend to favor rather than

651
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,200
the heavy onion garlic gas cheese I tend

652
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:23,080
to favor the much fruer lighter Esters

653
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,360
and um some of the the the the light

654
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:27,960
tropical fruit THS early on and the

655
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:31,038
Turpin obviously as well early on in in

656
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,240
the process rather than the the heavier

657
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,960
later sort of people have described it

658
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,278
as heady but the very garlicky cheesy

659
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,759
notes um and so I think it's it's it's

660
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:44,558
important to to give

661
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,278
um Growers especially and then then by

662
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,359
through Growers uh consumers the

663
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:52,599
opportunity to experience the plants at

664
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:56,719
different stages of ripeness because

665
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:58,398
that expands the um the ability to to to

666
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,200
to provide different experiences for

667
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:04,879
people um now you can go the opposite

668
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,840
direction which is that you can say this

669
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,919
is what um the micro environment that uh

670
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,079
you want to grow this Variety in um and

671
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,960
we're going to set that if you're going

672
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,119
to call it this it must be grown Within

673
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,600
These parameters and it must be

674
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,918
harvested within this window to deliver

675
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,240
this consistent experience and that is

676
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,600
one approach to it um the other approach

677
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,960
to it is to celebrate the variety of the

678
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,480
of the different experiences that one

679
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:34,399
can derive from a

680
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:38,360
chovar in or I guess a a a a a strain

681
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:41,798
within its life cycle and uh for me from

682
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:44,000
a uh a sensory science perspective I

683
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:46,278
love the opportunity to harvest multiple

684
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,480
or the same plant at multiple times and

685
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:52,000
then kind of blend to suit what I'm

686
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,360
after um and and I think that's a that's

687
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,640
that's another art that that should be

688
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,000
brought into this is cannabis blending

689
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,559
rather than single strain I think it's a

690
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,798
really fun opportunity

691
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,879
um and then um one last thing and this

692
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:06,480
goes back to what Colin was saying

693
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:10,200
earlier is that um you know

694
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,919
the varieties will age differently and

695
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,399
this is something that we've seen very

696
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:18,720
much in in the Hop industry in that

697
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:21,678
different balances of compounds will

698
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,919
oxidize and age and change at different

699
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,759
rates so as a a variety goes through

700
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:28,120
storage or curing which we've seen for

701
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:31,798
for many varieties it's not well

702
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:34,479
understood yet um we'll see that certain

703
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:37,398
varieties will stale very very quickly

704
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,519
some will actually wreak reach Peak uh

705
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:43,959
aromatic intensity after weeks um and

706
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,000
some others will uh just fade off

707
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:50,278
immediately and uh I have seen the same

708
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,079
thing with cannabis strains and

709
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:56,440
it's it's a challenge and so I guess to

710
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,639
what Colin was saying earlier you know

711
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,798
working together to have a industry best

712
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,320
practices for storage I think is a good

713
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,319
idea to prevent staling and to prevent

714
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:08,200
obviously any negative impacts for the

715
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:10,480
consumer such as um as you know mold

716
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,759
development or anything like that but

717
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:17,919
and and canav anoid degradation um but I

718
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:23,119
think that uh that's a separate

719
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:27,080
conversation from looking at the sort of

720
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:29,558
intrinsic aspects of each individual

721
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:34,639
cross does that make

722
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:37,480
sense does yeah love those those sulfur

723
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:42,559
containing compounds are called

724
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:46,038
thol and and Sul sulfides a sulfide is a

725
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:47,240
thol those those compounds um while

726
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:50,919
they're not

727
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:54,200
turbines because um they're uh mostly

728
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:58,240
like prenol sulfides they are derived

729
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:01,080
from isoprene so they do fall into the

730
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,720
bucket of Turpin noids they're Turpin

731
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:07,000
noids they're not turbines so so those

732
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,759
prenol sulfides that oswal and others

733
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,558
have now identified as sort of the

734
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,759
skunky essence of cannabis are are

735
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:16,720
indeed similar to those that are

736
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:19,558
naturally found in things like onion and

737
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,360
and and garlic and and what what what

738
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:25,839
you know Nick is that those those

739
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:29,918
sulfides which are um you know at the

740
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:33,439
two oxidation state sulfur can can go up

741
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,120
in oxidation and so so sulfides tend to

742
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,639
oxidize

743
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:41,518
into um sulfates and B sulfates and

744
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:44,719
things like that and so so those those

745
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,558
compounds have much lower volatility and

746
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,399
Apparent sulfides from which they're

747
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,319
derived so the sulfides themselves are

748
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:54,719
certainly volatile certainly have that

749
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:58,918
skunky Essence but yes as you mentioned

750
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,960
on oxidation on just exposure to air and

751
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,240
light and you know a little bit of

752
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,919
moisture and probably a little bit of

753
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:10,960
acid from somewhere catalyzes basically

754
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:13,880
the oxidation of those volatile sulfides

755
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,079
into into oxidized forms which don't

756
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:20,679
have the same same nose profile as the

757
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:23,480
as the parent sulfides the other thing I

758
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:26,798
wanted to say is that you know a lot of

759
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,558
so Esters yes have certainly like a

760
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:35,558
really really sweet essence you can take

761
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:38,960
a putrid smelling acid like buic acid I

762
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:41,759
hope that you've never had to smell buic

763
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,639
acid it literally smells like puke right

764
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,480
and or decaying flesh I think or I don't

765
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:50,319
know just in small amounts it smells

766
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:54,038
like parmesan cheese yeah right

767
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:57,879
soar and and and and so that's again

768
00:32:54,038 --> 00:33:01,480
where uh and as you know Nick that our

769
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:05,080
knows and our old factory sense has

770
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:08,200
developed this Exquisite ability to

771
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:10,038
distinguish between you know cheese that

772
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,200
doesn't smell good and cheese that does

773
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:15,480
smell good right or just you know

774
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,278
flowers from say a pile of dog [ __ ] but

775
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:22,159
like certainly like like I I I think

776
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:24,558
where where the the human sense itself

777
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,159
is Again part of that uh like what we

778
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,519
were talking about earlier the Cannabis

779
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,399
experience that you know if you're just

780
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,720
in in the dispensary purchase and and

781
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:36,678
the mindset of somebody who's in a

782
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,240
dispensary right at&amp; CES this every day

783
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:41,600
right someone's gonna maybe not be able

784
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,319
to smell the actual product they walk

785
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:47,558
away with so what's the other data point

786
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:49,480
they have to look at oh okay THC content

787
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:52,278
again you're already in that mindset

788
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,880
that I'm in a dispensary I'm paying top

789
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:58,278
dollar I need to get some kind of

790
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,200
measure of value for my purchase where

791
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:03,278
when you're going to your guy who

792
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,519
provides you with Legacy stuff you open

793
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:08,599
up that bag and you can smell it and

794
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,838
there's that interaction that humans

795
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:13,879
have with cannabis right which is that

796
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:16,279
joyful discovery of oh man I can't wait

797
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:19,440
to put this in my bowl and smoke it it

798
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,240
smells so good right and I think that

799
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,639
you know again for the lack of better

800
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,039
you know people have talked about this

801
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,679
whole Lab shopping thing where people

802
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:31,480
are trying to find Labs that basically

803
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,918
inflate their THC results to basically

804
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,079
create this is all an artifact of

805
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:40,598
prohibition and and and hopefully as

806
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,039
prohibition ends as we see this thing

807
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,679
unfold all that kind of [ __ ] will go

808
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,039
away

809
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,639
because I I I don't know the way I look

810
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,679
at it again is that yeah it's a quality

811
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:55,119
Artisan product if that's what you're

812
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,440
after some people just want pal Ms from

813
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,119
the 7-Eleven you know that's not me and

814
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,440
that's probably most of not the people

815
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,960
in this panel and again that human

816
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,480
experience that you miss out when you do

817
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,800
just get pal Ms down at the 7eleven is

818
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,280
the opening of that bag and the smelling

819
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,560
of that I'm sure ATN and atn's buyers

820
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,920
get to experience that right it's like a

821
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:19,799
farmer shows up with a bunch of weed or

822
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,519
a crop and it's like okay they get to

823
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,240
experience this is what our our our our

824
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:27,440
customers are going to enjoy because I'm

825
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:30,118
kind of substituting as a bud tender or

826
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,480
whatever a buyer for a dispensary you

827
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,280
know that quality that we were talking

828
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,960
about earlier you know quality is a very

829
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,519
subjective thing and I think certainly

830
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,320
the turpine profile plays into that jar

831
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:44,880
appeal right ATN is very very important

832
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,800
it's got to look good in the jar it's

833
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,000
got to be someone you know wants to see

834
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:55,240
Frosty tricomes and you know you don't

835
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,159
want to see ly no you know sticks sticks

836
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:58,199
and stems and the last thing I'll just

837
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:00,358
say is this

838
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:02,879
this whole thing around you know

839
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:05,920
prohibition is again

840
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,119
because in certain markets prohibition

841
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,200
sort of makes artisan and quality

842
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,720
products out of financial reach for say

843
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:18,039
common individuals so they're forced to

844
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,959
go buy you know products that maybe just

845
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:21,759
aren't as high of quality and I think

846
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,639
that that that's going to hopefully go

847
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,200
away when when prob goes away hopefully

848
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:30,440
well this one thing the NO2 can

849
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:32,799
haven't taken offer people because they

850
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,039
still want to look at their pot you know

851
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,160
the th those tunic cans you can't see

852
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,480
inside them whereas people still want to

853
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:41,838
look in jars even a couple months ago I

854
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,960
even got a set of jars and of course I

855
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:44,400
you have to pick them up and you look in

856
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,760
the bottom and as I pick it up and look

857
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,280
in the bottom what do I see I see

858
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,560
hermaphrodites with seeds inside of it

859
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,720
so I can still see what's inside of it

860
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,679
as opposed to if it were in a tin I

861
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:59,159
can't and so quality control still rules

862
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:01,559
the roost and educated and with more

863
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:03,399
educated consumers they want to see what

864
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:06,199
they're getting end of

865
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,400
story one thing I wanted to bring up you

866
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:10,879
know that Nick kind of mentioned was um

867
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,400
you know he touched on was was the

868
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,880
ideology you know of mixed feno hunts um

869
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,519
you know I think there's there idea that

870
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,680
I I embarked on in a year-long one of

871
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:25,599
popping seeds versus monocropping this

872
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,399
the single clone of that same Bridal and

873
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,720
what I found was the much larger spread

874
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,079
of tpin and cannabinoids from those from

875
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:35,000
those mixed pheno hunts and I felt like

876
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,920
that you know I I want to get back to

877
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
that type of work because I I just saw

878
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:43,119
like CBC upwards to 5% thcv upwards to

879
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,960
10% and then running the

880
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,400
Clone not even not even hitting for one%

881
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,079
of any of those those compounds so I

882
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,000
think you know just in terms of the

883
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:56,119
spirit of of ideology and just Theory

884
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,760
feel like there's there's more to

885
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,838
learning about uh you know the

886
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:04,079
cannabinoid spread in a you know in a

887
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:06,199
population that you might not not

888
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,318
otherwise see in a single clone that's

889
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:11,559
being passed around to everyone and that

890
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:14,400
same clone grown in five different

891
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:16,920
environments to like Nick said it's G to

892
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,039
express five different

893
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,000
traits so you know I just think you have

894
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,800
a better shot of a mixed feno hunt

895
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,760
representing a a bigger spread of the

896
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,519
population um if that's you know me

897
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,400
throwing out theories here um there's

898
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:34,358
something to it you know there's there's

899
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,240
uh there's a lot to talk about it seems

900
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:39,318
you know we've gotten so far away from

901
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:43,559
it that ideology it seems in in farming

902
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:46,039
um yeah anyone's thoughts has anyone

903
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:49,199
tried that before well I was going to

904
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:51,480
mention about you know throwing out the

905
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:54,118
idea that a a clone or cutting doesn't

906
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,280
have all the same Anatomy as a seed

907
00:38:54,119 --> 00:39:00,039
plant right so it can't tap in and and

908
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,760
and capture all that the Earth has to

909
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:07,279
offer that a clone would um so you're

910
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,480
going to be you're going to be um you

911
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,440
know stifled right out of the gate and

912
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,639
then the other thing I wanted to mention

913
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,280
is yeah the consumers right now are

914
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:20,559
shopping from a dashboard and and how

915
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:24,480
challenging that is for for them and and

916
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:28,078
you know they're trying to deliver a a a

917
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:31,079
poignant or pungent or potent

918
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,640
uh purchase but we we're trying to give

919
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:36,400
them that potent experience more so and

920
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,719
one thing that we have at the retail

921
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,440
partner we're working with is smell jars

922
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:44,000
and this last time I was tabling there I

923
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,519
had our double OG Cam that we're growing

924
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,719
for Rebel grown and some gush mins very

925
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,159
very different I was able to like go

926
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,519
back and forth like if someone didn't

927
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,559
like either one of those sure then they

928
00:39:54,519 --> 00:40:00,039
could go get our Clementine but if you

929
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:02,960
didn't if if you were a a basic consumer

930
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:05,039
today or a Savvy consumer today walking

931
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,199
into a shop and you smelled either one

932
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,000
of those profiles you're gonna walk out

933
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,960
with something and they're mouth Waters

934
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
their eyebrows pop right like you can't

935
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,639
have that or you don't have that when

936
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,440
you are looking into a

937
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:22,400
jar um and I've always liked the idea of

938
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,679
the tunic can like I'm a sporty guy I

939
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,119
like going to the beach I like

940
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,318
backpacking I like doing all these

941
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,400
things and like yeah that's like my mer

942
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:31,838
mergency kit let's crack that open let's

943
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,680
but that's because I know what's in it

944
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:35,799
right if you don't know it's very

945
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:38,559
challenging and I remember there was a

946
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:41,119
company of four years ago three years

947
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,759
ago they were trying to do like a a code

948
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,440
that you could scan that had a picture

949
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:50,079
of every single packed container it was

950
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,480
like canis I think it was called um and

951
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,920
that was pretty interesting but I just

952
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,559
couldn't wrap my head around having to

953
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,760
scan my herb before I smoked it just

954
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:01,039
seemed wrong

955
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,800
Josh welcome good to see you Josh and

good to see everybody this morning see

964
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,039
everybody this morning

965
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,839
so just to continue this conversation

966
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:35,800
you know I'm um I'm trying to

967
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:38,679
essentially map out and I I absolutely

968
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,200
agree you know the the concept of you

969
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:44,239
have a certain genetic and it can be

970
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:47,399
expressed in different ways um and all

971
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:50,679
the inputs that go to that um in Simo

972
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,880
terms is the terror right and there's so

973
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:56,480
much to it in terms of how it is grown

974
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,440
um and obviously a cultivar that is

975
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,559
grown indoor versus outdoor it might not

976
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,559
have the ability uh to adapt to that

977
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:09,279
particular environment right it depends

978
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:11,880
on you know how um I guess strong and

979
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,480
adaptable that particular plant is and

980
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,280
so when we're leading to helping at the

981
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,358
end of the day um at least My

982
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,839
Prerogative is to help consumers

983
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:24,078
understand I I train a lot of butt

984
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,199
tenders and retailers and they are

985
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,079
selling blind right now so that's that's

986
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:32,239
absolutely right it's it sucks because

987
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:35,760
the fun of cannabis you know in terms of

988
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:39,239
all of the sensory experiences is being

989
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,800
um muted right and closed off um and

990
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:45,159
whether it is because due to the

991
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,480
processing delays in terms of uh

992
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:49,679
packaging shipping distribution sitting

993
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,599
on distribution shelves going to retail

994
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:54,239
then you know and then now I'm smoking

995
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,800
product that's six nine months old um

996
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:59,239
and so that's why I want to talk about

997
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,359
if we could even break it down you know

998
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:05,159
if we have readers in the room let's

999
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:07,719
talk about how do you get the plant or a

1000
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:09,519
particular genetic to express what you

1001
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:12,159
want right when we're talking about

1002
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:15,719
science um in terms of Nick's um

1003
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:17,239
perspective there are the the

1004
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:20,799
quantifiable

1005
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:24,078
parameters that we can find correlation

1006
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:27,920
to our experience but our experience is

1007
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,000
also really biased when tur were really

1008
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,400
coming out strong they're like oh yeah

1009
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,079
like when I get something that's rich in

1010
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,838
terpinolene you know like I'm I get this

1011
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:41,559
kind of high and and that is an

1012
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:44,639
experience but I would say there's so

1013
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:46,880
much more to it right like you know what

1014
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,199
is the impact of Esters and dials you

1015
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,280
know what are the other chemical

1016
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:53,679
compounds that affect your high your

1017
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,119
experience and what are we not seeing

1018
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:59,118
right so many times when I dig deeper

1019
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:01,240
into cannabis THC and CBD sure are

1020
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,760
displayed because in Canada you're

1021
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:06,358
required to do so but you look at the

1022
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,040
the analysis and there's actually

1023
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:11,519
another three five% of other

1024
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:14,039
cannabinoids that are not being listed

1025
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,599
well what's the impact of that you know

1026
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:19,318
having a little bit of a different

1027
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:23,119
canabo might have a high impact in your

1028
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:26,599
overall experience or the overall um you

1029
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,640
know exchange of of that com in addition

1030
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:29,880
to you know all the other chemical

1031
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:34,279
compounds you know we're talking about

1032
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:37,519
the entage effect um and never mind um I

1033
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:40,880
also believe that a particular product

1034
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:43,280
may can lead to experience but there's

1035
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,720
different metabolisms and different um

1036
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,280
tolerances in different amounts you know

1037
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:49,239
at the end of the day we have to really

1038
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,839
look at well how much are you smoking

1039
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:53,399
how often do you smoke and look at that

1040
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:55,759
so before we even get to the consumer

1041
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,559
you know guidance component I wanted to

1042
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,640
say how do we empower

1043
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:04,240
the butt tenders out there to really

1044
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:07,519
describe in a very confident way where

1045
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:09,159
we can say Hey you know let's take a

1046
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,480
look at the cannaboid profile let's take

1047
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:16,159
a look at what the lab analysis can give

1048
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:19,079
us um but at the same time the personal

1049
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:21,639
experience is I is I know why you're

1050
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:24,480
here you're here because you know this

1051
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:27,039
is a multisensory experience when you

1052
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,960
consume it when you are looking in

1053
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,960
smelling at this we're using all your

1054
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,159
senses and we're all built differently

1055
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,920
so how can I find the power of language

1056
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,759
to convert all of this science and you

1057
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,680
know hard to pronounce words into

1058
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:46,920
something that is hey if you really like

1059
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:49,799
this um this really minty chocolate

1060
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:52,358
flavor profile you know I'm going to

1061
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,519
help you guide you this way but at the

1062
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:58,239
same time someone that has that might

1063
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:00,679
not be that might not have the higher uh

1064
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:04,078
good tolerance or much experience might

1065
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:07,838
need something that is lighter you see

1066
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,880
so um I think you know and and I also

1067
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:12,078
want to have an expectation and that's

1068
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,760
why I meant the whole GMO you know

1069
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:18,599
conversation or something skunk you know

1070
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,599
I I smoked I never you know

1071
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,440
for to taste and smell like skunk but

1072
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,838
when that piece is broken that's where I

1073
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:42,559
lose trust and confidence and so that's

1074
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:45,199
why I say you know if we have the

1075
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,920
perspective starting off with the the

1076
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:50,719
variety the Breeders variety and then

1077
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,119
how you know what are what should we

1078
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,279
expect and then of course the

1079
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:57,559
cultivation right and the teror and then

1080
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,280
the the the all the entire environmental

1081
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:02,079
inputs that go into it there's an

1082
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,599
argument right now which I I I

1083
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,920
absolutely support and believe is you

1084
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,119
know living soil produces amazing

1085
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,400
cannabis but you know what's even more

1086
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:13,920
amazing is outdoor natural grown

1087
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:17,079
cannabis from where cannabis can grow

1088
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:20,240
very well in is the best you know like

1089
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:22,200
just let it be in its place in its

1090
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,239
nature where it's supposed to grow and

1091
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:26,639
let it thrive in its own environment

1092
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:29,879
there I've tasted cannabis which is you

1093
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:32,199
know bang on right blows my mind um but

1094
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,000
it might not look nice because it's

1095
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:36,399
outdoor right so there's a complex thing

1096
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,480
about bag appeal right sometimes you're

1097
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,760
going to get that variation and then of

1098
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,240
course Harvest and curing there is a

1099
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,800
huge argument about that and that and

1100
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:47,679
that's why this p is perfect because we

1101
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:52,119
have experts from everybody in different

1102
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:55,519
stages of um this production that talk

1103
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,519
that can talk

1104
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:07,440
do essentially how do we communicate all

1105
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:10,279
of these great inputs to the consumer in

1106
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,519
a way that makes sense to them because

1107
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,880
so many people are still hung up on the

1108
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:17,759
indicas

1109
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:20,640
sativa Spectrum but it's not you know

1110
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,680
it's not about indicas sativa it's a

1111
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:25,039
it's more so about the chemotype and the

1112
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:27,480
flavor profile and what the what the

1113
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,318
cannabis plant you know um

1114
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,880
the the full expression in terms of its

1115
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:35,079
lab analysis and its genetic background

1116
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,559
right so the lab component is a a

1117
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:40,400
snapshot it's like a picture of it but

1118
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:42,960
what about all the work and the effort

1119
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:47,358
that goes into to getting the plant to

1120
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:50,838
produce those kind of results so um to

1121
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:52,598
and and of course um there's if we could

1122
00:48:50,838 --> 00:48:54,239
you know I I'm really interested to know

1123
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:57,280
if we could just start from the

1124
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,879
beginning like seed to sale because

1125
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,400
um you know eventually I do want to get

1126
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,920
to moisture content and packaging and

1127
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:08,160
everything right and how we and as a

1128
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:11,599
Somalia you know we we try to convert um

1129
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:13,920
what these inputs are into descriptors

1130
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:17,000
right aromatic descriptors your nose

1131
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,240
knows that so many times you might smell

1132
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,880
something you're like h i just like it

1133
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:26,358
it's an emotional reaction right it is

1134
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:29,680
not a I can determine the AR the primary

1135
00:49:26,358 --> 00:49:32,598
secondary and tertiary AR Aromas right

1136
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:35,039
but eventually as you train we will get

1137
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:37,280
you there so that you can have you the

1138
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:41,039
power of language to communicate to the

1139
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,440
consumer so the question is like for all

1140
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:46,039
the experts in here um what are the

1141
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:50,079
inputs that you're doing that really

1142
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:52,039
have increased quality from your

1143
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,720
production additionally onto that Julie

1144
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:56,119
I want to tag on a quick one um which is

1145
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:57,199
that we really need to focus as well on

1146
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,599
supply chain

1147
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:03,118
control um so uh like in beer we talk

1148
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:05,680
about the cold chain um and we talk

1149
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:09,039
about sort of best practices for storage

1150
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:11,358
and for uh packaging and then um

1151
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,960
shipping and distribution uh I think

1152
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:15,039
that's a really really important thing

1153
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,880
to get to get at least to have a have a

1154
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:19,719
sort of Level Playing Field for on which

1155
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,559
to judge all these different things so

1156
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:25,358
yeah absolutely absolutely because it's

1157
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:27,319
so unfair like I literally yeah I'll

1158
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:31,119
just I'll just add again back to this

1159
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:35,199
whole THC potency thing so when when

1160
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,519
when you buy cannabis or when you it

1161
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:39,000
doesn't matter if you're getting it from

1162
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:42,679
a dispensary or you're buying it from

1163
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,838
your guy the Legacy guy you're there's a

1164
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:47,558
certain amount of moisture content in

1165
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:51,239
that cannabis and the problem with the

1166
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:53,839
THC percentage is that typically in in

1167
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:57,798
herbs and and this is not anything

1168
00:50:53,838 --> 00:51:03,039
unique to cannabis in herbs often

1169
00:50:57,798 --> 00:51:05,559
um uh a oil content or or if they're

1170
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,798
measuring a particular compound that

1171
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:11,720
content is tied back to something called

1172
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:15,838
dry weight and dried weight means

1173
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:18,199
absolutely bone dry no water in there

1174
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:20,599
and so if you think about it if if a bud

1175
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:22,199
which has a certain amount of moisture

1176
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:24,000
and again the other moisture

1177
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:27,000
consideration just to talk to it for a

1178
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,519
second is that above a certain moisture

1179
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,798
content it it can still support

1180
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,920
microbial growth so after harvest you

1181
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:36,159
know the plant is rendered defenseless

1182
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,880
it doesn't have its own plant defenses

1183
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:42,239
to fend off microbes so certainly you

1184
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:46,000
can get uh mold

1185
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:48,598
growing if it's not properly dried and

1186
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,679
and certainly like I think in in bulk

1187
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:53,880
biomass when you're talking about hemp

1188
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:56,879
and you're talking about buying stuff

1189
00:51:53,880 --> 00:52:00,000
Super Sacks at a time

1190
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,720
understanding uh uh moisture content

1191
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,358
it's it's more important to understand

1192
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:06,239
something called water activity water

1193
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:09,719
activity is the measurement that you

1194
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:12,279
actually measure in the lab that then

1195
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:15,199
you can trace back to determine what the

1196
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:17,599
moisture content is there and typically

1197
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:20,318
you want to try to keep moisture content

1198
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:23,960
below the Threshold at which mold growth

1199
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:26,000
would be supported but but that aside so

1200
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,760
if you think about it when when you buy

1201
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,318
a nug or when you get a nug and there's

1202
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:34,599
a certain moisture content the t8c

1203
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:37,679
content based on dried weight is sort of

1204
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:40,838
irrelevant because you're not smoking so

1205
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:43,399
when you so uh when you send that sample

1206
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:47,199
to the testing lab thing the testing La

1207
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:50,079
has to do is they have to do that water

1208
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:54,118
activity measurement and that water

1209
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:59,798
activity measurement tells them what the

1210
00:52:54,119 --> 00:53:03,440
dried weight of sample is as opposed to

1211
00:52:59,798 --> 00:53:04,920
it in its moist State and the only way

1212
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,119
they could really do that in a high

1213
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,798
throughput way again just another

1214
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,640
handicap of of uh

1215
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:15,159
prohibition is the labs are forced to do

1216
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:17,759
that in an oven and when you take that

1217
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:20,199
nug that beautiful nug that you smell it

1218
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,119
just has moisture in it has turpine you

1219
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:26,598
put it in an oven to dry it out well

1220
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:29,798
guess what not just the water dries out

1221
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:33,318
right what else happens your your your

1222
00:53:29,798 --> 00:53:37,280
your uh your uh Turpin start to

1223
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:39,838
evaporate and you start to decarbox your

1224
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:43,119
your cannabinoids and there was a really

1225
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:46,159
nice presentation given on online uh

1226
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,519
analytical seminar uh I'm going to not

1227
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:51,519
get the woman's name right but um she

1228
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:53,880
really hit this to the tea where that

1229
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:57,000
can swing the percentage of measurable

1230
00:53:53,880 --> 00:54:00,920
canabo just that effect alone

1231
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,358
almost like 10 15% so so now you have to

1232
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:07,318
ask yourself okay if you're reporting

1233
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:09,679
THC back on a dried weight what should

1234
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:12,639
it be in the actual product that you're

1235
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:15,598
actually buying right which is wet not

1236
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:17,719
DEC carboxilate and Chuck full of tpin

1237
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,400
the tpin that you're attracted to which

1238
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:20,358
is why you bought the thing to begin

1239
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,680
with

1240
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:27,159
right so this is again where this whole

1241
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:29,440
Lab shopping comes up is that Labs

1242
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:33,000
cannot so what labs have to do is they

1243
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:35,119
have to measure the moisture content

1244
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,838
because whatever is moisture in that

1245
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:40,480
flow can't be cannaboids right so if you

1246
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:42,880
think about all the weight of a weight

1247
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,798
percent sample everything that's in your

1248
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,798
denominator there's a whole bunch of

1249
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:48,798
water that's in your denominator that

1250
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:51,280
that you know you you take out of the

1251
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:54,358
equation and and you can do something

1252
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:57,240
called vacuum desiccation at room

1253
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:59,119
temperature where now you're not losing

1254
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:01,798
as much of the Turpin you're losing some

1255
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:04,480
of the water but guess what it takes a

1256
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:07,239
lot longer to do and because it takes a

1257
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,838
lot longer to do people want their

1258
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:10,318
results immediately they want to submit

1259
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:12,679
something and they don't want to wait

1260
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,880
like multiple weeks a and these labs are

1261
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:17,039
backed up so think about it they got to

1262
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,680
do this moisture analysis to basically

1263
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:22,199
determine what part of the denominator

1264
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:25,159
is the water once they could correct for

1265
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:27,439
that now they could measure the sample

1266
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:29,679
by hlc

1267
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,358
and correct for how much water was in

1268
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:32,358
the original

1269
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:52,119
sample 11% right like can you can you

1270
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,240
elaborate on that well it's it's it's

1271
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:56,920
it's actually it's it's very complex

1272
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,399
because so so the plants cells

1273
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,559
themselves hold on to water water

1274
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:05,358
activity is a measure of how much freely

1275
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:10,000
exchangeable water there is between the

1276
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:13,798
biomass and and and and its environment

1277
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,798
but the real difficult

1278
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:21,280
thing like any cellulosic material is

1279
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:24,199
also extremely hydroscopic meaning that

1280
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:27,200
it actually absorbs moisture from air

1281
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:29,960
right so so like when so I actually work

1282
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:32,719
on a project where we we looking at um

1283
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:36,480
wood treatment uh chemistry and we had

1284
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:38,719
to really understand the moisture and

1285
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,798
the relative humidity and how that

1286
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:43,159
affect the properties of the wood

1287
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:45,920
because wood itself here's a real

1288
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:50,759
interesting fact sawdust

1289
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,358
sinks wood floats Isn't that cool the

1290
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,319
wood we all know floats right but

1291
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:57,078
sawdust actually sinks so actually so

1292
00:56:54,318 --> 00:57:00,159
wood is mostly air right it's it's these

1293
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:03,000
cells of air and like most plant

1294
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:06,440
structures you know they're not just

1295
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,318
there for humans to you know grow on

1296
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,480
trees and saw them down and make houses

1297
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:13,279
out of them right they're there as

1298
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:16,440
actually a physical respiration system

1299
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:19,359
for the tree to draw moisture and

1300
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,079
nutrients up from the root Zone and and

1301
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:23,679
and the sugar that comes down from

1302
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:25,599
photosynthesis and the leaves I mean at

1303
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:28,838
the end of the day there's a whole lot

1304
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:30,798
of reasons why wood and natural material

1305
00:57:28,838 --> 00:57:33,440
is the way it is but going back to

1306
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:36,880
cannabis is be it becomes very very

1307
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:40,599
difficult to say get to that bone dry

1308
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:43,039
Zero Water state so I think what your

1309
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:45,480
question was originally alluding to um

1310
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,799
Colin is that when you do the water

1311
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:50,599
measurement activity the company that

1312
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:52,280
sells you the water meter also sells you

1313
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:54,240
a software package that then

1314
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:56,440
extrapolates that water activity

1315
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:59,639
measurement up to something called

1316
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:02,440
isotherm and isotherm is basically the

1317
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:05,318
measurement of water activity

1318
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:08,639
per uh uh

1319
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:10,318
chemically uh measured uh water content

1320
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,639
by something called a Carl Fisher

1321
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:15,480
titration which is how you actually

1322
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:18,598
determine how much percent water is in

1323
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:21,280
material but it's very difficult to do a

1324
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:24,920
caral Fisher titration so if you have

1325
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:27,240
the isotherm curve which is determined

1326
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:30,159
by a Carl Fisher tit you could determine

1327
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:32,118
what the water content is and it used to

1328
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:35,679
be Colin I I remember when that number

1329
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:37,720
was 14% then they moved it down to 11%

1330
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:41,440
yeah but you know I think obviously the

1331
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:44,439
lower when you're buying say bulk hemp

1332
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,280
and you're buying like 50 Super Sacks of

1333
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:50,119
like you know 450 pounds a piece you

1334
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,960
want to know that that stuff is dried

1335
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:55,680
and it could sit in your Warehouse as

1336
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:57,440
you process it because if it is wet you

1337
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:59,759
could certainly get microbial

1338
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,280
contamination in those bags as they sit

1339
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,280
in your Warehouse 100% yeah and then

1340
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,400
even material that's you know sitting

1341
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:09,280
and you know a lot of people are bagging

1342
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,960
to trim right so if that stuff's not

1343
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,480
dried properly to your point you know

1344
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,920
they could lose that material without

1345
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,358
them even knowing you know you until you

1346
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,200
open the bag you're like oh my gosh like

1347
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:21,838
this is all that was a very common

1348
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:23,759
problem early on when we were buying

1349
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:26,159
kilos and looking through them is

1350
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,359
searching for those because people would

1351
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:30,960
like a bag by throwing in a fresh Bud

1352
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:34,159
Etc and so you know you had to hunt for

1353
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:37,079
that but going back to Julie's Point

1354
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:39,239
familiarity and education are the most

1355
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:40,960
important thing for our Bud tenders we

1356
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:43,279
we train them for a week before they

1357
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,240
even hit the floor I own and operate

1358
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,440
Berkeley Patients Group which is a uh

1359
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:51,439
you Us's oldest continuously operating

1360
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,798
dispensary we turned 23 years old next

1361
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,079
month by the way I want to say happy

1362
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:58,199
birthday to Berkeley Patients Group on

1363
00:59:55,079 --> 01:00:01,559
23 years of out there and doing it

1364
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:04,078
but um the more that the bud Tender Is

1365
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:06,680
educated and com can communicate that

1366
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:08,640
with confidence and that they have that

1367
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:11,440
confident education the better the

1368
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:14,038
consumer is to accept because the

1369
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,200
consumer is a lot different than they

1370
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:18,760
were previous to 2018 when it was

1371
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:21,838
strictly medicinal right they had

1372
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:24,760
specific needs whereas it's more of a

1373
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:26,838
curiosity now with the adult use Market

1374
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:29,079
they've now over the past four years

1375
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:31,199
become more accustomed to what those

1376
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:34,079
products and product lines out there but

1377
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:35,598
initially they had to all show up to see

1378
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:39,240
what they had heard about for the

1379
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:41,240
previous 18 years and to them it's just

1380
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:45,000
like you know wow it was really

1381
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:48,118
mindblowing so to then communicate that

1382
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,159
properly and effect effectively and

1383
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:54,160
efficiently was a challenge when we're

1384
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:55,519
dealing with groups of 5 to 10 to 15

1385
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:58,159
sometimes because previously we were

1386
01:00:55,519 --> 01:01:01,079
dealing with a patient oneon-one but

1387
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:03,078
that communication and that style was

1388
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:04,880
just as effective as that oneon-one as

1389
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:07,480
it was with those 15th because they were

1390
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,119
able to communicate that information

1391
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:11,679
confidently because they knew it

1392
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:14,119
understood it we use things like having

1393
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:17,159
the canab Bibles and all

1394
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:18,640
the having them in on in the break room

1395
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:20,558
so that they can flip through them and

1396
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:22,920
get a kind of an understanding about all

1397
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,920
these varietals but on top of that by

1398
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,119
having it the dispensary and seeing the

1399
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:29,480
amount of people that we are and that we

1400
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,960
do we have a good circulation of the

1401
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:34,400
genetics that are out there so their

1402
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:36,358
familiarity becomes their confidence to

1403
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,240
communicate that forward which is

1404
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:40,519
completely one of the most important

1405
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:42,798
things that bun tenders have to be is

1406
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:44,599
Thoroughly educated to communicate it

1407
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:47,239
not just communicate but communicate it

1408
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:50,280
confidently that they understand it not

1409
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:50,279
weak and

1410
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:54,798
feeble and

1411
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,440
with step out and say goodbye I'm going

1412
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:58,489
to go meet Rob and then for breakfast

1413
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,200
much love everybody I love you all happy

1414
01:01:58,489 --> 01:02:03,199

01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:56,599
could do like five prop I started with

1431
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:59,118

01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:17,520
yourself you do it for your plants you

1440
01:03:15,798 --> 01:03:19,440

01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:17,838
future cannabis cumber cucumbers peppers

1463
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,519
and tomatoes we're all talking about

1464
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:21,119
really understanding these turbines

1465
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:24,079
really understanding the growth patterns

1466
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:26,960
and how we can actually grow forward so

1467
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:29,119
that was it that's my kind morning do

1468
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:32,400
some push-ups

1469
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:34,039

1470
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:38,160
be doing our push-ups go

1471
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:40,720
ahead thank you Marcus um been a great

1472
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:43,440
conversation already this morning I kind

1473
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:46,199
of wanted to go back to uh the

1474
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,278
conversation about how different how a

1475
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:51,038
plant can express itself differently in

1476
01:04:48,278 --> 01:04:53,559
different places uh and helping

1477
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,440
consumers understand that difference

1478
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:56,880
that GMO can express in many different

1479
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,200
ways

1480
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,640
um I think that's one of the keys to

1481
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:04,239
Appalachians of origin in cannabis which

1482
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:06,199
is a program that the California

1483
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:09,199
Regulators are trying to roll out and

1484
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:11,439
I'm a big fan of because I do think that

1485
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:14,798
there is a chance for small farmers to

1486
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:16,599
succeed in that framework if you will to

1487
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:22,318
differentiate their

1488
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:23,838
product uh be it GMO or um whatever V

1489
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:27,199
cultivar you might be having to work

1490
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:28,719
with if you're at you know know 600 feet

1491
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:30,159
in the Central Valley of California

1492
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:32,639
you're going to get a very different

1493
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:35,318
expression than you would get at 3,000

1494
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:37,278
feet in British Columbia really

1495
01:05:35,318 --> 01:05:39,838
different versions of exactly the same

1496
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:42,000
plants exactly the same seeds and I

1497
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:44,239
think this is really a key when you

1498
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,278
start talking I mean so far the

1499
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,278
conversation today has been a lot about

1500
01:05:46,278 --> 01:05:51,798
how to preserve the beauty of the

1501
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:53,960
product created for the consumer and I

1502
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:58,559
think that really one of the keys for

1503
01:05:53,960 --> 01:06:00,838
cannabis is to do with the specificity

1504
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,400
of how different practices different

1505
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:06,199
environment different approach different

1506
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:08,480
intention even can give different

1507
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:12,239
Expressions to this plant and I think

1508
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:15,000
that's really the key of capturing the

1509
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:17,118
interest and Imagination of the consumer

1510
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,358
is helping them to understand how

1511
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:22,318
differently this plant can express

1512
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:24,679
itself and how those effects happen in

1513
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:26,838
your body and the other thing I wanted

1514
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:29,159
to mention in the ation about tpin and

1515
01:06:26,838 --> 01:06:31,119
terpenoids one of the things that has

1516
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:34,719
always been fascinating to me I'm a very

1517
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:37,440
sensual person I feel things in my body

1518
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:41,278
and when I smell a flower that's of

1519
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:43,480
interest to me it things happen in my

1520
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:45,358
body I just feel it I don't I don't

1521
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:48,199
really know how to explain it more

1522
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:50,038
specifically than that uh the ganier

1523
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:53,439
program I think is really fascinating

1524
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:55,880
because you're trying to give words to

1525
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:59,440
those sensory experiences and it's a

1526
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:03,680
really beautiful process um I found when

1527
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:06,838
I was working um more actively than I am

1528
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:09,278
these days with plants um particularly

1529
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:11,838
with patient needs one of the things

1530
01:07:09,278 --> 01:07:13,599
that was always fascinating to me was to

1531
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:17,400
the when I had an opportunity to take

1532
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:19,680
someone into a garden of cannabis plants

1533
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:22,599
and ask them which plant was right for

1534
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:24,519
them especially children were really

1535
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:27,559
good at picking out plants that I might

1536
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:30,798
have picked without their input and it

1537
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:33,079
turned out that some more than once uh

1538
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:35,318
those those plants turned out to be the

1539
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:39,318
right one for that person and I'll leave

1540
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:42,400
it at that um much love much respect and

1541
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:44,239
um I do think a key to the success of

1542
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,039
the Cannabis industry is helping the

1543
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:49,639
consumer to

1544
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:51,440
understand what's available uh we in

1545
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:54,278
particularly in in hash church one of

1546
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:56,119
the things I love about this is we are

1547
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:58,760
each of us in our own way

1548
01:07:56,119 --> 01:08:00,640
incredible Geeks about this plant and

1549
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:03,400
about the things that can be made from

1550
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:05,759
it most people don't have the time or

1551
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,920
the learning or the desire to really

1552
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,520
understand all of that what they want is

1553
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,639
the information that helps them be

1554
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:15,119
consumers that can find the thing

1555
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:18,198
they're looking for and we all know this

1556
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:20,359
plant can provide that for those folks

1557
01:08:18,198 --> 01:08:23,278
if we can help them understand how to

1558
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:27,279
find it wow long- winded rant there's

1559
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:29,719

like um my body is returning to some

1574
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:12,480
version of the Vitality I used to enjoy

1575
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:16,079
and I it I will say I have really come

1576
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:19,919
to appreciate the privilege the form of

1577
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:22,079
privilege that good health is so uh if

1578

1579
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:27,198

1580
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:29,439
out on taken responsibility for caring

1581
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:32,278
for your body doing what's needed to

1582
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:34,158
make your body as healthy as it can be

1583
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:36,560
and that's part of my fascination with

1584
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:38,920
cannabis but cannabis is not the answer

1585
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:42,159
for everything and really physical

1586
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:45,079
activity is huge diet is huge mental

1587
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:48,119
attitude willingness to be at peace with

1588
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:49,318
your situation carries a lot of weight

1589
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:51,759
uh in your

1590
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:54,840

1591
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:56,719

much we love and respect you you've you

1594
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:05,239
have I was trying to think earlier uh

1595
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:09,320
this morning about your leadership that

1596
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:10,519
you bring and you you're such a a your

1597
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:12,799
your voice

1598
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,320
alone is

1599
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,079
so

1600
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:20,238
soothing it it grabs the attention of

1601
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:22,640
everyone in the room and and that type

1602
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:27,000
of leadership whether you realize it or

1603
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:29,719
not is is unlike

1604
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,679
none that I've know it's it's it's a

1605
01:10:29,719 --> 01:10:34,600
it's absolutely incredible and you're

1606
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:36,239
such a champion for the for the plant

1607
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:39,079
and for the people that produce the

1608
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:40,439
plant and the place we sure love and

1609
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:44,158
respect

1610
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:47,279
you you're than you Craig it's hard for

1611
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:50,319
it's sometimes hard for me to be

1612
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:53,399
comfortable with that because like in

1613
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:55,880
this room I look around and I feel such

1614
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:59,279
respect and awe

1615
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:03,880
at the people who are here to talk about

1616
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:06,079
their experience in this work um yeah

1617
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:09,600
and that's what makes you a that's what

1618
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:12,079
makes you such a respectable Elder and

1619
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,480
Mentor for us to look up to and learn

1620
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:19,198
from you know the the humble state that

1621
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:21,919
you live in and that uh daily gratitude

1622
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:24,119
and just you know recognizing the beauty

1623
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,880
in everyone or and also probably the

1624
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:27,359
beauty in all the plans and everything

1625
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,679
it's it's a it's a beautiful teaching

1626
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:31,639
for us especially in this day and age

1627
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:33,000
and even in this industry you know when

1628
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:36,679
you get a lot of different types of

1629
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:39,439
characters and stuff so thank you Wade

1630
01:11:36,679 --> 01:11:41,600
and Monica and the family that supports

1631
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:43,759
you at the at the house there we we do

1632
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:47,960
love and appreciate you um thanks for

1633
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:50,440
saying that Craig um chated by his voice

1634
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:52,239
my chickens all came in and literally

1635
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:55,919
jumped up on the screen when they heard

1636
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:58,039
Wade like that was incredible like

1637
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:01,440
I couldn't believe it he even has power

1638
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:04,719
over tend to follow me animals do tend

1639
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:08,000
to follow me around um I'll just build

1640
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:09,840
on what you said which I feel is just a

1641
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,238
a part of the movement that you know

1642
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,719
we've all been a part of all these years

1643
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:16,839
which is it's knowing knowing your

1644
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:20,119
farmer you know know knowing your

1645
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:23,000
Origins knowing your food knowing your

1646
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:24,840
medicine that's why medicinal was

1647
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,039
powerful in the beginning because you

1648
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:30,400
knew your farmer and maker and there was

1649
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:32,639
a level of trust there and there was an

1650
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:35,638
understanding of what their Garden did

1651
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:38,560
so you understood what that GMO was

1652
01:12:35,639 --> 01:12:42,800
because you knew the farmer and you

1653
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:44,360
can't have appellations of

1654
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:48,000
origin

1655
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:51,000
andir without knowing the farmer you can

1656
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,079
play around with regions and say oh this

1657
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,520
region produces something but honestly

1658
01:12:53,079 --> 01:12:58,519
like a Farm's different you know down

1659
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:00,520
the same Valley as another Farm based

1660
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:02,760
off the practices that you put into it

1661
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:04,320
so you know you're going to find

1662
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:08,480
different expressions and different

1663
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:10,559
soils so unfortunately some laws that

1664
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:14,479
have been created and recreational have

1665
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:16,320
taken away the ability to uh to tell the

1666
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:18,238
farmer to talk about the farmer of

1667
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:21,880
origin you know especially in Canada

1668
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:24,238
when you're selling 20 kilos to

1669
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:26,480
Saskatchewan you know you you may or may

1670
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:29,319
not know your farm in that case and if

1671
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:32,399
you do it might be

1672
01:13:29,319 --> 01:13:34,519
uh really large and it may in that

1673
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:37,960
expansion lose those qualities of

1674
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:39,719
terroir and and and uh Appalachia

1675
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:44,719
because of the environment that it's

1676
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:47,840
grown in so a small batch knowing your

1677
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:50,480
farmer showing up to the dispensary

1678
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,960
getting to know people and and human

1679
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:56,559
interaction along with plant interaction

1680
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,279
probably is our best

1681
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:03,360
path towards

1682
01:13:58,279 --> 01:14:05,639
Health we can use bulk medicine and oils

1683
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:06,880
here and there we can eat bulk foods and

1684
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:10,000
do all those things but it's not going

1685
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:12,520
to give us the same transformative

1686
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,920
Health that we may need in times of

1687
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:19,400
sickness or in times of Health we should

1688
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:21,158
be uh continuing our health path Even in

1689
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:23,879
our health so you know you don't have to

1690
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:27,399
be sick to want to get better you should

1691
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:30,119
just be better while being better and uh

1692
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:34,759
you know if you're a a really humble

1693
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:37,319
regenerative farmer able to get exercise

1694
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:40,800
like Johnny B says you're able to

1695
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:44,599
interact with labs and understand

1696
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:47,560
microbes microbiology microscope work

1697
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:50,079
with teas and soils and you get to know

1698
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:53,679
the science side of things but you also

1699
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:56,319
get the spiritual Touch where you get to

1700
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:58,639
actually live live with the crystals

1701
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:01,639
that surround you and when you know

1702
01:14:58,639 --> 01:15:03,960
you're providing that medicine to people

1703
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:07,400
how are we going to make that an sop I

1704
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:10,719
know Kelly has sat with thousands of

1705
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:14,679
women at Birth but she doesn't have a

1706
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:16,840
birth manual that says you know this is

1707
01:15:14,679 --> 01:15:18,560
exactly what makes this happen and

1708
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:22,480
another thing happens you know she's

1709
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:24,960
using intuition and knowledge and um you

1710
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:27,000
know uh interaction and and exper

1711
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,639
experience to learn that so you know

1712
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,319
knowing your farmer and knowing your uh

1713
01:15:29,639 --> 01:15:34,119
medicine maker that's our best path

1714
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:38,279
towards health and so when we can go

1715
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:41,319
down to the dispensary or to h a medical

1716
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:43,319
uh dinner or we have some special

1717
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:45,119
high-end um ways of meeting up with

1718
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:47,639
people I think that's a really good way

1719
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:50,399
to really learn for Bud tenders to learn

1720
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:52,560
from people and from Farmers to connect

1721
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:55,559
with consumers for consumers to

1722
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,800
understand Farms better

1723
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:00,280
and uh yeah that's that's one thing to

1724
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,320
think about um when uh medicine's going

1725
01:16:00,279 --> 01:16:05,119
out to the

1726
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:06,960
market I I couldn't agree more um I just

1727
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:09,119
wanted to share like my experience there

1728
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,679
was a time when I was growing a lot of

1729
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:15,439
vegetables um for for Market I would

1730
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:19,158
take to to to Farmers Market and to to

1731
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:20,678
chefs and uh to the co-ops and when I my

1732
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:22,519
experience working with the co-ops you

1733
01:16:20,679 --> 01:16:25,079
know not not to knock a co-op like we

1734
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:27,320
shop at co-ops and they're they can be a

1735
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:28,600
really good option but often they're

1736
01:16:27,319 --> 01:16:31,039
they're they're doing things to make

1737
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:33,520
money and they have to buy low you know

1738
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:35,439
things at good deals and and just like

1739
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,840
more often than not I feel that I get

1740
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:40,198
disappointed with what I see actually

1741
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,679
coming through the co-ops you know I see

1742
01:16:40,198 --> 01:16:43,479
that they try to support a lot of local

1743
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:45,639
farmers and they often have their

1744
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:47,319
pictures on the wall but when I look at

1745
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:49,639
the tags like you know I live in

1746
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:52,000
Washington it'll say California like

1747
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:53,639
that you know especially the lettuce

1748
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,960
like where I live you can grow lettuce

1749
01:16:53,639 --> 01:16:58,440
year round you know with a little bit of

1750
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:00,319
little bit of effort and it's just like

1751
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:02,960
it disappoints me and so I just like

1752
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:04,439
couldn't agree more with what Josh said

1753
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,279
is saying you know and I really think

1754
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:07,960
that's

1755
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:10,519
what you know has has made Western

1756
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:13,079
culture it made most cultures let me

1757
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:14,840
retract that most cultures Thrive is is

1758
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:17,479
small farms and being connected to the

1759
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:21,159
food source and to who is producing

1760
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:24,718
products and anyways just wanted to like

1761
01:17:21,158 --> 01:17:24,719
agree on that

1762
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:30,840
feel like thank you Josh I think uh you

1763
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:34,759
know that opens up a huge can of worms

1764
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:38,239
because I um watching the industry um in

1765
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:43,079
terms of um how businesses run these

1766
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:47,198
days it's very much about um big big

1767
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:49,840
companies with um Financial backing and

1768
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:52,198
price skimming the market to undercut

1769
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:56,239
everybody else that's really having the

1770
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:59,359
right intention uh in producing good

1771
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:03,000
quality small batch products right and

1772
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:06,559
so that's why the mass market right now

1773
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:10,119
the majority of cannabis sales is not

1774
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:15,159
this small batch single Source farmer

1775
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:18,800
like uh uh uh sorry um like a call like

1776
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:21,319
a farm totable kind of approach it's

1777
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:23,119
more so about like hey let's hit the

1778
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:25,119
mass Market but I don't want to go there

1779
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:28,079
I don't want to go there I want to

1780
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:30,479
actually bring this conversation back to

1781
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:33,198
all the inputs for quality and then

1782
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:33,198
looking at

1783
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:54,439
the I wonder where are they produced in

1784
01:18:50,198 --> 01:18:56,799
the cannabis plant and what is what does

1785
01:18:54,439 --> 01:19:01,638
that type of volatility look like

1786
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:04,639
compared to tpin because um I know that

1787
01:19:01,639 --> 01:19:08,560
there is a huge following of canvas

1788
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:12,600
consumers that love that gas that funk

1789
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:15,440
that skunk and so um and and how this

1790
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:18,760
all relates to storage because when when

1791
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:22,359
someone a let's say a a purchaser at a

1792
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:24,719
cannabis dispensary is creating a menu

1793
01:19:22,359 --> 01:19:27,158
and they're trying to get a product and

1794
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:30,439
showcase a product that has that gas fun

1795
01:19:27,158 --> 01:19:33,238
skunk well yeah it I also find that it

1796
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:36,638
does um when you store it for a long

1797
01:19:33,238 --> 01:19:39,678
time um the funkier it gets and it it's

1798
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:44,119
really pleasing whereas um products that

1799
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:48,319
are like bright and sweet and citrus and

1800
01:19:44,119 --> 01:19:50,238
sugary right um it's this I want you

1801
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:52,719
know whether it's the storage or

1802
01:19:50,238 --> 01:19:56,399
something that um it doesn't last as

1803
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:58,399
long right it doesn't pure as um

1804
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:01,920
beautifully as compared to like the

1805
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:03,479
skunky gassy Aromas um and so that's my

1806
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,520
perspective but Mark I want to know more

1807
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:09,279
from you yeah I mean there there there

1808
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:12,120
could really be some basis in like tpine

1809
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:14,840
preservation in certain varieties that

1810
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:17,279
just again are kind of like fleeting uh

1811
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:20,360
you know we uh the analogy we've talked

1812
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:23,158
about here on hash Church before is that

1813
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:26,158
um Glade air freshener product you know

1814
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:28,238
that you plug into the wall just some

1815
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:30,839
heating element that basically heats up

1816
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:33,718
a thin film that releases these floral

1817
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,760
scents yeah when you first plug it in it

1818
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:38,119
smells wonderful it smells just like the

1819
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:41,639
flowers on the package but about a day

1820
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:44,000
or so later it smells it's got like kind

1821
01:20:41,639 --> 01:20:46,840
of like a more of an antiseptic kind of

1822
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,319
clean hospital kind of General smell

1823
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:52,000
there's still a floral Essence there but

1824
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:54,279
you've basically done

1825
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,560
fractionation and Nick you know this

1826
01:20:54,279 --> 01:21:01,679
from the The Hop industry is that the

1827
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:05,520
the the most the most volatile tping

1828
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:08,639
that you know the way that fragrances

1829
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:11,360
are looked at is is in notes right and

1830
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:13,359
so the the way almost it's kind of

1831
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:15,319
analogous to music which is kind of cool

1832
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:17,799
I think about it all the time like

1833
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:20,158
certain notes are really loud and you

1834
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:22,159
know people actually use loud to

1835
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:24,279
describe cannabis and I remember when it

1836
01:21:22,158 --> 01:21:28,359
was first you know when I first heard

1837
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:31,079
that like yeah right loud it's exactly

1838
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:33,759
it's that it's that that that punch that

1839
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:36,158
you get that that turfing punch and yes

1840
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,000
certainly like you say Julie these

1841
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:43,000
compounds are fleeting Nick could tell

1842
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:46,520
you this that it's it's a real challenge

1843
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:52,158
to basically capture the essence of the

1844
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:55,280
plant as in cultivation into a product

1845
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:57,519
into the jar and if you could do that

1846
01:21:55,279 --> 01:21:59,399
you know that means you have a

1847
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:01,760
successful extraction method if you're

1848
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:05,000
going after concentrates because to me

1849
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:07,760
it's like we we know these things are

1850
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,719
canabo producing machines there's no

1851
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,560
question that we could extract the

1852
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:15,520
cannaboids the real question and what

1853
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:18,120
differentiates the different varieties

1854
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,840
and what a lot of Growers put a lot of

1855
01:22:18,119 --> 01:22:22,559
investment into right is is the

1856
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:25,679
different varieties and the different

1857
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:28,920
flavors and maintaining those flavors

1858
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:31,399
through a processed product is really

1859
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:35,600
quite a challenge because you have to

1860
01:22:31,399 --> 01:22:37,960
treat these compounds with kid gloves

1861
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,880
right Nick I mean a little bit of

1862
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:42,800
oxidation goes the long way and the last

1863
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:45,159
thing I'll I'll remind myself is that

1864
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:48,719
when they package potato chips they

1865
01:22:45,158 --> 01:22:51,439
inflate those bags with nitrogen to make

1866
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:55,319
sure there's a pillow of nitrogen over

1867
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:57,119
the top of those plant oils with if it

1868
01:22:55,319 --> 01:22:59,759
sits on the shelf for too long will

1869
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:02,000
start to go rancid if there's air in

1870
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:04,119
there right but if there's nitrogen in

1871
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,439
there nitrogen kind of keeps in the

1872
01:23:04,119 --> 01:23:11,840
inner atmosphere which also I think Nick

1873
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:13,238
just the idea of like pushing by by like

1874
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,239
like people have always talked about

1875
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:17,000
like vacuum sealing their herb and

1876
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:19,279
certainly for certain applications

1877
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,880
that's a great thing to do vacuum

1878
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:23,000
ceiling you know you pull all the air

1879
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,840
out but there's certain machines that

1880
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,600
actually pull the air out but then

1881
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:31,560
reintroduce nitrogen to give you almost

1882
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:33,960
like a pillow of weed as opposed to this

1883
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:36,120
this shrink wrapped you know quarter

1884
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:39,840
pound that used to be this big is now is

1885
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:43,319
this this small but like again the

1886
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:47,639
chemistry that goes on to preserve those

1887
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:50,399
flavors is just part of like the natural

1888
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:53,840
curing process that happens in cheese

1889
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:57,158
and pickles and yogurt I mean really

1890
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:59,239
these are this is like food gone bad but

1891
01:23:57,158 --> 01:24:01,559
you know food gone bad in a good way

1892
01:23:59,238 --> 01:24:04,039
because of the way that the microbes are

1893
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:05,400
transforming that yogurt or the way that

1894
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:07,439
again like when you when you put

1895
01:24:05,399 --> 01:24:09,359
pickling spice and you have a certain

1896
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:11,719
kind of chemistry that's going on in the

1897
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:14,158
curing of those pickles there's things

1898
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:17,359
that are happening there that again is

1899
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:21,439
uniquely human right pickles are a

1900
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:24,759
uniquely human thing right it's kind of

1901
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:27,479
like like like iasa right I you know we

1902
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:29,960
were there to basically put together

1903
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:32,599
these these different components in a

1904
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:35,319
way that you know humans had to be here

1905
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,400
to do that right wise humans from the

1906
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:39,000
jungle

1907
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:40,960
yeah go ahead Nick I think you're

1908
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,600
similar things so I wanted I wanted to

1909
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,198
dip into this so there's a couple things

1910
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,760
that that uh that Mark brought up that I

1911
01:24:44,198 --> 01:24:46,919
think are in response to what Julie was

1912
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,360
asking that I think are really really

1913
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:52,880
important so um your Glade analogy is a

1914
01:24:50,359 --> 01:24:55,960
great one um but to make it more perhaps

1915
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:59,560
to to cannabis I won't buy anything

1916
01:24:55,960 --> 01:25:01,359
larger than a a half gram Vape anymore

1917
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:03,360
because as you're heating it up and as

1918
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:04,920
you're consuming it you're driving off

1919
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:06,118
those top notes and it changes and

1920
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,639
you'll see that you'll see the darkening

1921
01:25:06,118 --> 01:25:11,198
and that's from from the the heat

1922
01:25:07,639 --> 01:25:13,199
reactions um uh but you'll drive off the

1923
01:25:11,198 --> 01:25:14,919
lighter notes first and your you know

1924
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:17,319
your first rip is going to be very very

1925
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:19,639
different from you know one that's uh

1926
01:25:17,319 --> 01:25:21,759
you know halfway down the cartridge so

1927
01:25:19,639 --> 01:25:23,159
larger larger volumes is not actually

1928
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,920
the the better way to store things

1929
01:25:23,158 --> 01:25:27,479
especially for consumers

1930
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:30,239
um and to what uh what Mark was saying

1931
01:25:27,479 --> 01:25:31,118
you know the the there's a couple of

1932
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:32,559
different things going on there's a lot

1933
01:25:31,118 --> 01:25:34,439
of things I'm I'm just going to kind of

1934
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,800
try to Riff on them as I remember uh

1935
01:25:34,439 --> 01:25:40,559
obviously light heat and oxygen are the

1936
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:42,360
enemies um to a point uh you know if you

1937
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:45,080
want to preserve from the very very

1938
01:25:42,359 --> 01:25:47,639
first uh first experience you want to

1939
01:25:45,079 --> 01:25:50,198
preserve pres preserve all those notes

1940
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:52,880
um you know I think uh what Marcus has

1941
01:25:50,198 --> 01:25:54,039
done with with with bubble hash and and

1942
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,400
and you know full melt and all that

1943
01:25:54,039 --> 01:25:57,479
stuff the that separation that

1944
01:25:55,399 --> 01:26:00,279
concentration under under in a low

1945
01:25:57,479 --> 01:26:01,959
oxygen environment and under um inert

1946
01:26:00,279 --> 01:26:03,639
gas or something like that is is the

1947
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:05,679
best way to preserve it because the you

1948
01:26:03,639 --> 01:26:07,159
know the vast majority of the compounds

1949
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:09,000
that we're interested in are in in the

1950
01:26:07,158 --> 01:26:11,759
Tricom so being able to preserve those

1951
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,319
and concentrate those is is really the

1952
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,079
way to to to preserve preserve those

1953
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:17,118
aromatics and that's why I typically

1954
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:18,399
move to to concentrates for myself now

1955
01:26:17,118 --> 01:26:21,839
just because I enjoy it more and it's

1956
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:23,839
also easier in the lungs um that said uh

1957
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,199
there is a role for oxidation in and

1958
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,920
that's that you see that in the in the

1959
01:26:25,198 --> 01:26:28,759
curing process that some of those

1960
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:31,199
compounds you actually want to oxidize

1961
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:32,600
to get those those higher notes or those

1962
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:34,439
those heavier notes that you're after

1963
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:36,840
like some of the onion and garlic um

1964
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:39,039
those will are predominantly um you know

1965
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:42,119
oxidized THS and stuff that they become

1966
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:46,600
these very very you know chunky Aromas

1967
01:26:42,118 --> 01:26:48,519
uh that said as you are smelling things

1968
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:51,000
and as the plant matures and as as you

1969
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:53,480
you go through your your consumption um

1970
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,198
you will be selectively consu or

1971
01:26:53,479 --> 01:26:58,638
experiencing uh different compounds at

1972
01:26:56,198 --> 01:27:03,279
different levels so as an example if you

1973
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:05,760
leave a a a variety um you know past its

1974
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:09,319
prime all the varieties will eventually

1975
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:11,800
tend towards heavier skunky garlicky um

1976
01:27:09,319 --> 01:27:13,799
oniony Aromas because of of that

1977
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:15,760
degradation there they cease producing a

1978
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:17,119
lot of the the fresher compounds and

1979
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,679
some of a lot of those compounds are

1980
01:27:17,118 --> 01:27:21,519
much more aromatically powerful than the

1981
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:23,319
lighter top notes the top notes are

1982
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,400
still there but you just can't

1983
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:26,960
differentiate them unless you

1984
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:28,039
fractionate them apart um and that's

1985
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,840
that's a that's a fun project I'm

1986
01:27:28,039 --> 01:27:32,560
working on as well is trying to really

1987
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:35,319
see see how we can we can sort of uh you

1988
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:37,520
know blend to create these uh these

1989
01:27:35,319 --> 01:27:38,759
experiences using you know multiple feed

1990
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,159
stocks and stuff and and then also

1991
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:43,480
fractioning those feed stocks apart and

1992
01:27:40,158 --> 01:27:46,679
create entirely novel uh experiences

1993
01:27:43,479 --> 01:27:48,319
from different plants that would never

1994
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:49,800
that you would never get that in in one

1995
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:51,840
variety um and so I think there's

1996
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:53,679
there's there's a lot of fun there Nick

1997
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,560
Nick I just wanted to say you just

1998
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:58,158
reminded me of something that I wanted

1999
01:27:55,560 --> 01:28:00,400
to mention that I forgot which is that

2000
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:02,599
dimethyl sulfide is kind of like the

2001
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:04,799
essence of broccoli I mean it's got that

2002
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,960
kind of like almost rotten egg smell but

2003
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:10,800
more organic and it's kind of

2004
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:13,760
like tomatoes yeah yeah yeah yeah but if

2005
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:15,320
you take that up one oxidation state to

2006
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:18,520
dimethyl

2007
01:28:15,319 --> 01:28:21,198
sulfoxide now you got something that got

2008
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:23,159
a real kind of like garlic almost

2009
01:28:21,198 --> 01:28:25,638
overpowering kind of like like you know

2010
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:28,399
the smell of DMs so it's very very

2011
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:31,440
different than DMS but that tells you

2012
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:33,279
that again there could be like Trace

2013
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:36,919
Amounts of

2014
01:28:33,279 --> 01:28:39,238
oxidation that happens to those thol

2015
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:43,399
that takes them up to the to the

2016
01:28:39,238 --> 01:28:45,599
sulfoxides or higher oxidation it's it's

2017
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:49,679
on its way up to being a sulfate which

2018
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:52,000
is a fully oxidized and

2019
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:56,199
that's again I'm I'm just throwing it

2020
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:00,279
out there maybe again in the curing of

2021
01:28:56,198 --> 01:29:03,599
those skunky varieties to get the maybe

2022
01:29:00,279 --> 01:29:07,079
less harsh skunk but more of like a

2023
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:09,159
Nutty kind of garlicky thing it kind of

2024
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:10,960
goes through somewhat of an oxidation

2025
01:29:09,158 --> 01:29:13,238
but it's all

2026
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:15,639
speculation well I I I think actually

2027
01:29:13,238 --> 01:29:17,279
that's a that is one of the key drivers

2028
01:29:15,639 --> 01:29:19,480
during the the quote unquote cure

2029
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:21,479
process because um you know there's so

2030
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:23,759
many different mechanisms than proposed

2031
01:29:21,479 --> 01:29:26,439
but if you see people curing doing a hot

2032
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,440
cure a cold cure of their their resins

2033
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:29,638
their live resins or their concentrates

2034
01:29:28,439 --> 01:29:31,359
you know you're not going to be having a

2035
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:32,159
lot of that that microbial activity in

2036
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:34,079
there you're not going to be having a

2037
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:36,719
lot of sort of plant U sort of

2038
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:39,039
metabolite or metabolism in there uh so

2039
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:41,719
I think it is just basically chemical um

2040
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:44,479
and when you and and the

2041
01:29:41,719 --> 01:29:47,560
primary mechanism I'm suspecting is

2042
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:50,279
oxidation yeah a sulfide if we just have

2043
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:53,760
a beaker of sulfide sitting here as we

2044
01:29:50,279 --> 01:29:57,198
speak it'll start turning into to it'll

2045
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:59,320
it'll just air oxidized it's Auto

2046
01:29:57,198 --> 01:30:02,279
autocatalytic yeah like you said that's

2047
01:29:59,319 --> 01:30:05,079
light and air there's enough oxygen in

2048
01:30:02,279 --> 01:30:07,599
air to basically promote that reaction

2049
01:30:05,079 --> 01:30:08,960
and and even under um inert gas um

2050
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:11,239
you're never going to get all the oxygen

2051
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:13,439
out um you're there there's going to be

2052
01:30:11,238 --> 01:30:14,919
some remaining in just in between in

2053
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:17,719
between the compound or in between the

2054
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:19,639
uh the the heads or in the plant matter

2055
01:30:17,719 --> 01:30:21,480
um and even just you also get Cascade

2056
01:30:19,639 --> 01:30:22,800
Reactions where oxygen and and hydrogen

2057
01:30:21,479 --> 01:30:24,678
and and you know water are going to be

2058
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,840
liberated throughout the process

2059
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:30,800
so those reactions can also provide more

2060
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:34,000
of the of sort of the base uh some might

2061
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:36,199
say staling or at least um um con like

2062
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,719
elements that can convert compounds into

2063
01:30:36,198 --> 01:30:41,079
other other forms and oxidize them or or

2064
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:43,840
have them go up and down States so it's

2065
01:30:41,079 --> 01:30:46,760
it's really interesting am I correct

2066
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:49,000
like in the skunky thing that happens

2067
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:52,199
with beer it's a completely different

2068
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:54,639
set of chemistry but still oxygen and

2069
01:30:52,198 --> 01:30:56,559
oxidation is sort of rearing it we had

2070
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,239
there it's uh there's a couple different

2071
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,600
processes there but um in beer it's

2072
01:30:58,238 --> 01:31:01,158
typically actually it's called light

2073
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:04,039
struck it's a light reaction it's it's a

2074
01:31:01,158 --> 01:31:05,399
photon that knocks off um a I forget

2075
01:31:04,039 --> 01:31:07,198
exactly what it is it's it's quite a

2076
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:09,079
complicated reaction but it's a fun one

2077
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:12,319
um and you end up with a I think it's

2078
01:31:09,079 --> 01:31:17,000
three methyl 2 buttin thle um which is

2079
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:19,439
that that very skunky character um and

2080
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,039
uh cannabis is also because of those

2081
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:24,279
those aromatics some of the sered

2082
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:26,359
aromatics are uh are also is also very

2083
01:31:24,279 --> 01:31:29,319
sensitive to to light and again so light

2084
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:31,279
and heat are the two main drivers but

2085
01:31:29,319 --> 01:31:34,359
light and heat in the presence of oxygen

2086
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:36,599
it's going to go fast like like seconds

2087
01:31:34,359 --> 01:31:39,639
um you it's it's if you want to try it

2088
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:41,480
uh get a um an IPA or beer if you if you

2089
01:31:39,639 --> 01:31:43,639
if you consume uh take it out into the

2090
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:45,118
sunlight and then like literally a

2091
01:31:43,639 --> 01:31:46,760
second I mean the the reaction happens

2092
01:31:45,118 --> 01:31:47,679
almost at the speed of light um and you

2093
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:49,600
can just put it out in the sun and pull

2094
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:51,639
it back and it will change completely

2095
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:54,920
it'll skunk real

2096
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:57,480
fast right so Nick is is it safe to say

2097
01:31:54,920 --> 01:32:01,319
I mean to sort of address Julie's issue

2098
01:31:57,479 --> 01:32:05,479
around quality and and and freshness is

2099
01:32:01,319 --> 01:32:07,238
that is that it's kind of like again I

2100
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:09,079
don't know if you could if you could

2101
01:32:07,238 --> 01:32:11,718
have kind of like an expiration date

2102
01:32:09,079 --> 01:32:14,880
that makes sense because in most cases

2103
01:32:11,719 --> 01:32:17,079
most expiration dates on on uh products

2104
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,560
that are in dispensaries they just oh

2105
01:32:17,079 --> 01:32:21,319
six months that's it expires right at

2106
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:23,639
that day right so there's something of

2107
01:32:21,319 --> 01:32:26,840
magic that happens that particular day

2108
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:29,520
that makes it now expired right but to

2109
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:32,920
put some type of like like uh I don't

2110
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:36,639
know if you know these little uh uh Bova

2111
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:41,600
yeah packs that basically act as kind of

2112
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:46,199
like the way a humidor would would act

2113
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:48,600
in analogous way to tobacco and do you

2114
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:50,198
think that there's some so I I actually

2115
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:52,440
I I forget where I talked to those guys

2116
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:54,279
I think it was on future cannabis

2117
01:32:52,439 --> 01:32:56,559
project and they want to set up up a

2118
01:32:54,279 --> 01:32:58,639
call with me because I think there's an

2119
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,239
interesting aspect again

2120
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:03,880
around

2121
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:06,799
conditioning the environment in which

2122
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:08,600
the Cannabis is packaged and it's really

2123
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,800
important because I think again like if

2124
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:12,800
you're going to mass produce and you're

2125
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,800
just going to put a bunch of stuff in a

2126
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:17,440
warehouse and it's just going to

2127
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:19,639
inventory like you know many weeks

2128
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:22,879
before it gets I mean that's not the way

2129
01:33:19,639 --> 01:33:26,800
cheese works right and certainly I mean

2130
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:29,319
again I don't see where you know things

2131
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:32,880
always come unraveled is that states

2132
01:33:29,319 --> 01:33:35,719
have different rules around compliancy

2133
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:38,520
and packaging and you know cannabis

2134
01:33:35,719 --> 01:33:41,000
companies are trying to make efforts to

2135
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:43,960
you know reduce packaging you know

2136
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:46,279
footprint you know and less Plastics and

2137
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:48,158
trying to go to more natural packaging

2138
01:33:46,279 --> 01:33:50,759
But ultimately there is no thing because

2139
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:53,000
it's a it's a fresh product it needs to

2140
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:56,199
be grown fresh it needs to be taken to

2141
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:58,639
the place of Commerce and and bought and

2142
01:33:56,198 --> 01:34:01,158
consumed while it's still fresh just

2143
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:03,159
like the produce that we buy and it's

2144
01:34:01,158 --> 01:34:05,960
not something that you could just put in

2145
01:34:03,158 --> 01:34:08,439
a warehouse for several months and just

2146
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:10,000
pull down whenever it's convenient one

2147
01:34:08,439 --> 01:34:12,079
thing I think that struggle I've been

2148
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,479
through is is you know the thing you're

2149
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:15,800
you're kind of the stke in accord with

2150
01:34:13,479 --> 01:34:20,718
me is like no one we didn't really talk

2151
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:22,079
about Headroom and how much in yeah like

2152
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:23,719
these are all things we learned that

2153
01:34:22,079 --> 01:34:25,519
we're like oh my God over time I

2154
01:34:23,719 --> 01:34:28,439
cannabis in a room in a jar with lots of

2155
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:30,639
head room goes bad faster and you just

2156
01:34:28,439 --> 01:34:33,479
this is all you know no one was there to

2157
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:35,239
tell us that this is happening right so

2158
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:38,359
you know I'm still learning and going in

2159
01:34:35,238 --> 01:34:41,079
the sh second Sam was right

2160
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:43,319
Marcus Sam was there and Sam was there

2161
01:34:41,079 --> 01:34:46,039
to tell us all about it but none of us

2162
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:47,759
were listening yeah totally a whole

2163
01:34:46,039 --> 01:34:49,158
bunch of people listening I guess so

2164
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:51,159
what I'm trying to get across is like

2165
01:34:49,158 --> 01:34:53,719
you know I had to learn through trial

2166
01:34:51,158 --> 01:34:55,359
and error all this stuff and I think you

2167
01:34:53,719 --> 01:34:57,800
you're highlighting is still things that

2168
01:34:55,359 --> 01:34:59,799
today predominantly producers are not

2169
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:01,360
thinking about prod but the packaging

2170
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,119
companies are and they're trying to sell

2171
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:05,599
it on producers and I think that

2172
01:35:03,118 --> 01:35:07,039
ideology is a little backwards where

2173
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,079
we're really the ones that are supposed

2174
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:11,439
to be saying to these people that are

2175
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:14,039
providing these solutions to us that hey

2176
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:17,519
we need less Headroom we need better

2177
01:35:14,039 --> 01:35:18,880
seals we need better shelf life um and

2178
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,320
to start that narrative and that

2179
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,960
conversation with them so they can

2180
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:23,399
provide the solutions for us because I

2181
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:26,520
think that's the biggest hurdle today

2182
01:35:23,399 --> 01:35:29,399
that I find is jars are great but this

2183
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,400
has too much headro

2184
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:35,079
too doesn't really make sense one of the

2185
01:35:32,679 --> 01:35:36,920
things oh sorry sorry go ahead go ahead

2186
01:35:35,079 --> 01:35:39,319
man Addison I want to hear it go for it

2187
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:41,719
buddy I mean the issue with cannabis

2188
01:35:39,319 --> 01:35:44,319
storage is is even at steep build when

2189
01:35:41,719 --> 01:35:46,118
we started doing the nitrogen infusion

2190
01:35:44,319 --> 01:35:48,118
packaging for Farmers to save their

2191
01:35:46,118 --> 01:35:49,479
cannabis the problem with that is as

2192
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:52,238
soon as you take the Cannabis out of

2193
01:35:49,479 --> 01:35:54,519
nitrogen it degradates twice as fast

2194
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:57,238
starts to break down immediately quick

2195
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:58,719
so what we need to look at is that and

2196
01:35:57,238 --> 01:36:00,638
and understand is that cannabis is a

2197
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:03,079
perishable product no matter how you cut

2198
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:05,319
it the only way to slow that process is

2199
01:36:03,079 --> 01:36:06,600
to turn it into water hash and then take

2200
01:36:05,319 --> 01:36:08,559
that water hash and store it for a

2201
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:10,840
longer period of time convert that back

2202
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:12,440
in and bring it in different ways bring

2203
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,440
those compounds in different ways back

2204
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:15,479
into the the subject of matter what

2205
01:36:14,439 --> 01:36:18,479
you're trying to do whether it's an

2206
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:20,039
edible or anything else and it's just

2207
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:22,718
the you know I hear everyone talking

2208
01:36:20,039 --> 01:36:24,719
about like you know mass production or

2209
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:26,079
our industry and what's happening name

2210
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:27,800
another industry where this doesn't

2211
01:36:26,079 --> 01:36:29,679
apply it applies in every single

2212
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:32,800
industry so you can learn from those

2213
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:35,279
Industries like the the issue is that we

2214
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:37,800
don't have interstate commerce that's

2215
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:39,679
the biggest issue so no big massive

2216
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:41,159
player can run the whole [ __ ] game

2217
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:42,880
yet so when everyone gets worried about

2218
01:36:41,158 --> 01:36:44,118
some big massive player it's not going

2219
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,118
to happen yet you don't have interstate

2220
01:36:44,118 --> 01:36:48,920
commerce it has to be split up we all

2221
01:36:46,118 --> 01:36:51,079
know to run a company in multiple States

2222
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:53,079
is a [ __ ] there's no question

2223
01:36:51,079 --> 01:36:55,920
about it on the body on the mind on the

2224
01:36:53,079 --> 01:36:57,719
soul it's tough work so you have to

2225
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:59,840
decentralize yourself in order to do

2226
01:36:57,719 --> 01:37:01,800
that some guys are doing a great job of

2227
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:04,199
it right now they're able to present a

2228
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:06,880
product in different areas that that are

2229
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:08,799
standardized as much as possible but

2230
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:10,560
packaging is a huge issue and I and I

2231
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,800
think that what you're talking about

2232
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:16,119
Colin I'm so stoked I just saw the other

2233
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:17,840
day these new pop top caps that go on

2234
01:37:16,118 --> 01:37:19,960
the concentrate and they snap the top

2235
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:22,279
and it sucks all the air out of it and

2236
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:25,039
it seals it so then when you open it

2237
01:37:22,279 --> 01:37:26,920
there the answer is no no air the answer

2238
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:29,158
is to remove oxygen and not to add

2239
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:30,520
nitrogen you know and and it's and it's

2240
01:37:29,158 --> 01:37:32,799
a perishable product so I think the

2241
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:34,880
other thing too is I agree with that the

2242
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:37,639
small Farmer and the fact that the small

2243
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:39,800
Farmer's product if if a small Farmer's

2244
01:37:37,639 --> 01:37:42,039
product is being pushed out in my

2245
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,679
opinion typically there's not the it

2246
01:37:42,039 --> 01:37:45,198
doesn't have the correct marketing and

2247
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:46,880
it doesn't have the correct push behind

2248
01:37:45,198 --> 01:37:49,118
it because we all know that's typically

2249
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:51,039
a better product but if it's not

2250
01:37:49,118 --> 01:37:52,439
marketed correctly and it's not produced

2251
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:54,599
a big company reached out to me they're

2252
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:56,079
doing this big big panel on this new

2253
01:37:54,599 --> 01:37:57,639
hash thing they're doing and they had

2254
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:59,158
all these all these different panels

2255
01:37:57,639 --> 01:38:01,480
about all this stuff and nothing about

2256
01:37:59,158 --> 01:38:03,879
branding and marketing and I was like

2257
01:38:01,479 --> 01:38:05,399
what a mistake you know like we brand

2258
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:07,079
and Market in this industry by looking

2259
01:38:05,399 --> 01:38:09,719
over at the other guy and going oh Myron

2260
01:38:07,079 --> 01:38:12,079
jars got that big label okay I'm gonna

2261
01:38:09,719 --> 01:38:14,239
put a big label on oh and [ __ ] fruit

2262
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:15,840
colors and sticker okay like you know

2263
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:19,198
that that's not marketing like the guy

2264
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,199
that comes out

2265
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:35,760
and it's like but it's it's really the

2266
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,800
the I think to answer the question when

2267
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:39,960
it comes down to cannabis itself it all

2268
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:42,159
needs to be turned into hash it could be

2269
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:44,800
enjoyed as flower for a short period of

2270
01:38:42,158 --> 01:38:47,039
time that's awesome that that's for like

2271
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:49,159
the for the right now you can't store

2272
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:51,000
cannabis for a long period of time I've

2273
01:38:49,158 --> 01:38:53,759
never seen anybody successfully pull it

2274
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,399
off I've never seen it be like me not

2275
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,239
have to be honest to them to be like

2276
01:38:55,399 --> 01:38:58,879
this

2277
01:38:56,238 --> 01:39:00,678
sucks no it's not as fresh as it was

2278
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,639
it's not as good as it was that we all

2279
01:39:00,679 --> 01:39:05,239
know that everything has a a point of

2280
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:08,079
perfection in this in the curing process

2281
01:39:05,238 --> 01:39:10,439
when you're like oh [ __ ] oh man yep

2282
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:12,880
we're here but that's a period in time

2283
01:39:10,439 --> 01:39:14,118
it's a moment in time and and you got to

2284
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,960
keep doing what you do and you got to

2285
01:39:14,118 --> 01:39:17,960
keep networking and build a great

2286
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:20,279
Community to to have that feeling all

2287
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:22,480
the time so the community part's a huge

2288
01:39:20,279 --> 01:39:24,399
part you know when it comes to packaging

2289
01:39:22,479 --> 01:39:26,598
we're here like I'm I'm starting to see

2290
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:29,319
new packaging stuff you know Alchemy

2291
01:39:26,599 --> 01:39:31,039
jars different [ __ ] that just gets an

2292
01:39:29,319 --> 01:39:33,158
understanding of what's there like my

2293
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:36,079
Alchemy jars I've tested them I've done

2294
01:39:33,158 --> 01:39:39,079
like I put like four grams in an Alchemy

2295
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:42,559
jar I'll put 12 grams in an Alchemy jar

2296
01:39:39,079 --> 01:39:44,359
I put 22 grams in an Alchemy jar and I

2297
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:45,719
and I let those sit and I and I hit out

2298
01:39:44,359 --> 01:39:47,960
of them and I open and close them

2299
01:39:45,719 --> 01:39:50,760
there's no difference in the in the

2300
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:52,719
space the the per you know how it

2301
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:54,639
preserves that product is incredible it

2302
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:57,000
just does such a great job this thing

2303
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:58,440
was full when I when I saw you last dude

2304
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,198
this thing was full and you can see it's

2305
01:39:58,439 --> 01:40:02,839
still beautiful in the very bottom of

2306
01:40:00,198 --> 01:40:04,839
smoked the whole jar myself you know

2307
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:06,079
yeah I I couldn't agree more I wanted to

2308
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,880
I wanted to bring this up in the

2309
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:10,760
conversation I think it's a good a good

2310
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:13,440
time but like the last few weeks my head

2311
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:16,320
was was kind of going back in time to

2312
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:19,079
when we first started making rosin and I

2313
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:22,118
was selling full melt uh hash in in the

2314
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:23,319
medical market up here and we were it

2315
01:40:22,118 --> 01:40:25,439
was also the time when we were train

2316
01:40:23,319 --> 01:40:26,759
transitioning to Fresh Frozen and so

2317
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:28,960
that I there was a period where I would

2318
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:31,119
have a lot of dried material and we

2319
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,800
would we would wash it with water and

2320
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:35,238
we'd sell part of it as hash as full

2321
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:36,960
melt hash and then we we'd squish it the

2322
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:39,638
other stuff that wouldn't melt and put

2323
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:43,760
it out as rosin and so the rosin was a a

2324
01:40:39,639 --> 01:40:45,039
byproduct there for for a while um and I

2325
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:47,039
was just kind of thinking back through

2326
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:49,198
the cultivars I was using and

2327
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:50,719
remembering that that the ATF in

2328
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:52,399
particular was a good a good and the

2329
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:54,760
Cherry Pie was a good thing that stuck

2330
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:57,079
out of my mind when we dried the flow

2331
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:59,840
and even almost overdried it did a long

2332
01:40:57,079 --> 01:41:01,599
a long dry on it and then washed it we

2333
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:03,639
were able to pull out better yields and

2334
01:41:01,599 --> 01:41:06,480
a better quality product with certain

2335
01:41:03,639 --> 01:41:08,800
cultivars for the last however many

2336
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:10,879
years everyone's been really focused on

2337
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:12,800
Fresh Frozen and it's done an amazing

2338
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:14,480
thing in it but we've kind of gone to

2339
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:17,320
this categorization we've said certain

2340
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:19,598
things wash or don't wash and that's not

2341
01:41:17,319 --> 01:41:20,840
really what we we should be like and and

2342
01:41:19,599 --> 01:41:22,360
kaay is kind of hitting this I think

2343
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:24,000
it's starting to come up and I actually

2344
01:41:22,359 --> 01:41:26,519
went back

2345
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,960
I think it was like episode 65 or

2346
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:29,719
something in hash church I had to go

2347
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:32,760
back quite a ways and listen through a

2348
01:41:29,719 --> 01:41:34,039
number of hash churches old ones about

2349
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:35,480
around that time because I remembered

2350
01:41:34,039 --> 01:41:36,599
what I was doing and what I was putting

2351
01:41:35,479 --> 01:41:39,319
out and I could look back in my

2352
01:41:36,599 --> 01:41:41,960
Instagram and get a time stamp and Sam

2353
01:41:39,319 --> 01:41:44,479
and uh [ __ ] Cuban talking about dry

2354
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:46,480
sift about taking it for a full 90day

2355
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:47,759
dry in my all this just clicked into my

2356
01:41:46,479 --> 01:41:49,479
head and I was like dude we need to

2357
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:52,560
start [ __ ] around with

2358
01:41:49,479 --> 01:41:55,079
like dialing in which variety we We

2359
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:57,840
Fresh free which variety we dry then

2360
01:41:55,079 --> 01:42:00,039
wash or or dry sift you know and and so

2361
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:02,719
kind of part of the answer to to your

2362
01:42:00,039 --> 01:42:05,319
question Julie is we're still [ __ ]

2363
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:06,719
riding uh riding Trends a bit ourselves

2364
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:09,039
we're still a little bit confused

2365
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:10,439
ourselves we're getting so much better

2366
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:12,599
and the more online and the more

2367
01:42:10,439 --> 01:42:14,678
community and the more events it's like

2368
01:42:12,599 --> 01:42:16,319
we're learning rapid rapidly but uh

2369
01:42:14,679 --> 01:42:18,319
there's still a lot to to you know we

2370
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:20,799
could go back like you know Sam knew it

2371
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:22,359
all along could could be really you know

2372
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:26,199
that should be the T-shirt Sam always

2373
01:42:22,359 --> 01:42:28,000
Sam always set D knew all yeah hash

2374
01:42:26,198 --> 01:42:28,960
makers are the archaeologists of the

2375
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,960
Cannabis

2376
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:34,279
industry they are the guys they are dude

2377
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:36,000
I'm watching s the one more thing I was

2378
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:39,000
gonna say I was watching these guys in

2379
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:42,279
balistan in Afghanistan cut the whole

2380
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:44,000
plant hanging up just in inside a clay

2381
01:42:42,279 --> 01:42:46,399
building let the whole thing dry through

2382
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,960
the winter similar to Tobacco where it

2383
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:50,359
has a bit of fluctuation but it's

2384
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:52,760
staying within a bandwidth and then they

2385
01:42:50,359 --> 01:42:55,238
shake off the dry heads and they're

2386
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:57,039
they're and they're they you know when I

2387
01:42:55,238 --> 01:42:58,839
the pictures I see their hash game is

2388
01:42:57,039 --> 01:43:01,079
better than ours when it especially when

2389
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:02,920
it comes to doing dry dry dry resin you

2390
01:43:01,079 --> 01:43:04,359
know anyways I'll I'll shut up and let

2391
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:06,199
you go Addison but well they're all

2392
01:43:04,359 --> 01:43:08,920
different flavors like I I think what

2393
01:43:06,198 --> 01:43:11,279
people should do if I owned a type six

2394
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:12,960
here in California I already thought of

2395
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:15,279
it I would take a strain in I would run

2396
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,599
it every [ __ ] way you could I'd run

2397
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:19,399
it vho I'd run it solventless I'd run it

2398
01:43:17,599 --> 01:43:21,679
or a type seven I'd run it every single

2399
01:43:19,399 --> 01:43:23,759
way I'd dry it I'd run it into you know

2400
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:25,480
use the Spanish methods of like drying

2401
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:27,119
and pressing and the old old techniques

2402
01:43:25,479 --> 01:43:29,319
and do all that stuff and then have it

2403
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:30,719
all out in front and then you go okay

2404
01:43:29,319 --> 01:43:34,039
well this one's going to be great in the

2405
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:35,840
proxy without water as a dry press this

2406
01:43:34,039 --> 01:43:39,560
one's going to be great oh you know what

2407
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:43,000
this strain expresses itself most you

2408
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:44,960
know the best as a dried finished

2409
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,800
product it seems and and it'd be great

2410
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:49,359
to have all those different things out

2411
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:50,639
there and then have a a cup where people

2412
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:52,479
get to come and try those things and

2413
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:55,039
give their opinion I mean I pat douge on

2414
01:43:52,479 --> 01:43:56,919
the back for constantly being active in

2415
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:58,359
our community and doing all this stuff

2416
01:43:56,920 --> 01:44:00,840
as a marketer you know Dougie from

2417
01:43:58,359 --> 01:44:03,679
Hitman but him to come out and be like

2418
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:05,440
oh a blind test you know have an event

2419
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:08,520
that's a blind test where people come to

2420
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:10,960
it and you you the consumer sits down

2421
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:13,199
with a blindfold on and you're then

2422
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:16,800
being challenged to tell whether it was

2423
01:44:13,198 --> 01:44:18,079
organic indoor outdoor BHO solventless

2424
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,840
it's like what the [ __ ] are you talking

2425
01:44:18,079 --> 01:44:23,519
that who gives a [ __ ] you just took all

2426
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:25,480
the fun out of what we do for what

2427
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,639
reason for ego so that you can go haha

2428
01:44:25,479 --> 01:44:28,638
you don't know what you're talking about

2429
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:30,000
like no that's not what this community

2430
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:31,079
is about that's not what [ __ ] all

2431
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,238
these things are about it's definitely

2432
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:35,198
not what the [ __ ] plant's about I

2433
01:44:33,238 --> 01:44:37,559
mean it should be like did you get high

2434
01:44:35,198 --> 01:44:39,319
did you like it high five what's next

2435
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:42,599
like that's what it should be because

2436
01:44:39,319 --> 01:44:44,759
that leads to hugs and happiness and Lov

2437
01:44:42,599 --> 01:44:47,279
and kindness and Community it's not this

2438
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:49,520
division of like ah he's got pie on his

2439
01:44:47,279 --> 01:44:51,158
face because he there's Marcus the the

2440
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:54,679
king of [ __ ] solvent hash and he

2441
01:44:51,158 --> 01:44:56,839
thought a BHO was an indoor solvent it's

2442
01:44:54,679 --> 01:44:59,800
like get the [ __ ] out of here dude like

2443
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:01,840
oh what do you win humiliation is your

2444
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:04,000
prize like what the [ __ ] is this like

2445
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:05,920
you know that's Division I think it you

2446
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,039
know our our entire industry and

2447
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:10,359
Community I love the hash component of

2448
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:12,479
it I've kind of been pulled towards this

2449
01:45:10,359 --> 01:45:15,920
I think like like a massive Planet

2450
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:18,039
because it is I feel like the best heads

2451
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:19,279
and the people that are really like and

2452
01:45:18,039 --> 01:45:21,679
and not to say that the other people

2453
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:24,198
aren't great it's just we're not about

2454
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:26,239
marketing any but the product and

2455
01:45:24,198 --> 01:45:28,079
letting the product speak for itself and

2456
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:29,718
and if the products in a myar [ __ ]

2457
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:31,679
bag would the hash industry continue to

2458
01:45:29,719 --> 01:45:33,279
allow it to happen [ __ ] no we'd say

2459
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:34,920
that's trash we don't we don't want that

2460
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:36,920
as part of what we're going to support

2461
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:39,359
the flower industry can because it's

2462
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:40,960
real estate to be marketed it's that

2463
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:43,319
myar bag that could be marketing but

2464
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:45,679
like you say it you know uh Colin it

2465
01:45:43,319 --> 01:45:47,439
[ __ ] up the product it's too much heads

2466
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:50,800
space there's too much stuff in there

2467
01:45:47,439 --> 01:45:53,000
you know there needs to go ahead so like

2468
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:56,199
to that to that headspace aspect and to

2469
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:58,000
purging into the um you know pillow

2470
01:45:56,198 --> 01:46:00,319
packs like they do for for chips and

2471
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,198
stuff interesting side note my uncle

2472
01:46:00,319 --> 01:46:04,238
actually is the patent holder for for

2473
01:46:02,198 --> 01:46:06,238
that process he actually invented that

2474
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:08,638
way back in the day um for for veg and

2475
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:12,118
stuff like that but um

2476
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:13,560
the what's interesting for to consider

2477
01:46:12,118 --> 01:46:18,479
this is that you can you can actually

2478
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:18,480
store um you know

2479
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:34,599
atically extend your shelf life um to

2480
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:36,319
the point where you can you could

2481
01:46:34,599 --> 01:46:38,960
probably pick it up in five years and

2482
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:41,000
not have a precipitous loss of of

2483
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:42,639
character um it will change a bit but it

2484
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,599
won't be won't be terrible terrible

2485
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:46,880
terrible um I mean that's one of the

2486
01:46:44,599 --> 01:46:49,440
ways how quickly will it degrade

2487
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:51,359
afterward um the the degradation is it's

2488
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:53,439
it's about the same you don't see uh you

2489
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:55,359
don't see a lot of

2490
01:46:53,439 --> 01:46:56,960
acceleration um it's really just that

2491
01:46:55,359 --> 01:46:58,359
the perception of degradation is much

2492
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,520
higher because you've opened it smells

2493
01:46:58,359 --> 01:47:01,439
fresh and then you know you've

2494
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:02,880
introduced oxygen and Boop it it starts

2495
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:05,198
to go because the oxidation reactions

2496
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:09,319
are very very quick that shell falls off

2497
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:11,039
that shell yeah exactly so so um what I

2498
01:47:09,319 --> 01:47:14,719
you know in an Ideal World consumers

2499
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:16,639
would have the ability to um open select

2500
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:17,760
ideally it would be a single serving uh

2501
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,800
thing but that's going to be incredibly

2502
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:22,320
wasteful uh so so that wouldn't that

2503
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:24,159
wouldn't work but um I one of the things

2504
01:47:22,319 --> 01:47:25,519
you can do you can you can take your

2505
01:47:24,158 --> 01:47:27,000
your your serving size or whatever

2506
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:30,080
you're going to consume out of the

2507
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,639
package and then um you know vacuum it

2508
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:33,118
out and then refes it and then put it

2509
01:47:31,639 --> 01:47:35,039
back in the freezer and that'll work

2510
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:36,439
that'll that'll help it help it stay for

2511
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:39,880
for help it stay fresh for quite a long

2512
01:47:36,439 --> 01:47:42,479
time um to the headspace uh uh

2513
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:44,719
discussion though even in an inert

2514
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:47,319
environment you have the ideal gas law

2515
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:49,480
being in effect which is that basically

2516
01:47:47,319 --> 01:47:52,198
once you have the capacity for

2517
01:47:49,479 --> 01:47:53,839
volatilization uh you will get

2518
01:47:52,198 --> 01:47:56,079
volatilization into the head space to

2519
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:57,920
where it is equal between the uh Source

2520
01:47:56,079 --> 01:48:01,840
material and the volume in the headp

2521
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:05,520
space so assuming you have uh you know X

2522
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:09,239
grams or X micrograms of of your your

2523
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:11,159
volatiles um if you have 50% head space

2524
01:48:09,238 --> 01:48:12,959
you're going to have 50% of those of

2525
01:48:11,158 --> 01:48:14,799
those volatiles end up in the headp

2526
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:17,079
space and 50% still stay in the plant

2527
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,840
material that's really unavoidable so I

2528
01:48:17,079 --> 01:48:21,118
think head space reduction is a is a

2529
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:25,039
huge a huge thing that you need to think

2530
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:26,799
about um that said vacuum packing isn't

2531
01:48:25,039 --> 01:48:29,319
always the best way to do it either

2532
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:31,960
because you're crushing the material and

2533
01:48:29,319 --> 01:48:34,238
you're also uh you know you lose some of

2534
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:35,560
that character so again I hate to always

2535
01:48:34,238 --> 01:48:38,479
bring up the Hop industry but we've got

2536
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:40,560
a lot of experience in this um we found

2537
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:42,118
that actually pillow packs were more

2538
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:44,760
effective at preserving the material for

2539
01:48:42,118 --> 01:48:47,598
a longer time uh one of the reasons was

2540
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:49,960
also that um in vacuum packing you

2541
01:48:47,599 --> 01:48:51,520
create uh fragility in the package

2542
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:53,118
because uh the plant material is

2543
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,920
sticking against the sides and it

2544
01:48:53,118 --> 01:48:56,559
creates little hard nuggets and if those

2545
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:58,560
you know they're moving around a box

2546
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,159
you'll Shear off some of that myar some

2547
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:02,599
of the some of the metal foil that's in

2548
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:02,598
in in

2549
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:18,880
between you can back

2550
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:40,239
um the one of the things that you run

2551
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:41,679
into is also that um you have um sort of

2552
01:49:40,238 --> 01:49:44,039
in I'm going to use hops again uh you

2553
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:47,158
have what's called a storage index and

2554
01:49:44,039 --> 01:49:49,079
uh that is uh primarily determined by

2555
01:49:47,158 --> 01:49:50,598
the degradation of alpha acids just so

2556
01:49:49,079 --> 01:49:53,439
be equivalent like canabo that we're

2557
01:49:50,599 --> 01:49:55,880
talking about and depending on the

2558
01:49:53,439 --> 01:49:57,799
volatile mix and uh other compounds that

2559
01:49:55,880 --> 01:50:00,679
are present that storage inct will go up

2560
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:02,679
or down so if you have a lot of

2561
01:50:00,679 --> 01:50:04,760
compounds that are uh have the potential

2562
01:50:02,679 --> 01:50:06,920
to have highly reactive degradation

2563
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:10,119
products that is going to lead to a

2564
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:11,399
reduced storage in storage index because

2565
01:50:10,118 --> 01:50:14,238
those are providing the building blocks

2566
01:50:11,399 --> 01:50:16,279
for the reactions that will uh degrade

2567
01:50:14,238 --> 01:50:19,678
or at the very least change the material

2568
01:50:16,279 --> 01:50:21,399
that's in there um and so I think

2569
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:22,960
there's a lot to be learned from the

2570
01:50:21,399 --> 01:50:25,359
other Industries like you said earlier

2571
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:27,399
um people this is the same for cheese

2572
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:29,839
the same for salad it's the same for for

2573
01:50:27,399 --> 01:50:33,359
hops it's the same for for for any any

2574
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:35,000
Agricultural Product um you have to try

2575
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:37,198
to preserve it as long as possible and

2576
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,760
you're trying to preserve that character

2577
01:50:37,198 --> 01:50:40,319
if it goes in Back to the sort of the

2578
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:42,079
rant I had earlier about quality versus

2579
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:43,559
character if you have all the quality

2580
01:50:42,078 --> 01:50:44,840
metrics in place where it's not going to

2581
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:48,560
have any apot toxins there's no

2582
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:51,960
microbial uh contamination and um it's

2583
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:53,719
in as secure an environment as possible

2584
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:56,560
then

2585
01:50:53,719 --> 01:50:58,960
it's it's still going to change and so

2586
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:02,199
it's still safe to consume it's just not

2587
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:03,760
going to be as um it's not GNA be the

2588
01:51:02,198 --> 01:51:07,638
same level that that it went into the

2589
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:09,560
package as um but it's you know this is

2590
01:51:07,639 --> 01:51:11,679
this is something we a matter of rate

2591
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:13,800
right Nick it's all a matter of rate uh

2592
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:15,719
and if you want great products like

2593
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:18,440
cannabis grow them

2594
01:51:15,719 --> 01:51:20,279
yourself comes down like if you want the

2595
01:51:18,439 --> 01:51:22,279
best of the best then grow it yourself

2596
01:51:20,279 --> 01:51:24,279
if you want a consistent product you

2597
01:51:22,279 --> 01:51:26,359
need Mass producer to consistently

2598
01:51:24,279 --> 01:51:28,359
produce it so that you can enjoy it and

2599
01:51:26,359 --> 01:51:30,719
then the other thing is is we don't live

2600
01:51:28,359 --> 01:51:33,439
in a in a world anymore where you can't

2601
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:35,000
go out and get it you can continuously

2602
01:51:33,439 --> 01:51:36,598
get the same thing over and over again

2603
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,238
now because the dispensary is there or

2604
01:51:36,599 --> 01:51:40,679
the the black Market's there in a

2605
01:51:38,238 --> 01:51:42,238
stronger way so it's not like back in

2606
01:51:40,679 --> 01:51:43,679
the day when you'd find something you

2607
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:44,759
had to buy as much of it as you could

2608
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:45,920
and then you had to figure out how to

2609
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:47,679
[ __ ] store it and then You' break it

2610
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:49,719
out on Marcus's birthday and then you

2611
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:52,078
know you don't have to do that anymore

2612
01:51:49,719 --> 01:51:55,198
because we do have large mass producers

2613
01:51:52,078 --> 01:51:56,759
that can produce it and then my brain

2614
01:51:55,198 --> 01:51:59,479
started wondering back remember we were

2615
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:01,119
talking about large producer to small

2616
01:51:59,479 --> 01:52:02,718
producer and kind of pushing out the

2617
01:52:01,118 --> 01:52:05,118
small producer and it's just going to be

2618
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:08,319
big producers that happens in every

2619
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:10,719
industry and then how do they even out

2620
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:13,519
well the in the the small producer like

2621
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:15,399
the artist will go with the larger

2622
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:17,840
distributor and get that product out on

2623
01:52:15,399 --> 01:52:19,439
a mass scale and that's kind of how that

2624
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:21,440
works and it's in every industry and

2625
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:23,839
everyone's still protected you know I

2626
01:52:21,439 --> 01:52:26,879
think if everybody just like like you

2627
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:29,000
know lived a healthier life they

2628
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:30,520
wouldn't worry so much in their head

2629
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,198
about all these other things that could

2630
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:33,840
more be more easily solved through a

2631
01:52:32,198 --> 01:52:37,238
healthier

2632
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:39,760
lifestyle so that's thank you thank you

2633
01:52:37,238 --> 01:52:42,678
for that um I there were so many points

2634
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:45,079
I wanted to uh chime in here because

2635
01:52:42,679 --> 01:52:47,158
I've have so many questions for you um

2636
01:52:45,078 --> 01:52:50,759
and really valuable insights thank you

2637
01:52:47,158 --> 01:52:54,198
um but I wanted to kind of flip it have

2638
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:58,480
you come across cavars that bag appeal

2639
01:52:54,198 --> 01:53:02,359
looks great loud smells amazing um you

2640
01:52:58,479 --> 01:53:05,198
know Lab Test shows you know High tpine

2641
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:07,439
you know it's a three center with um you

2642
01:53:05,198 --> 01:53:09,960
know high cannaboid content and then you

2643
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:14,158
smoke it the

2644
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:18,399
flavor is definitely not in conjunction

2645
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:22,559
of what you expect compared to the aroma

2646
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:24,039
and the flavor is like rather sometimes

2647
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:25,639
like the worst for me is when it's

2648
01:53:24,039 --> 01:53:29,078
bitter right when it gets bitter I'm

2649
01:53:25,639 --> 01:53:30,880
like I you know I I put it out so does

2650
01:53:29,078 --> 01:53:34,319
anyone have anything to say about that

2651
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:36,960
like when there is a difference in the

2652
01:53:34,319 --> 01:53:40,479
trash genetics I think a lot of that has

2653
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:42,920
to do with cure because if cannabis is

2654
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:47,559
not properly cured you're still going to

2655
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:49,960
have sugars in the cellular material and

2656
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:52,880
curing is about converting the sugars

2657
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:56,239
into starches which burn clean sugars

2658
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:58,840
don't burn clean and I think that is one

2659
01:53:56,238 --> 01:54:01,000
of the big problems for the consumer

2660
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:02,960
cannabis that smells a certain way but

2661
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:05,279
when you burn it it tastes and smells

2662
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:07,520
completely different they're burning

2663
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:09,960
sugar that's all I have and it takes

2664
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:12,239
time to do a proper cure and it needs

2665
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:14,920
moisture in the cells of the plant

2666
01:54:12,238 --> 01:54:18,039
material for that chemical reaction to

2667
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:19,599
happen U whole art in and of itself and

2668
01:54:18,039 --> 01:54:21,920
that's all I I'll go back to listening

2669
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:23,920
thank you in a pheno hunt if you're

2670
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:27,158
looking at at 20 seeds of the same

2671
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:29,719
strain what can happen also is they're

2672
01:54:27,158 --> 01:54:31,679
they're doing selection and the the

2673
01:54:29,719 --> 01:54:33,599
right one makes it a wrong one makes it

2674
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:35,279
through and it'll be like what you're

2675
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:37,440
saying it could be perfectly cured it

2676
01:54:35,279 --> 01:54:40,279
could be perfectly done it's just that

2677
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:42,118
that inhale exhale flavor or that taste

2678
01:54:40,279 --> 01:54:44,000
isn't there on that feno it's just

2679
01:54:42,118 --> 01:54:46,439
didn't come through on that one where

2680
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,479
another one may not look as great but

2681
01:54:46,439 --> 01:54:50,479
that's really coming through on it and

2682
01:54:48,479 --> 01:54:52,638
it's so it could be selection too I mean

2683
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:54,598
I see you know because it's at the

2684
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:56,400
rainbow belts right now it's you know

2685
01:54:54,599 --> 01:54:58,400
and the 3.0 and the 2.0 and it's coming

2686
01:54:56,399 --> 01:54:59,920
in different ways and you're seeing it

2687
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:01,719
there'll be some versions of it just

2688
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:03,560
like a yield there'll be some versions

2689
01:55:01,719 --> 01:55:05,359
of it that have all the same

2690
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:08,520
characteristics and then it won't yield

2691
01:55:05,359 --> 01:55:10,198
and solvent was sash or it has all the

2692
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:12,239
same characteristics and it does yield

2693
01:55:10,198 --> 01:55:14,399
in soless hash that's the most valuable

2694
01:55:12,238 --> 01:55:16,359
cut that's the one that's coveted that

2695
01:55:14,399 --> 01:55:19,000
archive owns themselves and they hold on

2696
01:55:16,359 --> 01:55:20,198
to and only Chris gets to run and and

2697
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,960
all those different things and it makes

2698
01:55:20,198 --> 01:55:24,719
it viable but it he's right it's you

2699
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:27,198
know if it's not cured correctly then

2700
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:28,840
you're not going to get that final taste

2701
01:55:27,198 --> 01:55:31,198
and flavor and you won't get you'll see

2702
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:33,920
the ash too might be might be dark it

2703
01:55:31,198 --> 01:55:35,598
might not look correct so it's yeah it's

2704
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:37,880
all it's all part even through

2705
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:39,719
population your each plant each aino is

2706
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:41,679
going to require different things you

2707
01:55:39,719 --> 01:55:43,920
know and and cure is absolutely one of

2708
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:46,639
them you know might require it being a

2709
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:48,359
little colder a little warmer or more

2710
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:52,000
humidity or less humidity I mean all

2711
01:55:48,359 --> 01:55:55,559
these things are all attributes to what

2712
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:57,399
makes makes it you know viable um and we

2713
01:55:55,560 --> 01:56:00,320
try to do this one siiz fits all

2714
01:55:57,399 --> 01:56:02,359
especially at scale you know we don't

2715
01:56:00,319 --> 01:56:03,840
you know we're still we're just not

2716
01:56:02,359 --> 01:56:06,319
there in terms of genetics to be able to

2717
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:09,078
do those things how lucky are we though

2718
01:56:06,319 --> 01:56:12,198
that this is such a complex plant with

2719
01:56:09,078 --> 01:56:14,479
complex volatile organic compounds and

2720
01:56:12,198 --> 01:56:17,319
then we've got our own old factories

2721
01:56:14,479 --> 01:56:19,559
involved and our own systems that you

2722
01:56:17,319 --> 01:56:21,799
know our perceptions and our s our

2723
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:24,480
sensitivities and our blind spots and

2724
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:26,079
all of these things that just create you

2725
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:27,959
know these incredible conversations you

2726
01:56:26,078 --> 01:56:32,759
know someone mentioned earlier like uh

2727
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:32,760
Josh was talking about um oh I

2728
01:56:38,198 --> 01:56:42,519
froze always want to hear you out um

2729
01:56:41,118 --> 01:56:45,920
however I'm just

2730
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:47,719
gonna fill the Gap here um when you can

2731
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:49,560
get better reception or something like

2732
01:56:47,719 --> 01:56:53,599
that um I wanted

2733
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:56,159
to um talk about that in terms of how

2734
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:58,319
the product is grown has anyone

2735
01:56:56,158 --> 01:57:01,879
especially the Growers here tried grow

2736
01:56:58,319 --> 01:57:06,399
different growing mediums but with the

2737
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:10,279
sameir or same so that you see okay what

2738
01:57:06,399 --> 01:57:12,439
what yields a different hash or flavor

2739
01:57:10,279 --> 01:57:14,759
or burn um Quality

2740
01:57:12,439 --> 01:57:16,000
experience I'd love the chine on that

2741
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:19,320
one because I've been growing the same

2742
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:21,399
strain for the last what 18 years of

2743
01:57:19,319 --> 01:57:22,920
everything and I've grown basically

2744
01:57:21,399 --> 01:57:26,279
different nutrients and done a lot of

2745
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:27,599
testing and I've had my own hplc sitting

2746
01:57:26,279 --> 01:57:28,840
in the garage and I've done all the

2747
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:30,400
testing and everything you guys talking

2748
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:33,679
about so have you know I've been kind of

2749
01:57:30,399 --> 01:57:35,559
writing about it at the same time um and

2750
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:38,239
I've really been

2751
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:41,840
taking where need start with this be

2752
01:57:38,238 --> 01:57:43,638
honest um uh recently when Mark we did a

2753
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:46,360
we did a cleaning of some hash we did

2754
01:57:43,639 --> 01:57:48,039
some we did a video there and uh I

2755
01:57:46,359 --> 01:57:50,158
remember during that video Mark we were

2756
01:57:48,039 --> 01:57:52,158
doing that cleaning of the heads with

2757
01:57:50,158 --> 01:57:54,439
the glove Tech and you're like look how

2758
01:57:52,158 --> 01:57:56,960
fresh the sweetest it was hung dry for

2759
01:57:54,439 --> 01:57:59,198
four months okay so know people don't do

2760
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:01,158
this so four month hang dry and you

2761
01:57:59,198 --> 01:58:02,439
thought it was still fresh so

2762
01:58:01,158 --> 01:58:04,039
understanding and how that cure comes

2763
01:58:02,439 --> 01:58:05,359
into process and how the grower comes

2764
01:58:04,039 --> 01:58:07,519
into play because everybody can grow

2765
01:58:05,359 --> 01:58:09,078
cannabis I I've seen everybody grow some

2766
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:10,480
fantastic weight of there half the

2767
01:58:09,078 --> 01:58:12,679
people 90% of people don't know how to

2768
01:58:10,479 --> 01:58:14,439
cure their weed and they destroy it in

2769
01:58:12,679 --> 01:58:16,239
the process that's what it comes down to

2770
01:58:14,439 --> 01:58:19,279
is that art is learning how to cure

2771
01:58:16,238 --> 01:58:21,000
cannabis and how to actually hang dry we

2772
01:58:19,279 --> 01:58:22,319
all going to confirm that hang dry is

2773
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,078
the way it's not you get cutting the

2774
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:26,078
[ __ ] down trimming it up let it dry on

2775
01:58:24,078 --> 01:58:28,639
screens or in machines or anything like

2776
01:58:26,078 --> 01:58:31,198
that I've hung dry for three weeks 3

2777
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:32,840
months six months because the injuries

2778
01:58:31,198 --> 01:58:34,799
stuff like that I had no choice and then

2779
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:37,000
with those it gave me this great way of

2780
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:39,119
an education to see how we control the

2781
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:41,800
relative humidity in the room and

2782
01:58:39,118 --> 01:58:44,078
temperature are the key right this is

2783
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:45,840
the 100% the key guys this is how you

2784
01:58:44,078 --> 01:58:47,840
grow and this is everybody this is how

2785
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:50,119
you cure your cannabis in my opinion

2786
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:52,319
this this is my hallucination what I've

2787
01:58:50,118 --> 01:58:54,078
been understanding through the sticking

2788
01:58:52,319 --> 01:58:57,039
comes down to the water activity and

2789
01:58:54,078 --> 01:59:00,198
that cure so this has being great for me

2790
01:58:57,039 --> 01:59:03,279
to understand and see through time and I

2791
01:59:00,198 --> 01:59:04,879
start my my my cures around 80% humidity

2792
01:59:03,279 --> 01:59:07,479
in the room people think that's crazy

2793
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:08,920
hang dry sealed room no fans they're

2794
01:59:07,479 --> 01:59:11,678
pretty big room so I got to look at the

2795
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:13,920
amount of air that's in that room to the

2796
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:15,078
amount of C that's in that room I

2797
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:16,800
haven't really gone into those

2798
01:59:15,078 --> 01:59:18,238
scientific details and i' love to work

2799
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:19,440
with some people and look at some of

2800
01:59:18,238 --> 01:59:21,238
those numbers because I think this is

2801
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:22,719
going to be a really key thing of

2802
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:24,399
understanding really good cannabis for

2803
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:26,039
the patients and people getting those

2804
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:28,238
standardized tures and that same

2805
01:59:26,039 --> 01:59:30,198
consistency of water activity in

2806
01:59:28,238 --> 01:59:32,039
cannabis and this comes down to that

2807
01:59:30,198 --> 01:59:34,678
relative humidity to the grower and the

2808
01:59:32,039 --> 01:59:36,078
guy curing it plain and simple we got to

2809
01:59:34,679 --> 01:59:37,719
cure it properly we got to grow it

2810
01:59:36,078 --> 01:59:39,399
properly but that cure and then once it

2811
01:59:37,719 --> 01:59:41,560
passes on to that next level we got to

2812
01:59:39,399 --> 01:59:42,839
hold that water activity in the jar

2813
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:44,239
whatever me you're going to use that

2814
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:46,639
with there's a few products on the

2815
01:59:44,238 --> 01:59:48,598
market you can also keep it at a

2816
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:51,118
relative humidity level and keep that

2817
01:59:48,599 --> 01:59:53,239
inner jar I've had jars for 8 10 years

2818
01:59:51,118 --> 01:59:55,078
and they C them here from 2012 that were

2819
01:59:53,238 --> 01:59:57,078
10 years old they pop and smell just

2820
01:59:55,078 --> 01:59:59,479
[ __ ] amazing I knew it was in that

2821
01:59:57,078 --> 02:00:02,118
jar at that point so when I look at the

2822
01:59:59,479 --> 02:00:04,238
relative humidity in the room around 67%

2823
02:00:02,118 --> 02:00:08,078
that gives me my aw and my cannabis and

2824
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:10,879
I keep it there 65 sometimes um at a 60°

2825
02:00:08,078 --> 02:00:15,158
a little bit lower sometimes 55 and that

2826
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:17,639
holds my aw to 58 to 59 which is perfect

2827
02:00:15,158 --> 02:00:19,439
for smoking now percentages of moisture

2828
02:00:17,639 --> 02:00:20,840
levels I'm always kind of bad on this

2829
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:22,598
and maybe a few people might be able to

2830
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:24,800
help me with those moisture when we look

2831
02:00:22,599 --> 02:00:26,480
at the water activity Nick and not

2832
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:29,400
moisture levels because for some reason

2833
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:31,118
my I know it's around what's the most

2834
02:00:29,399 --> 02:00:34,960
what's the moisture level at like the

2835
02:00:31,118 --> 02:00:36,759
58% in canis if it's an aw I had it but

2836
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:39,800
I'm just coun a blank on it right now

2837
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:41,760
that's going to be um between hang

2838
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:43,960
second I got an image here to see I

2839
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:46,960
think I just I tried to post it earlier

2840
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:48,960
um right like it is let me see based on

2841
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:51,039
on some of the the isotherms that are

2842
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:53,840
out there you said between a what you

2843
02:00:51,039 --> 02:00:57,639
said 0.55 or 58% you're going to be

2844
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:59,199
looking at about uh 10.2 10.3% moisture

2845
02:00:57,639 --> 02:01:02,960
right

2846
02:00:59,198 --> 02:01:06,000
then2 so 62 is at what 62 is going to be

2847
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:10,279
closer to 11 so we got 10.8 and then we

2848
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:11,520
got 11 10.8 closer 10. 10.2 to 58 is gon

2849
02:01:10,279 --> 02:01:16,078
to be about

2850
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:19,560
10.2 uh and then you know 63 is uh about

2851
02:01:16,078 --> 02:01:21,078
11 11 and a bit 11 and a bit so so that

2852
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:22,920
that's something that I've been kind of

2853
02:01:21,078 --> 02:01:25,439
being and every like I think a lot of

2854
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:26,800
people C that so there's no M levels at

2855
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:28,519
that we're not going to get any

2856
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:30,039
contaminat we're not going to go moldy

2857
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:31,199
we're not going to get any microbes

2858
02:01:30,039 --> 02:01:33,560
anything going there like that's over

2859
02:01:31,198 --> 02:01:37,479
the 65% if I'm correct that's what I

2860
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:41,360
mean do the stock yes please mark thank

2861
02:01:37,479 --> 02:01:43,319
you do the stock stock will snap the

2862
02:01:41,359 --> 02:01:46,118
stock will snap after that's a good

2863
02:01:43,319 --> 02:01:49,359
shade tree way of doing it that's how I

2864
02:01:46,118 --> 02:01:52,839
select that was the old school right I

2865
02:01:49,359 --> 02:01:54,639
don't have a moisture meter but yeah

2866
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:57,679
they're ready to come off the sticks

2867
02:01:54,639 --> 02:02:00,279
I've cured so many I've cured in paper

2868
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:02,039
bags I've cured in and jars I've kep put

2869
02:02:00,279 --> 02:02:03,840
them in closets and we've wrapped them

2870
02:02:02,039 --> 02:02:05,599
and we've Cur there's so many different

2871
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:07,119
ways of caring course growing for the

2872
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:08,920
last 30 years so I've looked at

2873
02:02:07,118 --> 02:02:10,880
different ways but we now would control

2874
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:12,920
our moisture level relative humidity in

2875
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:14,239
the room with that temperature and I can

2876
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:16,440
hold it in that room for six months

2877
02:02:14,238 --> 02:02:17,959
eight months and I can cure that just

2878
02:02:16,439 --> 02:02:19,319
perfectly and those turs are fine once

2879
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:21,719
they going to the jar and to seal that

2880
02:02:19,319 --> 02:02:24,000
jar if I'm opening and closing a jar all

2881
02:02:21,719 --> 02:02:25,840
the time I humidity pack there so I have

2882
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,158
that relative humidity stay at that

2883
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:31,199
level if I'm putting for the jar that's

2884
02:02:28,158 --> 02:02:32,920
going to 67% I seal them I'm good to go

2885
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:35,719
so depending on how that's a jar that's

2886
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:37,679
an airtight not a plastic bag right it's

2887
02:02:35,719 --> 02:02:39,920
going to dry out in a Ziploc bag when we

2888
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:41,639
really ref I put zip well thr humidity

2889
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:43,440
pack in there or something like that so

2890
02:02:41,639 --> 02:02:45,400
that's where you got to kind of look at

2891
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:48,198
how I've been able to see how and I've

2892
02:02:45,399 --> 02:02:49,479
been doing this now for six over six

2893
02:02:48,198 --> 02:02:51,359
seven years really understanding

2894
02:02:49,479 --> 02:02:53,238
humidity levels with Bita they've been

2895
02:02:51,359 --> 02:02:54,960
kind of working with them and over the

2896
02:02:53,238 --> 02:02:56,879
last six years and me doing it

2897
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:59,599
beforehand and jars that I've had curing

2898
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:01,760
for I had my first medic cush when I won

2899
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:03,639
and a jar downstairs right so that's

2900
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:05,679
2012 so that's I've got all of these

2901
02:03:03,639 --> 02:03:07,359
things that I've kind of looked at

2902
02:03:05,679 --> 02:03:09,679
because I'm looking at a standardization

2903
02:03:07,359 --> 02:03:11,759
for myself so I can consume cannabis for

2904
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:14,199
the tpes that give me that joy that give

2905
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:15,560
me that that that that pain relief

2906
02:03:14,198 --> 02:03:19,559
that's what I need I need the

2907
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:19,560
consistency so

2908
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:43,000
the TPS are quite High and the lady

2909
02:03:41,399 --> 02:03:44,719
asked me what were you doing she goes

2910
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:47,000
what are your TPS are through the roof I

2911
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:49,198
also do a total darkness for a couple

2912
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:51,840
weeks I control my relative Comm in my

2913
02:03:49,198 --> 02:03:53,158
room everything I turn up my lights and

2914
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:54,719
I just I've looked at different ways

2915
02:03:53,158 --> 02:03:56,399
I've done that now for last year and a

2916
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:59,039
bit about four crops now and I'm

2917
02:03:56,399 --> 02:04:02,279
actually seeing those Turin Higher by

2918
02:03:59,039 --> 02:04:04,559
Turing it at two week lights out I do a

2919
02:04:02,279 --> 02:04:06,198
full feed full water not feed sorry full

2920
02:04:04,559 --> 02:04:08,239
water turn the lights out I have that

2921
02:04:06,198 --> 02:04:11,479
room completely controlled for humidity

2922
02:04:08,238 --> 02:04:13,519
and temperature of course and uh no

2923
02:04:11,479 --> 02:04:15,359
lights on and then I go in there just

2924
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:18,000
before they dry out completely I cut

2925
02:04:15,359 --> 02:04:20,158
them down and hang them and that's being

2926
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,679
that next little extra push on those

2927
02:04:20,158 --> 02:04:25,158
tpin to completely I've really seen a

2928
02:04:22,679 --> 02:04:26,840
big change in that and uh I hope you

2929
02:04:25,158 --> 02:04:28,319
guys will you make sure that room is

2930
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:29,719
controlled you cannot do that if you do

2931
02:04:28,319 --> 02:04:31,880
not have a controlled room you will

2932
02:04:29,719 --> 02:04:33,158
cause mold you will cause problems

2933
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:34,199
please do not do this unless you're

2934
02:04:33,158 --> 02:04:36,158
doing this and you know what you're

2935
02:04:34,198 --> 02:04:37,879
trying to do and I have no problem I

2936
02:04:36,158 --> 02:04:40,279
test things and I'm willing to like

2937
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:42,359
always fail because that's how you learn

2938
02:04:40,279 --> 02:04:43,479
20% of the problem 80% of the solution

2939
02:04:42,359 --> 02:04:45,279
so these are the things that I've been

2940
02:04:43,479 --> 02:04:47,839
able to find through time and what I've

2941
02:04:45,279 --> 02:04:49,519
been doing and uh that's just my

2942
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:51,078
hallucinations of how I being able to

2943
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:53,639
kind of work towards what I need for

2944
02:04:51,078 --> 02:04:53,639
myself

2945
02:04:54,319 --> 02:04:57,599
what I've

2946
02:04:55,439 --> 02:04:59,198
done and I've been growing with all

2947
02:04:57,599 --> 02:05:02,000
different lights many Kush everybody

2948
02:04:59,198 --> 02:05:04,719
knows my C my strain the same strain for

2949
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:06,399
the last over a decade and a bit and

2950
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:10,039
between lights and nutrients living

2951
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:12,118
soils by far is more flavor LEDs of

2952
02:05:10,039 --> 02:05:13,840
course I'm using because I like the far

2953
02:05:12,118 --> 02:05:18,479
red I like those deep Reds that give me

2954
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:20,679
that so it's uh and organic you guys all

2955
02:05:18,479 --> 02:05:23,279
know that right it's it's organic's the

2956
02:05:20,679 --> 02:05:25,800
way to go to get the flavor hang dry I

2957
02:05:23,279 --> 02:05:27,920
mean and add add the add the biology

2958
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:29,440
into your soils and go living soil like

2959
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:31,039
we got to grow for the future and we

2960
02:05:29,439 --> 02:05:32,960
can't do that with with Bal and

2961
02:05:31,039 --> 02:05:35,439
nutrients and stuff like that really

2962
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:37,158
understanding that that curing and using

2963
02:05:35,439 --> 02:05:38,879
proper Light Recipes and multiple

2964
02:05:37,158 --> 02:05:41,118
spectrums and how we can cut down on

2965
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:43,319
just this overall and be

2966
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:45,238
self-sufficient this is key importance

2967
02:05:43,319 --> 02:05:47,198
and this is uh why I love doing what I

2968
02:05:45,238 --> 02:05:50,198
do and I get the Joy from you guys thank

2969
02:05:47,198 --> 02:05:52,479
you for allowing me to share that and uh

2970
02:05:50,198 --> 02:05:55,000
John thanks you got you touch a bunch of

2971
02:05:52,479 --> 02:05:57,799
things I'm really interested in um one

2972
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:59,639
of the ones uh I think for me I'll touch

2973
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:01,520
on the organic thing in a second but uh

2974
02:05:59,639 --> 02:06:02,840
the light depth the last two weeks

2975
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:04,040
that's interesting because you know a

2976
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:05,559
lot of people are there's the Bro

2977
02:06:04,039 --> 02:06:08,840
Science aspect of it where people are

2978
02:06:05,559 --> 02:06:12,320
doing it for like a day 48 hours and

2979
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:13,760
that's not enough ums yeah and so so

2980
02:06:12,319 --> 02:06:16,319
like have you have you actually do you

2981
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:19,000
have measurements on that by any chance

2982
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:20,639
um I I've got some stuff I me looking at

2983
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,359
get some testing done a little bit so

2984
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:25,039
it's kind of you know always trying to

2985
02:06:22,359 --> 02:06:26,759
get that next of course it's I'm getting

2986
02:06:25,039 --> 02:06:28,319
more help with some people looking at it

2987
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:30,280
because it's uh I've had some people

2988
02:06:28,319 --> 02:06:32,759
look at what I'm testing for me because

2989
02:06:30,279 --> 02:06:34,840
you know everything does cost you yeah I

2990
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:35,920
mean I would I would love to to see see

2991
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:38,319
any any data that you're willing to

2992
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:40,840
share because yeah for I I would just

2993
02:06:38,319 --> 02:06:42,078
love love to see that yeah yeah I think

2994
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:45,039
I put my I put my contact information

2995
02:06:42,078 --> 02:06:46,599
earlier in the chat here um and then

2996
02:06:45,039 --> 02:06:49,519
I'll send it to you actually in a second

2997
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:53,279
um but the

2998
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:57,239
uh terms of organic versus in or

2999
02:06:53,279 --> 02:07:00,559
inorganic um one of the things that

3000
02:06:57,238 --> 02:07:02,558
I have have noticed is that there's

3001
02:07:00,559 --> 02:07:06,320
there's a lot of confusion between

3002
02:07:02,559 --> 02:07:09,119
organic and um sustainable and you know

3003
02:07:06,319 --> 02:07:11,479
a healthy uh microflora environment and

3004
02:07:09,118 --> 02:07:15,078
I think that absolutely having the the

3005
02:07:11,479 --> 02:07:17,118
microflora and the um you know the the

3006
02:07:15,078 --> 02:07:20,039
you know soil bacteria the right soil

3007
02:07:17,118 --> 02:07:23,519
bacteria and the right um soil fungi are

3008
02:07:20,039 --> 02:07:26,639
are the most important aspect of of What

3009
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:28,440
organic farming sort of set out to do um

3010
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:29,880
if you use the right balance of

3011
02:07:28,439 --> 02:07:33,198
nutrients and the right form of

3012
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:35,199
nutrients you can achieve those results

3013
02:07:33,198 --> 02:07:39,799
uh with you know sort of so-called

3014
02:07:35,198 --> 02:07:41,399
non-organic nutrients um and uh it

3015
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:43,360
really is more about keeping the soil

3016
02:07:41,399 --> 02:07:45,839
healthy and not just overloading it with

3017
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:48,118
with with uh with really heavy salts and

3018
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:51,559
leading to to over sort of over overs

3019
02:07:48,118 --> 02:07:54,639
salting in in and and nutrient imbalance

3020
02:07:51,559 --> 02:07:56,679
the soil um so I think that's that's an

3021
02:07:54,639 --> 02:07:57,760
important distinction I think people uh

3022
02:07:56,679 --> 02:08:00,359
I would I would like people to start

3023
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:02,639
experimenting with you know perhaps

3024
02:08:00,359 --> 02:08:05,078
sustainable non-organic nutrients as

3025
02:08:02,639 --> 02:08:06,760
well um and to doce tests on that and

3026
02:08:05,078 --> 02:08:07,840
see if you can achieve the same balance

3027
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:09,760
but just making sure that you have the

3028
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:12,480
right nutrients in the right form

3029
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:14,119
available to those microbes to then uh

3030
02:08:12,479 --> 02:08:16,839
liberate them for the plant at a

3031
02:08:14,118 --> 02:08:18,158
consistent sustainable rate um and and I

3032
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:19,400
think that would be a really nice

3033
02:08:18,158 --> 02:08:23,198
experiment to

3034
02:08:19,399 --> 02:08:24,799
try I mean I I'd like speak to that a

3035
02:08:23,198 --> 02:08:28,319
bit like there's a couple things you

3036
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:30,079
know um I've grown across the Spectrum

3037
02:08:28,319 --> 02:08:32,279
for sure and I'm I'm definitely a living

3038
02:08:30,078 --> 02:08:33,880
soil Guru so that you know

3039
02:08:32,279 --> 02:08:36,960
self-proclaimed I'm into it I'm really

3040
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:39,400
into it um for sustainability reasons

3041
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:40,800
but I feel like there's a there's

3042
02:08:39,399 --> 02:08:42,598
there's something we which we can't

3043
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:45,960
scientifically prove but all of our

3044
02:08:42,599 --> 02:08:49,239
mouths will verify that is the living

3045
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:50,920
soil stuff hands down comes out 100%

3046
02:08:49,238 --> 02:08:52,039
better it's better for the way it is in

3047
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:53,880
your body

3048
02:08:52,039 --> 02:08:58,078
it's better for the way for the way it

3049
02:08:53,880 --> 02:09:00,440
tastes um even the most hardcore um guys

3050
02:08:58,078 --> 02:09:03,078
running really tight really nice games

3051
02:09:00,439 --> 02:09:04,598
will say man your your [ __ ] is better I

3052
02:09:03,078 --> 02:09:05,479
they'll go but I get better yield or you

3053
02:09:04,599 --> 02:09:07,119
know what I mean they'll have their

3054
02:09:05,479 --> 02:09:09,319
reasons for why they stick doing their

3055
02:09:07,118 --> 02:09:10,839
thing but they always say your should

3056
02:09:09,319 --> 02:09:12,279
better you know and and there's there's

3057
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:14,599
a lot of factors I agree with what

3058
02:09:12,279 --> 02:09:16,198
you're saying uh in large part Nick that

3059
02:09:14,599 --> 02:09:18,360
that a lot of folks are messing their

3060
02:09:16,198 --> 02:09:20,319
new game up and they could dial it in

3061
02:09:18,359 --> 02:09:22,238
and they need to have the ability to

3062
02:09:20,319 --> 02:09:23,279
have some biology in there that's a big

3063
02:09:22,238 --> 02:09:24,598
difference and some of these new

3064
02:09:23,279 --> 02:09:26,679
companies will have actually have

3065
02:09:24,599 --> 02:09:28,679
probiotics that they add in and those

3066
02:09:26,679 --> 02:09:30,440
are like a lot better tasting you know

3067
02:09:28,679 --> 02:09:33,239
they're closer but they're they don't

3068
02:09:30,439 --> 02:09:35,000
hit the same homeostasis thing and and

3069
02:09:33,238 --> 02:09:37,598
and there's also a genetic thing too and

3070
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:40,319
I I wonder if Johnny B experienced this

3071
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:41,559
so like when I I taken different cuts

3072
02:09:40,319 --> 02:09:43,799
and I've noticed this through through

3073
02:09:41,559 --> 02:09:44,960
for decades like if I taken a cut you

3074
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:47,559
know let's say from a guy who's been

3075
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:51,039
running synthetics for Years it'll take

3076
02:09:47,559 --> 02:09:52,360
me two three four Cycles growing that

3077
02:09:51,039 --> 02:09:54,679
plant

3078
02:09:52,359 --> 02:09:56,198
and until that plant knows how to use

3079
02:09:54,679 --> 02:09:58,480
those organic nutrients and it's

3080
02:09:56,198 --> 02:10:00,638
literally in the cell walls of the plant

3081
02:09:58,479 --> 02:10:02,558
like it takes time for the plant to get

3082
02:10:00,639 --> 02:10:04,719
the right microbes inside the cell walls

3083
02:10:02,559 --> 02:10:07,679
to where it can really metabolize and

3084
02:10:04,719 --> 02:10:09,599
[ __ ] crank and that's in the seed and

3085
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:12,440
through the Clone it takes a it can take

3086
02:10:09,599 --> 02:10:15,639
a little bit on some on some some lines

3087
02:10:12,439 --> 02:10:18,039
that being said I have a line in ATF

3088
02:10:15,639 --> 02:10:20,800
that has never and I've had this thing

3089
02:10:18,039 --> 02:10:23,158
for like 15 years it has never shown me

3090
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:25,440
the best it shows the best quality when

3091
02:10:23,158 --> 02:10:26,879
when growing in synthetics under HPS

3092
02:10:25,439 --> 02:10:28,439
I've had it for 10 years I [ __ ] with

3093
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:31,840
an LED

3094
02:10:28,439 --> 02:10:33,279
HPS living soils living so you know I've

3095
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:35,480
done all the things and this one just

3096
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:37,399
loves to have a drain to waste HPS

3097
02:10:35,479 --> 02:10:38,919
[ __ ] hot game and it you know what I

3098
02:10:37,399 --> 02:10:40,799
mean so there's there's a genetic

3099
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:43,078
component there's there's a number of of

3100
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:44,920
things going on there but but I think

3101
02:10:43,078 --> 02:10:46,359
everyone in the room most people I won't

3102
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:48,000
speak for them agreed that that there's

3103
02:10:46,359 --> 02:10:50,439
something in the mouth that we can't

3104
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:53,319
scientifically say and quantify that

3105
02:10:50,439 --> 02:10:56,198
that that living soil done proper cured

3106
02:10:53,319 --> 02:10:58,719
proper is hands down better I would say

3107
02:10:56,198 --> 02:11:01,198
we can't scientifically approve it yet

3108
02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:02,639
um but one things the reason and the

3109
02:11:01,198 --> 02:11:05,118
reason I'm doing doing a lot of the work

3110
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:07,800
that I'm I'm trying to do is is not to

3111
02:11:05,118 --> 02:11:09,799
to remove the Artistry or to to to do

3112
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:12,279
that it's more just to to to quantify

3113
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:15,039
whatever we can so that we can grow what

3114
02:11:12,279 --> 02:11:17,399
we want you know and and and learn from

3115
02:11:15,039 --> 02:11:20,118
that um and it's interesting when we

3116
02:11:17,399 --> 02:11:21,598
mentioned about your ATF because um one

3117
02:11:20,118 --> 02:11:24,000
of the things that back to John was

3118
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:25,760
saying earlier you know the uh one of

3119
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:27,840
the reasons that living soil is so good

3120
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:31,159
is that you have a cons consistent

3121
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:32,639
infusion of complex organic soups

3122
02:11:31,158 --> 02:11:35,118
basically and I don't mean organic in

3123
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:38,480
terms of the TM organic farming system I

3124
02:11:35,118 --> 02:11:40,158
mean just like organic compounds um and

3125
02:11:38,479 --> 02:11:43,000
as those degrade they'll release

3126
02:11:40,158 --> 02:11:46,399
different micronutrients uh consistently

3127
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:48,479
uh over time and so I I think that the

3128
02:11:46,399 --> 02:11:50,879
the micronutrients and feeding the soil

3129
02:11:48,479 --> 02:11:52,198
is absolutely the best way uh you can do

3130
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:53,760
things and it should that that's the way

3131
02:11:52,198 --> 02:11:56,359
that that agriculture should be moving

3132
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:57,960
and is moving thankfully finally um and

3133
02:11:56,359 --> 02:12:00,000
it's you know feed the soil and you get

3134
02:11:57,960 --> 02:12:03,000
better plants out of it um the way you

3135
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:05,599
feed the soil is is up to you um and you

3136
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:08,198
will see differences depending on on on

3137
02:12:05,599 --> 02:12:10,520
the intens intensivity of your of your

3138
02:12:08,198 --> 02:12:13,678
fertilization um and what and even what

3139
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:15,199
forms those those come in um but the

3140
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:18,199
sort of what I'm saying is the higher

3141
02:12:15,198 --> 02:12:20,039
the biodiversity uh the higher the the

3142
02:12:18,198 --> 02:12:22,759
complexity of the system the more

3143
02:12:20,039 --> 02:12:24,800
resilient it is and the more um I guess

3144
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:26,760
is to change and to and to shift it has

3145
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:28,480
a bit better buffering capacity if you

3146
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:30,159
will not necessarily from a chemical

3147
02:12:28,479 --> 02:12:33,319
perspective but sometimes but more from

3148
02:12:30,158 --> 02:12:36,039
a a resistance to change um and that's

3149
02:12:33,319 --> 02:12:38,158
that's healthy um there's a there's a

3150
02:12:36,039 --> 02:12:40,158
really I mean there's a seminol paper in

3151
02:12:38,158 --> 02:12:43,638
in sort of sensory agriculture that came

3152
02:12:40,158 --> 02:12:46,000
out in the early 2000s looking at swong

3153
02:12:43,639 --> 02:12:49,159
grapes in the Malboro Valley of of New

3154
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:53,760
Zealand and what they found is that the

3155
02:12:49,158 --> 02:12:55,479
absolute best uh AR itics came from um

3156
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:58,800
Vineyards and particularly sides of

3157
02:12:55,479 --> 02:13:01,479
Vineyards that were were closer to

3158
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:05,960
unfarmed Wildland and they were getting

3159
02:13:01,479 --> 02:13:07,718
this migration of uh of microbes and and

3160
02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:09,840
Al obv from some some some you know

3161
02:13:07,719 --> 02:13:12,760
multicell or some like bugs and stuff

3162
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:16,039
like that that were bringing in this

3163
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:19,079
biodiversity that led to a significantly

3164
02:13:16,039 --> 02:13:23,039
and measurably different and higher

3165
02:13:19,078 --> 02:13:24,078
level of voc's in in these uh in in the

3166
02:13:23,039 --> 02:13:26,599
grapes and in the wines that were

3167
02:13:24,078 --> 02:13:28,158
produced from them um and I mean that

3168
02:13:26,599 --> 02:13:29,840
just to me speaks to the fact that you

3169
02:13:28,158 --> 02:13:33,598
know the higher the biodiversity and and

3170
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:35,119
the more um you sort of uh the healthier

3171
02:13:33,599 --> 02:13:37,679
the soil the more complex that ecosystem

3172
02:13:35,118 --> 02:13:39,439
is the more complex uh production of

3173
02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:41,599
Organics organic compounds and and

3174
02:13:39,439 --> 02:13:43,879
aromatics that you're going to get um

3175
02:13:41,599 --> 02:13:45,880
and so I think I I I think we're

3176
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:47,559
agreeing that that you know the more

3177
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:49,159
complexity and the the healthier the

3178
02:13:47,559 --> 02:13:50,719
soil system is and the healthier the the

3179
02:13:49,158 --> 02:13:53,359
micro environment is the better the

3180
02:13:50,719 --> 02:13:55,480
product was going to be and the the

3181
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:58,198
safer it is for the grower um to

3182
02:13:55,479 --> 02:13:59,919
maintain 100% agree I mean I feel like

3183
02:13:58,198 --> 02:14:02,158
we we could also agree that that like

3184
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:03,399
you know the more times a thing is eaten

3185
02:14:02,158 --> 02:14:05,399
you know what I mean like if I throw an

3186
02:14:03,399 --> 02:14:06,920
alphaalpha meal down on on the top soil

3187
02:14:05,399 --> 02:14:09,399
and let it be consumed by the microbes

3188
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:11,319
versus if I feed it to my goat and then

3189
02:14:09,399 --> 02:14:13,238
take that goat poop and pro process it

3190
02:14:11,319 --> 02:14:15,359
through a compost you know the more

3191
02:14:13,238 --> 02:14:17,718
times you can get things eaten and shat

3192
02:14:15,359 --> 02:14:20,039
and eating in shat you create diversity

3193
02:14:17,719 --> 02:14:21,719
and and Achieve that is one aspect you

3194
02:14:20,039 --> 02:14:24,399
know I I agree totally with what you're

3195
02:14:21,719 --> 02:14:25,800
saying and I mean and and sort of along

3196
02:14:24,399 --> 02:14:29,039
those lines like if if you continuously

3197
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:32,559
feed the same regimen you're going to be

3198
02:14:29,039 --> 02:14:37,238
um training your environment to subsist

3199
02:14:32,559 --> 02:14:39,480
on those on those uh those inputs and so

3200
02:14:37,238 --> 02:14:41,439
you can do it both ways you can do like

3201
02:14:39,479 --> 02:14:42,919
really consistent regimen of the same

3202
02:14:41,439 --> 02:14:46,000
things and you'll probably get a a

3203
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:48,078
fairly stable uh environment that will

3204
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:49,520
produce consistent results and this is

3205
02:14:48,078 --> 02:14:51,399
about consistency and this is what uh

3206
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:53,440
the 800 pound man mantra I don't

3207
02:14:51,399 --> 02:14:57,078
actually know your name sir I'm

3208
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:59,879
sorry uh sorry I can't hear Addison

3209
02:14:57,078 --> 02:15:02,158
Addison okay thanks man good stuff um

3210
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:04,279
the uh like Addison was saying is that

3211
02:15:02,158 --> 02:15:06,638
consistency is key now you could go the

3212
02:15:04,279 --> 02:15:09,238
opposite direction and feed looking at

3213
02:15:06,639 --> 02:15:12,719
at the at the at the micronutrients and

3214
02:15:09,238 --> 02:15:16,000
the um the macronutrients and feed

3215
02:15:12,719 --> 02:15:19,679
multiple different uh sources of those

3216
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:21,479
things continuously to try to promote um

3217
02:15:19,679 --> 02:15:23,319
an even larger biodiversity and a

3218
02:15:21,479 --> 02:15:26,118
flexibility in nutrient uptake and

3219
02:15:23,319 --> 02:15:29,679
nutrient consumption for that system and

3220
02:15:26,118 --> 02:15:31,198
I think there's probably some uh uh' be

3221
02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:32,039
interesting to compare results from both

3222
02:15:31,198 --> 02:15:34,238
of those

3223
02:15:32,039 --> 02:15:36,319
approaches I'd like to jump in here for

3224
02:15:34,238 --> 02:15:39,959
a second that I'm loving this

3225
02:15:36,319 --> 02:15:42,399
conversation um uh first part I wanted

3226
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:45,239
to talk about was the uh idea of

3227
02:15:42,399 --> 02:15:47,198
creating your own inputs um there's a

3228
02:15:45,238 --> 02:15:49,879
bunch of reasons that I think that's a

3229
02:15:47,198 --> 02:15:51,960
really good idea but the idea of B

3230
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:53,880
biodiversity your garden particularly if

3231
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:54,600
you're able to work Outdoors or in

3232
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:57,729
living

3233
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:57,729
[Music]

3234
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:13,159
soil the organisms that are flourishing

3235
02:16:10,559 --> 02:16:14,840
in the soil you have not in your garden

3236
02:16:13,158 --> 02:16:17,439
but around your garden to your point

3237
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:20,360
Nick about uh seeing better results from

3238
02:16:17,439 --> 02:16:22,678
grapes near the edge of a Vineyard as

3239
02:16:20,359 --> 02:16:23,799
versus in in the middle of it because

3240
02:16:22,679 --> 02:16:25,880
the

3241
02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:28,119
microorganisms uh that are in the

3242
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:30,199
Wildland if you will have a chance to

3243
02:16:28,118 --> 02:16:33,398
get into the vineyard and add to the

3244
02:16:30,198 --> 02:16:37,359
diversity of the microscopic life that's

3245
02:16:33,398 --> 02:16:39,119
happening there and I think that uh one

3246
02:16:37,359 --> 02:16:41,239
one of the memories I have I believe it

3247
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:43,599
was on hash Church a while back we

3248
02:16:41,239 --> 02:16:47,000
talked about tpin and someone was here

3249
02:16:43,599 --> 02:16:49,398
presenting the idea that um while

3250
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:51,558
genetics have something to play in the

3251
02:16:49,398 --> 02:16:55,558
genetic expression in the expression of

3252
02:16:51,558 --> 02:16:58,079
tpes in cannabis that uh the

3253
02:16:55,558 --> 02:17:00,358
microorganisms that are in the root Zone

3254
02:16:58,079 --> 02:17:03,519
as well as on the leaf surfaces and

3255
02:17:00,359 --> 02:17:05,920
within the plant itself also trigger

3256
02:17:03,519 --> 02:17:08,200
turpine response from the plant and I

3257
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:10,280
tend to think of it that the cannabis

3258
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:14,040
plant at least part of why it's creating

3259
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:16,120
these tpes is for its own needs we enjoy

3260
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:18,599
them but they are at least partially

3261
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:21,120
about a defense mechanism to discourage

3262
02:17:18,599 --> 02:17:23,799
things that eat plants from eating the

3263
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:27,240
leaves of this plant uh but there's also

3264
02:17:23,799 --> 02:17:29,199
of course that whole uh the Turpin and

3265
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:32,478
effect in our body and why we cultivate

3266
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:35,000
them so I'll stop there I just go ahead

3267
02:17:32,478 --> 02:17:38,879
I was just gonna say just as a way to

3268
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:44,679
encourage interactions with pollinators

3269
02:17:38,879 --> 02:17:49,279
which US humans are so so the the

3270
02:17:44,679 --> 02:17:51,799
Canabis plant and and all all plants for

3271
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:54,519
for that matter and all insects for that

3272
02:17:51,799 --> 02:17:57,279
matter um live in a world called

3273
02:17:54,519 --> 02:17:59,960
chemical ecology it's a whole branch of

3274
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:04,040
chemistry that that describes the

3275
02:17:59,959 --> 02:18:08,199
chemical language that exists between

3276
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:11,280
different organisms including plants and

3277
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:14,079
insects and what's truly amazing when

3278
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:17,559
you look at like the chemicals that

3279
02:18:14,079 --> 02:18:20,039
insects use to communicate with they're

3280
02:18:17,558 --> 02:18:21,518
the same some of the same molecules that

3281
02:18:20,040 --> 02:18:24,160
are in plants

3282
02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:27,639
and so some of the same biochemical

3283
02:18:24,159 --> 02:18:29,920
Pathways and some of the same signals

3284
02:18:27,638 --> 02:18:32,679
that are responsible for those molecules

3285
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:35,359
and plants are also in insects I'll just

3286
02:18:32,679 --> 02:18:38,318
end by saying this you know when we uh

3287
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:41,200
worked on this project with cat Min we

3288
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:45,679
had not realized the importance that cat

3289
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:49,000
Min has in it is a good insect repellent

3290
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:52,040
but it's a lacewing attractant right and

3291
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:54,760
Lace wings are the good ones

3292
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:56,319
well that's Mark that's that's a hugely

3293
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:58,000
important part point because it's not

3294
02:18:56,318 --> 02:19:01,760
only just for pollinators but it's also

3295
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:03,478
for for predators and so so what'll

3296
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:06,318
happen whole there's this whole

3297
02:19:03,478 --> 02:19:09,239
communication that's happening there and

3298
02:19:06,318 --> 02:19:11,879
I think humans right Wade right we're

3299
02:19:09,239 --> 02:19:14,478
we're involved in that communication

3300
02:19:11,879 --> 02:19:17,959
because it's like there's insects

3301
02:19:14,478 --> 02:19:20,199
there's plants there's people right then

3302
02:19:17,959 --> 02:19:22,000
there's the Earth but I I think just to

3303
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:24,319
go back to the chemical communication

3304
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:28,079
again that's really cool is that when

3305
02:19:24,318 --> 02:19:31,558
you look at certain varieties and

3306
02:19:28,079 --> 02:19:34,638
susceptibility to either insect or

3307
02:19:31,558 --> 02:19:39,318
microbial attack whether it's fungal or

3308
02:19:34,638 --> 02:19:43,279
by microbes or whatever um there is a

3309
02:19:39,318 --> 02:19:46,000
chemical basis for certain varieties

3310
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:49,000
that are resistant and and that all has

3311
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:51,478
to do with again tping makeup I would

3312
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:53,959
assume the other chemicals also play a

3313
02:19:51,478 --> 02:19:56,920
role but I think the tpping makeup has a

3314
02:19:53,959 --> 02:20:00,679
big role and someone we we were talking

3315
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:04,318
before too about microbial influence too

3316
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:08,280
on tpes you have to admit too that again

3317
02:20:04,318 --> 02:20:10,639
the Hallmark of microbial degradation is

3318
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:12,920
oxidation because that's what microbes

3319
02:20:10,639 --> 02:20:15,959
want to do they want to oxidize things

3320
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:19,520
when they eat things so sometimes like

3321
02:20:15,959 --> 02:20:21,199
when you look at El's papers and he

3322
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:23,159
identifies

3323
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:25,760
all of these new

3324
02:20:23,159 --> 02:20:28,359
canono they're basically microbial

3325
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:32,239
degradation products of moldy weed down

3326
02:20:28,359 --> 02:20:35,720
at Old Miss right it's basically what it

3327
02:20:32,239 --> 02:20:38,359
comes down to so um yeah so in its

3328
02:20:35,719 --> 02:20:40,559
pristine form yes cannabinoids and

3329
02:20:38,359 --> 02:20:43,720
Turpin in general are metastable

3330
02:20:40,559 --> 02:20:45,279
compounds so they have to be preserved

3331
02:20:43,719 --> 02:20:47,879
and it's interesting Addison what you

3332
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:50,840
were saying about this notion of well

3333
02:20:47,879 --> 02:20:53,679
you can't keep it as flowers so make it

3334
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:56,478
into hash and we need to like have that

3335
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:56,479
as like

3336
02:21:09,079 --> 02:21:14,200
hash I want to be buried in a hash

3337
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:18,159
casket I have to write that into my uh

3338
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:20,640
into my will that's like what you saying

3339
02:21:18,159 --> 02:21:23,200
earlier is the truth like you know hash

3340
02:21:20,639 --> 02:21:26,199
once you make it into that form and I

3341
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:29,319
know Marcus you know he he's been a a

3342
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:32,159
big proponent of this for a really long

3343
02:21:29,318 --> 02:21:34,039
time you know is the more hash you make

3344
02:21:32,159 --> 02:21:35,439
is you know you can you can freeze it

3345
02:21:34,040 --> 02:21:38,160
you can keep it you can pull it out of

3346
02:21:35,439 --> 02:21:40,200
the freezer you can use it at any point

3347
02:21:38,159 --> 02:21:43,719
in time and it has

3348
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:46,800
longevity um you know and resin done

3349
02:21:43,719 --> 02:21:50,799
well with you know the right amount of

3350
02:21:46,799 --> 02:21:54,759
resin to particulate ratios can can last

3351
02:21:50,799 --> 02:21:56,719
a very long time yeah H hash is like

3352
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:59,159
Walt Disney's head you know if you

3353
02:21:56,719 --> 02:22:02,799
freeze it keep that [ __ ] forever man

3354
02:21:59,159 --> 02:22:05,079
that's yeah no doubt any preservation

3355
02:22:02,799 --> 02:22:07,559
preservation is real for

3356
02:22:05,079 --> 02:22:10,318
sure and that's that's why the that's

3357
02:22:07,559 --> 02:22:12,359
why the the supply chain uh conversation

3358
02:22:10,318 --> 02:22:14,680
that Nick brought up is so very very

3359
02:22:12,359 --> 02:22:17,000
very important I think that lots of

3360
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:19,559
critics of what's going on in the legal

3361
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:22,359
Market in Canada I get it there's some

3362
02:22:19,559 --> 02:22:24,318
companies many companies growing boof

3363
02:22:22,359 --> 02:22:26,760
and there's companies not processing

3364
02:22:24,318 --> 02:22:28,719
correctly but there are also great

3365
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:31,280
people who are from the Legacy Market

3366
02:22:28,719 --> 02:22:32,959
growing really nice products and there

3367
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:35,399
are people processing really nice

3368
02:22:32,959 --> 02:22:37,478
products but if you you know if like I

3369
02:22:35,398 --> 02:22:39,840
kept my hash at minus 20 degrees the

3370
02:22:37,478 --> 02:22:42,920
entire time I had it then I sent it out

3371
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:45,559
in jars and it went to the warehouse in

3372
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:48,439
the OCS and it sat for three days in the

3373
02:22:45,559 --> 02:22:51,318
summer at like 100 degrees Fahrenheit in

3374
02:22:48,439 --> 02:22:54,040
their warehouse and you know Addison was

3375
02:22:51,318 --> 02:22:56,318
saying like when you remove the nitrogen

3376
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:58,280
uh oxygen and and replace with nitrogen

3377
02:22:56,318 --> 02:23:01,760
it degrades very very quickly well if

3378
02:22:58,280 --> 02:23:04,920
you keep hash stored for uh you know six

3379
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:06,880
months plus at minus 20 degrees Celsius

3380
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:10,239
and then you go to 100 degrees

3381
02:23:06,879 --> 02:23:12,839
Fahrenheit it literally Cooks the hash I

3382
02:23:10,239 --> 02:23:15,359
mean the hash was like reddish black it

3383
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:19,040
was from being a white powder it just

3384
02:23:15,359 --> 02:23:21,079
turned into this like smeared red black

3385
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:23,800
powder or black

3386
02:23:21,079 --> 02:23:25,159
gum and man it's like we took a lot of

3387
02:23:23,799 --> 02:23:27,599
hits from people going oh they're

3388
02:23:25,159 --> 02:23:29,159
selling bunk and it's not that good and

3389
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:33,040
there really is said something to be

3390
02:23:29,159 --> 02:23:35,200
said for a good product can be destroyed

3391
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:38,800
with a bad supply

3392
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:41,319
chain y you know it's packaging too it's

3393
02:23:38,799 --> 02:23:44,318
every every component is so important

3394
02:23:41,318 --> 02:23:46,959
and that's why you know I think as we

3395
02:23:44,318 --> 02:23:49,478
progress like every other industry has

3396
02:23:46,959 --> 02:23:51,478
that has less barriers you will solve

3397
02:23:49,478 --> 02:23:53,278
these problems and and great companies

3398
02:23:51,478 --> 02:23:55,719
will come forward and and introduce

3399
02:23:53,279 --> 02:23:57,680
these products and you know new Pioneers

3400
02:23:55,719 --> 02:23:59,959
will be made it's just kind of it's the

3401
02:23:57,680 --> 02:24:03,040
exciting part about what's next and what

3402
02:23:59,959 --> 02:24:06,239
we do because everything's come so far

3403
02:24:03,040 --> 02:24:09,319
but I mean it's it's even with uh with

3404
02:24:06,239 --> 02:24:11,119
Legends like for example every single

3405
02:24:09,318 --> 02:24:14,680
entry that comes into Legends goes

3406
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:16,600
immediately into a chest freezer and it

3407
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:19,239
stays in that chest freezer until it

3408
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:21,439
gets you know as we make the kits for

3409
02:24:19,239 --> 02:24:23,719
the judges those are all in free it's

3410
02:24:21,439 --> 02:24:25,479
like everything's protected and the

3411
02:24:23,719 --> 02:24:27,119
reason is is because it's our job to

3412
02:24:25,478 --> 02:24:29,559
give it to the person who comes up to

3413
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:32,479
the hash bar and the same format that it

3414
02:24:29,559 --> 02:24:33,879
was turned in as an entry you know it's

3415
02:24:32,478 --> 02:24:35,599
very important because now we're talking

3416
02:24:33,879 --> 02:24:37,799
about solventless hash it could be melt

3417
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:39,479
it could be dry sift uh it could be

3418
02:24:37,799 --> 02:24:42,159
rosin and we just want to make sure that

3419
02:24:39,478 --> 02:24:44,000
it's that that maker is getting we're

3420
02:24:42,159 --> 02:24:45,439
presenting that maker we're representing

3421
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,680
them at that moment that we hand that

3422
02:24:45,439 --> 02:24:49,880
over to them you know and I expect there

3423
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:51,359
to be a lot of people with coolers and

3424
02:24:49,879 --> 02:24:53,119
we we're going to be giving out ice

3425
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:55,040
packs for people and and replenishing

3426
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:56,399
ice packs while we're there because it

3427
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:58,600
because it is solventless and people

3428
02:24:56,398 --> 02:25:00,639
want to protect it and you know you want

3429
02:24:58,600 --> 02:25:02,159
that want to you know you don't bring it

3430
02:25:00,639 --> 02:25:03,278
all with you but now you're getting it

3431
02:25:02,159 --> 02:25:05,760
so we want to make sure that it's

3432
02:25:03,279 --> 02:25:08,120
protected and we even thought about like

3433
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:10,840
going to Pelican or or like not Pelican

3434
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:12,399
but uh going into like one of the bigger

3435
02:25:10,840 --> 02:25:14,120
cooler companies and being like hey do

3436
02:25:12,398 --> 02:25:15,680
you want to be a sponsor like you know

3437
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:17,040
we have a product that has to stay cold

3438
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:19,760
and I don't think we're ready for that

3439
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:21,359
kind of stuff yet but you know all this

3440
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:24,279
great work all the way through the

3441
02:25:21,359 --> 02:25:27,040
process at so many different points can

3442
02:25:24,279 --> 02:25:28,600
break down and change and destroy the

3443
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:31,160
art you know destroy the work that

3444
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:33,200
somebody did because of supply chain you

3445
02:25:31,159 --> 02:25:35,159
know supply chain isn't just the supply

3446
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:37,479
of the material that's being used it's

3447
02:25:35,159 --> 02:25:38,879
also that material getting itself to the

3448
02:25:37,478 --> 02:25:41,199
market and getting out there to the

3449
02:25:38,879 --> 02:25:42,839
consumer and it's it's it's everything

3450
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:44,200
it really is like if people are Bor in

3451
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:46,398
cannabis right now and you want to find

3452
02:25:44,200 --> 02:25:48,479
a new Direction supply chain is a very

3453
02:25:46,398 --> 02:25:50,439
interesting one and it pays pretty well

3454
02:25:48,478 --> 02:25:52,639
it's actually like a nice place to be

3455
02:25:50,439 --> 02:25:54,318
not as much I'm probably going to regret

3456
02:25:52,639 --> 02:25:56,079
saying this but it's not there's not as

3457
02:25:54,318 --> 02:25:58,478
much you know competition and craziness

3458
02:25:56,079 --> 02:26:01,039
in that space because everyone's focused

3459
02:25:58,478 --> 02:26:02,398
on being the [ __ ] the the rock star

3460
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:04,640
or you know the other guy that's doing

3461
02:26:02,398 --> 02:26:06,278
the other things so but it is important

3462
02:26:04,639 --> 02:26:07,719
and and it and I've seen it many times

3463
02:26:06,279 --> 02:26:09,800
like I'm sure Marcus people were getting

3464
02:26:07,719 --> 02:26:11,398
that hash and being like I always knew

3465
02:26:09,799 --> 02:26:13,039
bubble man was full of [ __ ] like this is

3466
02:26:11,398 --> 02:26:14,559
trash you know they they want to quickly

3467
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:16,000
jump at you and talk some [ __ ] or

3468
02:26:14,559 --> 02:26:19,840
something too with the way culture is

3469
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:21,478
now so no that's that that's what it

3470
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:23,639
looked like that's what it looked like

3471
02:26:21,478 --> 02:26:26,840
when it left when it left my

3472
02:26:23,639 --> 02:26:31,478
facility okay and now I'll show you what

3473
02:26:26,840 --> 02:26:36,600
it looks like now after it sat in in at

3474
02:26:31,478 --> 02:26:38,519
the ocf for three days in a jar okay so

3475
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:40,680
now this was taken with a macro so if I

3476
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:44,279
showed it to you out not in the macro

3477
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:44,279
you can still see the quality is

3478
02:26:46,398 --> 02:26:53,159
there I'll show you what I'll show you

3479
02:26:51,079 --> 02:26:57,439
well it's a lot of volatile organic

3480
02:26:53,159 --> 02:26:59,719
compounds yes yes exactly ton of voc's

3481
02:26:57,439 --> 02:27:02,239
are gone well Addison like you were

3482
02:26:59,719 --> 02:27:06,358
saying earlier so like what we need is a

3483
02:27:02,239 --> 02:27:09,478
a farm to face uh supply chain control

3484
02:27:06,359 --> 02:27:13,479
and to to your thing for Legends um do

3485
02:27:09,478 --> 02:27:15,840
you offer advice for the the supplier

3486
02:27:13,478 --> 02:27:18,039
for The Growers for submitting uh for

3487
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:20,799
for judging and stuff do you do you say

3488
02:27:18,040 --> 02:27:22,760
actually this is how we want you to pack

3489
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:25,559
to show off your your your stuff the

3490
02:27:22,760 --> 02:27:27,000
best it's all yeah but do do you give

3491
02:27:25,559 --> 02:27:29,398
them a standard so so everybody's

3492
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:32,559
getting judged equally well we explained

3493
02:27:29,398 --> 02:27:34,599
to them that it's important to us that

3494
02:27:32,559 --> 02:27:38,278
we're putting their product the way they

3495
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:40,640
present it to us uh exactly to whoever's

3496
02:27:38,279 --> 02:27:42,399
coming up to that hash bar to try it so

3497
02:27:40,639 --> 02:27:43,760
you know to every attendee so it's it's

3498
02:27:42,398 --> 02:27:46,760
really you know we have that

3499
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:49,040
conversation with them about hey uh you

3500
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:50,600
know here's the dates here's you know

3501
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:52,479
it's called weights and dates and it's

3502
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:53,840
like this is the weights of everything

3503
02:27:52,478 --> 02:27:55,559
here's all the dates important dates

3504
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:57,559
here's all the other information and

3505
02:27:55,559 --> 02:27:58,879
that's a big part of it is like you know

3506
02:27:57,559 --> 02:28:00,278
what are you turning in are you doing

3507
02:27:58,879 --> 02:28:01,759
one or two entries what are these

3508
02:28:00,279 --> 02:28:05,560
entries you know because it's it could

3509
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:08,120
be rosin this year it's it's melt or dry

3510
02:28:05,559 --> 02:28:09,799
sift or rosin so there's three different

3511
02:28:08,120 --> 02:28:11,720
categories that are all judged

3512
02:28:09,799 --> 02:28:14,559
separately and there'll be you know

3513
02:28:11,719 --> 02:28:16,639
awards for each one in each category so

3514
02:28:14,559 --> 02:28:18,760
um it's all completely split up so we do

3515
02:28:16,639 --> 02:28:20,760
have the conversation with them hey oh

3516
02:28:18,760 --> 02:28:22,559
you're entering a melt great you know

3517
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:24,359
let let's talk about how you know that's

3518
02:28:22,559 --> 02:28:26,478
coming in or how we're getting that and

3519
02:28:24,359 --> 02:28:28,239
the dates that it has to be here so you

3520
02:28:26,478 --> 02:28:30,879
know because they're also there's a jar

3521
02:28:28,239 --> 02:28:34,159
sponsor KX containers sponsors all the

3522
02:28:30,879 --> 02:28:36,119
jars because we we feel like that jar is

3523
02:28:34,159 --> 02:28:38,920
the most it's the best jar I mean we

3524
02:28:36,120 --> 02:28:41,120
have Melt from since that jar was first

3525
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:43,398
introduced to the market that we put

3526
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:45,279
into those jars and had uh you know and

3527
02:28:43,398 --> 02:28:47,000
it's still good and it you know I just

3528
02:28:45,279 --> 02:28:48,680
smoked some yesterday and it was fire

3529
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:50,120
and it's you know so we really

3530
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:51,439
appreciate that jar we think it's

3531
02:28:50,120 --> 02:28:53,880
there's a lot of thought that goes into

3532
02:28:51,439 --> 02:28:55,559
it including the film that's uh added to

3533
02:28:53,879 --> 02:28:58,199
the jar to cover the top of the jars on

3534
02:28:55,559 --> 02:28:59,639
the inside um so we we do a lot of

3535
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:01,640
different stuff that's all sort of in

3536
02:28:59,639 --> 02:29:04,760
line with exactly what I'm talking about

3537
02:29:01,639 --> 02:29:07,199
making sure from the jar to the way it's

3538
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:09,478
treated to how they give it to us uh

3539
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:10,680
that it's presented exactly that way to

3540
02:29:09,478 --> 02:29:12,079
whoever is going to look at the bottom

3541
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:15,079
of the jar see the sticker that's the

3542
02:29:12,079 --> 02:29:17,478
other thing Legends isn't blind each

3543
02:29:15,079 --> 02:29:20,398
company puts their their logo and their

3544
02:29:17,478 --> 02:29:23,079
strain name and possibly the breeder and

3545
02:29:20,398 --> 02:29:25,239
possibly the the farmer on the bottom of

3546
02:29:23,079 --> 02:29:28,520
that jar so every single one that you

3547
02:29:25,239 --> 02:29:31,478
look at oh that's what it looked like

3548
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:35,000
afterward is that what that is this by

3549
02:29:31,478 --> 02:29:37,879
the way is 14-year-old Master Kush

3550
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:39,600
bubble hash if everyone's wondering why

3551
02:29:37,879 --> 02:29:42,239
it's so dark sorry that it's not the

3552
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:44,120
blonde blonde blonde but this is a

3553
02:29:42,239 --> 02:29:46,799
perfect example of hash that the

3554
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:49,079
volatile organic compounds have changed

3555
02:29:46,799 --> 02:29:51,639
completely they are the most different

3556
02:29:49,079 --> 02:29:53,439
this stuff tastes like perfume it's so

3557
02:29:51,639 --> 02:29:55,119
strong I don't even know how because

3558
02:29:53,439 --> 02:29:57,398
it's just been in this jar it was out on

3559
02:29:55,120 --> 02:30:01,319
my table for years but it sealed itself

3560
02:29:57,398 --> 02:30:04,079
in a way where those compounds somehow

3561
02:30:01,318 --> 02:30:06,559
transformed and preserved without a

3562
02:30:04,079 --> 02:30:09,799
freezer I have not seen that happen many

3563
02:30:06,559 --> 02:30:11,199
times personally um but it is uh just as

3564
02:30:09,799 --> 02:30:13,039
you were talking I thought I would show

3565
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:16,760
a few things and and that particular

3566
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:18,240
hash is uh is extremely special so um I

3567
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:19,559
wanted to mention too you know we're

3568
02:30:18,239 --> 02:30:22,000
having this conversation and we're

3569
02:30:19,559 --> 02:30:23,639
wondering what can we do you know to

3570
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:26,040
sort of bring this to the people Julie's

3571
02:30:23,639 --> 02:30:28,318
like how do we get these PE well we have

3572
02:30:26,040 --> 02:30:30,359
events you know we have events and

3573
02:30:28,318 --> 02:30:33,119
that's what the legends of hash event is

3574
02:30:30,359 --> 02:30:34,840
all about uh in down in Los Angeles

3575
02:30:33,120 --> 02:30:36,240
that's what Julie's collector's cup

3576
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:38,279
which we'll talk about in a little bit

3577
02:30:36,239 --> 02:30:39,439
that's happening up here in Canada you

3578
02:30:38,279 --> 02:30:41,120
know when you have something like

3579
02:30:39,439 --> 02:30:43,439
Legends and you're inviting the best

3580
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:45,200
Growers you know we were asked when we

3581
02:30:43,439 --> 02:30:47,079
were interviewed the other day like oh

3582
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:48,840
what's the equal like what's the

3583
02:30:47,079 --> 02:30:50,680
equality outcome like how are you guys

3584
02:30:48,840 --> 02:30:52,799
making it like equal for all and we're

3585
02:30:50,680 --> 02:30:54,760
like oh oh it's not we're completely

3586
02:30:52,799 --> 02:30:56,398
prejudiced we don't care what the people

3587
02:30:54,760 --> 02:30:58,239
look like but we're prejudiced about

3588
02:30:56,398 --> 02:31:00,358
what the hash looks and smells like

3589
02:30:58,239 --> 02:31:03,039
that's what this event is it's not an

3590
02:31:00,359 --> 02:31:05,479
equality event it's an event to make

3591
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:07,680
sure whoever you are whatever Walk of

3592
02:31:05,478 --> 02:31:10,358
Life you come from that you bring the

3593
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:12,159
you bring what you think is going to be

3594
02:31:10,359 --> 02:31:15,120
that great thing to the table and that's

3595
02:31:12,159 --> 02:31:17,318
that sort of community of hashish aicad

3596
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:19,200
getting together and why the Growers are

3597
02:31:17,318 --> 02:31:20,439
so important and hey you know what put

3598
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:22,880
your money where your mouth is we don't

3599
02:31:20,439 --> 02:31:24,720
have to argue about you know organic

3600
02:31:22,879 --> 02:31:26,519
regenerative is better than Salt

3601
02:31:24,719 --> 02:31:29,318
although I think a lot of us feel that

3602
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:31,040
way but at the same time Nick had me

3603
02:31:29,318 --> 02:31:32,639
really thinking I appreciate his

3604
02:31:31,040 --> 02:31:35,160
scientific mind because he's certainly

3605
02:31:32,639 --> 02:31:37,959
not saying salts are better he's just

3606
02:31:35,159 --> 02:31:39,318
saying is there a way that we can like

3607
02:31:37,959 --> 02:31:40,519
we're it's almost like a conversation

3608
02:31:39,318 --> 02:31:41,760
about medicine and you've got your

3609
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:43,359
Western medicine and you've got your

3610
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:45,639
Eastern medicine well don't we know that

3611
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:47,760
the best version is both of those

3612
02:31:45,639 --> 02:31:49,680
together it's always we're always

3613
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:51,279
dividing not that I'm saying people that

3614
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:52,960
are organic and regenerative Farmers

3615
02:31:51,279 --> 02:31:55,439
need to be pump and salted that's not

3616
02:31:52,959 --> 02:31:57,719
what I'm saying try not to hear that I'm

3617
02:31:55,439 --> 02:32:00,318
just saying that the possibility that

3618
02:31:57,719 --> 02:32:02,199
there's value on both sides and

3619
02:32:00,318 --> 02:32:04,879
understanding feeding your soil what it

3620
02:32:02,200 --> 02:32:06,479
needs can be learned from both sides and

3621
02:32:04,879 --> 02:32:09,000
if it can bring you to a place that

3622
02:32:06,478 --> 02:32:11,760
pulls those two sides together it's very

3623
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:14,398
hard for a bird to fly with One Wing so

3624
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:17,200
when we have both wings of that bird we

3625
02:32:14,398 --> 02:32:20,159
get what we call you know that that just

3626
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:22,840
beautiful flowing state that those were

3627
02:32:20,159 --> 02:32:25,159
just a few things I wanted to say I

3628
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:27,559
couldn't agree more I mean that's that's

3629
02:32:25,159 --> 02:32:29,039
what I set set out to do with the regen

3630
02:32:27,559 --> 02:32:30,920
conference you know and I feel like we

3631
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:34,439
made a little dent in that you know that

3632
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:37,639
all compost is not equal not by no means

3633
02:32:34,439 --> 02:32:40,159
is compost equal and uh not all microbes

3634
02:32:37,639 --> 02:32:42,439
are equal by no means like we try we try

3635
02:32:40,159 --> 02:32:44,239
to really incorporate like let's focus

3636
02:32:42,439 --> 02:32:46,760
on the individual parts of the science

3637
02:32:44,239 --> 02:32:48,478
this let's focus on testing and let's

3638
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:50,800
get down to where we're regenerative to

3639
02:32:48,478 --> 02:32:53,318
me really is using less and if we're

3640
02:32:50,799 --> 02:32:55,278
just aimlessly throwing carbon and

3641
02:32:53,318 --> 02:32:56,799
nitrogen at the at the product at the

3642
02:32:55,279 --> 02:32:59,239
problem rather than saying oh we're

3643
02:32:56,799 --> 02:33:01,920
lacking this through a a te Leaf tissue

3644
02:32:59,239 --> 02:33:03,799
test and adding it micro through a folar

3645
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:05,600
you know like I think I didn't mean to

3646
02:33:03,799 --> 02:33:07,920
come off so hot Nick earlier I I just

3647
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:10,640
kind of can be a little hot Italian but

3648
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:13,318
I uh dude you came across passionate not

3649
02:33:10,639 --> 02:33:16,519
hot at all you came across loving like

3650
02:33:13,318 --> 02:33:21,600
listen I will defend my organic living I

3651
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:25,359
will not hear this I am into this [ __ ]

3652

he's just an amazing individual and way

3679
02:34:19,760 --> 02:34:23,920
you and him would probably be like best

3680
02:34:21,200 --> 02:34:25,800
friends honestly um on the farming end

3681
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:27,799
and the boat regenerative for the soils

3682
02:34:25,799 --> 02:34:29,358
and the biology he wants to do things on

3683
02:34:27,799 --> 02:34:30,879
the rainforest on the edge as they're

3684
02:34:29,359 --> 02:34:32,880
coming into it he's doing some pretty

3685
02:34:30,879 --> 02:34:35,239
amazing things on on an international

3686
02:34:32,879 --> 02:34:37,639
level and this is just a conversation

3687
02:34:35,239 --> 02:34:39,840

this year I'd love to um yeah let's you

3698
02:35:01,719 --> 02:35:05,039
know what let's I want to get back to

3699
02:35:03,239 --> 02:35:06,920
this conversation for sure but we got a

3700
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:09,240
little bit of time and legends is pretty

3701
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:10,559
important so uh let's uh let's talk

3702
02:35:09,239 --> 02:35:13,279
about that for a little bit I want to

3703
02:35:10,559 --> 02:35:15,278
make time to talk about Julie's and the

3704
02:35:13,279 --> 02:35:16,840
canor rep's collector's cup as well

3705
02:35:15,279 --> 02:35:19,720
that's happening here in Canada and

3706
02:35:16,840 --> 02:35:21,960
three cities but let's start off with uh

3707
02:35:19,719 --> 02:35:24,278
Legends and uh you know just a little

3708
02:35:21,959 --> 02:35:26,239
bit of information for everyone I you

3709
02:35:24,279 --> 02:35:27,680
know mostly what everyone asks is how

3710
02:35:26,239 --> 02:35:31,000
they can get a ticket that's usually

3711
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:32,318
where it starts and so maybe you could

3712
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:34,520
let the answer

3713
02:35:32,318 --> 02:35:37,119
out yeah yeah that's the that's the

3714
02:35:34,520 --> 02:35:40,079
biggest question the answer to it is

3715
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:42,880
that um I think as like as organizers

3716
02:35:40,079 --> 02:35:45,398
and producers of it we look at that as

3717
02:35:42,879 --> 02:35:46,920
as the hardest decision to make is who

3718
02:35:45,398 --> 02:35:48,920
can actually be on that list and who can

3719
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:50,840
come that Year from the maker all the

3720
02:35:48,920 --> 02:35:53,478
way into the the attendees that get to

3721
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:55,239
come um we were able to alleviate that

3722
02:35:53,478 --> 02:35:57,039
issue a little bit this year by

3723
02:35:55,239 --> 02:36:00,079
introducing all the judging and giving

3724
02:35:57,040 --> 02:36:02,399
the judges uh essentially 21 hours to

3725
02:36:00,079 --> 02:36:07,760
judge uh and and the judges are the

3726
02:36:02,398 --> 02:36:12,278
makers so it it it came down to um you

3727
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:12,279
know we had to put a system in place

3728
02:36:23,959 --> 02:36:29,039
because you know the our our job is to

3729
02:36:26,959 --> 02:36:30,959
not just put on an event but figure out

3730
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:32,920
how to monetize it correctly with the

3731
02:36:30,959 --> 02:36:34,679
culture and involve it in the culture

3732
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:37,000
and that means to involve sponsors but

3733
02:36:34,680 --> 02:36:39,960
they have to be very specific sponsors

3734
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:42,439
it can't just be you know oh the biggest

3735
02:36:39,959 --> 02:36:44,559
Dabber producer it's like no let's let's

3736
02:36:42,439 --> 02:36:46,359
look at Mystic Timbers which is one of

3737
02:36:44,559 --> 02:36:47,639
the longest sitting you know dab

3738
02:36:46,359 --> 02:36:49,040
producers that has that is a

3739
02:36:47,639 --> 02:36:50,920
family-owned company and all these

3740
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:54,520
different things go into selecting the

3741
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:56,040
sponsors all the way down into then uh

3742
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:59,680
you start moving through the process

3743
02:36:56,040 --> 02:37:02,560
what we introduced uh is we do the lists

3744
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:05,479
early so the list of makers we get that

3745
02:37:02,559 --> 02:37:07,199
decided on as early as possible you know

3746
02:37:05,478 --> 02:37:08,920
as the year's kind of maturing we're

3747
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:10,520
we're already sitting there doing posts

3748
02:37:08,920 --> 02:37:12,000
and doing stuff to figure out that list

3749
02:37:10,520 --> 02:37:13,800
and who's going to be involved we're

3750
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:16,719
looking at the winners of other events

3751
02:37:13,799 --> 02:37:18,840
other things like that qualifiers uh and

3752
02:37:16,719 --> 02:37:22,000
then being able to put them on the list

3753
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:24,920
second is uh the guest list or the

3754
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:27,840
attendee list and half of the first

3755
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:30,520
night dinner list is really the guest of

3756
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:32,239
the maker so you have 40 makers then

3757
02:37:30,520 --> 02:37:34,760
those 40 makers get a guest which puts

3758
02:37:32,239 --> 02:37:36,719
an 80 person guest list up uh we only

3759
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:39,439
have 150 people the first night so we

3760
02:37:36,719 --> 02:37:41,239
have about 70 people that then are

3761
02:37:39,439 --> 02:37:43,680
coming in at an attendee you know a

3762
02:37:41,239 --> 02:37:46,520
two-day attendee list the way we build

3763
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:48,318
that list is the same way we start early

3764
02:37:46,520 --> 02:37:51,120
and we're putting people in there that

3765
02:37:48,318 --> 02:37:53,199
are um you know the it's mainly the

3766
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:55,279
owners of some of these sponsors the

3767
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:57,760
biggest sponsors the and you know that

3768
02:37:55,279 --> 02:38:00,560
fit really well with the culture or uh

3769
02:37:57,760 --> 02:38:03,040
other you know producers manufacturers

3770
02:38:00,559 --> 02:38:04,559
that don't enter contests but they're

3771
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:06,240
definitely a big part of the culture

3772
02:38:04,559 --> 02:38:08,039
from the you know product side to the

3773
02:38:06,239 --> 02:38:10,239
merch side to whatever it might be

3774
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:11,720
artists other people that just are

3775
02:38:10,239 --> 02:38:13,959
really part of the culture but then the

3776
02:38:11,719 --> 02:38:16,599
second qualifier for that person is do

3777
02:38:13,959 --> 02:38:19,239
they consume a lot of hash

3778
02:38:16,600 --> 02:38:21,840
because this is this isn't just you know

3779
02:38:19,239 --> 02:38:24,439
it's not to say that any event is just

3780
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:27,359
but you know this isn't a small event

3781
02:38:24,439 --> 02:38:28,920
it's over $100,000 in production there's

3782
02:38:27,359 --> 02:38:30,600
a lot that goes into it and those

3783
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:32,600
sponsors make that possible so we want

3784
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:34,600
to make sure that the experience for

3785
02:38:32,600 --> 02:38:36,520
every single attendee from the maker all

3786
02:38:34,600 --> 02:38:39,040
the way down to the you know the second

3787
02:38:36,520 --> 02:38:42,040
Day brunch attendee get you know has a

3788
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:42,040
really

3789
02:38:54,398 --> 02:38:59,159
you go up to the bar and you say hey I'd

3790
02:38:56,600 --> 02:39:01,239
like to sample from the menu or sample

3791
02:38:59,159 --> 02:39:03,478
from the entries and it's just a quick

3792
02:39:01,239 --> 02:39:05,398
here you go here's the next five or six

3793
02:39:03,478 --> 02:39:07,959
entries to try and you know those are

3794
02:39:05,398 --> 02:39:09,159
quarter gram entry you know uh servings

3795
02:39:07,959 --> 02:39:11,119
but there's enough to go back and sit

3796
02:39:09,159 --> 02:39:12,840
down and try some stuff and mosy back up

3797
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:15,079
to the line and get some more and have

3798
02:39:12,840 --> 02:39:17,000
that real open feel like when I went to

3799
02:39:15,079 --> 02:39:18,920
Legends that's how it was we walked up

3800
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:20,359
and there was stuff on the table and I

3801
02:39:18,920 --> 02:39:21,478
cut a little piece of this and pulled a

3802
02:39:20,359 --> 02:39:23,159
little piece of that put on a paper

3803
02:39:21,478 --> 02:39:24,719
plate and circled and you know did the

3804
02:39:23,159 --> 02:39:26,920
whole dance and did that and kind of got

3805
02:39:24,719 --> 02:39:29,559
to experience the product with the

3806
02:39:26,920 --> 02:39:31,920
people you could then sit down next to

3807
02:39:29,559 --> 02:39:33,799
you know whoever and say hey like man

3808
02:39:31,920 --> 02:39:35,439
this is awesome like and it was that's

3809
02:39:33,799 --> 02:39:38,039
the same experience that we're trying to

3810
02:39:35,439 --> 02:39:40,318
create so the can the hash is all

3811
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:41,920
dispersed that way the makers get a kit

3812
02:39:40,318 --> 02:39:46,000
and then the makers have access to a

3813
02:39:41,920 --> 02:39:47,879
half gram um uh entry size so it's it's

3814
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:50,879
we keep the bar that way there's there's

3815
02:39:47,879 --> 02:39:53,478
a lanyard everything this year uh

3816
02:39:50,879 --> 02:39:55,159
because we added judging we've we have a

3817
02:39:53,478 --> 02:39:57,760
blockchain that we created with the

3818
02:39:55,159 --> 02:39:59,680
partnership uh that's on you know on the

3819
02:39:57,760 --> 02:40:01,680
web 3 have our own blockchain our own

3820
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:03,000
coin there's a dow everything that

3821
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:06,000
exists there and it's all for the

3822
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:08,040
hashing glass community so we use that

3823
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:11,200
and created a format so that we can have

3824
02:40:08,040 --> 02:40:12,920
all of our judging on web 3 uh it's all

3825
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:14,200
transparent we can publish it after

3826
02:40:12,920 --> 02:40:16,600
everyone can look at it and see who

3827
02:40:14,200 --> 02:40:18,359
judged and and what they judged uh and

3828
02:40:16,600 --> 02:40:21,318
then that way it's a system that we can

3829
02:40:18,359 --> 02:40:23,680
then you know Legends Marcus and myself

3830
02:40:21,318 --> 02:40:25,119
can turn to anyone else and Dave and we

3831
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:26,720
could turn and say hey here's our

3832
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:28,920
platform you know to Emerald cup or

3833
02:40:26,719 --> 02:40:30,358
anyone else you can use this you're

3834
02:40:28,920 --> 02:40:32,200
you're the person who's using it just

3835
02:40:30,359 --> 02:40:35,279
goes into their phone uses the sliding

3836
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:37,640
scale and gets to fine-tune the actual

3837
02:40:35,279 --> 02:40:40,640
judging so it eliminates more more

3838
02:40:37,639 --> 02:40:42,439
possibility of ties and things like that

3839
02:40:40,639 --> 02:40:44,478
uh so it's we built a system it's on

3840
02:40:42,439 --> 02:40:47,120
your phone it's completely secure it's

3841
02:40:44,478 --> 02:40:48,760
100% publishable it's very transparent

3842
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:51,359
so that's another part that we've kind

3843
02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:53,960
of added this year is the judging and

3844
02:40:51,359 --> 02:40:55,520
that's why the second day exists um but

3845
02:40:53,959 --> 02:40:57,559
only the makers will judge and they'll

3846
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:59,640
judge one another that's best way to do

3847
02:40:57,559 --> 02:41:02,239
it because it eliminates any issue of

3848
02:40:59,639 --> 02:41:05,920
like you know a coup that's all voting

3849
02:41:02,239 --> 02:41:08,079
for soand so for some reason so it's um

3850
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:10,040
I think it's going to be uh you know

3851
02:41:08,079 --> 02:41:12,680
it's bigger this year it's much larger

3852
02:41:10,040 --> 02:41:16,840
it's a 400 person venue um but we'll

3853
02:41:12,680 --> 02:41:18,680
only have 250 or 275 people there Max um

3854
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:21,000
which is you know gives us much more

3855
02:41:18,680 --> 02:41:23,079
room for for you know our sponsors to

3856
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:24,359
have booths outside and the outside has

3857
02:41:23,079 --> 02:41:26,760
more of a you know a little bit of a

3858
02:41:24,359 --> 02:41:29,239
trade show feel but then the inside has

3859
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:32,040
more of an intimate seating very

3860
02:41:29,239 --> 02:41:33,600
comfortable large farm tables uh you

3861
02:41:32,040 --> 02:41:35,279
know we feel like that's the most sturdy

3862
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:37,040
table that we can get the largest

3863
02:41:35,279 --> 02:41:39,640
seating space we can have together

3864
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:41,279
there's no ropes there's no excluded se

3865
02:41:39,639 --> 02:41:43,000
you know sections that are roped off or

3866
02:41:41,279 --> 02:41:46,319
anything like that everyone's there

3867
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:48,120
together uh the only only specific area

3868
02:41:46,318 --> 02:41:50,039
for seating is the uh the sponsor

3869
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:52,079
seating area and that's closer to the

3870
02:41:50,040 --> 02:41:54,040
outside so that those guys are able to

3871
02:41:52,079 --> 02:41:56,719
to get more quickly in and out and enjoy

3872
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:59,680
the experience as well so uh you know we

3873
02:41:56,719 --> 02:42:02,000
have the the lanyards and uh the

3874
02:41:59,680 --> 02:42:04,159
laminates this year again and we'll

3875
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:07,000
qualify the different uh you know

3876
02:42:04,159 --> 02:42:10,000
attendees with those as well as you know

3877
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:12,200
now your ticket is an nft it will be on

3878
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:13,680
your phone through a Kepler wallet and

3879
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:16,240
you'll show that when you come in and

3880
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:17,639
then that qualifies who the person is uh

3881
02:42:16,239 --> 02:42:20,079
what they're there for whether they're

3882
02:42:17,639 --> 02:42:23,680
going to be a judge

3883
02:42:20,079 --> 02:42:23,680
and then also oh go

3884
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:28,639
ahead Oh I thought someone was saying

3885
02:42:25,959 --> 02:42:31,478
something um but yeah that's that's the

3886
02:42:28,639 --> 02:42:33,239
uh I would add something Addison um what

3887
02:42:31,478 --> 02:42:36,079
what you guys are doing is a lot harder

3888
02:42:33,239 --> 02:42:38,398
than what I did because I did Legends uh

3889
02:42:36,079 --> 02:42:41,318
from this purely heart place it came

3890
02:42:38,398 --> 02:42:43,000
from this pure efficient AOS place which

3891
02:42:41,318 --> 02:42:46,398
I don't doubt were still coming from

3892
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:48,520
that same place but to monetize it was

3893
02:42:46,398 --> 02:42:50,239
the was the the the thing I was just

3894
02:42:48,520 --> 02:42:51,960
always too AF afraid to do and when we

3895
02:42:50,239 --> 02:42:54,119
had our conversation about like look

3896
02:42:51,959 --> 02:42:55,719
like you can't just keep paying for this

3897
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:57,240
out of your pocket dude like this is

3898
02:42:55,719 --> 02:42:58,719
[ __ ] mental like people want to come

3899
02:42:57,239 --> 02:43:00,639
to this event they want to enjoy the

3900
02:42:58,719 --> 02:43:02,559
hash they want to popularize new strains

3901
02:43:00,639 --> 02:43:04,039
and flavors they want to have this

3902
02:43:02,559 --> 02:43:05,519
experience in the culture and one of the

3903
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:07,600
things you didn't really talk about

3904
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:09,399
because you were so you know into

3905
02:43:07,600 --> 02:43:11,040
talking about this future which is

3906
02:43:09,398 --> 02:43:13,439
actually pretty incredible the Kepler

3907
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:15,359
wallet and the nft and the whole way the

3908
02:43:13,439 --> 02:43:18,639
transparency of the competition works so

3909
02:43:15,359 --> 02:43:20,479
you take away that sort of Temptation of

3910
02:43:18,639 --> 02:43:21,920
like oh let's just sell the first pray

3911
02:43:20,478 --> 02:43:23,519
you know like what people inevitably do

3912
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:25,840
when they build something big right you

3913
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:27,520
have to like preserve it in in the early

3914
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:29,559
days and the foundation of it to make

3915
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:31,200
sure that it doesn't get bastardized

3916
02:43:29,559 --> 02:43:32,478
which is a very hard thing and I'm sure

3917
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:33,960
there's already people who went to the

3918
02:43:32,478 --> 02:43:35,398
original Legends who are like oh they

3919
02:43:33,959 --> 02:43:37,159
took sponsorships and you now you're

3920
02:43:35,398 --> 02:43:39,639
allowing cameras it's just not the same

3921
02:43:37,159 --> 02:43:41,840
anymore no it's not the same anymore but

3922
02:43:39,639 --> 02:43:43,559
it is same same but different if you've

3923
02:43:41,840 --> 02:43:46,760
ever been to Thailand it's still going

3924
02:43:43,559 --> 02:43:48,318
to have its soul of Legends but we're

3925
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:50,000
going to allow more people to be

3926
02:43:48,318 --> 02:43:52,079
involved and we're it's just like the

3927
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:54,840
same thing and people always say oh it's

3928
02:43:52,079 --> 02:43:56,559
selling out well it's the it's the at

3929
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:58,478
one point in time you have to monetize

3930
02:43:56,559 --> 02:44:00,799
it and get it do you want to just have

3931
02:43:58,478 --> 02:44:03,039
Legends with 40 people every year or do

3932
02:44:00,799 --> 02:44:04,759
you want to do Legends where maybe some

3933
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:06,600
thousands of people can experience it do

3934
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:08,800
you want to make it so you know you're

3935
02:44:06,600 --> 02:44:10,359
growing weed for like the 10 people in

3936
02:44:08,799 --> 02:44:11,920
your neighborhood or do you want to make

3937
02:44:10,359 --> 02:44:13,640
it so you could touch people on the

3938
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:16,279
other side of the country to taste your

3939
02:44:13,639 --> 02:44:17,879
flavors as well so this is kind of the

3940
02:44:16,279 --> 02:44:19,880
difficulty as we get older we come from

3941
02:44:17,879 --> 02:44:21,278
The Roots where all these activists and

3942
02:44:19,879 --> 02:44:22,839
we're fighting and fighting and fighting

3943
02:44:21,279 --> 02:44:24,960
and then suddenly one day you realize oh

3944
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:27,079
my gosh I'm running a business and it's

3945
02:44:24,959 --> 02:44:28,239
Incorporated and there's I've got a you

3946
02:44:27,079 --> 02:44:30,840
know I've got to do all of these

3947
02:44:28,239 --> 02:44:34,000
different things to preserve it uh it

3948
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:36,200
it's an interesting kind of situation

3949
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:38,520
but I I feel that Legends is in good

3950
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:41,240
hands with with you guys and with myself

3951
02:44:38,520 --> 02:44:44,040
as well and I'm just excited that uh you

3952
02:44:41,239 --> 02:44:46,159
know recently uh Bubba Cole from uh

3953
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:48,800
Instagram uh hit me up and started

3954
02:44:46,159 --> 02:44:49,840
sending me pictures from Afghanistan and

3955
02:44:48,799 --> 02:44:53,358
my

3956
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:54,960
Frozen no you're good okay and started

3957
02:44:53,359 --> 02:44:56,439
and and he's he said I've been writing

3958
02:44:54,959 --> 02:44:58,759
all these articles about preserving the

3959
02:44:56,439 --> 02:45:00,520
culture in Afghanistan and but the

3960
02:44:58,760 --> 02:45:02,880
Taliban is searching for me and I had to

3961
02:45:00,520 --> 02:45:04,640
leave the country and I thought whoa so

3962
02:45:02,879 --> 02:45:07,119
this is another part of Legends The

3963
02:45:04,639 --> 02:45:08,559
Roots like so I say well can we publish

3964
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:10,640
some of your stories can we make some

3965
02:45:08,559 --> 02:45:14,000
placards for Legends of hash with your

3966
02:45:10,639 --> 02:45:16,639
words can we use some of your pictures

3967
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:19,559
and you know he's just like yes of

3968
02:45:16,639 --> 02:45:21,799
course like yes I want I want that so

3969
02:45:19,559 --> 02:45:24,639
um the circle of hashish that I sent

3970
02:45:21,799 --> 02:45:26,559
Addison the other day in Afghanistan um

3971
02:45:24,639 --> 02:45:28,799
he sent me this photo just to share it

3972
02:45:26,559 --> 02:45:30,119
really quick and I'm hoping on getting

3973
02:45:28,799 --> 02:45:32,799
some of these

3974
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:35,880
photographs um you know this is the this

3975
02:45:32,799 --> 02:45:37,679
is the circle of hashish babako like

3976
02:45:35,879 --> 02:45:39,639
taken last year in Afghanistan where

3977
02:45:37,680 --> 02:45:42,398
they gather and join and they smoke all

3978
02:45:39,639 --> 02:45:45,358
this hash inside this little chamber and

3979
02:45:42,398 --> 02:45:47,119
so I love the idea that here's this guy

3980
02:45:45,359 --> 02:45:49,079
he's got Instagram but he's looking for

3981
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:51,000
a place to preserve these stories and

3982
02:45:49,079 --> 02:45:52,000
get these photos seen by a group of

3983
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:54,840
people that actually have an

3984
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:57,559
appreciation for hashish and here it is

3985
02:45:54,840 --> 02:46:00,600
going to be Legends Legends of hash like

3986
02:45:57,559 --> 02:46:03,079
the event is more than just some event

3987
02:46:00,600 --> 02:46:06,720
it's also the preservation of our

3988
02:46:03,079 --> 02:46:08,318
culture and the cultures of hashish and

3989
02:46:06,719 --> 02:46:09,920
we can't you know it's not about picking

3990
02:46:08,318 --> 02:46:11,760
one or the other it's about preserving

3991
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:14,840
them all in the most authentic way that

3992
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:17,279
we can while contining continuing to

3993
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:20,159
grow that culture in the world we live

3994
02:46:17,279 --> 02:46:22,520
in today and honoring and and praising

3995
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:24,520
the genetics and The Growers who who

3996
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:27,439
spend their time and spend months and

3997
02:46:24,520 --> 02:46:29,960
months of variables uh to produce these

3998
02:46:27,439 --> 02:46:32,479
incredible flavors for the hash makers

3999
02:46:29,959 --> 02:46:35,559
to then come along and process with the

4000
02:46:32,478 --> 02:46:38,679
utmost care and love and gentleness to

4001
02:46:35,559 --> 02:46:40,478
bring to an event I mean a hash bar that

4002
02:46:38,680 --> 02:46:42,120
you can walk up to from the menu and

4003
02:46:40,478 --> 02:46:43,398
just oh give me a quarter gram of that

4004
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:46,399
and a quarter gram of this and give me

4005
02:46:43,398 --> 02:46:48,559
two quar grams of that like that is that

4006
02:46:46,398 --> 02:46:50,159
is something I want to see more of so if

4007
02:46:48,559 --> 02:46:52,039
you have anything else to say Addison

4008
02:46:50,159 --> 02:46:54,439
feel free to say it but I've said my

4009
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:55,720
piece well you can you can see more of

4010
02:46:54,439 --> 02:46:59,600
it I have a ticket for you if you want

4011
02:46:55,719 --> 02:47:01,760
to come down um of course so that would

4012
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:03,760
be awesome to have I mean I know you

4013
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:05,760
know maybe like put a m just cut a

4014
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:10,478
mustache or something I think we can get

4015
02:47:05,760 --> 02:47:10,478
you down buddy I think we can do it

4016
02:47:24,840 --> 02:47:27,880
I just just just that was just a

4017
02:47:26,398 --> 02:47:29,719
question and then uh secondly and more

4018
02:47:27,879 --> 02:47:31,959
importantly how do how does one get a

4019
02:47:29,719 --> 02:47:33,278
judging uh spot uh if it's not if

4020
02:47:31,959 --> 02:47:34,079
they're not a maker or if should I just

4021
02:47:33,279 --> 02:47:37,359
start

4022
02:47:34,079 --> 02:47:39,600
making so the the there's five so

4023
02:47:37,359 --> 02:47:42,359
whatever I think we're we're never gonna

4024
02:47:39,600 --> 02:47:45,318
go above 40 I think 40 is like a great

4025
02:47:42,359 --> 02:47:48,359
way to have the room we may go less NE

4026
02:47:45,318 --> 02:47:50,359
definitely not more um so I think it's

4027
02:47:48,359 --> 02:47:53,079
you know that that's a good number so

4028
02:47:50,359 --> 02:47:55,040
because it's a good number because it

4029
02:47:53,079 --> 02:47:57,680
sort of hits there we want to we want to

4030
02:47:55,040 --> 02:48:00,760
make that an odd number so we add five

4031
02:47:57,680 --> 02:48:03,439
judges that we consider respected by the

4032
02:48:00,760 --> 02:48:04,920
40 makers um guys that really know their

4033
02:48:03,439 --> 02:48:06,040
[ __ ] that are that are kind of what

4034
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:08,200
you're talking about like not

4035
02:48:06,040 --> 02:48:10,680
necessarily the maker but maybe Scott

4036
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:13,560
deppy you know and not necessarily the

4037
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:15,559
maker but maybe JP Toro and you know lot

4038
02:48:13,559 --> 02:48:17,199
comedy guys that smoke a lot of hash and

4039
02:48:15,559 --> 02:48:18,398
have smoked hash and know the culture

4040
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:19,319
and know all the makers and know

4041
02:48:18,398 --> 02:48:21,199
everybody

4042
02:48:19,318 --> 02:48:25,519
and can kind of sit in that room and

4043
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:27,680
again 60 entries in 21 hours and being

4044
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:29,960
able to give your your full opinion on

4045
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:33,880
those 60 however that may be whatever

4046
02:48:29,959 --> 02:48:35,839
process you use um but I I look at it as

4047
02:48:33,879 --> 02:48:39,000
familiarity like all of the people that

4048
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:41,559
are judging are incredibly familiar with

4049
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:43,239
the entire process they dab you know

4050
02:48:41,559 --> 02:48:45,840
they're dabbing three and a half grams a

4051
02:48:43,239 --> 02:48:47,520
day three grams a day two grams a day on

4052
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:49,279
The Daily that's just part of what

4053
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:51,079
they're putting into themselves

4054
02:48:49,279 --> 02:48:53,560
and and how much exposure they have to

4055
02:48:51,079 --> 02:48:55,920
hash and that's kind of why that Maker

4056
02:48:53,559 --> 02:48:57,760
list that judge list is so small that

4057
02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:59,760
you have to have that exposure in order

4058
02:48:57,760 --> 02:49:01,960
to to be able to do that to order in

4059
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:03,359
order to pull it off and and what's

4060
02:49:01,959 --> 02:49:05,919
crazy about this is I've seen this

4061
02:49:03,359 --> 02:49:09,600
multiple times before when it's honestly

4062
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:12,279
done and you look at the results it's

4063
02:49:09,600 --> 02:49:14,000
it's across the board you can see it

4064
02:49:12,279 --> 02:49:15,079
sort of uniformally if you pick the

4065
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:17,520
right judges you could see it

4066
02:49:15,079 --> 02:49:18,879
uniformally in those judges where

4067
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:20,319
they're all you know there some someone

4068
02:49:18,879 --> 02:49:22,000
may bring something from Left Field here

4069
02:49:20,318 --> 02:49:23,719
and there but you can tell that

4070
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:25,359
nothing's fixed and you're like oh okay

4071
02:49:23,719 --> 02:49:28,278
look at these oh [ __ ] look at the

4072
02:49:25,359 --> 02:49:31,238
judging it actually is favoring and a

4073
02:49:28,279 --> 02:49:33,279
favoring and not favoring the entries

4074
02:49:31,238 --> 02:49:34,959
that came in you can see that in in a

4075
02:49:33,279 --> 02:49:36,319
lot of it and that means that you picked

4076
02:49:34,959 --> 02:49:38,959
the right kind of judges and you had

4077
02:49:36,318 --> 02:49:41,079
that and there's you know there's 18

4078
02:49:38,959 --> 02:49:43,159
months of thought that goes into and

4079
02:49:41,079 --> 02:49:44,719
then the returning and kind of putting

4080
02:49:43,159 --> 02:49:47,439
together the process from what we did

4081
02:49:44,719 --> 02:49:49,519
last year we took feedback from all of

4082
02:49:47,439 --> 02:49:52,200
the makers that came last year year and

4083
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:53,760
then we said okay can we Implement these

4084
02:49:52,200 --> 02:49:56,439
things and still keep it in line with

4085
02:49:53,760 --> 02:49:59,359
culture while we monetize it while we

4086
02:49:56,439 --> 02:50:01,159
you know continue to give thanks back to

4087
02:49:59,359 --> 02:50:03,279
and telling the story of hashish and the

4088
02:50:01,159 --> 02:50:05,520
history of it you know how do we do that

4089
02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:07,560
and you know it's it's even the way we

4090
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:10,840
we put the tickets out you know the the

4091
02:50:07,559 --> 02:50:12,359
second day the brunch has 75 tickets

4092
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:14,079
that can go out for that day well that

4093
02:50:12,359 --> 02:50:15,520
gives us an opportunity now to bring in

4094
02:50:14,079 --> 02:50:18,318
makers that we weren't able to get on

4095
02:50:15,520 --> 02:50:20,680
the list to bring in glass shop owners

4096
02:50:18,318 --> 02:50:22,398
that really help push the culture by

4097
02:50:20,680 --> 02:50:24,600
selling the glass and putting that stuff

4098
02:50:22,398 --> 02:50:25,799
out and consuming a lot of hash like

4099
02:50:24,600 --> 02:50:27,720
every single person that's there

4100
02:50:25,799 --> 02:50:30,238
consumes a lot of hash there's no

4101
02:50:27,719 --> 02:50:32,438
question about that all 250 people are

4102
02:50:30,238 --> 02:50:34,159
hand selected you know we go through and

4103
02:50:32,439 --> 02:50:36,159
look at every single person we're either

4104
02:50:34,159 --> 02:50:38,119
putting their name on the list to start

4105
02:50:36,159 --> 02:50:40,200
or we're getting their name and then

4106
02:50:38,120 --> 02:50:43,040
reviewing it and kind of vetting it and

4107
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:45,640
putting it in so it's like Marcus says

4108
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:48,840
it's it's a it's a sifting through the

4109
02:50:45,639 --> 02:50:51,840
heads of all these people and then

4110
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:54,600
putting together that that perfect 90

4111
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:56,559
120 that's just kind of oh [ __ ] you know

4112
02:50:54,600 --> 02:51:00,120
and that's when when we're putting it

4113
02:50:56,559 --> 02:51:02,159
together our whole you know like okr

4114
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:04,399
like outcomes and key results what we're

4115
02:51:02,159 --> 02:51:05,879
really looking for is for that person to

4116
02:51:04,398 --> 02:51:07,358
stand there in the room for any any

4117
02:51:05,879 --> 02:51:09,438
person in the room to walk in and be

4118
02:51:07,359 --> 02:51:11,720
standing at any point and look around

4119
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:14,439
and just and take it in and be like you

4120
02:51:11,719 --> 02:51:16,559
got to be [ __ ] kidding like how the

4121
02:51:14,439 --> 02:51:18,720
[ __ ] is this even possible now like you

4122
02:51:16,559 --> 02:51:22,119
know from the place that they get to sit

4123
02:51:18,719 --> 02:51:24,959
the entire design of of the motif that's

4124
02:51:22,120 --> 02:51:27,560
there it's all Moroccan all you know

4125
02:51:24,959 --> 02:51:29,159
flowing curtains and pillows and floor

4126
02:51:27,559 --> 02:51:31,840
seating all these different things and

4127
02:51:29,159 --> 02:51:34,559
lamps and lighting and everything is all

4128
02:51:31,840 --> 02:51:36,318
to bring that to life um in this large

4129
02:51:34,559 --> 02:51:39,159
space indoor and outdoor like the

4130
02:51:36,318 --> 02:51:41,079
outdoor tents have rugs and and other

4131
02:51:39,159 --> 02:51:43,520
stuff laid down and seating so it's

4132
02:51:41,079 --> 02:51:44,760
really you know very very solid

4133
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:46,920
experience and the food you know the

4134
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:50,159

lighting up a space and then the r and

4176

4305
02:58:03,238 --> 02:58:06,920

4309
02:58:11,439 --> 02:58:16,398
doing things that can help push the hash

4310
02:58:14,359 --> 02:58:18,559
you know culture in each area that they

4311

day and it was like yeah we you know

4317
02:58:29,879 --> 02:58:32,839
Legends of hash cares more about the

4318
02:58:31,520 --> 02:58:35,000
color of your hash than the color of

4319
02:58:32,840 --> 02:58:37,559
your skin it's like you know it's just a

4320
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:39,680
straight up like none of that stuff you

4321
02:58:37,559 --> 02:58:41,719
know it should be in the room it's not a

4322
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:43,318
part of like dividing anybody it's

4323
02:58:41,719 --> 02:58:46,079
really about bringing everybody together

4324
02:58:43,318 --> 02:58:48,840
and saying like hey we we really don't

4325
02:58:46,079 --> 02:58:51,120
care about anything other than like are

4326
02:58:48,840 --> 02:58:54,359
you is it a good person that loves hash

4327
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:56,079
that can you know you know wants to dab

4328
02:58:54,359 --> 02:58:58,079
and wants to enjoy the space and wants

4329
02:58:56,079 --> 02:58:59,959
to enjoy other people there's you know

4330
02:58:58,079 --> 02:59:01,639
there's going to be vegans in the room

4331
02:58:59,959 --> 02:59:03,639
there's vegetarians in the room and

4332
02:59:01,639 --> 02:59:06,079
there's meat eaters in the room there's

4333
02:59:03,639 --> 02:59:08,199
you know sativa lovers and Inda lovers

4334
02:59:06,079 --> 02:59:10,600
and you know there may be a guy firing

4335
02:59:08,200 --> 02:59:12,439
up some BHL you never know it's like

4336
02:59:10,600 --> 02:59:15,399
everyone's welcome like one thing we did

4337
02:59:12,439 --> 02:59:18,120
do this year is we're making large signs

4338
02:59:15,398 --> 02:59:20,199
and any tobacco smoke or flower smoke is

4339
02:59:18,120 --> 02:59:21,960
to be done outside uh the reason for

4340
02:59:20,200 --> 02:59:23,960
that is so we can preserve that indoor

4341
02:59:21,959 --> 02:59:25,679
space that we have uh where we're all

4342
02:59:23,959 --> 02:59:27,959
going to be dabbing anyway already which

4343
02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:31,318
has ventilation we just don't want to

4344
02:59:27,959 --> 02:59:33,679
bring home with us uh that sort of you

4345
02:59:31,318 --> 02:59:36,079
know extra you know carbon and other

4346
02:59:33,680 --> 02:59:37,600
components when we're judging uh in the

4347
02:59:36,079 --> 02:59:38,719
room it's I think it's a lot better to

4348
02:59:37,600 --> 02:59:41,800
not have that in the room if you're

4349
02:59:38,719 --> 02:59:43,959
judging so uh that's that's one thing uh

4350
02:59:41,799 --> 02:59:45,519
if you go outside parts per billion

4351
02:59:43,959 --> 02:59:46,679
breaks it up and you can probably not

4352
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:49,479
have an issue with it but when you're

4353
02:59:46,680 --> 02:59:51,559
inside in inside Space we think it's uh

4354
02:59:49,478 --> 02:59:53,760
you know gives a lot more to your pallet

4355
02:59:51,559 --> 02:59:55,639
and a lot more to what's happening so uh

4356
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:57,760
there'll be a lot of glass there like

4357
02:59:55,639 --> 03:00:00,519
that's another big part big push last

4358
02:59:57,760 --> 03:00:02,760
year was for glass and breeders uh and

4359
03:00:00,520 --> 03:00:04,319
Farmers this year we're adding and

4360
03:00:02,760 --> 03:00:06,639
pushing a little harder with the glass

4361
03:00:04,318 --> 03:00:08,719
side and and Scott deppy motherships our

4362
03:00:06,639 --> 03:00:10,439
largest sponsor and they're coming in

4363
03:00:08,719 --> 03:00:12,719
and kind of bringing some of the glass

4364
03:00:10,439 --> 03:00:14,398
industry in with us this year so they've

4365
03:00:12,719 --> 03:00:17,679
invited some special guests that'll be

4366
03:00:14,398 --> 03:00:19,439
there with us both days um so it's kind

4367
03:00:17,680 --> 03:00:20,639
of you know we feel like it's a the

4368
03:00:19,439 --> 03:00:24,639
right room of

4369
03:00:20,639 --> 03:00:27,079
people um pretty chadis to say the least

4370
03:00:24,639 --> 03:00:29,879
that it'll be uh Chad free Chad free

4371
03:00:27,079 --> 03:00:31,520
zone for the whole place for everyone um

4372
03:00:29,879 --> 03:00:33,238
and and I say that in a joking way too

4373
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:36,600
but it's definitely like

4374
03:00:33,238 --> 03:00:39,478
uh they won't survive it's like you know

4375
03:00:36,600 --> 03:00:42,000
the somebody who's not into the culture

4376
03:00:39,478 --> 03:00:44,119
and not a part of this is really just

4377
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:46,600
not going to enjoy it and we've already

4378
03:00:44,120 --> 03:00:48,520
done a hard you know a lot of

4379
03:00:46,600 --> 03:00:50,040
push oh

4380
03:00:48,520 --> 03:00:52,279
we've already made a you know made

4381
03:00:50,040 --> 03:00:54,720
certain that like the list is is a

4382
03:00:52,279 --> 03:00:57,120
select amount of people that we can have

4383
03:00:54,719 --> 03:00:59,119
there in in different uh you know in

4384
03:00:57,120 --> 03:01:02,319
different levels too because the second

4385
03:00:59,120 --> 03:01:03,720
day we we love that because now if we're

4386
03:01:02,318 --> 03:01:05,079
not able to bring a maker in and put

4387
03:01:03,719 --> 03:01:07,639
them on that list which is really hard

4388
03:01:05,079 --> 03:01:09,238
to do it's only 40 makers now we have

4389
03:01:07,639 --> 03:01:11,079
the opportunity to invite them at least

4390
03:01:09,238 --> 03:01:12,359
to come for the brunch they can get to

4391
03:01:11,079 --> 03:01:14,680
see what it's all about they can still

4392
03:01:12,359 --> 03:01:16,880
share their hash and see everybody and

4393
03:01:14,680 --> 03:01:18,159
and be a part of it which is cool and

4394
03:01:16,879 --> 03:01:20,920
and you know that makes a big big

4395
03:01:18,159 --> 03:01:22,760
difference for uh for helping us make a

4396
03:01:20,920 --> 03:01:26,840
decision for next year on who's on the

4397
03:01:22,760 --> 03:01:26,840
list oh is that is that a

4398
03:01:26,959 --> 03:01:31,278
marshmallow that looks pretty but yeah

4399
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:33,200
we could select who's on that list for

4400
03:01:31,279 --> 03:01:34,439
next year and then um and then just get

4401
03:01:33,200 --> 03:01:36,600
to know the makers a little more

4402
03:01:34,439 --> 03:01:38,439
depending on who they are uh I'm most

4403
03:01:36,600 --> 03:01:40,000
excited about you know if you're an East

4404
03:01:38,439 --> 03:01:42,398
Coast ticket holder and you're getting

4405
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:43,879
to come out from the east coast and come

4406
03:01:42,398 --> 03:01:45,680
come into California which is great

4407
03:01:43,879 --> 03:01:47,599
weather in December and just kind of

4408
03:01:45,680 --> 03:01:48,559
extend the the good weather and the Good

4409
03:01:47,600 --> 03:01:50,720
Vibes

4410
03:01:48,559 --> 03:01:52,719
and get a good time in California if

4411
03:01:50,719 --> 03:01:54,599
you're enjoying that event and you know

4412
03:01:52,719 --> 03:01:56,760
going there you're getting to be in the

4413
03:01:54,600 --> 03:01:59,279
room with with you know 60 entries from

4414
03:01:56,760 --> 03:02:00,920
these 40 makers that you would never see

4415
03:01:59,279 --> 03:02:04,040
you can easily identify who the makers

4416
03:02:00,920 --> 03:02:05,960
are by the jars um and go up and say hey

4417
03:02:04,040 --> 03:02:08,200
this is great I really love this you

4418
03:02:05,959 --> 03:02:10,599
know like I love your product you know

4419
03:02:08,200 --> 03:02:12,239
like to shake your hand we wanted them

4420
03:02:10,600 --> 03:02:14,439
to be able to get those flowers in the

4421
03:02:12,238 --> 03:02:15,959
room we don't feel like by putting their

4422
03:02:14,439 --> 03:02:18,439
name on the bottom of the jar that it's

4423
03:02:15,959 --> 03:02:19,639
going to affect the group of 40 makers

4424
03:02:18,439 --> 03:02:22,079
they're not going to be impressed with

4425
03:02:19,639 --> 03:02:23,159
the name of another maker and you know

4426
03:02:22,079 --> 03:02:24,238
the fact that they're going to if

4427
03:02:23,159 --> 03:02:26,600
they're going to

4428
03:02:24,238 --> 03:02:28,920
vote you know we we that's another

4429
03:02:26,600 --> 03:02:30,520
conversation too it's like they you know

4430
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:32,318
we're still figuring that part out we

4431
03:02:30,520 --> 03:02:34,238
may make it so that they can't vote for

4432
03:02:32,318 --> 03:02:35,959
themselves they actually have to vote

4433
03:02:34,238 --> 03:02:37,959
for the other makers um and that's

4434
03:02:35,959 --> 03:02:40,839
pretty easily done so we have that

4435
03:02:37,959 --> 03:02:42,438
control in the voting so that it is you

4436
03:02:40,840 --> 03:02:44,359
know like hey we want your opinion on

4437
03:02:42,439 --> 03:02:46,318
this not to vote for yourself

4438
03:02:44,359 --> 03:02:47,880
technically um and I don't know if

4439
03:02:46,318 --> 03:02:49,238
people like or don't like that I just

4440
03:02:47,879 --> 03:02:51,238
just think that it makes it more fair it

4441
03:02:49,238 --> 03:02:53,279
makes it so that every vote is being

4442
03:02:51,238 --> 03:02:55,039
counted technically at that point uh if

4443
03:02:53,279 --> 03:02:57,720
you vote for yourself it's just sort of

4444
03:02:55,040 --> 03:02:58,920
it's expected you're there we know

4445
03:02:57,719 --> 03:03:00,559
you're GNA vote for yourself you're

4446
03:02:58,920 --> 03:03:01,840
already here with us if you voted for

4447
03:03:00,559 --> 03:03:04,278
yourself as soon as you walk through the

4448
03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:07,799
door you know now let's let the judging

4449
03:03:04,279 --> 03:03:11,600
you know let's you know let's see right

4450
03:03:07,799 --> 03:03:13,079
is yeah yeah what's that it's not really

4451
03:03:11,600 --> 03:03:15,960
judging if you're just like hey I'm just

4452
03:03:13,079 --> 03:03:19,200
G to vote for me because you know my St

4453
03:03:15,959 --> 03:03:21,398
you know what I mean I think that's

4454
03:03:19,200 --> 03:03:22,960
it's you want to keep it as have an art

4455
03:03:21,398 --> 03:03:25,398
event where everyone tries everything

4456
03:03:22,959 --> 03:03:26,559
and appreciates each other right yep and

4457
03:03:25,398 --> 03:03:29,159
then you that's what we're trying to

4458
03:03:26,559 --> 03:03:30,959
promote more of too we want to know what

4459
03:03:29,159 --> 03:03:33,279
of the other maker stuff that was

4460
03:03:30,959 --> 03:03:34,919
entered that you like the most we don't

4461
03:03:33,279 --> 03:03:37,479
want to know whether you like your stuff

4462
03:03:34,920 --> 03:03:39,079
the most because we hope that you're

4463
03:03:37,478 --> 03:03:41,199
putting your best foot forward and you

4464
03:03:39,079 --> 03:03:43,680
[ __ ] love what you presented and

4465
03:03:41,200 --> 03:03:45,760
that's already expected so you know and

4466
03:03:43,680 --> 03:03:48,439
and it's it's a great way to really be

4467
03:03:45,760 --> 03:03:51,120
able to um to get in on understanding by

4468
03:03:48,439 --> 03:03:53,079
by letting only the makers be the judges

4469
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:54,760
I think it eliminates anything either I

4470
03:03:53,079 --> 03:03:57,318
mean if every person there was a judge

4471
03:03:54,760 --> 03:03:58,800
every attendee and they got to see which

4472
03:03:57,318 --> 03:04:00,840
which name was on there then it's a

4473
03:03:58,799 --> 03:04:02,799
popularity contest and that's not what

4474
03:04:00,840 --> 03:04:04,600
we're having it's it's not a contest at

4475
03:04:02,799 --> 03:04:07,559
all so it's more of you know a

4476
03:04:04,600 --> 03:04:09,439
competition between makers to be able to

4477
03:04:07,559 --> 03:04:12,079
in their opinion what they think is the

4478
03:04:09,439 --> 03:04:15,559
best you know stuff this year and we do

4479
03:04:12,079 --> 03:04:17,279
have uh a lot of makers that are you

4480
03:04:15,559 --> 03:04:18,238
know from last year's list and then we

4481
03:04:17,279 --> 03:04:20,000
also have

4482
03:04:18,238 --> 03:04:21,680
uh you know a number of makers that are

4483
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:24,359
new for this year that we haven't that

4484
03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:27,760
we've never had before um so it's you

4485
03:04:24,359 --> 03:04:30,399
know it's uh it's definitely going to be

4486
03:04:27,760 --> 03:04:32,680
as Fair as possible as transparent as

4487
03:04:30,398 --> 03:04:34,840
possible um you know even afterwards

4488
03:04:32,680 --> 03:04:38,079
people will be able to look and see what

4489
03:04:34,840 --> 03:04:39,279
what was judged and and how it won um so

4490
03:04:38,079 --> 03:04:41,359
and I think that stuff's great to

4491
03:04:39,279 --> 03:04:42,800
document and have so that you can see it

4492
03:04:41,359 --> 03:04:45,238
and kind of check out what was hot that

4493
03:04:42,799 --> 03:04:48,559
year you know how many how many things

4494
03:04:45,238 --> 03:04:50,478
are belted up or you know or or that and

4495
03:04:48,559 --> 03:04:52,719
and you know it's already it gets really

4496
03:04:50,478 --> 03:04:55,519
exciting at this time of year my taste

4497
03:04:52,719 --> 03:04:57,840
for hash kind of dips because I think my

4498
03:04:55,520 --> 03:05:00,359
my brain knows that all this crazy hash

4499
03:04:57,840 --> 03:05:02,559
is about to come and I sort of get I'm

4500
03:05:00,359 --> 03:05:04,120
like all right I'm just getting high now

4501
03:05:02,559 --> 03:05:06,238
like you know and sort of going through

4502
03:05:04,120 --> 03:05:08,239
the motions because it's it's quite

4503
03:05:06,238 --> 03:05:10,279
overwhelming when you start seeing

4504
03:05:08,238 --> 03:05:12,920
what's coming in what's culturally

4505
03:05:10,279 --> 03:05:14,479
relevant what's kind of brand new that

4506
03:05:12,920 --> 03:05:16,719
just came in this year that's going to

4507
03:05:14,478 --> 03:05:18,159
be getting pushed uh so that's kind of

4508
03:05:16,719 --> 03:05:20,879
like the most exciting part for me is to

4509
03:05:18,159 --> 03:05:26,559
kind of see that stuff but

4510
03:05:20,879 --> 03:05:30,599
yeah bu I I admire that about you so

4511
03:05:26,559 --> 03:05:32,879
much you have no idea I also very much

4512
03:05:30,600 --> 03:05:37,200
at a deep level understand what you're

4513
03:05:32,879 --> 03:05:38,959
going through and so the the the stress

4514
03:05:37,200 --> 03:05:41,680
and everything is absolutely you know

4515
03:05:38,959 --> 03:05:43,799
you have to balance life right as uh

4516
03:05:41,680 --> 03:05:45,600
Johnny V was talking about right yes you

4517
03:05:43,799 --> 03:05:48,358
can have passion and throw everything

4518
03:05:45,600 --> 03:05:51,238
you have in terms of your commitment

4519
03:05:48,359 --> 03:05:53,640
your will your your vision what you want

4520
03:05:51,238 --> 03:05:57,279
to create right what change you want to

4521
03:05:53,639 --> 03:06:01,840
have and make in the future so that um

4522
03:05:57,279 --> 03:06:05,040
it's not about you but it's about the

4523
03:06:01,840 --> 03:06:09,760
legend right what is the

4524
03:06:05,040 --> 03:06:13,640
longterm um impact of your work right so

4525
03:06:09,760 --> 03:06:16,478
I appreciate that so much um I need to

4526
03:06:13,639 --> 03:06:18,238
get a way to get to you and and do this

4527
03:06:16,478 --> 03:06:20,799
um experience

4528
03:06:18,238 --> 03:06:24,840
um and and uh and the reason why I bring

4529
03:06:20,799 --> 03:06:28,318
it up is because um uh I'm running a

4530
03:06:24,840 --> 03:06:32,639
cannabis somal um collector's cup which

4531
03:06:28,318 --> 03:06:34,760
is all about the flower so Legends is

4532
03:06:32,639 --> 03:06:37,639
Hash this is

4533
03:06:34,760 --> 03:06:40,398
about and I know in terms of um

4534
03:06:37,639 --> 03:06:43,000
respecting time from everybody um I'd

4535
03:06:40,398 --> 03:06:45,278
love to just talk about it another time

4536
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:48,238
if you want to you know like get on with

4537
03:06:45,279 --> 03:06:51,159
your day but I'm I'm also here for you

4538
03:06:48,238 --> 03:06:52,520
the one thing I got to say is I just

4539
03:06:51,159 --> 03:06:55,959
came up

4540
03:06:52,520 --> 03:06:59,200
with the the marshmallow ash

4541
03:06:55,959 --> 03:07:01,199
tray seriously it is so cool because I

4542
03:06:59,200 --> 03:07:03,880
didn't have an ashtray and I have kids

4543
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:06,840
so um I was smoking The Joint even when

4544
03:07:03,879 --> 03:07:09,039
you put the the joint on the marshmallow

4545
03:07:06,840 --> 03:07:12,600
it kind of toasts it and it comes it

4546
03:07:09,040 --> 03:07:15,880
releases the sweet Aroma it's so nice

4547
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:19,640
and then you open it because it's sticky

4548
03:07:15,879 --> 03:07:21,559
and then you put the The Joint inside

4549
03:07:19,639 --> 03:07:24,358
and then you close it up and then all

4550
03:07:21,559 --> 03:07:27,439
the all the moisture sorry well yeah

4551
03:07:24,359 --> 03:07:30,520
everything get sucked no smell you can

4552
03:07:27,439 --> 03:07:32,880
just eat it yeah I can eat this end I

4553
03:07:30,520 --> 03:07:34,640
can eat but end yeah you can eat the

4554
03:07:32,879 --> 03:07:36,278
whole thing that's you know you get high

4555
03:07:34,639 --> 03:07:39,680
off of it

4556
03:07:36,279 --> 03:07:43,680
now you know not no no that's not for me

4557
03:07:39,680 --> 03:07:45,760
I don't smoke the filter either um but

4558
03:07:43,680 --> 03:07:48,120
yeah yeah so I that I think that's so

4559
03:07:45,760 --> 03:07:52,238
awesome um man

4560
03:07:48,120 --> 03:07:55,800
uh and what one thing I ask from any of

4561
03:07:52,238 --> 03:07:58,079
you is the next time you smoke flour

4562
03:07:55,799 --> 03:08:00,679
okay if you don't smoke flour I get it

4563
03:07:58,079 --> 03:08:03,719
if I had the ability to not smoke flour

4564
03:08:00,680 --> 03:08:07,600
then um you know I would be smoking like

4565
03:08:03,719 --> 03:08:09,959
full melt all day any day right but um

4566
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:12,880
go to my website which I'll send a link

4567
03:08:09,959 --> 03:08:15,278
in and grade A flour and I'm trying to

4568
03:08:12,879 --> 03:08:19,799
get your input for a particular flower

4569
03:08:15,279 --> 03:08:22,960
and how you grade it and um if we find

4570
03:08:19,799 --> 03:08:25,159
alignment because calibration is so

4571
03:08:22,959 --> 03:08:27,278
important the experience that you have

4572
03:08:25,159 --> 03:08:29,959
when I when I first experienced what a

4573
03:08:27,279 --> 03:08:33,159
quad flower was I was like wow my life

4574
03:08:29,959 --> 03:08:34,559
has changed and then onto the next quad

4575
03:08:33,159 --> 03:08:36,200
I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that

4576
03:08:34,559 --> 03:08:38,600
what I thought was a quad is really a

4577
03:08:36,200 --> 03:08:40,960
trip right and so your journey really

4578
03:08:38,600 --> 03:08:43,479
begins that way so I definitely respect

4579
03:08:40,959 --> 03:08:46,000
all of the the Legends and the people

4580
03:08:43,478 --> 03:08:47,959
that have um done all that work because

4581
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:50,920
the only way to do it is do

4582
03:08:47,959 --> 03:08:54,278
experience right there's no shortcut to

4583
03:08:50,920 --> 03:08:55,960
it um so that just brings it up to what

4584
03:08:54,279 --> 03:08:57,800
I wanted to say

4585
03:08:55,959 --> 03:09:00,559
