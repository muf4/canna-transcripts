00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:23,820
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:26,579
I'm sitting here at the University of

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,849
West Indies on the campus just in front

5
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,949
of the Usain Bolt the track that he

6
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,679
obviously practice on for many years and

7
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,719
helped him win some gold medals in

8
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,780
running obviously one of the fastest man

9
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,448
on the planet and I guess I'm here to

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,960
talk to you guys a little bit about the

11
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:45,719
standardizations that are going to be

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,299
coming to Jamaica in your future and how

13
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,250
we're going to be able to test the

14
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,779
cannabis that all the local farmers and

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,100
all the companies that come in and make

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,868
their attempts at growing whether

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,000
they're using local farmers or whether

18
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:59,100
they're bringing people in I'm not sure

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,808
I know we have the plans on doing a

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,298
little bit of both obviously using as

21
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,548
many local people as possible one of the

22
00:01:03,298 --> 00:01:06,989
worries is standardizations and one of

23
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,540
the machines right now that's being

24
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:12,599
promoted as the new standard in Jamaica

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,368
is the quanta cam from steep hill and it

26
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,169
is quite a unique machine it's really

27
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:17,790
neat you can grind up the herb and it

28
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,920
takes this little photograph and

29
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,049
moisture and it sort of has a reference

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,960
of the product that's photographing and

31
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,130
it references the many many types I

32
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,149
don't know if they've done a thousand

33
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:33,060
tests for different strains with gas

34
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:34,799
chromatograph or LLL CP or whatever it

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,420
is liquid chromatograph I'm not sure

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,549
which ones they did but it's basically a

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,498
reference model it's the beginning of

38
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,719
what we will get to in the future but in

39
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:45,089
the meantime at the University of West

40
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:48,269
Indies they have all the machines on

41
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,270
point here on campus that would be used

42
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:54,259
in regards to standardizing the medicine

43
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:58,438
and being able to test for microbials

44
00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:00,659
molds THC potent percentages cannabinoid

45
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,089
percentages and then also stripping down

46
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,130
and breaking the terpene and turpin

47
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,109
terpenoid contents down and of course

48
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:08,519
there's even mono terpenoids and Cesc

49
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:10,949
with terpenoids and the science gets

50
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,319
more and more and more complex the

51
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:16,649
deeper you get that is one of the main

52
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:19,560
reasons crd and you can has signed a

53
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,180
contract in an MoU with the university

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,550
west indies because we know that they're

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,969
the people for the job they have all the

56
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,460
students available they have

57
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:29,050
the machines available and all it really

58
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,969
is is a little bit of a synergistic

59
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,090
relationship of us bringing a few key

60
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:36,849
people in to help train the for instance

61
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,340
the proton h-nmr that is being used here

62
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:41,799
they have two of them a 250 megahertz as

63
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,469
well as a 500 megahertz and we're going

64
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,840
to be going to see those in a little bit

65
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:49,150
those machines have the ability to do

66
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,469
more than most and the things that they

67
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:56,020
don't do GC and liquid chromatograph and

68
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:58,359
then mass spec all of these are

69
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,800
available here with people who are on

70
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,170
them and trained and know how to use

71
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,959
them and I think when you can and crd

72
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:07,389
just brings a small amount of key people

73
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,030
in to do some training you're really

74
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:11,500
going to see some standards take place

75
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,659
here on the island in regards to

76
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,219
cannabis so I'm not going to talk too

77
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,139

103
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:31,439
we're not able to do this and they kind

that's not working in a closed room town

can't use their other drugs you know

127
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,500
let's find out what's good with it and

128
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,019
then the rest let's stop using like it's

not going to solve

00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:32,310
it's also dimension

132
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:46,860
that's really good for me I've seen too

133
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:50,430
much anecdotal evidence and see what it

134
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,580
does hundreds of thousands and they rely

135
00:07:50,430 --> 00:08:03,230
on it and they want comparison people

138
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:26,829
anymore it's gonna attract know so be

139
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:29,530
very careful this magnetic new killer

140
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:40,299
resistance so you want to stay out here

141
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:42,240
you can stay just read that it's not

142
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:44,379
gonna muck up the cameras though huh

143
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,029
well you're more expensive than mine

144
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:51,039
sorry this won't this isn't this is

145
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:53,649
prime this is on magnetic fell I just

146
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:56,009
mean the components in the camera oh I

147
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,009
don't think so

148
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:13,809
this one you can't get around because

149
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,810
it's too much this is

150
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:20,850
extractor even though it doesn't belong

151
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:21,809
to us so I do supercritical co2 is this

152
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,199
supercut you're saying this is

153
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:28,078
supercritical co2 that's what i use it

154
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:31,188
looks totally different than that okay i

155
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:31,188
can show you what ours

156
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:52,339
it's pretty cool you know you can get

157
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,899
though and I'm six well click done and

158
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,670
you can pretty much so this is where we

159
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,669
do most of our drug hub interactions

160
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:07,579
Varian has got water over now as you may

161
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:16,330
buy the ax Ackley on or whatever they

162
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:16,330
are did the data is pretty

163
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:42,170
this is something brentwood really like

164
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:46,059
okay I started kids company six years

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,750
reformed a us-based company

167
00:10:54,808 --> 00:11:01,509
graduated from before as well as

00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:12,970
got i'm going to spare your show but we

170
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:17,588
so they have the principal palace which

171
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:19,778
is why is that interesting so I'm

172
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:23,709
fortunate daddy called release a big

173
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:27,659
part of our boards and I to assist

174
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:30,608
another five because that's CSU in

175
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,918
Colorado one of you guys it's on our

176
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:35,790
team graduated many moons go from there

177
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:35,789
he's been using

178
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:44,509
studying

179
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,120
[Music]

180
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:54,778
so that's what ever over here

181
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,778
just past

182
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,949
bring somebody

183
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,360
in today's

184
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:16,778
[Music]

185
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:25,539
rabisu separate oh no it's mostly great

186
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:42,520
experience useful so this would be the

187
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:46,809
workhorse we have our community so it

188
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:52,149
was hard this one is this one I've seen

189
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:57,509
for this one so the inverse multinuclear

190
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:57,509
can hear asleep it's just we

191
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:09,360
so someone is standard here realizing H

192
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:09,360
bills each

193
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:18,730
must certify the crops and certified

194
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,180
products sustainers we met it's a

195
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,180
process

196
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:31,860
we just want answers backgrounds yes

197
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:31,860
my parts are you trying to find

198
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,178
[Music]

199
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:48,919
clearing again I'm not sure what's being

200
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:50,338
done yeah but that moment is tuning for

201
00:13:48,919 --> 00:14:09,419
research but the Magus

202
00:13:50,339 --> 00:14:11,879
yeah that's what we do we extract those

203
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:13,289
for clients and test enough and do some

204
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:14,959
due diligence on the equipment if you

205
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:18,240
don't mind is just going to go minute

206
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:21,559
just so we take the pictures and show

207
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,750
another scientists toys you have

208
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,750
