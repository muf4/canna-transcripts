well let's have ourselves a little Bowl

331
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,160
here on hash church we certainly don't

332
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,720
snub our noses at some nice solventless

333
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,439
oil or for that matter any type of oil

334
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,278
we have all sorts of different panelists

335
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,959
that enjoy all sorts of different things

336
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,198
here we try to be inclusive and remove

337
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:34,159
ourselves from these silly divisions

338
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:35,639
that we get caught up in sometimes as

339
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,679
human

340
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,560
beings Josh did you uh get to deploy any

341
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:43,638
of the uh the the things I sent over to

342
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,559
you to the little notes here and there

343
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,159
in the

344
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:51,838
process so I just want everyone to know

345
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:54,559
how stoked I am about Colin because he

346
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,120
shared with me some tech that was really

347
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,439
really phenomenal and yes Colin I really

348
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,198
appreciate that I'm sort of in the

349
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,279
middle of a couple runs right now uh to

350
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:07,679
be able to give you like the full uh you

351
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:10,000
know sort of reply on on my thoughts on

352
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,838
it and again I'm sort of somewhat new at

353
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,399
it and everything in this last year but

354
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,560
yes incredible work and I think that has

355
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,039
a lot to do with why the TPS are so

356
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:21,958
strong on it I mean in some cases the

357
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:25,000
tpping are

358
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:27,439
strong than the flower was and I maybe

359
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,600
that's normal but you know in our case

360
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,959
here you know the the

361
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,319
uh tures are just crazy in

362
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,879
there you know I I think you have an

363
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:40,278
opportunity to with the the knowledge

364
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:43,559
that I I gave I passed on you to to

365
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:45,120
retain a lot and um but I think um you

366
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,599
know we always lose a little bit it's

367
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,839
just where we're at I don't unless

368
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,399
you're using a lab kico or things like

369
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,120
that I think it's and even then you're

370
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,039
still you know I don't think anybody

371
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,000
really has any true date on it quite yet

372
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,599
but um or maybe they do I just I'm not

373
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,799
aware of it but uh I'm super stoked that

374
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,240
you able to utilize it and have fun with

375
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,078
it and uh yeah make great medicine I'm

376
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,519
so stoked so yeah please give me some

377
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:10,198
feedback I I I'd love hearing you know

378
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,318
how it went so thanks I feel like you

379
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:16,278
guys talking in

380
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:18,159
c i g i uh I helped I helped uh Josh

381
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:20,679
with some uh some freeze dryer

382
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:24,120
techniques and uh just gave him some

383
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:25,838
pointers and and and uh you know just

384
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,560
gave him the armed him with the the

385
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,480
right stuff and you know let him do his

386
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,278
thing and I think he

387
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,920
he took the sheet music and made some

388
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:39,399
beautiful music you

389
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,360
know as I call it you know and is this

390
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,720
something we're sharing with our

391
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,720
audience or is this something that we're

392
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,639
keeping a little closer to our our chest

393
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,800
we're keeping a little closer but but

394
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,360
it's uh you know I I just had to ask

395
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,479
because we talked about it so long like

396
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,159
a while ago and I just we haven't

397
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,800
checked in on each other and I I just

398
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,838
wanted to ask because you you pulled up

399
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,838
that beautiful jar and I was like that

400
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,600
looks pretty familiar

401
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,319
the same reason I asked because it was

402
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,640
mentioned on hash church I had to

403
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,119
mention like are we talking about this

404
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,839
we can talk about it in the future maybe

405
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,798
one day I'll invite a bunch of people on

406
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:12,798
who use freeze dryers and we'll spend

407
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,519
the first hour just talking about

408
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,838
settings and uh how to sublimate out the

409
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,160
water it's not as tricky as you might

410
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:22,438
think um depending on the type of freeze

411
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,839
dryer that you have it's just like

412
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,880
anything you learn the variables and

413
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,639
then you tune the variables to find The

414
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,200
Sweet Spot and how you do that

415
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,759
is by making mistakes and it's not that

416
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,679
difficult you make little mistakes they

417
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:38,558
they direct you as long as you're paying

418
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:41,200
attention and you have that awareness

419
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,639
you'll find that sweet spot making rosin

420
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,400
is no different you've got pressure

421
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,080
you've got heat you've got time those

422
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,519
are your three variables now you're

423
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,639
going to tune each of those variables in

424
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:53,679
and you're going to hone in on that

425
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,679
sweet spot and um The Sweet Spot could

426
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,200
change from person to person who knows

427
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,240
for me it's always about definitely

428
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,960
getting my yield because I hate the idea

429
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,038
of leaving things behind but also

430
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,400
preserving you know the flavor as much

431
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:12,240
as I can um yeah that's kind of kind of

432
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,120
my my um my process we use a bunch of

433
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,000
different freeze dryers that my work so

434
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,359
a freeze dryer conversation really would

435
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,038
have to be with people who are using the

436
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,678
same freeze dryers because if you've got

437
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,359
people who are using lab conos and

438
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,798
people who using freeze dry Coes um

439
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,199
their their the conversation is not

440
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:29,558
going to be the same conversation

441
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,519
they'll uh

442
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,558
they'll they'll be thinking that uh what

443
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,158
one person says doesn't align with what

444
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:38,798
the other person

445
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:42,400
says an elevation I find sometimes has a

446
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:45,440
a big play into settings as well

447
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,360
um you know so that'll change based on

448
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,360
where you are GE

449
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,879
geographically uh also Flynn from wuce

450
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,960
Winery has some really good Tech and

451
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,919
ganji Gill was just bigging him up on

452
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,759
his story not too long ago for helping

453
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,520
him uh bring his dry time down quite a

454
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:05,960
bit and also continue to keep his uh

455
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,839
quality up so I think that you know if

456
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,840
you can keep your times down and still

457
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:14,879
and times down TPS up that's kind of the

458
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:18,158
lecher got it down to seven hours but

459
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,240
it's also you know part of that is that

460
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,440
his screens that he uses that we've

461
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,640
purchased that insert into the freeze

462
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,640
dryer they have very big metal frames

463
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,159
and then they're basically screens that

464
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,759
the hash sits on so the sub sublimation

465
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:36,159
of the water happens way faster but it's

466
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,079
also seemingly faster because you put a

467
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,200
lot less hash in because of that big

468
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,038
metal frame when we first started I

469
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,519
can't tell you how many times I muffined

470
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:46,480
out my freeze dryer putting in so much

471
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:49,480
hash that every single tray that I

472
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,519
pulled out was like the hash had risen

473
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,279
right to the top of the the bottom of

474
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,519
the next tray and the the cleaning of

475
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:59,038
the freeze dryer when you do that is

476
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:01,558
Extreme like that silicone mat that is

477
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,359
on the top you know freeze dryers tend

478
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:05,879
to look like they're upside down when

479
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:09,319
they go in that's because those heaters

480
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,120
have um a silicone mat that goes over

481
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,960
top of them and that's kind of what

482
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,079
buffers the Heat and controls the

483
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,720
sublimation of the water and so we used

484
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:21,480
to oh my God we used to put like three

485
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,519
four wet kilos of hash into these things

486
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,440
and that's just too much the amount that

487
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:29,279
seems to come out perfectly is you know

488
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,440
around 700 to 800 dried ground Rams from

489
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,839
a from a harvest right at least which is

490
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,720
really the freeze dryer that 90% of

491
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,199
people in the in the industry and

492
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,240
Community are using right now because

493
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,120
they're a lyophilization oven that is

494
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,000
like really the most basic one that you

495
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:48,798
could possibly buy and because of freeze

496
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,960
dry Co who who is the manufacturer for

497
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,200
Harvest Right and makes all of those uh

498
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,000
freeze dryers they already had a

499
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,919
business where they were creating freeze

500
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,679
dryers for a variety of Industries so to

501
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,480
create a little side Hub where they

502
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,280
could just start pumping out these very

503
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,480
small little home units really even the

504
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:10,000
laboratory one uh is more of a home unit

505
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,038
than than not in my opinion I got

506
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,079
attacked pretty good on my Facebook page

507
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:18,038
the other day when I mentioned to a

508
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:21,960
friend to avoid using the oil pumps that

509
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:24,200
come with the Harvest rights and uh yeah

510
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,400
this guy just came at me fairly

511
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,159
intellectually you know not very passive

512
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,640
aggressively I I felt like he had just

513
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,240
been you know under house arrest like

514
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,960
all of us for the last year and was

515
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,359
probably at the his rope and he was like

516
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,319
I think I'll take it out on bubble man

517
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,959
today like that seems like a as good as

518
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,599
any and uh his argument was that that

519
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,120
you know the oil pumps work fine if you

520
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:48,119
know how to use the the oil um uh and

521
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,639
the and the and the pump properly for me

522
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,678
I love the idea of mitigating all risk

523
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,640
when it comes to and funny enough you

524
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,880
know just as I'm about to talk about

525
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,720
mitigating risk in a laboratory Dr

526
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,919
Markell pops into the room so that's

527
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,960
pretty trippy well played Dr Mark well

528
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,919
played I know you didn't hear what I

529
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,640
just said but uh I'm talking about

530
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,159
mitigating risk in the

531
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,960
laboratory and the atomized oil from

532
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,799
those pumps that unless you have it

533
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,120
piped out of your lab goes into the air

534
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:21,440
and is not good for for humans and is

535
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,119
definitely not something you want to

536
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,640
find on your hash so I'm talking about

537
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:29,439
Mark right now why I think a scroll pump

538
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,720
is a better idea than an oil pump oh

539
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:37,038
yeah any La for for freeze drying

540
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,200
yeah okay yep yep yeah so that's

541
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,200
basically the conversation so you know

542
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,278
first of all the scroll pump is way more

543
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,278
expensive but you don't have to deal

544
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:48,960
with changing the oil like after every

545
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:51,278
batch which in my opinion is a very

546
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,278
large Vector for potential contamination

547
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:55,919
because the oil is kind of invisible and

548
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:58,558
it transfers very easily depending on

549
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,720
your ability in the lab and everyone has

550
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,879
different abilities and so that's one

551
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,798
good way to to mitigate that risk is by

552
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,679
getting rid of it secondary the the

553
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:09,759
scroll pump in the long run will be the

554
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,720
cheaper option because you won't be

555
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:17,720
continually buying oil to put into the

556
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,480
pump it costs money to do that Andor a

557
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,798
pump that that breaks because you didn't

558
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,558
change the oil when you were supposed to

559
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:25,440
yeah well it's all about getting there's

560
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:28,038
water that ends up in that oil and then

561
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,840
you have to separate it filter it out

562
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:32,240
they give you the whole thing but it's

563
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:35,278
it's nasty there's no invariably all of

564
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,640
that all that pump uh exhaust should be

565
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:39,798
exhausted like out a fumehood because

566
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,799
otherwise you're going to develop this

567
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:46,158
film of stuff all over the inside of

568
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:49,038
your lab which you try to keep clean but

569
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:52,760
it it's a greasy kind of grime that just

570
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:55,759
ends up collecting everywhere and it

571
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:57,480
it'll attract dust too and and dirt and

572
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,038
why people aren't thinking about it is

573
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,200
because uh

574
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,119
it's it's invisible basically and they

575
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,400
don't the one difference that they're

576
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:09,798
not doing is doing microbial testing on

577
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,038
their lab weekly where you just swab

578
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:14,000
everything and send it off and find out

579
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:16,200
what's going on if you're not doing that

580
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,480
and you're just

581
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,480
assuming that's

582
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:27,200
scary the new premium pumps I'll just

583
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,159
say um you you can get like 20 Cycles

584
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,960
out of it without changing the oil not

585
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,760
that I'm promoting the oil pump after

586
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,079
everything you said but the new premium

587
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:38,079
pumps that come from Harvest Right don't

588
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,639
have to be changed every single time so

589
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,278
that's that's a positive thing but the

590
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,278
squirrel pumps are great maybe someone

591
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,919
could put a link of the squ some of the

592
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:48,720
squirrel pumps that you're talking about

593
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:51,240
up on theat SR squirrel sorry squirrel

594
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,679
friend thanks for the squirrel pump

595
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:59,399
squirrel p liol leoy is another great

596
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:03,480
company has Parmer yeah cold farmer is

597
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:07,639
also another is a good one and uh yeah I

598
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,720
mean leol is what I what VTA uses and

599
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,799
you know I've have a few of them on on

600
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,679
some other devices and yeah there're

601
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:16,000
sometimes called they're sometimes

602
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,559
called diaphragm pumps right are is a

603
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,359
diaphragm pump the same as a scroll pump

604
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,240
I think it's the same right definitely

605
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,000
heard them spoken about in the same

606
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,839
sentence right I think it's just and so

607
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,599
the fundamental difference between that

608
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:34,398
and oil pump is just the whole pumping

609
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,558
mechanism is just oilfree because

610
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:37,918
basically what you're doing is you're

611
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,519
compressing and

612
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,720
decompressing a diaphragm which creates

613
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:46,918
a vacuum right and if you have your

614
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,759
valve set up right as as as the as the

615
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,360
diaphragm is decompressed it creates a

616
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,240
negative pressure or vacuum which again

617
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:58,879
creates sort of like this pulsating kind

618
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,519
of negative pressure right so that's why

619
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,200
it there's kind of like a noise to it

620
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:05,000
because the diaphragm is going back and

621
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,440
forth and it's only on the fourth cycle

622
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,398
that it actually pulls the vacuum

623
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,519
otherwise it needs to push so it's

624
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:12,839
pulling and pushing pulling and pushing

625
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,119
but you're only sort of capturing the

626
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:18,839
pulling so to

627
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:22,038
speak Dr Mar you're looking very Jerry

628
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:25,439
today you just have yeah like the black

629
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:27,798
shirt with the hair you just like you

630
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,278
just have this I act like Jerry too you

631
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:31,278
just have this like yeah you just have

632
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,960
the ism going you know yeah I just want

633
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,558
to go back for one second on scroll

634
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,558
pumps versus diaphragms because I just

635
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,960
checked it out the scroll technology is

636
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,839
based on smooth orbital operation while

637
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,079
diaphragm pumping involves abrupt

638
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:45,798
cycling of the diaphragm cylinder pum

639
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,639
pretty but I believe they're so are they

640
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:51,319
both oiless Mark are they both they

641
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,640
don't involve an oil um I'd have to go

642
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:56,720
in deeper scroll definitely does not I

643
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,679
don't think diaphragm does either um

644
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,798
that use two spiral Scrolls to compress

645
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,600
air and move them towards you but you

646
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,000
know your your point of oil

647
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:06,398
contamination in in the hash is still

648
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,480
you know regardless you want to

649
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:11,479
basically use an oilf free pump and

650
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,599
again oil free pumps can only give you a

651
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:17,079
vacuum of so much but for just drying

652
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,639
water you only need uh that kind of

653
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:20,879
vacuum you don't really need a really

654
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,840
really deep vacuum that only the oil can

655
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,799
give you and yes uh someone in the chat

656
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,720
just mentioned that the oil that Harvest

657
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:30,639
Right supplies is not the best oil

658
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:34,000
absolutely Ely 100 Agreed 100% agreed

659
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:37,038
but is there really a best oil to be

660
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,038
anywhere near your

661
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:43,038
hash hash

662
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,038
oil that's the only

663
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,080
one I like it well people really enjoyed

664
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,960
that little bit of the conversation I

665
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,359
will tell you just from reading the chat

666
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,519
people were like Bring it on I got my

667
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,798
notepad out this is important

668
00:27:53,519 --> 00:28:00,000
information things that um people are

669
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:02,960
looking to save time and mitigate risk

670
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,759
and so Mark does Harvest Right sell a

671
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,720
pump with their machine that they sell

672
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:11,720
the um

673
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,480
the oil pump that comes with it it's an

674
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:18,640
oil pump oh yeah upgrade to as well I

675
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:21,919
believe I don't know what it is I

676
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,519
I they sell the scroll as

677
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,120
well okay yeah it's

678
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,880
$2,000 yeah 1400 US but it's not the

679
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:31,558
standard pump that so if someone gets a

680
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,320
freeze dryer and they think that they

681
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:35,480
have the thing that they need to freeze

682
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:37,798
dry their hash that's not that's not the

683
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,038
situation well they can get the job done

684
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:42,558
I'm not saying they can't but it's you

685
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:45,720
know it seems inevitable at one point

686
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:48,960
that with all the risk it's kind of like

687
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,360
when you're back in the day before pfte

688
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,240
came out which is uh distilled water

689
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,119
with spores for mushrooms in a syringe

690
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,839
we had to use things called transfer

691
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:59,599
Chambers which of course mark would know

692
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,759
what that is because it's a pretty

693
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,199
standard thing in a lab when you really

694
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,278
need to avoid this microbial world that

695
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,519
we absolutely live in you have to create

696
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:10,960
a small chamber and kill all the

697
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:14,679
bacteria in it and like go in with

698
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,440
gloves and do your work in there and so

699
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,720
you know unless you're doing your oil

700
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,278
changes in there to me I just couldn't

701
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,200
take the risk every time I saw that oil

702
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,319
I just wanted it out of my lab

703
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,278
immediately and uh that's what we made

704
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:31,278
sure we did before there was any

705
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,439
problems it's really great if you could

706
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,600
have kind of like your your vacuum pumps

707
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,519
kind of like in like a a mechanical room

708
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:46,240
area that's adequately ventilated and so

709
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,038
if they do end up spewing stuff it's

710
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,960
kind of in a separate room from where

711
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:53,319
your product is out and open because you

712
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,319
know those vacuum lines they all need to

713
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:59,200
be exhausted and very rarely I'll go

714
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:01,079
into a lab and it'll smell sour and

715
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,038
it'll be kind of like again that Grime

716
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:06,240
and it's like you guys realize you're

717
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,359
sending all that vacuum stuff vacum

718
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,319
doesn't just

719
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:13,558
disappear it's got to go somewhere right

720
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,278
ends up all over your lab right and

721
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,158
you're right those

722
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:21,119
microscopic particles I I imagine a hash

723
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,360
just could be a magnet for all that you

724
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,239
know I'll tell you and even worse so how

725
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,558
about if they're making rosin and

726
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,558
they're actually pressing rosin in

727
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:30,319
parchment

728
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,759
paper which we know I think I've even

729
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:35,278
shown it right here on hash Church yeah

730
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:38,278
even hash pressed in parchment paper

731
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:41,839
particularly touched by humans seems to

732
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:44,159
send and charge that thing statically

733
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,678
and so when the rosin is hanging in a in

734
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,960
a band you can take your finger and put

735
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,559
it nearby and the rosin will go like

736
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,319
this towards your finger which means so

737
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,519
charged know that it's literally yeah

738
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:00,480
man absolutely take some hash or some or

739
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,839
some and put it in parchment and like

740
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,360
press it with your hands a little bit

741
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:07,079
and then open it up and hang it and then

742
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:09,599
go like this with your finger and you'll

743
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:13,000
literally see the rosin go like that

744
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:16,319
I've done it on hash church for

745
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,359
sure the wide world of hash man that's

746
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:21,038
totally [ __ ] cool dude tricks you

747
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:23,638
could can you teach it to do tricks well

748
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:26,319
you can how about this from a microbial

749
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:28,199
or a contamination mind in a lab would

750
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,319
you want to see that [ __ ] like like

751
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:35,120
exposed in any way like it's literally

752
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:37,439
pulling a Charged pulling like anything

753
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:41,199
that's floating in the air like you just

754
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,159
have has to be kept really really clean

755
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,200
I think it'll take a little while but

756
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,039
eventually PE people are going to become

757
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,120
aware of all these things as they make

758
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:51,038
little mistakes in their labs and have

759
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:53,278
their

760
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:56,319
problems because this is a relatively

761
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:58,079
new industry and we're not all chemists

762
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,558
that come from a chemistry background

763
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:03,759
that were trained to to work in in Labs

764
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:06,000
you know

765
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,519
like I don't know the best I could ever

766
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,278
train my hashes to burn up in a small

767
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:13,599
series of little fires that's the only

768
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,759
trick I've been able to teach it to I

769
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,000
mean you know I I put on a little flette

770
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,480
before and flung it into a bowl but you

771
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,880
know that's about it I always feel like

772
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,159
the hash is training me don't touch me

773
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,320
this way you're gonna get stuck all over

774
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,480
your fingers Colin don't don't do don't

775
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:32,038
do that Michael of looking at it botney

776
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,759
of desire for any of those of you who

777
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:36,558
have read that book you know it's an

778
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:39,359
interesting thing when you think of

779
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:42,240
almost like Corps infecting the mind of

780
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,839
the insect to climb to the tallest tree

781
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,880
so it can fruit and explode its spores

782
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:52,759
to fall find more uh insects to infect I

783
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:56,919
sometimes wonder like is uh C is

784
00:32:52,759 --> 00:33:00,720
skunkman Sam breeding cannabis or is

785
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:03,120
cannabis directing skunkman Sam through

786
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,038
some sort

787
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:12,558
of what do you think skunkman Wag the

788
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:16,119
tail but the boty of the desire but

789
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:19,440
desire is what binds you to The Wheel of

790
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:24,119
Life so I guess we all got to get away

791
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,480
from boty maybe it'll just grow

792
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:28,678
itself well I think I've always kind of

793
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,679
convinced that as like my man has always

794
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,639
spread cannabis no cannabis has gotten

795
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:37,038
man to spread it throughout the entire

796
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:38,678
world so uh yeah I think cannabis is a

797
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,359
wee bit smarter than some of us humans

798
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:41,360
in some

799
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,720
respects one of the things we're getting

800
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:49,158
ready to do on the farm today as soon as

801
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,319
we're finished is plant ganja outside

802
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:54,159
because it's a really good uh planting

803
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:57,038
Mo what What mo is it today it's Libra

804
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,760
why is Libra good uh Libra is just a

805
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:03,119
it's a air sign it's really awesome for

806
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:05,558
flowers only you really don't want to be

807
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,159
planting any your veggies that's for in

808
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:12,320
the next couple of days uh when the moon

809
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,878
um moves into cancer or Scorpio moves

810
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,919
into Scorpio in a couple of days and

811
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:18,279
then that's just going to be way better

812
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,799
for your pumpkins and your squashes and

813
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,440
all of your brasas and things like that

814
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,240
time to get those in the garden as well

815
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,519
as all of your peas and your spinaches

816
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:30,199
so in the next couple of days but today

817
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:34,358
is is a really awesome day and tomorrow

818
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:36,358
morning for planting flowers so I'm sort

819
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:38,838
of half in and half out honestly all I

820
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:41,119
can do is look outside and go oh geez

821
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:43,279
it's a planting day so we're expecting

822
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,000
we're direct sewing everything uh this

823
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,839
year everything we're not even doing any

824
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,119
little pots no lights anywhere of

825
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:54,320
nothing we've just realized that we can

826
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,720
direct SE with some greenhouse plastic

827
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,200
over some stuff outside and and if

828
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,118
people look at her the sunlight just

829
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,519
seems like you know after 30 years of

830
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,880
growing we've just come to that that's

831
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:11,199
you know what's easy and how can we grow

832
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,640
gardens for when we're 89 or 90 and this

833
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:14,399
is just the way to do it we don't have

834
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,078
to carry pots around we just carry a

835
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,480
little bag of seeds out to the garden

836
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,800
and direct so it's been awesome the only

837
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,559
plants that we may put in pots are some

838
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,920
of the ones that we uh may want to keep

839
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:29,519
as a male we we did um think about we

840
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,280
digging up some of the males out of the

841
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,759
direct sto out of the greenhouse and in

842
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,000
some cases that worked we had to put it

843
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,920
in the shade in in a creek we put it in

844
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,639
a Creek in the shade for a couple days

845
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,960
let it like kind of come back to life

846
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,679
then repot it then bring it up into a

847
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,880
semi-shady area and it's amazing it

848
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:48,719
keeps growing and it gives us pollen and

849
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,440
some ways I like that better than

850
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,039
cutting the top off and putting it in a

851
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,440
glass jar but you can cut the top off

852
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,159
and put it in the glass jar when it's

853
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,159
fruited enough but you have to get it

854
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,598
fruited enough and sometimes

855
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,358
that means there's pollen going through

856
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,838
the air but you know so it's good to

857
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,039
have research and developing Farms out

858
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,679
there but uh this year you can look on

859
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:09,920
our Instagram the last couple days we

860
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:12,078
showed how we've prepared our beds this

861
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,119
year and we really like you know the

862
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,880
ramal chip uh wood chips and how they

863
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,838
are going to feed our rizosphere and we

864
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,800
really like the idea that when the the

865
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:24,199
seed germinates and the first root comes

866
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,400
out it's going to hit micro risal spores

867
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:28,118
and Indigenous microorganisms and then

868
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,119
all the roots are going to grow through

869
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:33,480
these

870
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:35,200
Birch uh Birch chips that we have and

871
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,519
and then the the fungi is going to eat

872
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,919
you can see how easy it is for the fungi

873
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:41,838
to come on and eat like sawdust and wood

874
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,760
chips so it's just going to be this

875
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:47,559
total Fusion of of fungi and Roots

876
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,640
growing together and I love the oil

877
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:51,239
secretions that that come from the

878
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:53,960
weight of the plant uptakes those

879
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:58,919
nutrients and it comes out in the hash

880
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:03,960
when you have a juicy Rich Nar

881
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:07,079
soil substrate it comes out in the hash

882
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,800
and the tri comes get more amazing and

883
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,039
the flavors are are stronger and they

884
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:16,039
last

885
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:17,599
longer somebody just asked to on the

886
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:19,199
chat

887
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,318
just

888
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:28,078
address it it's a super

889
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:30,000
aome about uming so they really your

890
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,560
your your temperatures at night are

891
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,358
around five degrees Celsius then you can

892
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:37,279
really start planting that's just

893
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:39,679
telling you that it's a good yeah or 45

894
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,359
degrees um Fahrenheit and that's just

895
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,078
telling you hey you know it's probably a

896
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,960
good time to start putting in seeds if

897
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,720
it's going to be super wet and rainy and

898
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,119
that temperature you might want to hold

899
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,838
off until the rains sort of pass but

900
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,519
when you've got optimal soil

901
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:56,199
temperatures as well as optimal Moon

902
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:59,280
signs somebody wrote in there that it's

903
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:01,919
pseudoscience but really the moon signs

904
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,560
are what moves the ocean the moon signs

905
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,519
are what decides when plants uptake

906
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:10,078
nutrients trees we know when we look at

907
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:12,920
when they're in a water sign they uptake

908
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,119
a tremendous amount more of water and

909
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,599
different humidities during that time

910
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,559
like you know it's pretty obvious yeah

911
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,800
and we've tried um to do all different

912
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,159
types of tests you know planting in a in

913
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,640
a fire moon right next to one in a water

914
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:29,279
Moon and be like yeah you know we're

915
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,239
really going to docu M this or sometimes

916
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,000
we have to push it because you just

917
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:34,598
can't get around it and you have to

918
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,960
plant anyway because we're running out

919
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:39,119
of time or the weather and we notice

920
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,240
it's it's it's tremendously different

921
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,079
when you hit it on the right Moon as

922
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:47,679
opposed to when you don't it's it's and

923
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,039
Maria Maria Maria th is one biodynamic

924
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:52,879
woman I mean she did tons of tests and

925
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:55,119
proved you know that she even modified

926
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,800
the biodynamic planting calendar into a

927
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,800
more modern calendar um so yeah now is a

928
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,200
really good time to plant outdoors you

929
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,440
can plant outdoors on one thing if you

930
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:09,480
make hash and it has a little seed in it

931
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,440
you can put the hash out in on your beds

932
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,960
you know like the leftover Leaf while

933
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,440
you're making hash the seeds kind of

934
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,280
germinate they sort of they don't

935
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,639
germinate but they they soak like you

936
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,119
would a sprout and then when you put the

937
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,440
the hash drags out on your this for the

938
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,760
home Gardener out on the on the soil

939
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,400
like in a greenhouse I we you know you

940
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,359
could do that for the last month we've

941
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,838
had uh drgs with seeds in it on top of

942
00:39:34,358 --> 00:39:39,598
soil and soon as the Earth temperature

943
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:41,199
gets warm enough sprouts come up so and

944
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,039
some there's some beds out there that

945
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:46,838
have like a thousand Sprouts coming up

946
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:50,358
and these seeds have been

947
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:52,719
frozen 50 times over the last you know

948
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:55,039
two months because it freezes nearly

949
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,679
every night and what seeds go through is

950
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,358
something called serot and some like

951
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:01,519
through the winter seeds fall in the

952
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:03,960
fall and they go through this serotinous

953
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,519
state where they go dormant even though

954
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,358
they're starting to germinate they go DM

955
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,800
it until the temperatures come right and

956
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,480
cannabis seeds are like that so you can

957
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,880
plant a cannabis seed in colder

958
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,199
temperatures than say you can put a

959
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,800
clone outside and anyone who's a

960
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:20,919
gardener knows that you know volunteers

961
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,359
coming up are so much more vigorous

962
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,119
they're so much more adapted to the soil

963
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:26,838
around them they're ready for the

964
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,680
microbial life that they're going to

965
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:31,759
uptake because they've already known it

966
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:33,199
throughout the whole winter and also I'm

967
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,960
still seeing on the chats here that

968
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:37,399
somebody is talking about pseudoscience

969
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,358
and they want the scientific papers well

970
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,519
let's go ahead and let's look back

971
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:46,440
before industrialized Revolution the

972
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:49,838
scientific papers on the moon signs and

973
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,720
moon plantings were incredibly vast you

974
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:55,880
can go back to the early 1800s and way

975
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:58,799
into the early 1900s before we started

976
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,880
mechanized big agriculture that really

977
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,839
is aligned with um you know not nature

978
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,800
and not the moon and you know it's not

979
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:09,639
reallying at Natural Sciences so let you

980
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,880
know I just want to let people know that

981
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:13,838
there's papers out there and there are a

982
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,920
lot of comparison studies that will

983
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,920
actually really blow your mind um so and

984
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,960
I'll leave I'll leave it here rudol

985
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,960
Steiner wrote 1 million pages of

986
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,400
documents before 1920 have a look at it

987
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,240
you can decide whether you think they're

988
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,240
valuable

989
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:40,280
I had a couple questions um on that last

990
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:43,318
thing um I I can't point to the paper

991
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,359
but I know that in the in the forestry

992
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:48,239
world uh there's somebody who's been

993
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:52,480
looking at what what sort of harvest in

994
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:54,919
terms of uh firewood Andor Lumber uh by

995
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,559
weight do you see based on when the tree

996
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:00,119
is cut and trees that are cut in Full

997
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:03,920
Moon particularly in water signs produce

998
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:05,440
like as much as 40% more by weight at

999
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,639
Harvest

1000
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:12,159
um is it relevant to cannabis I can't

1001
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:14,358
prove that but um I definitely I I use

1002
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:17,159
the biodynamic calendar in in the work

1003
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:20,598
here on the farm uh deep appreciation to

1004
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:23,078
miss Stone indeed um and then I had a

1005
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:25,760
question for you guys um do you soak the

1006
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:28,200
seeds before you put them in direct SE

1007
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,319
uh sewing in a greenhouse or do you

1008
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:32,679
water the soil to keep them moist enough

1009
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:32,679
that they

1010
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:39,838
sprout we just soak them in our mouth

1011
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:42,280
and um usually I'll count how many holes

1012
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:46,440
that I want to do and in each hole we'll

1013
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:48,599
maybe put three to five seeds and and we

1014
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,679
can do this and we can direct sew like

1015
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,880
this because we are breeders and we do

1016
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:55,639
have so many seeds and people gift us so

1017
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,680
many seeds so we have this ability to

1018
00:42:55,639 --> 00:43:00,279
maybe pick the very best female na in

1019
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,519
each hole so I'll sort of count all of

1020
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,599
the different holes that I want to plant

1021
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:06,719
and then I'll count out the seeds I'll

1022
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,480
put them in my mouth I'll sort of suck

1023
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:11,118
on them a little bit I'll make all of

1024
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,358
the labels and the name tags that that

1025
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,400
you know is needed for those holes and

1026
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:18,519
then I'll just plant them I would so it

1027
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,358
only gets a pre- soak with um saliva I

1028
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:22,960
would that's it probably add that the

1029
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:24,639
most magical thing is that we use a dowo

1030
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,159
Zing Crystal and this will be really

1031
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:29,719
great for the people who love pseudo

1032
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:32,118
science we use a dowsing Crystal over

1033
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:34,679
every one of our seed packages and we we

1034
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:36,880
truly believe in this we we lay our

1035
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:38,919
seeds out you know in front of us on a

1036
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,200
table from all the people that we get it

1037
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,519
from and we use a crystal and you can

1038
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:46,598
get a a yes or a no from the crystal on

1039
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:49,440
whether that plant you have to ask an

1040
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:51,559
intentional simple question you have to

1041
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,559
say is this you know whatever you want

1042
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:55,839
is this medicine good for me does this

1043
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:58,559
medicine make hash will this cure

1044
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:01,078
Crohn's disease canc or whatever it is

1045
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:04,079
and you ask the question to the Crystal

1046
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:06,160
and that goes through and so we choose

1047
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,760
our seeds based off that then we put

1048
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:12,399
them in our our mouth to get the DNA and

1049
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,119
then we will roll it in Lush Roots a

1050
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,680
little micro Rizal fungi with our saliva

1051
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,760
on it and then we'll put it into the

1052
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:22,639
soil direct which also has indigenous

1053
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,839
microorganisms and all of the other

1054
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:27,598
living cultures that we've put into the

1055
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:31,078
soil and then we wet the soil down and

1056
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:33,000
then that's right we let nature and soil

1057
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:36,039
germinate the seed and it's our belief

1058
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,400
that if it doesn't grow out of that soil

1059
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:41,159
in that moon sign with that then really

1060
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,838
it's not meant to be on our land and

1061
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:46,078
grown out with our intentions the way

1062
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:48,599
that we wanted to and I understand if

1063
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,440
someone has specific seeds that they

1064
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,440
want to grow there's there's other ways

1065
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,358
of doing it but this is just the way

1066
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,159
that we do it on on our farm and this is

1067
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,880
the way that we've come to too and and

1068
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,519
it also we do lot of tests and a lot of

1069
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,079
different observations and we'll soak

1070
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:07,519
some and we'll put some over here we'll

1071
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,400
try some in wherever but you know it's

1072
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:12,318
just good to always try out different

1073
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,920
things and when you're rich in seeds or

1074
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:17,039
you're a breeder then why not try out a

1075
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,960
lot of different mediums and a and a lot

1076
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:22,039
of different areas and try to plant out

1077
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,199
of moon signs that are optimal and see

1078
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:26,159
what happens you know I think it's

1079
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:29,039
really awesome because you people can

1080
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:31,039
listen to us here on hash church or they

1081
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:34,039
can go and do it themselves because I

1082
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:36,679
feel like the very best relationship

1083
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:38,639
that we can have not only with nature

1084
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:41,318
but with the cannabis plant is to grow

1085
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,039
our own and the reason why you put it in

1086
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:43,880
your mouth is because you're creating

1087
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,079
that

1088
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,559
relationship with the seed with your DNA

1089
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:51,720
with the microbiology in your mouth and

1090
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:53,599
in your and then in the soil you know

1091
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:55,799
when we compare

1092
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,599
microbiology of the soil to the

1093
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:01,440
microbiology of our own body it's

1094
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:04,559
totally similar there's no differences

1095
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,639
you know what is in soil and what makes

1096
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:10,559
plants and trees healthy is the same

1097
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:14,799
microbiology that helps break down our

1098
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:17,400
own seed coating yeah our own uh food

1099
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,960
inside of our body which helps make us

1100
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,039
healthy it's it's a it's a cycle you

1101
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:25,119
know I think that often we're always

1102
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:28,558
looking for proof and proof is always

1103
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:31,240
given in science when when we isolate

1104
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:34,599
and when we isolate things we're only

1105
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:39,439
seeing it from a very small

1106
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:42,079
pinpoint place in a whole you know

1107
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,800
Universe of

1108
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,880
microcosmic

1109
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:50,200
possibilities so I think that um you

1110
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:54,039
know when we are relying on just

1111
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:57,598
pinpoint uh you know accuracies I think

1112
00:46:54,039 --> 00:47:01,400
that we are not valuing all of the

1113
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,838
possibilities that nature and Humanity

1114
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,838
has to

1115
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:08,598
offer someone asked how long we keep the

1116
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,800
seeds in the mouth and you can keep the

1117
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:12,680
seeds in your mouth as long as really

1118
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,400
you want to you could say your favorite

1119
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:16,960
prayer or you could set your intention

1120
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,880
for that seed and that's how long you

1121
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,679
kept it in your mouth I think it's again

1122
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,680
you an

1123
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,319
intuition so as you guys are talking and

1124
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:28,039
that was just awesome someone sent me

1125
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:31,880
this stuff while back and you're telling

1126
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:33,719
me I should like roll my peps after it

1127
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,960
roots in this

1128
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:40,838
stuff that's awesome M

1129
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:43,760
fungi you know if it's the Spore has to

1130
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:46,799
touch the the root in order a living

1131
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:50,599
route in order for the score to to come

1132
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:53,880
alive so if you can get direct contact

1133
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:57,559
if you clone I mean once my

1134
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,960
clones I dip this into this there I just

1135
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:00,839
opened this right now as you're talking

1136
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,240
about this right so I've been someone

1137
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:04,400
sent me this for promix a while back so

1138
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:06,159
I'm just curious about it because now

1139
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,119
I'm really interested in what you're

1140
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:09,920
talking about sorry I'm just running

1141
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:11,559
around so I'm going to just get my

1142
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,880
clones and when they root I would just

1143
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:16,880
kind of roll that in some of this stuff

1144
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:20,039
or is that what you're

1145
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,519
saying I'll just read this you know I

1146
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:27,800
guess well what you do is you you would

1147
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:30,159
make a little micro risal solution

1148
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,839
okay sorry you could use a little corn

1149
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:35,799
starch and water and and and make a

1150
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:38,880
little dip gel with microle fungi and

1151
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:42,240
maybe aloe and then you can dip your you

1152
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,079
can dip your cutting into it right and

1153
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:47,759
so you do you pull the cutting out it

1154
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:50,200
has aloe juice and micro isal fungi on

1155
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,760
it

1156
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:54,798
so what wait it's just you want it

1157
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,720
wrapped around the stock of the Clone

1158
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:58,400
that you're

1159
00:48:55,719 --> 00:49:00,558
taking so when you put the Clone in

1160
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,880
point what you're

1161
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,160
saying okay I didn't hear what you said

1162
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,039
there okay sorry oh my microphone's over

1163
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:10,960
here so when I cut a clone I would dip

1164
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:12,558
it in um into something like this first

1165
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,039
before I put it into the Pete and then

1166
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:19,960
allow it to root but not after inoculate

1167
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:23,239
the Pete the stock and when you

1168
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,838
transplant it okay so you do okay yeah

1169
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:28,959
as much as you can don't overuse the

1170
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:32,119
micro isal fungi and I would just flag

1171
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,400
like with micro risal products you know

1172
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:37,119
check the sourcing of the product some

1173
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:41,240
of that is grown on GMO

1174
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,920
substrate some of it's certified organic

1175
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:45,879
so you know if you want to get some of

1176
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,798
it is just single species it might be

1177
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,680
only feeding you

1178
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:54,119
know yeah it's just a single species

1179
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:56,399
poly polyculture is just super important

1180
00:49:54,119 --> 00:50:00,119
so you know and we're we're recommending

1181
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:03,318
a living microbial cloning you know

1182
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:06,720
often cloning is used with with

1183
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:08,358
fungicides and and a sterile environment

1184
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,679
the type of cloning that we're talking

1185
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:14,598
about is the exact opposite where you

1186
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:17,039
make a living soil bed and you put micro

1187
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:19,838
isal fungi and stalks in it and when The

1188
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:23,960
Roots come out they're full of white

1189
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:25,719
hairs and the white hairs are where the

1190
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,519
the the plant uptakes nutrients so

1191
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:29,439
you're automatically getting an

1192
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:31,639
inoculation on your root and that

1193
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,960
inoculation stays with the plant its

1194
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:36,798
entire life yeah okay and that's why

1195
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,280
it's important to get the micro asle

1196
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:42,599
fungi root on there as soon as possible

1197
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,960
now a lot of people do indigenous

1198
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:47,798
microorganisms and make soils that

1199
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,199
they're getting micro isal fungi wild

1200
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:53,318
from the environment and that's also

1201
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:57,039
recommended it's also recommended it's

1202
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:59,400
just if you want to ensure you know the

1203
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:04,000
studied micro isal fungi thing you can

1204
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:06,200
do an a very easy root dip or or dusting

1205
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,318
of the roots in the very beginning and

1206
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:09,919
then that will last its whole entire

1207
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,880
life you don't necessarily even have to

1208
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,559
do it again unless maybe two weeks into

1209
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:18,519
it you could do another drench and and

1210
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,640
an inoculated root zone is gonna help

1211
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:23,519
your plant double in size which is why

1212
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:27,400
we joke around Lush roots 8.40 that we

1213
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:29,798
have is 420 time 2 just for fun great

1214
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,639
product I was just gonna say you got you

1215
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:34,759
know Josh the I've been using your

1216
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:38,039
product um and boy have I seen

1217
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:40,599
incredible increase in Vigor um the Lush

1218
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:43,679
Roots alone is is really awesome I did

1219
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:46,318
some some really isolated tests with uh

1220
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:49,000
some motor breath 15 some chmd some Sour

1221
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:53,798
Diesel clones and then um uh just

1222
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:57,400
recently banana uh um you know St Nana

1223
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:59,358
clone uh so I am seeing side by side

1224
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,400
results and uh you know I've always

1225
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:05,798
rolled my clones in in my gzel and then

1226
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:08,680
then transplanted right but having this

1227
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:10,679
this Lush Roots is um is really

1228
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:12,759
incredible stuff man it's you know

1229
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:15,838
Johnny if you should get some man it's

1230
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,799
it's really great um I I plan on

1231
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,558
continuing to incorporate it into my

1232
00:52:17,798 --> 00:52:22,239
whole regimen at this point it's it's

1233
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:24,960
really phenomenal so really beautiful

1234
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:26,279
work guys thank you for the first time

1235
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,480
we listened to you guys talk about this

1236
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,400
for a long time so I have to like change

1237
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,000
everything I've redone the whole room

1238
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:37,599
I'm looking at cutting new clones tying

1239
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,559
things down I have these products and

1240
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,200
I'm gonna be like calling you guys daily

1241
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:44,240
and I'm G to come up for a visit and you

1242
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:45,798
try by my house a few times I missed you

1243
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,679
on the Sunshine Coast the other day you

1244
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:49,519
were there I was there the next day so

1245
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:51,639
it was kind of funny I was I was like

1246
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:54,838
saw Joel the day after so I was like oh

1247
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:57,039
I just missed you guys but um awesome

1248
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:59,159
love listening to you guys I'm quiet

1249
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:01,000
here and taking the information

1250
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:03,118
again we didn't make it through

1251
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,719
Vancouver we were fully feeling you and

1252
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,760
and we really wanted to stop but we were

1253
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,318
like on this Midnight Mission after

1254
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,160
coming out of the coast and made it

1255
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:12,239
through but we we did have an amazing

1256
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:14,639
time and I wanted to touch really

1257
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:16,479
quickly on what Josh was saying about

1258
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:21,318
this idea

1259
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:24,280
of of what is sterile and the idea of

1260
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:28,519
bringing sort of half sterilized

1261
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:30,760
techniques into your Garden it's sort of

1262
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:33,920
like these half sterilized techniques

1263
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:36,200
too you know with the mask and and what

1264
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,358
people are wearing and and like what

1265
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:41,798
what is sterile what is not sterile it's

1266
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:45,119
it's like microbial life is all around

1267
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:48,639
us it's everywhere and and when we call

1268
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:50,798
something clean we tend to go towards

1269
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:53,598
maybe the science side of it and say

1270
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:56,440
sterilized is what is clean but I'd like

1271
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:58,798
to sort of open up the minds to people

1272
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,519
on the idea that when you have a

1273
00:53:58,798 --> 00:54:02,480
tremendous amount of beneficial

1274
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:04,679
microbiology on your side and you're

1275
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,358
working with beneficial

1276
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:10,879
microbiology then that can be more of a

1277
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:13,960
definition of what clean is because we

1278
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:17,200
are you know utilize microbiology

1279
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,639
everywhere all the time and it's on the

1280
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:20,919
plants that you're getting if you're

1281
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:23,118
getting cuting or you're getting clones

1282
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,480
there's already an end aiic system

1283
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:29,039
within those cuting that's you know

1284
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:32,920
there's nothing that's truly sterile so

1285
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:35,599
when you're using a product like a um a

1286
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:38,079
dip or or something that's used for

1287
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,119
rooting gels or something like that

1288
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,960
that's a fungicide that Josh said it's

1289
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:44,079
actually

1290
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,720
sterilizing everything around where

1291
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,720
you're dipping it which means that

1292
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:51,279
you're killing all of the bacteria all

1293
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:54,519
of the fungi even the endophytic fungi

1294
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:57,160
which is inside or the cyano bacteria

1295
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:59,719
which is on the outside of the plant

1296
00:54:57,159 --> 00:55:01,480
where if you have a healthy clone then

1297
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:03,519
you really don't want to be killing that

1298
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,920
because that's your health that's your

1299
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:08,318
Vitality that's the well-being in the

1300
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,079
plant that's going to go up inside of

1301
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:13,920
the plant and become its own healthy

1302
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:15,880
microbiome so when you Ally with this

1303
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,880
microbiology that we're talking about

1304
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:23,640
like these endos and these ectos it's

1305
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:25,680
it's really similar um you know to just

1306
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:27,000
allying with nature and getting that

1307
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,159
cleanliness

1308
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,358
from nature so just a little thought

1309
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:35,798
there for everybody and healthy microbes

1310
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:38,679
eat pathogens as breakfast that's their

1311
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:42,798
whole entire purpose so fusarium and

1312
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:45,679
pythium tend to propagate in

1313
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:47,679
ster cloning environments this is why

1314
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,318
tissue culture has become such a big

1315
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:50,960
thing maybe Mark can talk or someone can

1316
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:53,558
talk about tissue culture and how that's

1317
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,358
different than what we're saying but uh

1318
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:58,720
I believe that like Kelly said a healthy

1319
00:55:55,358 --> 00:56:01,279
microbiology system eats

1320
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,399
path I was going to say I cut clones two

1321
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,519
days ago so I'm going to go in pull

1322
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,880
those out of the pets make up this dip

1323
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,199
it in there and put them back in cuz

1324
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,680
they're probably just starting to swell

1325
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:12,279
a little bit so I have that little

1326
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:13,598
window right now thank you so much for

1327
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:18,119
the lesson because that's what I'm doing

1328
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:18,119
this afternoon so that's awesome I can't

1329
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:28,160
wait okay time to do it job got quiet

1330
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,119
for a

1331
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:33,038
second

1332
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:35,880
Le do a little

1333
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:39,319
dab we had an amazing trip we'll just

1334
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:42,519
say and we we got to visit Terry Willard

1335
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:45,199
um and Alexandra on the island and

1336
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:47,798
they're just such amazing people and

1337
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:49,558
they're Elders in our community and they

1338
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:52,239
started you know people should look into

1339
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:53,200
Wild Rose College um it's an herbal

1340
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:55,759
College

1341
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:57,358
online and people have they've been just

1342
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,960
doing a you know they even have a

1343
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:00,759
cannabis course now that they're doing

1344
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,720
online which I think is really valuable

1345
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,920
to like the hom grower and and the and

1346
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:08,118
people Beyond it was really wonderful to

1347
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,079
see their their way they've transformed

1348
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:13,240
their their six acres and utilizing

1349
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:16,400
alternative energy and hugle culture

1350
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:18,318
swes and polyculture diversity and all

1351
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,838
the different medicines they're making

1352
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,920
and uh you know going along the coast we

1353
00:57:20,838 --> 00:57:24,639
just uh got and it just it's just

1354
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,760
reminding me I don't mean to cut you off

1355
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:29,159
just really quickly like you know the

1356
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:32,880
world is a really crazy place if anybody

1357
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:35,038
has a backyard or even like a 5 by 10

1358
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,920
piece of land

1359
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:39,280
like I mean gardening is so incredibly

1360
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,358
healing if you're even if you're going

1361
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,599
to only grow like a couple of tomato

1362
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:46,279
plants and you can watch them grow that

1363
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:49,359
means that you're outside that means

1364
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:51,440
that you're with the soil and I just am

1365
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,519
really encouraging people to have little

1366
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,358
backyard gardens or to share backyard

1367
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,838
gardens with those people who do have

1368
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:59,000
backyards

1369
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:02,159
um because we really believe that

1370
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,838
backyard gardens are going to be what

1371
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,000
saves the Earth and and it's humans I

1372
00:58:04,838 --> 00:58:08,480
mean I think the Earth is going to be

1373
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,039
totally fine whether we're here well

1374
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:14,079
it'll be way better if we're not here

1375
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:16,280
but um since we are here and we do want

1376
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,839
to save ourselves and I think it's

1377
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,440
probably really optimal that we all get

1378
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:24,599
into backyard gardening and growing our

1379
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,760
own food uh so that we can be eating

1380
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:29,798
good nutrients and up taking good

1381
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,319
microbiology so that we have the ability

1382
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:35,920
to think outside of the box of what

1383
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:38,558
which just science and media is teaching

1384
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:41,000
us something outside of that um I think

1385
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:45,559
will be really helpful for our

1386
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:51,039
species and building bird houses B

1387
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:52,440
houses and minor B hotels are really

1388
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:54,359
good thing to do right now we're we

1389
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,200
going to build swallow houses because

1390
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:58,920
the swallows come back I wrote a note

1391
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,879
from last year that they came back on

1392
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,280
April 15th so I'm trying to prepare I

1393
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,519
want to have a you know a good amount of

1394
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,359
swallow houses for them so creating

1395
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:10,358
habitat is also very important in a time

1396
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:10,358
when we're losing a lot of

1397
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:19,680
habitat I like it Peppers peppers are an

1398
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:22,719
easy thing to grow and if you eat

1399
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:25,558
peppers you got to clean out the seeds

1400
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:28,798
so now you have pepper seeds right so

1401
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:31,720
there there so easy to grow and you know

1402
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:34,639
we just uh had a meal with peppers my

1403
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:36,679
daughter was so inspired like Dad look

1404
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:37,838
there's all the seeds here I'm like okay

1405
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:40,759
let's

1406
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:42,440
go all different kinds of peppers you

1407
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:46,200
now have seeds

1408
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:48,519
for so many things we eat have seeds and

1409
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:50,919
it is true there are so many things we

1410
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:54,159
can save seeds from that we eat and we

1411
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,838
often throw it away yeah well with

1412
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:59,639
tomatoes you kind of eat the seeds right

1413
00:59:56,838 --> 01:00:03,000
so with some things you eat the seeds

1414
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:06,358
but like so we tried to actually strain

1415
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:09,039
out of some of the Tomato pulp a few of

1416
01:00:06,358 --> 01:00:10,440
the seeds and it didn't really work out

1417
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:13,760
too

1418
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,760
well so we'll just go buy those seeds

1419
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,039
but the thing with us is like we we live

1420
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:21,480
close to um and you would love these

1421
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:24,799
guys Josh and Kelly um our local Amish

1422
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:27,000
farmer who um you know we've been buying

1423
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:29,960
produce from him for probably about 20

1424
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,318
years now I mean and we've seen his

1425
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:35,559
business grow to where he's making

1426
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:38,318
package Goods now and has Dairy which

1427
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:39,960
means he needs Refrigeration which when

1428
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:42,159
we first went there they had no

1429
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,039
electricity at all they were just kind

1430
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:47,480
of like a Farm Stand literally just

1431
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:50,039
selling produce that was just freshly

1432
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,639
harvested it's now more of the Amish

1433
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:56,880
Market you know that baked goods and

1434
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:59,838
dairy stuff and stuff like that but um

1435
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,960
Yeah man they just they they're totally

1436
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:03,599
regenerative Farmers you could tell

1437
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:06,039
because when you go there you just you

1438
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,920
you see it happening you know and and

1439
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:11,359
the whole family is involved and it just

1440
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:15,119
it's so cool they they they they

1441
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:18,759
peacefully coexist in we we kind of live

1442
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:21,280
in Philadelphia creep Suburbia you know

1443
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,760
a Suburbia from Philadelphia and

1444
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,119
Westchester and Baltimore kind of like

1445
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,599
they all kind of creep together I mean

1446
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:32,000
where we live now 20 30 years well 20

1447
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:35,720
years ago we were here so 40 years ago

1448
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:39,358
this was all Farmland but um the Amish

1449
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:42,639
basically run all of the local farms in

1450
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:45,199
this area and and they they're they're

1451
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:46,480
just amazing man they they just and

1452
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:49,318
they're out there're they're growing

1453
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:52,760
hemp now too which is really amazing too

1454
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:55,639
but we try to support our local Amish

1455
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:57,720
guy because it means the world to him

1456
01:01:55,639 --> 01:02:00,038
that you know my wife is there probably

1457
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:03,078
two or three times a week buying our

1458
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:05,079
fresh produce we'll buy our our eggs and

1459
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:08,240
our some of our Dairy not all of our

1460
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:11,160
Dairy from him but um yeah man I mean

1461
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:14,759
it's just it's regenerative farming all

1462
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:17,639
of their um livestock practice is all

1463
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,520
organic and open range for like their

1464
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:22,199
chickens and their turkeys and stuff

1465
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:25,400
like that they sell they sell goat milk

1466
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:27,919
and goat cheese which is really again

1467
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:30,358
probably unique to them but you well

1468
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,599
maybe not unique to them but um it just

1469
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:37,920
it's so great that they can peacefully

1470
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:41,519
coexist and farm in

1471
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:44,880
2021 by the methods that I think have

1472
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:48,000
been farmed that you know for for

1473
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,920
Generations go ahead Sam I'm sorry no no

1474
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,599
problem you know me I butt into

1475
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:56,119
everybody and uh I I just wanted to say

1476
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:59,039
that if you want to save tomato seeds

1477
01:02:56,119 --> 01:03:01,480
two points one make sure it's not a

1478
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:05,400
hybrid because you can't save hybrid

1479
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:07,599
tomato seeds second uh so you use an

1480
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,680
open pollinated oldfashioned type

1481
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:13,079
variety second thing is you scoop out or

1482
01:03:10,679 --> 01:03:16,078
squeeze out the seeds and you put them

1483
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:17,200
in a glass jar and let them ferment for

1484
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:20,720
a few

1485
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:23,318
days then you take them out wash them in

1486
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:25,519
clean water dry them and you can use

1487
01:03:23,318 --> 01:03:27,719
them the next year you know when it's

1488
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:32,199
ready to plant but without that

1489
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:32,199
fermentation product it doesn't

1490
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:39,599
work wow Sam dropping the real knowledge

1491
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:42,400
here there you go tell me more Sam about

1492
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:45,119
the you can't if it's a hybrid because I

1493
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,599
assume like when I buy tomatoes like at

1494
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:50,680
the grocery store that those are

1495
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:54,798
probably all commercial hybrid Tomatoes

1496
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:56,838
right so is itely yes okay so is it so

1497
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:59,278
can you say what you said before which

1498
01:03:56,838 --> 01:04:01,400
is that you're not allowed to take those

1499
01:03:59,278 --> 01:04:04,199
seeds from those Tom no it's not that

1500
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:07,160
you can't you're not allowed to it's

1501
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:10,919
they won't reproduce like the hybrid

1502
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:13,278
because the a hybrid an F1 hybrid has

1503
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:17,960
two different parents two different

1504
01:04:13,278 --> 01:04:22,639
lines and you only are reproducing the

1505
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:25,720
F1 which is it it's not this an F1

1506
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:29,400
hybrid when you self it to itself it'll

1507
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:32,038
prod 25% like the mother 25% like the

1508
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,880
father and 50% somewhere in between the

1509
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:37,559
two so you don't get what you want

1510
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:41,680
whereas if you use like an heirloom

1511
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:44,960
variety of tomato like brandy wine well

1512
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:47,480
that's true breeding and if you ferment

1513
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:50,000
the seeds and save them they will

1514
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:52,318
absolutely work Wonderful because I've

1515
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:56,079
done it for

1516
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:59,199
decades and also the roma tomato is one

1517
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:01,200
that is still somewhat a Heritage

1518
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:02,679
variety that you can also keep seed from

1519
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:04,919
which is one of the most common ones in

1520
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:06,399
the grocery store that's actually still

1521
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:09,159
an old

1522
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,880
variety we've grown Roma tomatoes for a

1523
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:14,159
while in this one area and we're the

1524
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:16,119
tomatoes have kind of gotten mature the

1525
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:18,719
end of the season sometimes we just

1526
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:21,760
leave them out there they drop the seeds

1527
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:26,038
and they yeah just keep growing year

1528
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:28,000
after year and yeah in the fruit yeah

1529
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:30,680
what a wonderful tomato that is that's

1530
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,679
just you could eat them just raw just

1531
01:05:30,679 --> 01:05:34,919
with salt and pepper I mean they're just

1532
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:37,199
yeah you could put them in sauce I love

1533
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:40,119
those Tomatoes I love r or my wife's

1534
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:43,118
favorite is Brandy Wine mine favorite is

1535
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:47,079
Cherokee purple you can't beat it for in

1536
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:49,240
my taste so Sam you mentioned not being

1537
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:51,880
able to start the seeds um is there a

1538
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:53,919
reason why are they just not fertile or

1539
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:57,000
or what's the reasoning behind the

1540
01:05:53,920 --> 01:06:00,680
hybrids not being able to be well

1541
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:04,679
no it's but they will grow but instead

1542
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:10,358
of being the F1 hybrid that the parents

1543
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:10,358
were they will be uh

1544
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:19,200
F2 and therefore 25% like the mother 25%

1545
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:23,559
like the father and 50% in between and I

1546
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:26,000
doubt very many of them will be like the

1547
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:27,960
F1 hybrid that you bought in the first

1548
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,960
place because it was so

1549
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,480
wonderful makes sense thanks for the EXP

1550
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,838
you know Mark I loved what you were

1551
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,278
saying there about supporting the local

1552
01:06:34,838 --> 01:06:40,719
Amish people is that you're also

1553
01:06:37,278 --> 01:06:42,639
supporting your local biome and what

1554
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:44,439
everybody is talking about here and when

1555
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:45,920
you're getting those cheeses and when

1556
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,920
you're getting those veggies you're

1557
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:51,720
supporting your own healthy

1558
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,880
microbiome which is inevitably your own

1559
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:55,719
healthy

1560
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:57,440
microbiome um which is really awesome

1561
01:06:55,719 --> 01:07:01,078
intelligent to do and also what we're

1562
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:04,599
talking about here with uh germination

1563
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:08,160
of any kind of seeds is what is it doing

1564
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:11,119
in nature so tomatoes are really awesome

1565
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:13,278
they come up all over the garden as

1566
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:16,440
volunteers and when they do that is when

1567
01:07:13,278 --> 01:07:19,760
a tomato drops off of the plant whole

1568
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:23,079
and then it overwinters and it's rotting

1569
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:26,079
or fermenting inside of its own

1570
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:28,880
serotinous sugars carbohydrates Ates its

1571
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:32,798
own State then it has the ability those

1572
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:35,960
enzymes eat away at the outside or the

1573
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:39,719
hole of the seed which helps it to

1574
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:41,798
germinate faster in that environment so

1575
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:43,480
whenever we're planting seeds you know

1576
01:07:41,798 --> 01:07:45,798
you you want to be able to think about

1577
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:50,838
oh well what is it doing in nature and

1578
01:07:45,798 --> 01:07:53,199
how can I you know mimic that so that it

1579
01:07:50,838 --> 01:07:55,519
will have that its best germination as

1580
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:59,358
well as its most potential growth Poss

1581
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:02,880
POS it's absolutely true I mean some

1582
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:05,679
seeds have to be frozen or they will not

1583
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:08,680
grow I'm not talking cannabis seeds I'm

1584
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:12,199
talking about seeds of everything in the

1585
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:16,119
universe and other things yeah each one

1586
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:19,559
has its own like you say if you see how

1587
01:08:16,119 --> 01:08:22,798
they propagate in nature that's probably

1588
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:26,120
what you have to do something to them

1589
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:29,319
we're growing a California

1590
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:31,759
seoa Giant Sequoia in our yard that was

1591
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:36,239
started by our neighbor who's an elder

1592
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:37,880
AR arborous n natur naturalist and he

1593
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:39,678
got the seeds while he was down in the

1594
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,759
SEO he brought them back you know the

1595
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:45,480
pine cones uh or the the seoa cones I'll

1596
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:47,920
call them um brought them back up put

1597
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:49,318
them in his freezer for 11 years that's

1598
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,838
what he did because that's what how long

1599
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:53,000
it took and then he took the seeds out

1600
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:56,238
of the freezer and propagated about 20

1601
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:59,560
of them and he's got them growing on his

1602
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:02,599
property and now we have a giant sequoia

1603
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:04,759
that's probably around 10 feet tall now

1604
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:07,359
growing in British Columbia we also have

1605
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:10,198
the Dawn Redwood growing on our property

1606
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:12,600
which is the Redwood from from China for

1607
01:09:10,198 --> 01:09:14,559
for so many years you know in America

1608
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,640
and North American and European

1609
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,120
botanists used to think that the only

1610
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:22,640
redwoods were in California but then I

1611
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:25,920
believe it was the 30s botanists were

1612
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:27,798
traveling the world and studying

1613
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,920
species and they came across this

1614
01:09:27,798 --> 01:09:32,000
firewood this was the story I heard

1615
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,239
someone could maybe prove me wrong or

1616
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,479
something when they found this firewood

1617
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:37,119
and they said wow this looks like

1618
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:38,559
Redwood can you take me to where the

1619
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:41,679
tree is and they took him to the tree

1620
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:46,719
and they're like holy this is like a

1621
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:49,000
type of SEO I think it's seoa um Meta

1622
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:51,319
Meta something and that's the scientific

1623
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,560
name so it's called a Dawn Redwood and

1624
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:55,880
this Redwood loses its needles in the

1625
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:58,440
fall and then it grows back in the

1626
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,719
springtime it definitely grows different

1627
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:02,879
but um like the Larch tree or the

1628
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,760
tamarak over in this area those are the

1629
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,520
two conifers that I can think of at the

1630
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:09,320
moment that lose their their leaves or

1631
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,600
their needles in the fall and then grow

1632
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:14,238
them back bright green in the springtime

1633
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:17,000
so um yeah we were able to propagate

1634
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:21,079
unique Conifer trees on our property

1635
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:24,479
sequia redwoods when I was young my mom

1636
01:10:21,079 --> 01:10:27,359
took me to uh King's Canyon and sequ

1637
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:31,079
national parks in California and they

1638
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:33,599
sold little redwood trees growing about

1639
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:38,119
6 Ines tall you could buy them for like

1640
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:41,920
five bucks from the camp uh was part of

1641
01:10:38,119 --> 01:10:41,920
the forest office gift

1642
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:47,039
house yeah you can still get them um I

1643
01:10:45,238 --> 01:10:49,519
belong to a couple of local Bond Die

1644
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:51,560
societies and they have uh you know

1645
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,640
spring uh where they everyone will bring

1646
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:55,840
out their sprouts and uh they'll do a

1647
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:58,520
little exchange as well as you can buy

1648
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:00,480
certain trees or some starters we've got

1649
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,480
an Oakland Bonsai as well because

1650
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:06,079

01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:43,679
years ago a couple of friends of mine uh

1668
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,199
the grower behind that and I went and

1669
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,600
visited his grow a few times and did

1670
01:11:54,198 --> 01:11:58,599
some did some some things on him as well

1671

but uh we went there and they were the

1672
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:03,400
most gracious hosts they had a little

1673
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,520
shop there um and he was growing

spectacular herb that he was selling at

1675
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,199
his shop and he really sort of showed us

1676
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:12,479
around the island of mayorca gave us the

1677
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:15,198
history of it and we rented motorcycles

1678
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:16,119
and cruised all around these epic areas

1679
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:19,719
in

1680
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:22,079

incredible road that youve just I mean

1696
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:02,800
the closest thing I ever saw to it was

1697
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:05,559
in Switzerland and Switzerland certainly

1698
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:07,520
isn't like a tropical island so yeah

1699

it's just uh you know across the water

1700
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:13,639
from Barcelona in between Africa and uh

1701
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:16,639

1714
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,920
was the motorcycle ride if you guys want

1715
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:57,079
to Google

1716
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:59,480
saoba c a l r o b a that um that is the

1717
01:13:57,079 --> 01:14:02,238
road that you can see on mayorca that of

1718
01:13:59,479 --> 01:14:05,198
course we had to ride uh motorcycles and

1719
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:08,718
rip oh John was there also that's right

1720
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:11,879
John was also on that trip Neil and John

1721
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:14,960
uh as well as Los Gardens and

1722
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:18,279
myself so much

1723
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:20,480
fun all right so I want to kind of

1724
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:22,960
bounce back to a second for the uh the

1725
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:25,279
Redwood there that was found in China

1726
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,158
you think that goes back to uh gandan

1727
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:28,800
land when it was all one land mass and

1728
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:31,279
one of those things that was left in a

1729
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,760
pocket per se if you know because I

1730
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:34,960
always kind of wondered if you know

1731
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:39,039
cannabis you know was kind of spread

1732
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:41,359
around you know via gandana land per se

1733
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:43,158
because it was never originally found in

1734
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:45,880
North America it was seemed to have been

1735
01:14:43,158 --> 01:14:47,879
found later on here but in other parts

1736
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:50,480
of the world so it's always been kind of

1737
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:52,440
fascinated about the one land mass that

1738
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:56,039
is kind of always spread out in the

1739
01:14:52,439 --> 01:14:58,158
Flora and Fauna that have survived in

1740
01:14:56,039 --> 01:15:00,639
Regional in California we also have the

1741
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:00,638
coastal

1742
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:07,638
redwoods of which you used to harvest in

1743
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:12,039
right the coastal redwoods are the

1744
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:13,400
sequoia Seer virn and the the the Sierra

1745
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:17,158
Nevadas are the

1746
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:18,719
seoa gigantium I believe and I think

1747
01:15:17,158 --> 01:15:21,279
that's a really um interesting

1748
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,480
hypothesis ATN and I totally agree with

1749
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:24,000
that I mean when we're talking about

1750
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:26,279
plants and trees we're talking about you

1751
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,639
know millions of years years of of

1752
01:15:26,279 --> 01:15:31,039
evolution and survival and uh also I you

1753
01:15:29,639 --> 01:15:33,960
know we know about

1754
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:36,679
dragonflies for example there's giant

1755
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:38,880
dragonfly migrations people should look

1756
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:42,560
up dragonfly migrations in some cases

1757
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:45,279
dragonflies migrate 250000 miles across

1758
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,440
whole uh oceans and stuff so other

1759
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:49,719
things do too you know and I think that

1760
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:52,919
birds and different things have do have

1761
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:55,359
the potential to carry seeds vas you

1762
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:57,319
know Long Way dist distances especially

1763
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:59,319
if they catch a A headwind or something

1764
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:01,719
they find themselves a thousand miles

1765
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:03,880
away in a few days you know I think

1766
01:16:01,719 --> 01:16:07,079
seeds can travel like that but I I like

1767
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:11,319
that hypothesis of the Continuum from

1768
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:11,319
the land mass uh you know with

1769
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:16,039
seeds kind of

1770
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:24,279
curiosity last week think about on our

1771
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:26,000
psychedelic Renaissance um um course

1772
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:28,840
that it's a six week course and it was

1773
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,479
the fifth week uh the speaker was a guy

1774
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:36,800
named Mark Plotkin I'd never heard of

1775
01:16:31,479 --> 01:16:39,158
Mark before uh but he is um a student of

1776
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:42,560
Richard schulties who certainly is much

1777
01:16:39,158 --> 01:16:44,599
more well known Richard schulties was

1778
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:49,039
the Harvard

1779
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:52,079
ethno uh biologist who went down to the

1780
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:55,198
South America and and Mexico and

1781
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:58,479
discovered all these psychedelic you of

1782
01:16:55,198 --> 01:17:01,079
psychedelic plants including iosa

1783
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:03,079
ceremony uh I think if it wouldn't been

1784
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:05,439
for Schult work I don't think it would

1785
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:08,238
be as popular today as it as it as it

1786
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:11,879
truly is so schy was is certainly a

1787
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:14,399
Pioneer and Mark Plotkin got a a podcast

1788
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,960
called plants of the Gods which I think

1789
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:20,238
is after Richard Shy's books that he he

1790
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:24,239
wrote with Albert Hoffman and uh his

1791
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:25,959
podcast is extremely informative and it

1792
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:28,559
the one thing the reason why I brought

1793
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:31,639
it up during this discussion is because

1794
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,239
it talks about you know ceremony and

1795
01:17:31,639 --> 01:17:36,639
iasa ceremony and how it's it's

1796
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:38,678
connected to the culture and it's

1797
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:41,440
something that you can't just

1798
01:17:38,679 --> 01:17:43,440
necessarily reproduce and Berkeley

1799
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:46,599
California in a clinic you know it just

1800
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:48,479
doesn't you can't do it by Zoom you know

1801
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:52,120
it just it just doesn't just doesn't

1802
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:55,119
translate very well right and as as much

1803
01:17:52,119 --> 01:17:58,519
of of and all this work that sh'll he

1804
01:17:55,119 --> 01:18:02,119
did in that like now plin is now uh uh

1805
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:06,440
documented just shows like how important

1806
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:10,000
it is to conserve this

1807
01:18:06,439 --> 01:18:14,319
biodiversity that exists down in what's

1808
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:17,719
left of the of the Amazon rainforest and

1809
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:20,359
and elsewhere all other you know native

1810
01:18:17,719 --> 01:18:22,880
areas that you know humans haven't you

1811
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:25,839
know deforested or completely you know

1812
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:28,239
somehow changed the natural biology

1813
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:30,760
what's going on because I'm convinced

1814
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:33,238
there's a whole Treasure Trove of

1815
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:35,880
chemistry and molecules down there in

1816
01:18:33,238 --> 01:18:38,119
plant species we don't know yet because

1817
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:39,920
it's funny there's certainly a

1818
01:18:38,119 --> 01:18:42,920
definitely an awareness from the

1819
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:46,480
indigenous cultures uh in fact there's

1820
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:49,600
still cultures today that exist today

1821
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:52,799
that have had no outside contact with

1822
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:55,280
the Western World and and to me I was to

1823
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:58,199
hear that to know that the are still

1824
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:59,880
cultures today that have not had contact

1825
01:18:58,198 --> 01:19:03,599
with with the Western world to me at

1826
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:06,159
least was was fascinating to hear but um

1827
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,719
the other thing is that just the areas

1828
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:11,559
that they're they're living on you know

1829
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:13,319
are increasingly getting smaller and

1830
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:16,000
smaller but thank God to these

1831
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:20,039
conservation efforts people like Mark

1832
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:23,639
plin and he's involved in that whole uh

1833
01:19:20,039 --> 01:19:26,039
Amazon conservation society which is you

1834
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:28,039
know again a huge huge thing that's just

1835
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:31,000
trying to keep as much of the

1836
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:33,960
biodiversity that we possibly can and

1837
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,679
learn it in a way that doesn't totally

1838
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:38,920
exploit it commercially but in a way

1839
01:19:36,679 --> 01:19:40,719
where again we can understand I mean

1840
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:43,679
there's all kinds of clinical work going

1841
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:46,719
on around DMT again partially because

1842
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:49,440
it's one of the active ingredients in ha

1843
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:51,880
iasa that coupled with the monoamine

1844
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:54,960
oxidase inhibitor harmaline so there's

1845
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:56,960
something that's that's happening there

1846
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,719
monomolecular medicine that we've talked

1847
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,639
about here on hash Church doesn't quite

1848
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:03,520
get so there's there's there's things

1849
01:20:00,639 --> 01:20:07,199
and there's clues that these indigenous

1850
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:09,480
cultures have and these Shaman know and

1851
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:12,919
they they they they know and and really

1852
01:20:09,479 --> 01:20:15,919
disease is a manifestation of some off

1853
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:18,920
balance between society and the

1854
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:21,359
environment and and and and they've

1855
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:23,960
they're they've figured it out and how

1856
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:26,960
ironic that you know here we are in the

1857
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:30,239
what the 20 first century we're looking

1858
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:33,079
to them for answers to solve our

1859
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:35,799
problems and disease and hunger and

1860
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:39,238
we're going to the shaman and we need

1861
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:42,039
these places to basically still exist

1862
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:43,479
and I was in a clubhouse room the other

1863
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:45,439
day again where they were talking about

1864
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:49,479
clinical use of

1865
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:52,238
iasa to treat you know behavioral

1866
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:54,638
disorders and it's just amazing that

1867
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:57,238
we're at that point but I I don't think

1868
01:20:54,639 --> 01:21:00,279
think that that's a true you know

1869
01:20:57,238 --> 01:21:04,519
manifestation of like where the where

1870
01:21:00,279 --> 01:21:04,519
the medicine comes from and what

1871
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:10,399
the experience is all about and I think

1872
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:11,679
some Shaman is just counting some money

1873
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:13,079
because he just made a whole lot of

1874
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:14,039
money by selling out but I'd be

1875
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:16,359
interested in what everybody else

1876
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:16,359
thought on

1877
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:27,760
that anyway yeah no I I agree that um

1878
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:29,920
yeah it's it's interesting how you know

1879
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:32,199
it's it's partly the Shamanism has been

1880
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:34,520
sort of marketed a little bit you know

1881
01:21:32,198 --> 01:21:37,519
so that's that maybe that's just a human

1882
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:40,320
thing but it reminds me of Terence

1883
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:42,920
McKenna and Dennis McKenna and Wade

1884
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:45,319
Davies and Ethan Russo different people

1885
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:47,399
that have gone you know made their life

1886
01:21:45,319 --> 01:21:50,238
out of going to South America and trying

1887
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:52,399
to find plant medicine and see how it

1888
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:55,439
can pertain to ours also psychedelic

1889
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:57,719
plant medicine it reminds of Papa new

1890
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:59,638
guine and and the diversity on Papa new

1891
01:21:57,719 --> 01:22:01,520
guini and all the tribes that live there

1892
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:04,039
and I think these these tribes have

1893
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:06,760
allied with diversity and they've allied

1894
01:22:04,039 --> 01:22:10,119
with with nature and they do have the

1895
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:13,639
key into the unknown and and We Know by

1896
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:15,519
by searching tombs and using science to

1897
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:17,760
find out about different compounds that

1898
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,679
are SE on mummies or whatever and you

1899
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:22,840
know they found cocaine on mummies in in

1900
01:22:20,679 --> 01:22:25,079
Egypt where cocaine was probably from

1901
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:26,960
America so you you would think for

1902
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:29,920
millions of

1903
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:33,039
years you know these native cultures

1904
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:35,239
were in total contact with each other

1905
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:37,198
and and probably sharing medicine you

1906
01:22:35,238 --> 01:22:39,000
know I mean I don't think you can really

1907
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:42,479
stop humans from from traveling around

1908
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,840
so I like that there's a nature magic

1909
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:47,479
still I like that we're in a modern

1910
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:50,199
world we can use science in a way that

1911
01:22:47,479 --> 01:22:52,919
we choose and I like that there's still

1912
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:55,279
nature magic out there that reminds us

1913
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:57,158
that you know

1914
01:22:55,279 --> 01:22:59,000
nature is producing these healing

1915
01:22:57,158 --> 01:23:01,799
compounds whether science proves it or

1916
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,319
not you know so in some cases our

1917
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:07,560
intuition can lead us towards health and

1918
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:09,880
this is why I feel we've dedicated our

1919
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:11,520
life towards you know nature and and

1920
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:14,279
natural healing and stuff so I

1921
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:17,199
appreciate you saying that and we are

1922
01:23:14,279 --> 01:23:20,279
recently given some iasa bark to take

1923
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:21,759
with mushrooms a little bite of iasa

1924
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:24,479
bark with

1925
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,639
psilocybin really changes the

1926
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:28,079
psychedelic experience of it and um you

1927
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:30,079
know I like that these medicines are

1928
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:32,519
coming into our modern world well he he

1929
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:34,800
was telling the story about I I forget

1930
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:38,600
the species of toad but the toad that

1931
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:42,600
they they lck right and he was showing a

1932
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:44,960
picture of that toad to another tribe

1933
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:48,760
that was thousands of miles away and

1934
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:51,520
completely isolated from them and and

1935
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:54,079
and his his uh his contact there was

1936
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:56,800
like oh we got a toad like that he goes

1937
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:58,960
no no no no this toad is from on the

1938
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,320
other side over over near Peru by the

1939
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:04,039
coast this isn't this goes no no no no

1940
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:04,960
we got a toad like that and certainly

1941
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:09,359
sure

1942
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:12,439
enough this guy showed them a toad that

1943
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:15,839
also produce the same kind of

1944
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:18,039
psychedelic effect so they identified

1945
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:19,800
like a new species of toad down there

1946
01:24:18,039 --> 01:24:22,479
that they can lick you

1947
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:26,199
know so crazy

1948
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:28,839
man you know it's what else is out there

1949
01:24:26,198 --> 01:24:30,678
I mean there's got to be I mean I mean

1950
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:34,000
and again I think that if those cultures

1951
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:36,679
go away if somehow the western

1952
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,039
civilization pollutes it just down there

1953
01:24:36,679 --> 01:24:41,600
such that there's no more indigenous

1954
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:43,560
culture all that knowledge will go away

1955
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,159
and that is fundamental knowledge that

1956
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:48,639
has been passed down for generations and

1957
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:52,479
generations and generations on how to

1958
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:55,440
live in a multi you know use using all

1959
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:57,799
of these plants and fun

1960
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:59,799
and if there's something wrong with you

1961
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:02,159
you go to the medicine man and he can

1962
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:04,480
make it better whether it's a cut with

1963
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:06,879
an infection or whether you got the

1964
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:09,279
fever or whether you got malaria I mean

1965
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,960
they have all the cures for everything

1966
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:15,039
to to live down

1967
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:17,800
there it's it's amazing to

1968
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:19,639
me so Paul stamitz is the speaker

1969
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:23,600
tomorrow it's the last

1970
01:25:19,639 --> 01:25:26,159
class it's yeah so it's the the finale

1971
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:28,360
they bring Paul in at the very end that

1972
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:30,238
full our conversation because someone

1973
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:32,519
mentioned this in chat I believe it was

1974
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:34,519
fried Piper when we were talking about

1975
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:37,760
the botney of Desire who said Paul

1976
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:40,520
stamin said that mushrooms are probably

1977
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,520
cultivating

1978
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:46,960
us to add that to the sure are man they

1979
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:50,600
sure are well that's not

1980
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:54,840
actually very far off at all because if

1981
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:58,719
we're made up of trillions of

1982
01:25:54,840 --> 01:26:02,520
microbiology I mean trillions 380

1983
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:04,840
trillion more 380 trillion that could

1984
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:07,320
possibly be pathogenic and then rest is

1985
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:10,960
sort of infinite so if we're made up of

1986
01:26:07,319 --> 01:26:16,198
all of that then these are all thinking

1987
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:18,840
living breathing exceda eating

1988
01:26:16,198 --> 01:26:21,799
beings that are highly intelligent

1989
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:24,079
because they are still here in numerous

1990
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:26,560
amounts so I always say you know you

1991
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:28,319
might as well Join the microb Revolution

1992
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:31,360
because there's a lot more of them than

1993
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:33,719
there are us and also the other thought

1994
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:35,319
is that you know e everything that

1995
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:37,319
you're sitting around you know people

1996
01:26:35,319 --> 01:26:39,279
talk about Plastics and how it's bad for

1997
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:43,840
the Earth and yes all of that stuff it

1998
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:46,719
takes so long but every single thing

1999
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:48,840
that feeds us every single thing that we

2000
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:51,439
like type on the fact that we're looking

2001
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:53,719
through this computer everything

2002
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:55,198
everything everything came from the

2003
01:26:53,719 --> 01:26:56,719
Earth

2004
01:26:55,198 --> 01:27:00,439
and I just think that that's interesting

2005
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:04,239
if we like take that mindscape and we

2006
01:27:00,439 --> 01:27:07,118
and I just know that when we're gone the

2007
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:08,919
microbiology is going to proliferate and

2008
01:27:07,118 --> 01:27:11,000
and totally take care of that because

2009
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:13,719
the Earth is what made it of course

2010
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,560
totally out of balance with Humanity but

2011
01:27:13,719 --> 01:27:18,239
still it's just a really interesting

2012
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:21,280
conversation that you know when you take

2013
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:24,479
plant medicine seems to come up in the

2014
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:28,238
you know cerebral cortex of um you know

2015
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:30,479
discussion to to set the mind to so I

2016
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:32,759
just think that it's really interesting

2017
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:34,479
when we talk about closed loops and when

2018
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:37,039
we talk about the Earth and we talk

2019
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:39,879
about how we're all intermixed and

2020
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:43,079
involved and how science is related on

2021
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:45,760
such a small microcosm you know point

2022
01:27:43,079 --> 01:27:50,760
that we have to express and something we

2023
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:52,520
have to you know explain but it is just

2024
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:55,199
it's such a wide observational

2025
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:57,000
experience that's getting us there so I

2026
01:27:55,198 --> 01:28:00,559
think that it's important that we don't

2027
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:03,158
just doubt or let go of that in

2028
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:07,000
intuitive observational experience that

2029
01:28:03,158 --> 01:28:09,000
we're having to help guide us to you

2030
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,760
know a much better place than we're in

2031
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,319
right now because we have that ability

2032
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:16,920
and the plant medicines continue to show

2033
01:28:13,319 --> 01:28:19,198
us that sorry for the rant but it's big

2034
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,199
out

2035
01:28:19,719 --> 01:28:24,520
there everything is going to degrade

2036
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:26,960
except for fluoropolymers we don't know

2037
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:31,239
what happens to them they seem to last

2038
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:34,560
forever so fluoropolymers might be uh

2039
01:28:31,238 --> 01:28:36,759
yeah so so Teflon right dental floss

2040
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:40,159
yeah so so um you know billions and

2041
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:44,000
years from now the only thing that will

2042
01:28:40,158 --> 01:28:48,198
exist from us is the Fukushima radiation

2043
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:50,800
and and the uh and T dental floss those

2044
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:56,039
be our Footprints that's

2045
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:56,039
right the Fukushima dental floss era

2046
01:28:57,439 --> 01:29:01,439
I can only imagine how many times we've

2047
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:04,279
gone through this cycle and don't even

2048
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:06,599
have any idea wouldn't that be an error

2049
01:29:04,279 --> 01:29:09,079
not an error

2050
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:10,719
error we learned from Paul statement

2051
01:29:09,079 --> 01:29:13,079
said there was and I took this course on

2052
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:14,679
Cortez that it was there's been five

2053
01:29:13,079 --> 01:29:16,158
mass extinctions obviously he didn't

2054
01:29:14,679 --> 01:29:18,118
make this up but he was teaching it to

2055
01:29:16,158 --> 01:29:19,920
us there have been five mass extinctions

2056
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:22,599
on Earth where it damn near wiped out

2057
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,800
all of life on earth and the last one I

2058
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:27,600
think was called the PT EX

2059
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:30,079
Extinction and what he was suggesting

2060
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:33,920
was that life on Earth came back from

2061
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:35,920
you know the BC Coast Area and that

2062
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,600
repopulated the earth I mean you know

2063
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:40,920
maybe there's some more there but I like

2064
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:43,159
that you know even during mass

2065
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:45,118
extinctions the Earth re repopulates

2066
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:47,638
itself and the hopie the Hy have the

2067
01:29:45,118 --> 01:29:49,960
same prophecy that they say that this

2068
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:52,159
humanity is on its fifth stage of

2069
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:55,279
humanity and they believe that we came

2070
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:58,719
out of the Rocks so so if there was some

2071
01:29:55,279 --> 01:30:00,759
kind of a big cataclysmic event of heat

2072
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:03,399
or something that made it so the Earth

2073
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:05,719
was inhabitable it makes sense that we

2074
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:08,479
would come out of the Rocks you know the

2075
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:11,039
ones that did survive so there's a super

2076
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:13,238
interesting uh the prophecy Rock people

2077
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:16,319
can look up the the prophecy rock down

2078
01:30:13,238 --> 01:30:18,079
at Four Corners uh in the southwest and

2079
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:20,599
it talks about you know where Humanity

2080
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:22,880
goes in two different directions and it

2081
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:25,800
might be interesting that we're in an

2082
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:27,679
area like that right now you know where

2083
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:30,079
there's just two types of things going

2084
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:31,960
on and I like the idea that we're you

2085
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:33,559
know connecting with indigenous cultures

2086
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:37,118
Mark I I'll let you say something again

2087
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:41,600
because I think that we can all take on

2088
01:30:37,118 --> 01:30:43,880
getting um local plants you know and

2089
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,400
native plants back onto our property and

2090
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:49,239
bringing in more native plants into our

2091
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:51,799
polyculture is really important and

2092
01:30:49,238 --> 01:30:53,479
working on connecting with First Nations

2093
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:55,719
and Native cultures even in North

2094
01:30:53,479 --> 01:30:57,519
America where we are at the moment you

2095
01:30:55,719 --> 01:30:59,118
know cultures native all over the world

2096
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:02,280
are very important um we've been

2097
01:30:59,118 --> 01:31:04,759
recently contacted uh by gw's smoke

2098
01:31:02,279 --> 01:31:07,479
break and and the um the family there to

2099
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:10,600
to work with the Lakota um you know in

2100
01:31:07,479 --> 01:31:12,559
in uh South Dakota and you know and and

2101
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:14,639
if that if that works out you know it'

2102
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:17,800
be amazing to be able to collaborate

2103
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:20,520
with native peoples to bring you know to

2104
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:23,320
help enhance their you know what they

2105
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:26,119
have to offer us because in so many

2106
01:31:23,319 --> 01:31:28,559
cases is you know that's been wiped out

2107
01:31:26,118 --> 01:31:31,319
through residential schools and

2108
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:34,119
reservations and all this stuff so

2109
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:36,479
colonialization but information is still

2110
01:31:34,118 --> 01:31:38,839
there I think that we have the ability

2111
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:40,519
to still retrieve it and I think that

2112
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:42,159
the retrieval of that information is

2113
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:44,960
going to come from the earth because

2114
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:46,519
she's always been interacting with us

2115
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,639
that's the funny thing we you know if we

2116
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:50,920
think about that like we're interacting

2117
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:52,960
on certain levels and in certain time

2118
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:54,560
periods but the Earth has always been

2119
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:57,760
interacting

2120
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:59,880
with Humanity or with the planet or I

2121
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:02,199
mean with the the plants and the animals

2122
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:03,600
that are on it so there's there's some

2123
01:32:02,198 --> 01:32:05,960
kind of a

2124
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:08,679
resonant uh

2125
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:10,439
Everlasting higher

2126
01:32:08,679 --> 01:32:12,158
intelligence um it's there for the

2127
01:32:10,439 --> 01:32:13,599
taking like the all knowing and it's

2128
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:16,359
totally there for the taking all we have

2129
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,840
to do is allow it in and and on that

2130
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:20,519
note I believe we have to to take to

2131
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:22,119
take off and get our seeds planted we

2132

01:37:39,079 --> 01:37:45,238
collaboration really hard to push it

2261
01:37:41,079 --> 01:37:47,359
Forward I appreciate you all so so much

2262
01:37:45,238 --> 01:37:49,559
thank you thanks for coming guys we

2263
01:37:47,359 --> 01:37:52,238
appreciate you as well and have a great

2264
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:56,000
day in the garden getting those seeds

2265
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:58,759
into the into the soil speaking of the

2266
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,560
culture we're actually defining that

2267
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:03,119
because uh uh as you know I'm working

2268
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:04,920
with the veterans Action Council and one

2269
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:07,439
of our members Michael kows who's been

2270
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:10,199
working at the United Nations and we're

2271
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:11,960
actually working on submitting questions

2272
01:38:10,198 --> 01:38:14,158
and our green paper to the United

2273
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:15,960
Nations uh will be submitting that this

2274
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:19,039
week but one of the things that we have

2275
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:21,279
found is that United Nations accepts

2276
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:24,800
cultures and especially specific

2277
01:38:21,279 --> 01:38:27,319
cultures so um across Ross all uh

2278
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:29,719
treaties uh so we're trying to define

2279
01:38:27,319 --> 01:38:31,198
the Canabis culture because as we know

2280
01:38:29,719 --> 01:38:32,520
it's been defined and we're trying to

2281
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:34,359
Define it from more of a world

2282
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:36,920
perspective as opposed to a US

2283
01:38:34,359 --> 01:38:38,719
perspective even though the US has had

2284
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:41,199
its influence on the

2285
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:43,198
culture the culture of cannabis is

2286
01:38:41,198 --> 01:38:44,279
worldwide and as we know AC crosses

2287
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:47,919
every

2288
01:38:44,279 --> 01:38:49,479
socioeconomic uh region so um it's going

2289
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:53,520
to be very interesting to see what

2290
01:38:49,479 --> 01:38:56,118
happens but yes we're we're going to uh

2291
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:58,639
be relying on the culture at the UN

2292
01:38:56,118 --> 01:39:01,399
level because the persecution of

2293
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:03,599
cannabis has you know done nothing but

2294
01:39:01,399 --> 01:39:06,638
help us perpetuate our own growing

2295
01:39:03,599 --> 01:39:10,239
growing cycle our processing processing

2296
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:12,440
Styles um how we ingest how we use pass

2297
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:14,238
it to the left you know all these

2298
01:39:12,439 --> 01:39:15,719
different situations you know you come

2299
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:17,638
together cannabis seems to be rather

2300
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:21,239
communal you know we come together in

2301
01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:23,400
circles how it's produced Etc so um it's

2302
01:39:21,238 --> 01:39:26,559
going to be very interesting to see as

2303
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:29,399
we challenge things uh culturally

2304
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:32,679
because uh you know there is a cannabis

2305
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:35,519
culture it's it's it's definable it's

2306
01:39:32,679 --> 01:39:38,679
it's actually malleable in shapes from

2307
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:41,440
Regional names from genetics to even

2308
01:39:38,679 --> 01:39:43,158
what cannabis is that have crossed I

2309
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:45,919
mean how many different Generations you

2310
01:39:43,158 --> 01:39:48,359
know if I say a Wade and you know a

2311
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:50,599
skunk man you know I say a lid they

2312
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:54,198
understand it but my generation doesn't

2313
01:39:50,599 --> 01:39:57,239
know what a lid is per se or why the

2314
01:39:54,198 --> 01:39:59,839
term lid came from you know cannabis in

2315
01:39:57,238 --> 01:40:02,158
the first place so it's just also

2316
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:04,560
fascinating how Through the Ages from

2317
01:40:02,158 --> 01:40:07,319
going back to the term Muggles as

2318
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:09,960
opposed to other different terminologies

2319
01:40:07,319 --> 01:40:13,639
that have been cultural subsets that

2320
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:16,359
have crossed every boundary around the

2321
01:40:13,639 --> 01:40:18,560
world to continually maintain things I

2322
01:40:16,359 --> 01:40:20,799
mean look even as a culture we all kind

2323
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,719
of gravitated and met where in Amsterdam

2324
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,360
because there's a huge culture of

2325
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:28,359
cannabis there that was happening that

2326
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:30,759
they were you know growing judging etc

2327
01:40:28,359 --> 01:40:33,920
etc and those things that have continued

2328
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:36,920
to spread out I mean Cannabis Cup wasn't

2329
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:40,079
the first one to ever judge cannabis but

2330
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:43,760
it was a cultural recognition spread out

2331
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:46,559
through a magazine Etc that Drew us to a

2332
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:49,199
destination where we all met and

2333
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:51,159
continued to perpetuate this so it also

2334
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:53,960
goes back to the discussion you know did

2335
01:40:51,158 --> 01:40:56,839
we perpetuate cannabis or did cannabis

2336
01:40:53,960 --> 01:41:00,039
perpetuate us to you know proliferate

2337
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:02,319
her as well so uh just some interesting

2338
01:41:00,039 --> 01:41:05,079
cultural distinctions and understandings

2339
01:41:02,319 --> 01:41:08,279
that we're going to be pushing to try to

2340
01:41:05,079 --> 01:41:10,920
liberate things worldwide

2341
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:13,519
further

2342
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:16,079
stuff yeah trippy thoughts for sure

2343
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:19,239
always in that cycle are we perpetuating

2344
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:22,039
it or is it perpetuating us probably a

2345
01:41:19,238 --> 01:41:24,638
nice balance of the two no doubt and

2346
01:41:22,039 --> 01:41:27,198
obviously that would depend on on your

2347
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:29,599
perspective which seems to depend on

2348
01:41:27,198 --> 01:41:32,839
your attitude all these filters that we

2349
01:41:29,599 --> 01:41:34,719
put in the way to perceive I guess

2350
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:36,679
that's what this experience is it's all

2351
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:39,039
these filters and this five sense prison

2352
01:41:36,679 --> 01:41:41,679
that we seem to be yeah and back in the

2353
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:46,479
day we used to say who are The Grateful

2354
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:46,480
Dead and why are they following me

2355
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:55,519
right and the answer

2356
01:41:51,479 --> 01:41:59,718
was drugs I don't know where's the next

2357
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:59,719
show I like your's answer

2358
01:42:00,279 --> 01:42:06,158
better Drugs That's why went I we

2359
01:42:04,279 --> 01:42:08,118
couldn't get good drugs where we I mean

2360
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:10,359
you could get drugs but you can get good

2361
01:42:08,118 --> 01:42:12,279
drugs or the drugs dude you wouldn't

2362
01:42:10,359 --> 01:42:14,039
believe the mushrooms you find on dead

2363
01:42:12,279 --> 01:42:16,960
tour you wouldn't believe the LSD

2364
01:42:14,039 --> 01:42:20,158
they've got on dead tour and you know it

2365
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:23,760
just drives drove people there just you

2366
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:26,118
know sociologically because of you know

2367
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:28,400
bad access you know if you're new into

2368
01:42:26,118 --> 01:42:29,960
the drugs scene you know you're the old

2369
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:31,439
people in town don't know who the [ __ ]

2370
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:33,359
you are and aren't going to deal or deal

2371
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:36,479
with you per se those are things that

2372
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:39,839
are earned again culturally how we even

2373
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:43,079
access or allow access to certain you

2374
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:45,960
know uh levels of cannabis early on we

2375
01:42:43,079 --> 01:42:48,079
had access to shitty Mexican it wasn't

2376
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:50,279
until we earned respect that we oh this

2377
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:54,279
is kind but oh oh now this is the

2378

01:43:06,198 --> 01:43:10,919
memories on Shakedown Street is this

2385
01:43:08,118 --> 01:43:13,960
dreadlock hippie walking up holding this

2386

mushrooms she like I think I found the

2389
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:24,319
spot

2390
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:31,239
yeah I loved it didn't I look I didn't

2391
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:33,399
dig the music but I appreciated the

2392
01:43:31,238 --> 01:43:35,238
culture I mean there was always some bus

2393
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:37,719
at the end with somebody with a huge

2394
01:43:35,238 --> 01:43:39,718
chalkboard with somebody who was calling

2395
01:43:37,719 --> 01:43:41,480
out from the show like okay they just

2396
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:44,239
played this and then they would mark

2397
01:43:41,479 --> 01:43:46,638
down on the actual chalkboard what song

2398
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:48,118
had just played inside the show so

2399
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:49,679
people could be like oh outside in

2400
01:43:48,118 --> 01:43:51,920
Shakedown Street like oh wow they're

2401
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:53,800
playing this this so awesome and it's

2402
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:56,199
literally go around and then Play the

2403
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:58,960
song that was on from some other show

2404
01:43:56,198 --> 01:44:02,079
that was recorded probably the night

2405
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:04,039
before it's really [ __ ] trippy I mean

2406
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:07,559
I've never SE so this was during during

2407
01:44:04,039 --> 01:44:09,760
the show you were out outside the venue

2408
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:11,560
in the Shakedown Street area yeah while

2409
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:14,840
the live Grateful Dead show was going on

2410
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:18,080
in yep in like Oakland Oakland Coliseum

2411
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:20,880
and stuff like that oh yeah many times

2412
01:44:18,079 --> 01:44:22,719
yeah it it's very common you know I just

2413
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:25,679
didn't dig the music I mean I dug the

2414
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:27,800
scene I like the people but you know it

2415
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:30,118
just didn't carry it for me I was a I

2416
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:32,560
liked hardcore I like jazz I grew up in

2417
01:44:30,118 --> 01:44:34,960
jazz in New Orleans so I appreciated the

2418
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:37,840
free flowing of it it just wasn't my

2419
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:40,560
thing but the scene and the people that

2420
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:42,079
were there I mean that was the only part

2421
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,440
place I could literally be walking

2422
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:48,840
around tripping see a guy pop open a

2423
01:44:45,439 --> 01:44:52,238
huge Tupperware jar just brimming with

2424
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:54,119
the fattest [ __ ] weed I've ever seen

2425
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:56,839
and like hey br brother can you spare a

2426
01:44:54,118 --> 01:44:58,719
bud and you know he'd be like sure dude

2427
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:01,400
and then just [ __ ] chucked a bud

2428
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:03,279
right [ __ ] at me I'm like thanks bud

2429
01:45:01,399 --> 01:45:05,359
and [ __ ] went over to a tree at the

2430
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:07,559
end of Shakedown Street sat under the

2431
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:10,158
tree you know in the shade and just kind

2432
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:12,599
of smoked a bud to try to come down oh

2433
01:45:10,158 --> 01:45:14,519
yeah no other place could I have done

2434
01:45:12,599 --> 01:45:17,440
something like that and be a [ __ ]

2435
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:22,040
punk with my jacket and you know my

2436
01:45:17,439 --> 01:45:24,079
tattoos and [ __ ] like that hell no but

2437
01:45:22,039 --> 01:45:25,920
the Grateful Dead accepted us all it was

2438
01:45:24,079 --> 01:45:29,238
kind of weird loved

2439
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:32,440
it yeah dead heads are pretty friendly

2440
01:45:29,238 --> 01:45:34,519
pretty open to anything you know if you

2441
01:45:32,439 --> 01:45:37,039
didn't cause any problems you know I

2442
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:40,679
mean occasionally they'd get skin heads

2443
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:42,719
in there and they'd have to you know

2444
01:45:40,679 --> 01:45:44,319
have to have have issues but for the

2445
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:46,840
most part yeah it was a

2446
01:45:44,319 --> 01:45:48,799
free-for-all party for those of you

2447
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:52,039
don't know what we're talking about is

2448
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:53,520
before a well during and after Grateful

2449
01:45:52,039 --> 01:45:55,679
Dead concerts

2450
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:57,719
they would just have this traveling

2451
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:01,359
circus of many thousand people that

2452
01:45:57,719 --> 01:46:05,719
would just come around and make a living

2453
01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:09,039
off of selling food and alcohol and

2454
01:46:05,719 --> 01:46:12,158
shirts and Frisbee and bowls and

2455
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:14,079
crystals and if you could sell it I

2456
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:17,079
remember seeing things like just

2457
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:19,198
lighters and papers I mean if you needed

2458
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:21,238
papers at a Grateful Dead show you went

2459
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:23,719
down to Shakedown Street there was some

2460
01:46:21,238 --> 01:46:25,559
head shop down there that was set up on

2461
01:46:23,719 --> 01:46:28,439
the back of their Ford truck and they

2462
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:31,360
had all kinds of papers and bowls and

2463
01:46:28,439 --> 01:46:34,519
yeah don't forget glass pipes yeah glass

2464
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:37,118
pipes yeah absolutely yep yep I we see

2465
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:39,880
like Marvel Slinger and those guys out

2466
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:42,920
on tour with their their you know heady

2467
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:45,800
cases full of glass and you know

2468
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:48,158
flashlight to you know sell pretty hey

2469
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:50,480
pieces and yeah it was a whole scene

2470
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:53,479
that kind of developed around them and

2471
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:54,959
in some cities that was the reason why

2472
01:46:53,479 --> 01:46:57,319
The Grateful Dead weren't allowed to

2473
01:46:54,960 --> 01:47:00,079
come back because they're like oh my God

2474
01:46:57,319 --> 01:47:02,399
it's [ __ ] travelous circus of drugs

2475
01:47:00,079 --> 01:47:04,719
and then you know all the high school

2476
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:07,198
kids in the area would catch oh we could

2477
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:10,239
go to the Grateful Dead show stock up on

2478
01:47:07,198 --> 01:47:12,079
all kinds of drugs they buy acid and bu

2479
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:14,479
you know all kinds of drugs and then

2480
01:47:12,079 --> 01:47:16,639
there would be all kinds of problems for

2481
01:47:14,479 --> 01:47:20,039
months after the Grateful Dead have left

2482
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:21,279
town because there's this whole wake of

2483
01:47:20,039 --> 01:47:24,920
you

2484
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:27,599
know you know it sh was fun it was back

2485
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:32,480
in the day it was so much [ __ ] fun

2486
01:47:27,599 --> 01:47:34,560
man a wake of Freedom that's was yeah

2487
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:36,879
well it was it was a real life adventure

2488
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:38,760
and you know way before it got really

2489
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:43,359
big like I started seeing him in the

2490
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:45,320
late 70s and like they were still on

2491
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:47,118
like Saturday Night Live like I was

2492
01:47:45,319 --> 01:47:50,319
there the night that John Belushi came

2493
01:47:47,118 --> 01:47:53,960
out um on stage and sang with him uh for

2494
01:47:50,319 --> 01:47:56,158
a song before that was in 198 80 and you

2495
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:59,319
know it was just back then in the early

2496
01:47:56,158 --> 01:48:02,839
80s it wasn't a big thing like people

2497
01:47:59,319 --> 01:48:05,399
didn't really know about them and like

2498
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:08,520
you'd go to an arena and you'd be able

2499
01:48:05,399 --> 01:48:11,799
like like um ATM was saying you'd be

2500
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:13,440
able to smoke weed in an arena normally

2501
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:16,480
where if you were at a rock concert

2502
01:48:13,439 --> 01:48:18,439
they'd bust your ass for smoking weed it

2503
01:48:16,479 --> 01:48:20,718
was just a different set of rules for

2504
01:48:18,439 --> 01:48:22,399
when the Grateful Dead came to town Bill

2505
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:23,480
Graham and the other promoters would say

2506
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:25,879
hey man

2507
01:48:23,479 --> 01:48:28,399
this group if you just let them smoke

2508
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:30,159
their weed they're just going to you

2509
01:48:28,399 --> 01:48:32,559
know they're not going to bust chairs or

2510
01:48:30,158 --> 01:48:35,279
not they just want to watch the music

2511
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:37,199
and come and go and again I remember

2512
01:48:35,279 --> 01:48:40,479
being at almond brother shows and at

2513
01:48:37,198 --> 01:48:42,439
Neil Young shows and other shows where I

2514
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:44,519
had like a little one hitter and some

2515
01:48:42,439 --> 01:48:46,799
guy was giving me the flashlight all

2516
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:49,520
night you know and you could be at a

2517
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:52,079
Grateful Dead show and just be smoking

2518
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:54,599
just all over the place great man that's

2519
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:56,880
that's the beauty Vancouver because all

2520
01:48:54,599 --> 01:49:00,119
shows in Vancouver are a Grateful Dead

2521
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:02,159
show in regards to smoking cannabis I'll

2522
01:49:00,118 --> 01:49:04,598
never forget the last time I was smoking

2523
01:49:02,158 --> 01:49:07,279
joints which was a fair while ago I saw

2524
01:49:04,599 --> 01:49:11,039
Neil Young play a solo show at the Queen

2525
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:14,279
Elizabeth theater and I rolled like 20

2526
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:17,519
huge fat joints and I wrote the names of

2527
01:49:14,279 --> 01:49:19,840
my favorite 20 Neil Young songs on those

2528
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:22,760
joints and I was sitting in like the

2529
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:24,639
sixth row on the floor right like in the

2530
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:28,159
Queen Elizabeth theater in Vancouver

2531
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:30,359
which is a pretty awesome venue and uh I

2532
01:49:28,158 --> 01:49:33,399
I I smoked one of those joints each time

2533
01:49:30,359 --> 01:49:37,118
he uh he did another song and uh I think

2534
01:49:33,399 --> 01:49:41,039
I ended up smoking like 14 of the 20 how

2535
01:49:37,118 --> 01:49:42,679
cool yeah it was awesome I started by

2536
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:44,639
the time the song was over the joint was

2537
01:49:42,679 --> 01:49:47,199
still going so I'd have to pass that one

2538
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:49,599
down was it just him solo Marcus or did

2539
01:49:47,198 --> 01:49:52,960
he have a band with him solo with about

2540
01:49:49,599 --> 01:49:54,960
six to eight acoustic guitars a standout

2541
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:58,158
piano a

2542
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:58,750
banjo and feel like I'm forgetting oh a

2543
01:49:58,158 --> 01:50:01,198
baby

2544
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:04,039
[Music]

2545
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:05,678
grand definitely a couple of shows worth

2546
01:50:04,039 --> 01:50:07,359
checking out it was two nights at the

2547
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:09,399
Queen Elizabeth theater and I I want to

2548
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:14,198
say it was like

2549
01:50:09,399 --> 01:50:16,118
90 six or 97 maybe I saw the Almond

2550
01:50:14,198 --> 01:50:19,759
Brothers the same year at the same venue

2551
01:50:16,118 --> 01:50:24,079
and it was also a unbelievable wonderful

2552
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:27,480
experience of just mass mass puffing in

2553
01:50:24,079 --> 01:50:29,479
a super beautiful old school venue where

2554
01:50:27,479 --> 01:50:32,959
everything's like sort of inspirational

2555
01:50:29,479 --> 01:50:36,118
you know all the chairs are like red

2556
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:38,960
Valour I mean it's not it's not it's not

2557
01:50:36,118 --> 01:50:42,399
a caricature but I used to

2558
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:46,118
smell that Herb At The Grateful Dead

2559
01:50:42,399 --> 01:50:49,198
show and say that's herb not this

2560
01:50:46,118 --> 01:50:51,479
Mexican Brown [ __ ] or I remember getting

2561
01:50:49,198 --> 01:50:53,879
aaao back in the day and it definitely

2562
01:50:51,479 --> 01:50:56,919
had a definitely a a different flavor to

2563
01:50:53,880 --> 01:51:00,880
it but like many dead head kids who are

2564
01:50:56,920 --> 01:51:04,000
out on tour we started smoking nor cow

2565
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:06,118
grown weed out on Grateful Dead tour and

2566
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,639
there was no going back they're like oh

2567
01:51:06,118 --> 01:51:12,238
my God this is just a higher grade of

2568
01:51:09,639 --> 01:51:14,118
cannabis and the first time I smoked

2569
01:51:12,238 --> 01:51:16,198
blonde hash was out on Grateful Dead

2570
01:51:14,118 --> 01:51:18,679
tour we used to always get like the red

2571
01:51:16,198 --> 01:51:20,638
lebanes or the dark stuff I remember

2572
01:51:18,679 --> 01:51:23,158
getting stuff where you could still see

2573
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:25,078
the stamp or the imprint of the hash

2574
01:51:23,158 --> 01:51:27,719
like the Turkish hash you know in the

2575
01:51:25,078 --> 01:51:30,158
New York metropolitan area but the first

2576
01:51:27,719 --> 01:51:32,639
time I had smoked blonde hash was yeah

2577
01:51:30,158 --> 01:51:35,359
out on out on Grateful Dead

2578
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:38,800
tour and this quarantine got us missing

2579
01:51:35,359 --> 01:51:40,439
concerts no doubt I'm gonna cut it short

2580
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:42,159
today we have eight more minutes I just

2581
01:51:40,439 --> 01:51:44,039
wanted to let everyone know that I my

2582
01:51:42,158 --> 01:51:46,920
son's down at the Field playing soccer

2583
01:51:44,039 --> 01:51:48,760
and he's uh wanting Dada to come down

2584
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:50,719
and kick the ball around and what what

2585
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:52,239
could you imagine being better than

2586
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:54,319
after a couple of hours of hanging out

2587
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:56,399
with you guys and puffing bowls and

2588
01:51:54,319 --> 01:51:58,639
enjoying some great dialogue I get to go

2589
01:51:56,399 --> 01:52:01,319
outside and run around with my six and a

2590
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:03,480
half-year-old son who's just starting to

2591
01:52:01,319 --> 01:52:05,238
get kind of cool with soccer he wasn't

2592
01:52:03,479 --> 01:52:07,919
really understanding before but now he

2593
01:52:05,238 --> 01:52:10,479
can run and kick the ball and you know

2594
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:12,560
you just uh I can see why pride is one

2595
01:52:10,479 --> 01:52:14,279
of the Seven Deadly Sins Not that I'm

2596
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:16,159
like super religious and follow the

2597
01:52:14,279 --> 01:52:19,118
Bible but be careful with that [ __ ] the

2598
01:52:16,158 --> 01:52:21,479
love you have for your kids is blinding

2599
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:24,598
it's it's it's the reason why you're a

2600
01:52:21,479 --> 01:52:26,839
parent and it's just it's the best

2601
01:52:24,599 --> 01:52:29,279
treasure that you have for all the

2602
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:31,119
headaches and all the sweating and

2603
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:34,118
you're worried about again bringing

2604
01:52:31,118 --> 01:52:35,679
someone into the world I I think being a

2605
01:52:34,118 --> 01:52:38,880
parent is the best thing you could do in

2606
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:42,319
this life and yeah my kid just turned 24

2607
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:44,199
years old man and to see him out in he's

2608
01:52:42,319 --> 01:52:47,039
in the industry Marcus and he's out

2609
01:52:44,198 --> 01:52:49,799
making hash and making a good name for

2610
01:52:47,039 --> 01:52:53,198
himself and he got himself a modulus

2611
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:54,760
base and uh yeah

2612
01:52:53,198 --> 01:52:56,799
I don't know I mean to those of you who

2613
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:58,880
aren't parents I guess it's something

2614
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:01,599
again that you can't relate to but yeah

2615
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:04,319
that that unconditional love that you

2616
01:53:01,599 --> 01:53:07,119
get from your children here's a good

2617
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:09,880
reason they might want you to mark

2618
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:12,519
because if it's not us good parents

2619
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:17,199
having children who will have the

2620
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:17,199
children of the future God protect

2621
01:53:18,039 --> 01:53:23,399
us yeah I always tell my kids when you

2622
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:25,239
set foot out your our front door you're

2623
01:53:23,399 --> 01:53:29,198
