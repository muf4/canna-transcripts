just the other day so we are now sitting

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,478
here in my backyard it was very cloudy

22
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,478
when we came out and it has since well

23
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:16,599
Johnny said let's go as high as we can

24
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:18,039
go and get high and so simultaneously of

25
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:21,000
course we've been doing the beautiful

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,360
time lapse of the clouds uh dissipating

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,560
over the over the ocean it's amazing

28
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,400
though it is it's like totally like

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,640
clamped in you saw nothing that opened

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,520
right up and it's like nature at its

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,920
best so we really you know we haven't

32
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,319
had much planned for today's puff

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,240
Wednesday but we thought let's get

34
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,359
outside let's puff a bunch of bowls and

35
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:41,679
let's show these people some Drone

36
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,359
footage so that's kind of the plan I got

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,439
some sift from um that trim bone well

38
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,039
let's start with getting high on Johnny

39
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,959
B's sift from the trim bin so we're

40
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,118
going to show you this under the macro

41
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,000
uh video camera as well as the macro

42
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,680
camera uh photography camera so you can

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,478
see the quality of it it's got a nice

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,520
little sheen on the edge of it cuz he's

45
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,519
had it in his pocket put in my pocket we

46
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,519
won't be able to clean it up but we will

47
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,318
well that's not true that's not true we

48
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,478
you should try it we don't need to I

49
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,878
thought about putting this in the

50
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,239
freezer and smashing it with in like but

51
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,639
you know like you know when you get that

52
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,560
resin and it's already like past that

53
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:19,039
point you can't sift it yep like when

54
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,719
it's stuck to that card I was going to

55
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:24,479
like freeze it and smash

56
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:28,479
it got a lovely smell what's the

57
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,119
cultivar it's mixes mixes of of of kush

58
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,878
from what I understand so what what it

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,400
was a great friend of mine um he was

60
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:35,560
harvesting and he was using of course

61
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,360
his May one he's an organic grower and

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,239
that's why I really appreciate him he's

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,640
like

64
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,239

104
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:16,000
gorgeous this is like a beautiful

105
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,879
afternoon Pacific West Coast of course

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,399
I'm trying to squish this

107
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:24,279
out how' that work out for you see look

108
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,279
at the residue in there

109
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,240
yeah a little bit little bit of

110
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,439
resi carboned it up a little bit not too

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,240
too bad it's coming off the uh off the

112
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,399
nail but still a little bit might have

113
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,240
to torch it a tiny little bit I only

114
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,079
heated it up for a very short amount of

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,478
time if I was hitting bubble or oil uh I

116
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,800
probably wouldn't have gotten the same

117
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,839
amount of

118
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,478
uh actually let's clean it up a lot

119
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,519
better now well we're deep in the fall

120
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:02,800
experience here now in British Columbia

121
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:05,560
we are deep into fall we had 29 days of

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,280
rain out of 31 days in October which was

123
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,199
uh did we pretty impressive I wouldn't

124
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:16,319
hit that just yet it would be probably

125
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,319
too hot this guy's timing me like three

126
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,839
two like wait ding I wouldn't hit it

127
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:29,440
just yet myself but it's it's going to

128
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,439
be really hot Johnny Be likes Hot rips

129
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,800
that was a hot rip that was a

130
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,319
8900

131
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,079
[Laughter]

132
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,599
Johnny how was

133
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,079
that it's a little hot let me clean it

134
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,360
out maybe sorry about that that's okay

135
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:01,639
don't be

136
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,639
sorry you know what

137
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,598
I really find the difference

138
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,720
between I don't think you'll agree with

139
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:13,279
this between like say the dry sift hit

140
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,000
with the flavor then from that like

141
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,839
being

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,160
rosin right yeah I mean I think there's

143
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,079
still a substantial amount of

144
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,360
contaminant that sift does look really

145
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:26,359
nice I know but I think it's more than

146
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,000
likely you know in the I don't know 80

147
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,919
to 90 range you give it that much well

148
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,759
maybe you know what it melts and that's

149
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:35,918
what I pressed it out it did melt at

150
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,479
first it just carboned up really fast

151
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,639
it' be interesting to see how it

152
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:40,959
squishes to be honest have you used the

153
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,120
sasquash

154
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,680
Press no well dude I've got one in my

155
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,800
office we could easily squish that out

156
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,240
for you if you like I kind of want to

157
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,439
learn this

158
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,478
Al see what just happened I brought

159
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,800
sift and you know what's going to happen

160
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,560
next right I suspect we're going to go

161
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,840
squished it in the in there if you want

162
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,280
just kind I just like

163
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,679
this all right you know how much I love

164
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,038
to squish things right so um I haven't I

165
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,240
haven't had the pleasures even using the

166
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:16,240
Sasquatch yet well I mean uh why don't

167
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,639
we take this particular resin right here

168
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,120
I will uh show you guys what it looks

169
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,280
like so you can kind of have an idea

170
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,680
what it is we're talking about here by

171
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,000
no means the lowest quality this saw

172
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,000
macro up yeah well they're going to they

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,240
that's for sure

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,399
still nice to give them a

175
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,680
little yummy pretty big chug too it's

176
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,079
not bad it's got to be like three or

177
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,918
four grams

178
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,839
no we'll weigh it we'll see we'll weigh

179
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,878
it and we'll find out uh what kind of

180
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,399
returns we get why don't we take them go

181
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,919
into the office and squish that out in

182
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,638
the sasquash Press I'm really excited

183
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:52,399
right now [ __ ] right so we're going

184
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,759
to I want to squish this you know what I

185
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,198
want to see oozing res well let's bring

186
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,759
them with us and we'll take you guys now

187
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,759
and go squish some hash

188
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,520
all right so Johnny B and I are inside

189
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,960
the office here we got the bubble man's

190
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:09,799
world Customs plate from the sasquash

191
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,918
boys uh Johnny be's put his hash in here

192
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,598
did we weigh it no pass that scale

193
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:16,839
that's over on the desk over and we'll

194
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:18,000
give it a quick weigh so yeah it was

195
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:21,918
exactly what I thought it was going to

196
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,439
be02 on the screen and 3.4 on the hash

197
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:28,680
so Al together oh 3.8 alog together so

198
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:32,120
let's get that back in there plates

199
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,120
heating up at

200
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:38,278
245° and of course the Rosen press from

201
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,800
sasquash with the parchment lift this

202
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,759
little guy

203
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,759
up to expose the

204
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,639
plates all right you want to operate the

205
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:02,600
Press slow slow slow slow slow slow much

206
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,360
SL slower much there we go one little oh

207
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,159
I think we're I think we're in business

208
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,600
Johnny we're gushing we're gushing might

209
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,240
have might have crushed it too much I

210
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,480
don't know you might be exposing hash

211
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,240
into the actual oil cuz you literally

212
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,680
closed the plates right down so we'll

213
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,079
have to see it might be a perfect press

214
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:23,879
it might be a little bit of a oops do

215
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:24,719
you want to uh open her up let's open

216
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,439
her

217
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,959
up it could be just beautiful

218
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,399
oil came out a little came a little bit

219
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:36,359
dark like it's usually this lighter

220
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:39,480
color but sure looks thick put way to

221
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,560
ooze and drip that's what we do guys we

222
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,920
squish our hash and that is

223
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,479
definitely something going on there

224
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,399
there we go it looks like it's like the

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,159
sift has bubbled out let's check it out

226
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,159
let's see if we blew

227
00:09:54,679 --> 00:10:02,039
out nope just beautiful oil beautiful

228
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:03,599
beautiful oil guys a trim bin I mean

229
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:05,679
would you ever think that you would get

230
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,920
this from just trimming some

231
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,838
weed in a

232
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:13,879
bin grabbing a

233
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,360
press squishing well let's collect it up

234
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,120
I can't wait to do that okay all right

235
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,879
so that was quite an experience we uh

236
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,879
went inside you saw the uh the squish I

237
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,480
was very fearful that there was a

238
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:27,600
contamination occurring we got the macro

239
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:32,120
lens out and there definitely was some

240
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,720
um minor uh um intrusion of of dry sift

241
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,720
it was so melty it actually some of it

242
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,839
squeezed right out of the bag but we

243
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,920
managed to collect a couple of real nice

244
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,079
pieces uh and we're going to try dabbing

245
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,278
it now you know when you have six-star

246
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,120
hash and you squish it and you squish it

247
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:49,679
into hash and rosin it's still kind of a

248
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,519
pretty nice [ __ ] thing I got a drip

249
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,719
you got a beautiful drip I photographed

250
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,879
that drip and it's pure as I will show

251
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,480
right now you can see pure rosin no hash

252
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,559
contamination there um I've got a couple

253
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,839
of dabs for us as well that we collected

254
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,559
here so why don't I just uh do you want

255
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,240
to go clean the first dab and then we'll

256
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,879
do TP dipping after I like that idea

257
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,919
because we can do both yeah and it's

258
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,519
good it's good to set the base and know

259
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,078
what we're doing and what we're what

260
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,320
we're hitting so it's kind of what you

261
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:20,359
can do with your sift if it uh melts all

262
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,278
together and it's in one big goo ball

263
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,240
and you want to get a little

264
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:28,958
extra you want to separate out the oil

265
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,240
you squish it it's doable it's very

266
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,239
doable

267
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,560
ah but you know what I've learned so

268
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,200
much from squishing over the last you

269
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,278
know since it all kind of exploded on

270
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,519
the internet and and I did my little

271
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,200
video there and and I've been squishing

272
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:43,639
with my hair straightener forever and

273
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,399
we've seen all these different presses

274
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,519
come out and you know one thing I have

275
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,440
to say is is that Sasquatch

276
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,200
mhm squished it it's pretty spectacular

277
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,040
unit it's a little different from using

278
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,959
a hair straightener a clamp imine a hair

279
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:00,559
straightener a clamp works very quick it

280
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,078
doesn't really squished that well

281
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:06,000
sometimes as we saw last

282
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:08,879
time but I'm quite happy with a

283
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,639
sasquat that was pretty cool I think it

284
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,639
went a little too

285
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,319
squishing got a little happy there for

286
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:19,240
sure I don't have the carb over here

287
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,839
actually I have it so it's okay good

288
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,480
good good hoping you do hoping you

289
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,120
do so we'll see what he thinks of his

290
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,199
trim bin dry sift rosin that we just

291
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,679
pressed out hitting a nice clean piece

292
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:35,159
that was

293
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:38,599
very take that

294
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:42,240
sir clean that off a little bit for you

295
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:46,040
that was pretty tasty was it

296
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,959
now was it now well I'm going to join

297

305
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,480
nicely and I was I was kind of like I'm

306
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:14,319
still seeing that that that squish

307
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,199
oozing out cuz I've seen it before I

308
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,079
think we did it once um like a long time

309
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:23,559
ago when um Rick was here delisha oh

310
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:26,439
yeah and uh we actually sat down we did

311
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:29,399
an epic squish of some of course 73

312
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,639
Micron bubble hash squishy squish and

313
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,198
that half squished like I think it's on

314
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,639
my Instagram it's just these two big

315
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:38,319
drips like this one is here and it was

316
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:42,079
good to see I got a little smile from

317
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,560
it that's a nice thing to see resin dri

318
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:44,919
I'm feel I'm feeling pretty pretty good

319
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:48,359
about it that's for sure about to hit

320
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:51,078
this dab thank you sir a little cool

321
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,919
little carb cap action and and one thing

322
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:53,958
I've really seen with a carb cap was I

323
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,078
had this one that has a little hole in

324
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,599
the top and the way the direction goes

325
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,638
so it pushes the air on the back of the

326
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,320
bowl and you can actually move the resin

327
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,959
around and the little things that

328
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,000
actually that we did in the in the last

329
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,159
puff Wednesday when we did the really

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,159
low temp dab when we did that drop in

331
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:12,278
the middle and and the way it kind of

332
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:14,360
bubbled up and we're just like wow and I

333
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:15,958
was seeing with the other carb cup I was

334
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,839
using the other day is how it's got a

335
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,679
little hole in the back of it and you

336
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,199
can actually push the resin around by

337
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:24,159
moving the wind around with it which is

338
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:25,399
kind of cool so learning more and more

339
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,480
every day of

340
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:30,639
course oh

341
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,199
yes lovely how was that it was good I

342
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,720
think I'd like to try it with a TP dip

343
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:35,599
what about yourself I always like TP

344
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,519
dips why don't you pull yourself out a

345
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,519
hit maybe from your drip with your

346
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,190
Dabber and then I'll pass you over some

347
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,759
of these

348
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,759
[Music]

349
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,159
TPS and we can uh get turp dipping I

350
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,680
think the flavors I brought out were

351
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,679
white cookies Crown Royal both from

352
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:59,559
Jamaica and then I'm not sure oh OG

353
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,920
Kush of course always going to bring

354
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,799
kind of funny is it's actually um this

355
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,439
resing was nice and YY but because it's

356
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:10,799
so cold out here it's happing as a rock

357
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,800
so I kind of like it's hard as a

358
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:14,679
[Applause]

359
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,439

363
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,360

364
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,159

365
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,759

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,640
temperature that you can get a nice

666
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,798
little rip

667
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,399
without without burning your

668
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:24,558
throat a lot of planes flying overhead

669
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,599
today I wonder where everyone's going

670
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,759
that's two three 400 people at a time at

671
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:31,278
a swack just going flying right over top

672
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:32,960
of us how psychedelic is the world when

673
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,038
you really think of that many people

674
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,679
floating in space above our heads

675
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:39,679
multiple times since we've sat down to

676
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,200
do devs there's a lot of people it's a

677
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,519
lot of people flying around the world

678
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,038
right now you know it's amazing that

679
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,440
people have such a hard time believing

680
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:48,759
that there could be unidentified flying

681
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,038
objects when there are so many

682
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:53,038
identifiable flying objects you got to

683
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,200
think that geez it wouldn't be that hard

684
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,519
to make one look a little different and

685
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,360
have someone see it and that's it now

686
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,399
you've got your yourself an unidentified

687
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,000
flying

688
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:06,479
