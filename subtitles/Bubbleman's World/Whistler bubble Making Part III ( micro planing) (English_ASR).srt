00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,320
welcome to Bubble man's world back again

3
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,599
this is part three of The Whistler

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,560
Excursion it was quite an Excursion my

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,359
little my little Whistler we're going to

6
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,640
call it my Whistler we took the My

7
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:39,640
Little Pony fresh frozen fresh frozen it

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,200
was good I like beautiful beautiful

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,079
quality um I saw it quite a bit when

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,440
John was dumping it all over the hotel

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,039
entrance and at the elevator when he was

12
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,718
dumping the cooler over accident it was

13
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,399
just bringing him some nice flavors to

14
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,480
the hotel room some nice flavors to the

15
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,120
hotel room so anyway what we are at Now

16
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,038
with uh where we're at now is we've got

17
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,599
a nice big piece of cardboard is usually

18
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,198
attached to my screen so mostly the only

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,840
thing that is on this cardboard is a

20
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,359
little bit of dry sift but I've managed

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,000
to get most of it off I've got the two

22
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,840
micro micr planers here John has the

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
Frozen material he just pulled it out of

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,280
a Pelican case which we have stuffed

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,118
with frozen juices and ice packs it's

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,759
our little mini cooler that way we don't

27
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:25,319
have to uh continue to bring the

28
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,840
material in and out of the freezer so

29
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,438
I've got my pen we've already done the

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,118
190 Micron here

31
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,839
and here is the 160 we're going to do

32
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:37,478
the 160 now it's really just and then

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,640
once we're done the 160 we'll write on

34
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:42,239
her yeah this 160 of course is going to

35
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,960
be a little bit dirty um oh I would

36
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,359
suggest getting some type of a rub

37
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:49,078
rubber glove um I'm I usually SE when I

38
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,319
se I use a spoon I don't touch the

39
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:52,919
bubble whatsoever um I'm going to have

40
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,319
to I've cleaned my fingers made sure

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,159
there's no skin particles and uh I'll be

42
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,839
very careful when I grind down like I

43
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,399
said because John made a little bit of a

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,600
mistake when we first made this batch

45
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:08,280
he's he went to clean the 220 bag I try

46
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:12,719
to pull as much fiber out inside of the

47
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,878
um 160 bag so that it is a little bit

48
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,280
there's a little bit of leaf in

49
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,959
it but it'll be very easily to

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,959
distinguish once it's broken into a

51
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,719
powder all right so nice and sticky yeah

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,120
but and you know what still maintaining

53
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:33,000
its coolness yeah oh was awesome I think

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,599
the freezing of the uh of

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,199
the microplane helped as

56
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:41,199
well keeping them nice and

57
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,280
cold there we go we're going to have a

58
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,839
few little

59
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,158
chunks which will be identified by The

60
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,800
Rolling

61
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:50,639
up those will probably be the chunks

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,599
make great for um actually throwing into

63
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,878
your

64
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,719
cookies I love the cleaning of the micro

65
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:56,878
plane it always seems like it's going to

66
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,878
be

67
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,919
impossible and then you just give it one

68
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,518
good whack

69
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:04,798
and it's clean see keep everything nice

70
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,560
and cold

71
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,360
here excellent excellent Mak it much

72
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,920
easier all right so that

73
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,920
is the

74
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:20,560
160 all right next next is this here

75
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,000
this is the 120 wow this is a lot of it

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,519
dude yeah it's really Frozen isn't it

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,919
yeah Frozen let's see the bottom of the

78
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,239
screen for a second perfect perfect okay

79
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:35,000
uh just look at that probably break that

80
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,039
great thirds at least here's a really

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,840
good tip for you guys you don't want to

82
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,959
be using um too large of a piece when

83
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,479
you're microplaning uh it starts melting

84
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,319
in your fingers particularly of this

85
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,840
quality this is going to melt very fast

86
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,078
right going to move over to the next

87
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,239
planer here that I

88
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,640
have look at the

89
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,039
color oh wow is that white that is white

90
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,798
for 120 that is amazing it's not white

91
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:05,840
for 120 it's white for

92
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,280
snow I've don't that's just so white

93
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,400
that's amazing I'm I'm super so we need

94
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,158
more

95
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,158
CLE yeah I think we

96
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,478
will really careful when we get down to

97
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,240
these last pieces kind of gently rubbing

98
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:25,319
it over

99
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:28,840
the this micr planer another piece right

100
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,159
there for you excellent it's always nice

101
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:33,079
having someone to health you you doing

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,400
this oh so nice so much easier it's a

103
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:38,000
huge or just to to to do it all on your

104
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,359
own it's always nice to have a good

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,759
buddy especially oh yeah who grows

106
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,919
killer resin it's always ni to have a

107
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,800
good buddy that makes killer

108
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:49,359
bubble yes it's a a symbiotic

109
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,960
relationship it looks up quite nicely

110
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,479
actually sh that that is that that looks

111
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:57,279
like we just threw some white IC and

112
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,639
sugar I can't believe the color I can't

113
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:03,959
wait to see the

114
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,918
90 yeah this is the 120 yeah oh my

115
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,918
gosh excellent

116
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:12,719
excellent that that I might break that

117
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:12,719
one in it too just

118
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,080
give and this Pelican case here full of

119
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,160
um ice and some frozen packs is keeping

120
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:26,279
this just perfect and in the pizza box

121
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,840
that marvelous Pizza we had in Whistler

122
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,439
and I'm trying to keep my fingers nice

123
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,638
and clean so as to not let it build up

124
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:36,279
it can be a very tricky thing uh getting

125
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,478
ooey gooey resin on your fingers you can

126
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,599
get yourself in a position where you

127
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:42,000
make a very big mess in a very short

128
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,319
period of time so it's good to keep

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,038
those fingers clean as you're as you're

130
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,720
going like I said if you wear the gloves

131
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:51,159
you can freeze the gloves and the resin

132
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,240
just pops right off you're going to

133
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,639
manage you're going to keep any type of

134
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,879
uh particulate from your fingers out of

135
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,879
here so I would love to have gloves on

136
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:03,120
right now however I do not have have

137
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:07,399
them so in the world of bubbles we do

138
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,840
what we must do we Trot on we continue

139
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,239
give this a little whack to release

140
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,239
what's in

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,160
there how many more 120 pieces do we

142
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:18,079
have one more after that one more after

143
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,599
this okay so we'll go in a little

144
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:24,959
deeper I was going to maybe oh so we too

145
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:24,959
small no

146
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,520
problem I mean that's just coming apart

147
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,639
so perfect and it'll be really nice to

148
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:34,680
take some nice shots of that and show

149
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,800
that the heads aren't all mangled or

150
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,519
chopped up that we were talking about

151
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,319
actually what you mentioned and what we

152
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,680
yeah we we'll definitely take a shot of

153
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,520
this with the macro lens of each variety

154
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,519
oh so small and now the smell is just

155
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:50,680
hitting me so

156
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,680
much yeah it's really nice isn't

157
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,360
it and there's your next piece of 120

158
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:00,758
one more after that next piece of 120

159
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,479
coming through

160
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,319
I find that when you do it flat you'll

161
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,719
get a nicer plane a more surface area of

162
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,759
bubble that's touching the plane gives

163
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:16,400
her a nice um almost not not too thick

164
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:20,720
but just a nice even spread yeah comes

165
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:23,120
out nice I still prefer um a strainer

166
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,039
that is I have to

167
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,840
admit a strainer is nice for me cuz I

168
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,959
don't touch the

169
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,878
product I can just imagine how high

170
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,198
you're going to be getting as you're

171
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,199
doing

172
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,878
this it's pretty much uh this all gets

173
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:42,318
absorb through your skin so when

174
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,800
touching really killer resin understand

175
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,039
that that is also going into your blood

176
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,520
system that's why he's happy right now

177
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:53,560
you'll see the smiles get bigger and

178
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,758
bigger nonactive though nonactive but

179
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm still going to

180
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,919
smile

181
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,918
right okay so

182
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,439
Okay so we've

183
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:08,439
got our

184
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:19,598
120 all right that 120 is basically uh

185
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,120
the majority well next okay we're going

186
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,360
to get another piece of cardboard

187
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,319
because we're getting some bigger pieces

188
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,759
out here so I will be right

189
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,879
back we're going to do the 73 cuz there

190
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,520
just not enough room for the 120 okay

191
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,000
yeah we're uh we're going to place the

192
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,079
73

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,799
here I'll run it through my little guy

194
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:44,120
my nice micr plane coming out beautiful

195
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:47,559
color keep everything cold as you're

196
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,919
planing if you can keep the bubble cold

197
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:53,319
keep the planer cold keep your fingers

198
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:55,519
cold anything you can keep cold is going

199
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,600
to be helpful if you can do it in a cold

200
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,159
environment that's not going to

201
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,120
hurt he just had his hands in the

202
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,240
freezer so I literally

203
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,078
did I washed them from the last that's

204
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,519
cor apart really nicely right there just

205
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:13,559
crumbling yeah it is really too bad it's

206
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,200
staying on my fingers

207
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,919
but not that much this time not much not

208
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,920
much we'll give it a

209
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:25,879
little yeah it's because there's

210
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,720
moisture present I can feel it it's

211
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:31,679
making it easier that moisture

212
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,680
definitely makes makes it

213
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:38,559
easier all right so we've got our 73

214
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,039
we're going to mark that down you know

215
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,838
you think you can

216
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:48,599
remember just write it down

217
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,880
73 120 160 and 190 we're going to

218
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,839
replace this cardboard with a clean one

219
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:57,799
put this one up in our stack so it's out

220
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:01,320
of the way and protected and uh yeah

221
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,319
we'll be back in a second

222
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,919
Okay so we've got our nice fresh piece

223
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,440
of cardboard there's a couple of rips in

224
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,838
it that I don't really like cuz it's

225
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,760
actually exposing fibers we're going to

226
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:20,560
avoid that and

227
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:23,120
uh yeah here we go next up 120 I thought

228
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,719
we did all the 120 the 90 okay we got to

229
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,278
keep that straight we're in the 90 he's

230
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,040
he's playing games with me tricking me

231
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:32,759
well I'm just keeping you on keeping me

232
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:34,679
on my toes keep me on your toes all

233
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,639
right so so this is U one of the

234
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,879
favorites in

235
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,360
the that's just

236
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,360
crumbling but it's making for easy

237
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,759
crumbling so whoever says it has to be

238
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,759
completely

239
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,919
Frozen I after doing

240
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:52,958
that must disagree with you we have

241
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:54,559
quite a bit more 90 or oh yeah yeah

242
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,719
excellent yeah this is real nice the way

243
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:59,518
it's crumbling

244
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,278
up ni see the more more you experiment

245
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,320
the more you realize what's everything's

246
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,799
can change with your environment and the

247
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,800
humidity and the temperature

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,320
and way less sticking to my fingers this

249
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,440
time because it isn't Frozen I don't

250
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,040
have to push as as hard on it and we got

251
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,079
another piece after

252
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,559
that yeah just washing it it's just

253
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:29,958
coming apart

254
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,958
perfectly yeah nice and gentle

255
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:40,399
and our last nice thick piece of 90

256
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,399
excellent save the best for

257
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,399
last

258
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:51,559
woohoo look at

259
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:54,480
that not too shabby hey yeah very happy

260
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:57,479
with that for sure the smell is just

261
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
awesome

262
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,839
all right so the 90 is

263
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,680
plained do my little roll the hash off

264
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,919
your

265
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,679
fingers you'll end up usually seeing

266
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,120
these pieces in the end they'll have a

267
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,719
little bit of a different texture to

268
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,440
them and they they really are just going

269
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,360
to have a tiny bit of moisture trapped

270
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,760
in them so I usually just puff those

271
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,680
early on

272
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,278
here's a

273
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:35,879
45 all right we're going into 45 now are

274
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:35,879
we right into

275
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,919
45 so

276
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,720
[Music]

277
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:47,120
45

278
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:52,720
45 what do we have left after that just

279
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,720
20 yeah five getting right down to the

280
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,120
last ivly by the looks of everything

281
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:01,879
here it's uh upwards of over over 10 10

282
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,198
rounds at least I

283
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,799
say yeah you know it's I'm sure we'll

284
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:08,039
get our 10% return at least oh yeah

285
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,039
that's what I'm saying we're definitely

286
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,240
getting that 10%

287
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,480
return good piece

288
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,480
out fiber there that

289
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:25,519
off 45 has that very strong tonation

290
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:28,838
tpine smell you just I can always know

291
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,560
when it's the 45 yeah truly yeah it's

292
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,160
also so the first bubble that is usually

293
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,799
the one to light a flame when you're

294
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,159
smoking

295
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:39,120
it not that I've been smoking much

296
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,120
lately since I got the

297
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:47,399
Dil one more piece of 45 oh only got lot

298
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:47,399
45 pass it pass them up there go

299
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,599
excellent shaving them

300
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:03,000
down one little Tri head of B yes one

301
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,000
little tricomb head at a

302
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:12,199
time sometimes 50,000 heads 50,000 right

303
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:13,639
there I raise you 50,000 heads to uh

304
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:16,559
there's an

305
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,079
extra 5,000 there yeah the moisture

306
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,879
content is good in this it's got enough

307
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,679
moisture that it's not um really

308
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:26,559
sticking to my fingers uh the moisture

309
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:30,838
allows for it to that little bit of

310
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,479
water makes for a good PL l in and it's

311
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,680
easy to go through and pick up the tiny

312
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,920
little chunks that are too big and just

313
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:40,039
run them gently through the micr planer

314
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:42,319
I've got a two size planer here so the

315
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:44,159
one size the smaller size is pretty easy

316
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,519
to

317
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:50,360
uh to touch directly it's got smaller

318
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,120
little blades I guess you would say and

319
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,919
because of that it's not it's gentle on

320
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,320
my fingers I'm not peeling my fingers

321
00:14:53,919 --> 00:15:01,039
off on it and last but not least is just

322
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,040
one big chunk of 25

323
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,919
25 you know truly the one that you can

324
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,720
honestly get away with sometimes drawing

325
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,599
in a

326
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,759
Patty um we're just going to microplan

327
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,759
it

328
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,839
up crumbles right up

329
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,920
perfectly never have a problem drying

330
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,000
the 25 micron I think it has a lot to do

331
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:30,159
with the fact that the heads are so much

332
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,440
smaller um less water actually fits

333
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,078
between the heads on the outside of the

334
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,240
heads if you if you think of it like a

335
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:39,919
bowl of grapes um the larger the grapes

336
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,360
the more surface area between Those

337
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,240
Grapes uh the smaller they are the less

338
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,800
space between the more can fit in a bowl

339
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,000
there's less room for moisture and I

340
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,838
think that's why the 25 micron has never

341
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
really been a problem drying it even in

342
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,440
a Patty and it's definitely the one that

343
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,759
can confuse people when you tell them

344
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,360
you can't dry bubble in a Patty they

345
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,959
might have done it 5 Micron and and

346
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,480
think yes you can so there's a quick

347
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,919
little uh microplaning job I'll tell you

348
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,278
uh having somewhere safe to put this

349
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:13,198
away from dust and debris pet hair kids

350
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,759
whatever is very important we've got it

351
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:17,479
in the gorilla tent here on top of the

352
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,759
4X 2T screens we've got them stacked

353
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,639
they're going to be safe and beautiful

354
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,519
and put away and not even dust is going

355
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,039
to fall on it you really want to make

356
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,560
sure you can kind of create something

357
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,360
like that before you get yourself into

358
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,958
this situation of having the bubble all

359
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,919
powdered out on the on the cardboard

360
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,078
board or parchment paper and uh yeah I

361
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,879
guess we're going to put this over there

362
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,359
John and I are going to hit some bowls

363
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,360
so we'll be right back thanks for
