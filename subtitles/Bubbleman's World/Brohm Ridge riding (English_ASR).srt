00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,879
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,359
and

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,679
welcome to Epic nature I have jumped on

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,960
my I guess anti-nature machine dirt

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,040
bikes a lot of people find them

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,839
obnoxious I grew up on them since I was

7
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,160
7 years old so I have a different

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,640
affinity for them as most but I try to

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,640
be as polite as I can when I'm driving

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,439
on trails and whatnot maintaining the

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,399
nature of the environment without going

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,079
off the trail that being said I am up

13
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:30,719
here in the garabaldi brome ridge

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,320
absolutely surrounded by nature and

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,479
nothing but you can see there's still

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,920
quite a bit of snow up here I've

17
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,799
actually gotten about as far as I can

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,439
get I usually go up to the peak of that

19
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,479
mountain up there um I'm trying to see

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,960
if I can get up on the left side here my

21
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45,000
buddies are just up on the other side of

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,679
the mountain about to shoot some guns

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,359
and I figured I would do a little Vapor

24
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,000
session with you guys I got my uptech

25
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,000
here so I got to give a shout out to uh

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,399
Gary and Sam from uptech and just give

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,920

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
vaporizers

30
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,079
beautiful uh to give you an idea where I

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,560
am this is north in the background if

32
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,599
you see that little peak of mountain

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,280
that's called um why am I brain farting

34
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,079
on that that's the Black Tusk and the

35
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,400
Black Tusk can be seen of course very

36
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,599
well from here in brome but it can also

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,840
be seen uh quite well from Whistler

38
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:23,919
Mountain if you've ever been on the peak

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,240
of Whistler Mountain you can absolutely

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,640
see uh the Black Tusk Peak pretty

41
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,239
beautifully from there sorry about all

42
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,519
the moving around and stuff I I I know

43
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,000
it's not

44
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,640
ideal with the camera moving like that

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,640
I'll try to get it

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,560
steady I think my friend is coming up

47
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:43,640

48
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,640

you guys have been appreciating your

54
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,279
summer and of course enjoying nature as

55
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,038
often as you can one of my favorite

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
things to do with ganja cannabis resin

57
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,559
whatever you want to call it it's to get

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,839
out in nature it's not to just sit on my

59
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,479
couch and play video games although if

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,800
that's what you want to do power to you

61
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,159
I'm definitely not against you doing

62
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,879
that but uh if you get the chance try to

63
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,560
get out into nature man you'll see it's

64
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:22,560
