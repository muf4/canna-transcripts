you've taken I'm sure you've taken the

discipline that you learned in Jiu-Jitsu

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,720
and transferred it over into the hash

86
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,000
making

87
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:54,919
World definitely man I tell you what

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,560
margus tells you not to give up really

89
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:00,078
it like our industry is really hard it

90
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,560
can be very defeating you know it can be

91
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,760
you can go through your torch and

92
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,759
pitchforks on both sides you know and oh

93
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,679
yeah it can be discouraging we've all

94
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,239
tapped out trust me yeah yeah yeah I

95
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,920
come close a lot and that's the thing

96
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,000
you just can't give up you can't let

97
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,798
people grind you down and it's a hardest

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,839
of hardest situations man when you're

99
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,918
getting like man handled or woman

100
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,239

picked me up and like handled me you

103
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,478
know I mean like yeah like you know it

104
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,439
really humbled you it it humbles it

105
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:36,478
humbles you a lot and uh but in like you

106
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,199
know it's hot in the room somebody's

107
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,079
pushing on you you're under a lot of

108
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,400
pressure it it it sometimes you can't

109
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:46,359
even breathe you know you're in a lot of

110
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,918
pain but you got to like push through

111
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,199
and persevere and and just keep going

112
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:53,439
and sometimes you it's unbelievable what

113
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,000
the human Spirit can can achieve like

114
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,120
you think you're just done for and then

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,879
all of a sudden your tiny little opening

116
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,240
and that's the same for hash making is

117
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,240
is like dude I'm just done I don't even

118
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,960
know why the [ __ ] I do this anymore but

119
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,918
like you know there's somebody that

120
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,120
comes up to you like this girl one time

121
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:11,719
was like you know you're the reason I

122
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,478
make cash bill I was like

123
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,520
okay you know like that's why we do it

124
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,478
we do it so we can pass on pass on the

125
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:21,079
knowledge so we can keep on going you

126
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,120
know absolutely there's something for

127
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:26,120
youth there's something very uh

128
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,319
important about the the humility aspect

129
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,800
of life and it seems like the more we

130
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,439
practice humility

131
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,280
I guess the I don't know it's just

132
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,079
easier when you practice humility I I

133
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,038
think it was a Mike Tyson quote which

134
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,639
obviously came after he licked the

135
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:47,519
butane uh the BH The Bu The the Frog the

136
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:49,280
the MEO frog the buoen frog calling it a

137
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,560
butane frog that's pretty funny that's

138
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,478
cool um but he said if you are not

139
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,160
humble in this world this world will

140
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:01,199
dress humility upon you and I was like

141
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,400
damn I mean before that before he he

142
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,080
licked the the butine Frog it was

143
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,839
everyone has a plan until they get

144
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,038
punched in the face that was like the

145
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,799
original Mike Tyson quote and then it

146
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,399
like got all got all deep well right

147
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,000
right that was like old school mic but

148
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,000
then it got deep and it got psychedelic

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,079
and it got like you know out of the

150
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,120
shallows and it's it's very true if you

151
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:27,560
are not humble in this world this world

152
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,120
will dress humility upon you so um it's

153
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,240
not a bad thing to practice have some

154
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,280
humble pie and if you eat Humble Pie you

155
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,840
might not have to eat big plate loads of

156
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:43,478
[ __ ] that's my advice to the world for

157
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:47,079
2025 yeah I I actually uh

158
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:49,839
copyrighted humility of course you did

159
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:52,719
of course you did s we appreciate

160
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,519
that oh what's everyone smoking today I

161
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,720
got some beautiful things first I got

162
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,279
this like I guess this would be

163
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,520
considered an elite back from the day

164
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,598
the old Mothership B rig I had a little

165
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,120
buddy he's got like seven of these

166
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:05,560
things they're they're just not quite

167
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,120
worth I I'm sure this thing must have

168
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,560
cost like $25,000 when it was originally

169
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,478
purchased it's probably worth like five

170
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,598
or 6,000 now but uh I have to say it has

171
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,240
been a beauty for puffing out of I've

172
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:20,000
got a ton a full Mount bubble I've got

173
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,840
some 90 Micron death Bubba I've got some

174
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,879
90 Micron Event Horizon which that event

175
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:31,359
horizon is quite lovely I believe it's

176
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:35,720
from um exotic genetics and then I've

177
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,960
got some Masterpiece 90 Micron and then

178
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,400
I got a couple of Yeezy ogs and an MK

179
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:45,198
Ultra all seed air dried you know

180
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:48,478
six-star melt into nothing I just

181
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,280
haven't had a ton of melty bubble in my

182
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:54,120
life lately and it's so good to have it

183
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:58,439
back I uh I just want everyone to have

184
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,199
melty hash all the time that is my dream

185
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,279
everyone needs it even if you still want

186
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,199
to smoke spliffs and BHO and whatever

187
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:08,318
else you're enjoying in your life at

188
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:12,038
least have some full melt dry sift or

189
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,080
some full melt bubble in the um in the

190
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:16,439
quiver that's what I would say to that I

191
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,439
also want to welcome uh Logan into the

192
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,800
room Wolverine dabs one of our young

193
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,319
hash makers who's uh you know Making

194
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,158
Waves and making us think and showing us

195
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,360
different things he had those amazing

196
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:31,680
photos you showed with the crystallized

197
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,200
gland heads I love that in all the years

198
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,839
that I've been doing this and certainly

199
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,278
it's a fraction of the years that Sam's

200
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:40,120
been doing this there's just still new

201
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,918
things to see there's new things to be

202
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,399
uh uh to to be unveiled and I really

203
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:48,759
have a appreciation for uh for you for

204
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,519
doing that Logan I really do yeah and i'

205
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,720
I've scheduled to go back to Oregon as

206
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,159
well to go get my hands on that same

207
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,040
strain so we can get some data we can

208
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:00,120
test it all of that oh nice that's the

209
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,919
one that's sort of just crystallized the

210
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,399
heads and turned them into into dust

211
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:08,799
yeah the trop Santos I wonder if there

212
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,159
was like a particular pH of water that

213
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,439
was used to to wash that and whether or

214
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:16,360
not that pH had anything to do with that

215
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,959
that process well it was all dry sifted

216
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,039
it was dry sifted okay yeah yeah Wild

217
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,799
Well very cool yeah so I'm excited to go

218
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:26,719
back down there get my hands on the same

219
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:28,199
pheno and see if it replicates it

220
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,600
otherwise if it doesn't replicate it

221
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,800
then it had something to do with the

222
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,320
environment or the age of the tricomes

223
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:36,879
as well but or just one of other 10,000

224
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,480
variables that we yeah

225
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,320
exactly Nick is laughing because it's

226

269
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,759
huge part of my life I made it happen in

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,120
the early or mid90s late 90s and it just

271
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:53,319
sort of petered out it's literally been

272
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,278
I don't know 20 to 25 years since I saw

a fish show which is uh I feel like out

274
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:01,200
of all the things I got robbed from this

275
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,919
record from having a record and not

276
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,200
being allowed into the US I feel like

277
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,479
the Grateful Dead and fish were some I

278
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,800

324
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:10,559
and Amy Weinstein and all those just

325
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:14,079
absolute awesome Tripper I mean it was

326
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,799
Allison Gordon who got me on she got me

327
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,799
to try and go down to Portland for the

328
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:19,359
legends of hash that I that I did with

329
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:22,120
Addison down there so that's when I

330
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,320
actually I was at the border I was at US

331
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Customs Allison was like already went

332
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,440
through you have to know Allison but it

333
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,198
was like her will is so strong she has

334
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,720
this incredible will that when she wants

335
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:37,559
to do something it always gets done so

336
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,399
when US Customs started to deny me her

337
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,159
head literally started to explode she's

338
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,320
walking back and forth she's kind of

339
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,719
already cleared customs and kind of

340
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,959
needs to bug her off but she doesn't and

341
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,800
she stands there for the entire hour and

342
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:52,159
a half that I'm delayed staring through

343
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,599
the glass at me you know the Customs are

344
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,399
kind of like hey you you got to go and

345
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,240
she's like I'm not going anywhere I'm

346
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,799
waiting for my friend and then finally

347
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,600
when they deny me she's like well I'm

348
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,559
not getting on my plane and they're like

349
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,920
well you're already in the US basically

350
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,439
like you can't you can't come back it's

351
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:10,000
not allowed well they had not met

352
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,240
Allison Gordon she absolutely came back

353
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,320
she did not get on that flight and she

354
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,519
ended up driving me home later that day

355
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,440
so she we were going to go see dead and

356
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,240
Co at the sphere she had tickets for us

357
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,880
at the sphere uh right after Portland so

358
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,320
she's going to be with us on that little

359
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,679
tour I should welcome uh Davis Allen uh

360
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,440
another young dude who's doing some good

361
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,679
things here in British Columbia he's

362
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,160
been on hash Church uh at least one or

363
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,879
two times with us how you doing Davis

364
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,639
doing pretty good doing pretty good it's

365
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,879
been an amazing start to the year for

366
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,720
sure where you at right now I'm just

367
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,759
finishing up the one of the projects at

368
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,120
UBC and then again just out of the

369
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,240
family's property right now oh like on

370
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Bowen yeah yeah Bowen Island yeah D

371
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,120
Davis is on the most amazing little

372
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,600
island that's like just outside of

373
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,799
Vancouver it's just across the ocean

374
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,399
from my little place in Lion's Bay he's

375
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,639
in a little island called Bowen Island

376
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:08,078
and it's surrounded by like whales and

377
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,480
dolphins and it's just one of the

378
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,838
special and he grew up there which is

379
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,159
kind of like an anomaly you know you

380
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,079
meet a ton of people that live on boan

381
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:19,360
island but they could literally be from

382
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,519
anywhere else in the world other than

383
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,240
British Columbia but Davis was one of

384
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,440
the lucky ones he got to grow up there

385
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,240
so you're doing the the UBC project

386
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,240
still yeah so we're finishing up the um

387
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,879
fertility Pro project currently we're

388
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,318
just uh I'm starting to measure all the

389
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,958
plants check how many seeds we're

390
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:36,879
developed from different varieties and

391
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,838
crosses and then we're uh going to be

392
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,439
starting some new projects hopefully in

393
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,880
uh the next few months here I think that

394
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,959
I think that you and Stephen Philpot

395
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,639
should exchange uh numbers and link up I

396
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,518
think you guys would really have some

397
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,560
great synergies you're both brilliant

398
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:56,318
you're both Uber focused and I think

399
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:58,119
what he's doing and what you're doing

400
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:00,240
there'll somehow be some synergies in

401
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,919
there so make sure that uh I put you

402
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,519
guys together I I only met Stephen

403
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:08,119

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,200
science group and uh one of the young uh

437
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:35,079
another one of the young brilliant

438
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,519
scientists um uh social scientists

439
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:39,678
around cannabis he's been doing a

440
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:44,759
fasinating research um his own personal

441
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,640
research on uh music uh genetics and how

442
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,519
they have intertwined do you want to

443
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,600
explain a little bit of that Caleb for

444
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,440
the uh the

445
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,759
public sure so I'm sitting here at

446
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,000
calpol humbl in the Cannabis studies lab

447
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,919
and I'm a master's in public sociology

448
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,679
student and and this is um you know it's

449
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,640
not a wet lab it's not like a hash lab

450
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,080
like Belle gets to work with downed

451
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,200
Heritage it's not um like a lab where we

452
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:14,399
can touch cannabis or do any breeding

453
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:17,000
like Davis Allen can do of a UVC um and

454
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,960
so you know in the sociology Department

455
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,038
this is though the very first cannabis

456
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,679
studies program in the whole world and

457
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:27,158
so there's you know there's cohorts of

458
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,360
cannabis studies Bachelors um Majors

459
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,840
cannabis studies Majors here

460
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,519
and I get to uh be a research assistant

461
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,519
with them on the Legacy genetics Grant

462
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,400
with Dr Dominic Corva but for my thesis

463
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:40,839
um I'm looking at changes in cannabis

464
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,440
genetics over time and I'm doing so by

465
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:44,480
interviewing cannabis breeders but I'm

466
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,759
also doing archival research because you

467
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,880
know everyone here I think has a love of

468
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:53,519
music and um through music I've learned

469
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,799
a lot about weed and um definitely

470
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,918
there's a connection there that you can

471
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:00,440
straight up track which cultivars have

472
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,120
been popular where where they first

473
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,080
popped up all this sort of stuff is just

474
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,599
sitting there on you know the internet

475
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:10,119
archives in lyric databases and there's

476
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,519
all sorts of insights into our cannabis

477
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,839
culture that can be shared through that

478
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:17,599
you know not just in Hip Hop or through

479
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:19,038
fish or the Greatful Dead Or there's

480
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,079
literally anything and everything yall

481
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:24,400
can think of including I've learned

482
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:26,199
about some um like hash music from Greek

483
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,200
hashan music

484
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,200
yeah mus

485
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:35,960
actually that's really cool this must be

486

00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:44,119
concept the so so what exactly is it

489
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,480
that you're connecting is it like

490
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:48,639
frequencies and vibrations or is it like

491
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,720
oh certain areas have certain cultivars

492
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,679
and they also have certain music are you

493
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,200
putting these sort of underlining

494
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,440
connections that other people haven't

495
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:00,798
made so far what's the what's the sort

496
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,240
of thesis of the work yeah so one um

497
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,038
presentation I'm going to be making in

498
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,599
March at the Pacific sociological

499
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:09,879
Association conference in San Francisco

500
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:13,519
is titled um how C weed became a world

501
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:16,278
star um a lyrical analysis of hip hop

502
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:19,158
songs from 1980s to

503
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:22,679
2020s and basically by searching on

504
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:25,360
lyrical databases for the words C weed

505
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:28,200
um I found 200 or 40 s songs that

506
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:30,519
mentioned C weed in the lyrics directly

507
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,960
and if I were to ask everyone here like

508
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:36,000
you know what country you think those

509
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,640
songs are from the majority of them what

510
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,640
would people

511
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,640
guess

512
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,678
USFA so for the last 10 years most songs

513
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:51,599
mentioned in cweed are actually coming

514
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:53,480
out of Germany ho [ __ ] that's hilarious

515
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,158
interesting and how that's like German

516
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,079
hipop and German reggae and stuff like

517
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:03,360

like inventions of C weed you know and

520
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,640
that is as many people here know it's

521
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:15,359
kind of an older sling term now um on

522
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,240
hash church people might know about C

523
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,599
plates which is you know where things

524
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,240
are moving to and there's lyrical

525
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:24,359
references to that

526
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,960
too love it love it that's so cool dude

527
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm just G to rip a dab here so I I just

528
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,600
wanted to finish up the story when when

529
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,200
Caleb came and got me high at

530
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,558
biscon okay here here is the three

531
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,759
people or the four of us that were

532
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:41,918
sitting at the bench it was Murphy

533
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:44,919
Murray right uh was miabi there no it

534
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:48,320
was twinkle twinkle right twinkle from

535
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,759
abstracts myself and Caleb right so

536
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,519
we're sitting we're sitting out on this

537
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:54,119
bench and it basically known while it's

538
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:56,038
a weed conference so people are probably

539
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:58,639
going to just step outside the door and

540
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:00,839
start smoking and everything but there

541
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,759
was this kind of Maintenance crew that

542
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:06,240
was sitting on a fork truck that was

543
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,319
just across the way from us and I think

544
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,679
we didn't have a lighter did we Caleb

545
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,720
didn't we have to ask those gentlemen

546
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,840
for a lighter and they had one and and

547
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,960
and they had one because they were all

548
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:19,558
smoking cigarettes

549
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,278
right we light up this this this torch

550
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:24,639
and it just it just was stinky to all

551
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:27,400
hell but yeah it was great weed it got

552
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,759
me totally high and yeah I want to

553
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,519
appreciate you C for reaching out to me

554
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:35,038
and that was a a fun little interaction

555
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,839
that we had there and I think I took a

556
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,400
bunch of photos from it so if you reach

557
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,158
back out to me I could send you some of

558
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,480
the photos so I think yeah there was a

559
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:48,000
photo of me you Murray and twinkle

560
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,720
sitting there getting high outside

561
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,038
biscon right after my talk I think was

562
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:57,519
that a yeah it was just after yeah so I

563
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:59,400
I gave a talk there Marcus on um

564
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,480
synthetic canab IDs and you know all

565
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,480
this chemistry that's going on to

566
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:08,079
basically convert CBD and so-called CBD

567
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,440
into other you know cannaboids that are

568
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:13,199
basically you know for

569
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,558
sale all kinds of different products and

570
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,400
gas stations and on the internet and not

571
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:21,158
having the regulatory opes that most of

572
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,720
the rest of the Cannabis industry has to

573
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,200
go through and that's a whole you know

574
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,839
train wreck down here in the states that

575
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,159
you guys probably aren't dealing with so

576
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:34,720
much in in Canada but we have our own

577
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,720
train wrecks we're dealing with up

578
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,119
hereid it's a as you know many people

579
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:42,319
would say it's the proverbial race to

580
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:45,879
the bottom you know and what the

581
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:50,319
Cannabis industry has turned into I'm

582
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:53,799
thinking about um JJ's uh post on

583
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,398
Facebook uh from uh from Top Dog was

584
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:58,398
basically just saying you know where the

585
00:24:55,398 --> 00:25:01,439
industry's gone in the last 10 years and

586
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:04,479
it's basically gone to you know mids

587
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,880
that can be produced at you know [ __ ]

588
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,720
ton quantity uh and then just goose with

589
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,840
whatever to get people high and again I

590
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,159
think I had reported back on biscon this

591
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,158
year being kind of like pre-roll con

592
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:18,679
everything was about pre-rolls

593
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,039
everything was about pre-rolls there's

594
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:25,440
like every three booths or every like

595
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:28,319
third Booth was uh either selling tubes

596
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,278
or custom papers or pre-roll machine

597
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:34,278
machines are all about pre-rolls and I

598
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:37,919
think the majority of those companies

599
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:40,640
are using the cheapest super sack hemp

600
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,880
they possibly can get and you know

601
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,240
putting some THC isolate in there and

602
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,480
calling it cannabis you know that's what

603
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,000
our industry's become today you know

604
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,839
proverbial that's because you have a a

605
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,558
bunch of immature like new buyers that

606
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,720
are just they don't really know it'll

607
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:58,599
take them like I just you know I got

608
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,880
into this pretty hardcore not not quite

609
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:03,439
right away I smoked my first joint at 14

610
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,559
but by 17 I was definitely like both

611
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,558
feet in like flipping pounds and like

612
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,720
just going as deep as I possibly could

613
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:13,960
and I think that now because it's not

614
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,960
illegal people can get into it but they

615
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,720
can stay shallow they don't have to go

616
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,600
so deep and be like oh wow this isn't

617
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,839
allowed what else am I not allowed to

618
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,038
know about this right they're just like

619
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,639
and so it's going to take a while I I

620
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:27,679
feel for you because I can hear your

621
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,880
heartbreaking when you say what you just

622
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,880
said and I I know all of our hearts

623
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,159
break for that too but we just have to

624
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,720
remain resilient and stay true to our

625
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,799
path and continue with quality and

626
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,440
Purity and and the education because I

627
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:43,798
just I can't

628
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,880
believe that and personally I'm good

629
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:48,038
with a smaller percentage of the market

630
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,720
if I can just feed a small group of

631
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:53,038
people who are really happy to receive

632
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,399
what I'm what I'm putting out there then

633
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:58,759
that's that's good enough for me and the

634
00:26:54,398 --> 00:27:01,439
world is so big Mark it's so big like

635
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:02,960
uh Canada did like 3.5 billion in

636
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,200
cannabis we're not even a big cannabis

637
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,399
Market Michigan alone did like 200

638
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,399
million more than the Canadian cannabis

639
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:11,359
Market in in an entire year and that's

640
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:13,079
just Canada and Michigan you got like

641
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,479
all these other states and countries and

642
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:15,839
it's just going to grow and grow and

643
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,319
grow and

644
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,599
unfortunately the if you just want to

645
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:22,720
make a ton of money and you want to uh I

646
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:24,879
mean [ __ ] it's almost sick but if you if

647
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,278
you were like a hurting scene and you

648
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,480
wanted to start an amazing brand and you

649
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,159
really believed in

650
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,159
you should almost start a brand that

651
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,240
sells floor sweepings distillate and

652
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:38,039
Botanical tpin in pre-rolled joints with

653
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,880
the thickest nastiest paper you could

654
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:42,679
possibly imagine make it real ugly gudy

655
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,720
packaging you'll have the number one

656
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,759
brand like in the country genetics

657
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,679
because they don't track seeds still

658
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:51,720
they really track poen of course they do

659
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,798
and stop please everybody can we stop

660
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,440
with the cone pre-rolls they royally

661
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,599
suck and about a half inch to an inch

662
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,440
above it it get so clogged can we just

663
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,599
go back to the if you're going to if you

664
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,880
have to do pre-rolls you son of a

665
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,079
[ __ ] can you at least make it regular

666
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,240
and even like how they do with

667
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,960
cigarettes so people can get an even at

668
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,919
least hit if you have to [ __ ] go

669
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,079
there I'd prefer you [ __ ] not but can

670
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,360
you stop with the [ __ ] cones you

671
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,720
[ __ ] I I I think of the

672
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:23,639
pre-rolls as like fishing lures right

673
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,880
you're just out there looking to like

674
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,080
get people into weed like check this out

675
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,799
it's just like I'm not overly confident

676
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:32,519
smoking full melt bubble with people

677
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,679
that have never smoked canvas I've done

678
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:37,798
it I can do the micro dab I got I pull a

679
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,278
pin out because any other Dabber is too

680
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:41,038
big and pulls too much out but if no

681
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,720
one's ever had a dab before I'll pull

682
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,440
the pin out and I'll be I'll you know

683
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,319
just the first dab they blow it out they

684
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,480
taste it it was nothing there almost

685
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,918
nobody gets high off that but they've

686
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,599
they're now on the other side of their

687
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,278
fear that they had about this experience

688
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,240
that they've seen people Whiting out

689
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:59,640
they've seen people grabbing the the red

690
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,919
hot bowl they've seen all of these ways

691
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,640
that you can [ __ ] up and they're nervous

692
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,799
about it a lot of people are nervous

693
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,919
about it they don't blow torches and all

694
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:09,558
this other crazy [ __ ] but once you give

695
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,120
them that little micro dab and they can

696
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:12,918
be on the other side of it then it's

697
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,918
like well I can give you another one I

698
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:18,399
can even give you another one but if I

699
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:20,600
take a dab with this I can't unive it to

700
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,359
you you're going to be high for like at

701
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:25,480
least 45 minutes to an hour and I just

702
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:28,519
although for whatever reason I think I

703
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,240
thought it was hilarious in my 20s I'm

704
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:33,558
just like offended by it in my 50s I'm

705
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:36,359
just like this is knocking people out

706
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:38,839
and making people uncomfortable is the

707
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:41,839
worst thing you could do for the

708
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:43,639
extracts world now if you're begging for

709
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,759
it and you're saying Hey I want to be

710
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,880
uncomfortably high oh my God deliver

711
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:51,119
that guy a half gram hot dab get you

712
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,278
know he just asked for it give it to him

713
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:56,518
but uh

714
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,240
otherwise pull back Meo another another

715
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,319
Trend that's happening down here and

716
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,519
even though it's still a small Market

717
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:06,319
sector it's growing exponentially is is

718
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,798
beverage and beverage doesn't give a

719
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:11,798
[ __ ] about strain all they need is 10

720
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,798
milligrams of THC and they don't care

721
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:16,440
where that THC came from whether it came

722
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:18,759
from a a reaction vessel or what

723
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,600
actually came from a plant it doesn't

724
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:24,158
make a difference and so there you have

725
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,199
big money because in order to have

726
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,960
canning facilities I mean think about it

727
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,240
like this big beverage is already all

728
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,000
set up to do this the nanoemulsification

729
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,839
of THC now gives them just another

730
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,398
ingredient to drop in to their big

731
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:43,199
production right it also it also St well

732
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,678
I wouldn't say it completely stabilizes

733
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,880
it's the most stable cannabis product

734
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,159
it's like they want to stabilize flour

735
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,960
and hash and oils but that that's un you

736
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,200
can't you can slow it down and put it in

737
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,038
a cold chain but like it's not stable

738
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,558
it's literally volatile that's the

739
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:03,319
that's the word used to describe it it's

740
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:05,038
not stable it's the opposite but where

741
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:07,319
where they have con considerable

742
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:10,440
Tailwinds pushing them into this Market

743
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:13,558
is they have these huge distribution

744
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,038
channels Marcus and they're outside

745
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:18,000
needing you know a cannabis license so

746
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:20,519
like in Minnesota and I think now in

747
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,159
Texas and a few other states you can

748
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,759
sell these things at the liquor stores

749
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:29,159
yeah you know 10 milligram drinks and

750
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:32,158
you know more more than 10 migr even

751
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:34,679
more than that but but I mean like

752
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,000
so how do you compete with that you

753
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:40,559
can't compete with that right like ATN

754
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,319
do you sell beverages at your store I

755
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,440
mean do you got do people come in and

756
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,879
buy beverages there yeah they do but

757
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,519
they can go up the street to Bev Mo and

758
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:54,200
you know at the end of the aisle buy you

759
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:55,480
know the same um drinks for probably

760
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,120
much cheaper because they don't have to

761
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,480
deal with the licensing and all of that

762
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,638
so yeah we do but not like we used to

763
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,038
because they're up the street for

764
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:06,719
cheaper in a regular store and and cheap

765
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:09,079
that that that matters right I mean if

766
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,679
you're spending absolutely if a

767
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:13,720
consumer eight for a four pack or five

768
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,159
dollar for a four pack people are gonna

769
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:21,038
drive that a little extra to save that

770
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,639
ours are 8 a can yeah or one can 8 now

771
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:26,359
listen to this if you want to hear how

772
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:29,599
[ __ ] the Canadian cannabis regulatory

773
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:31,398
framework is was whatever it just shows

774
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,278
you everything's Topsy Turvy like the

775
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:36,439
same way unfortunately the police flip

776
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:38,240
the law upside down lawyers flip the law

777
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,798
upside down doctors flip Health upside

778
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,720
down we're living in a Topsy Turvy world

779
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:46,158
and so when cannabis became legal in

780
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,120
Canada the first thing to become a part

781
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,278
of the cold chain where like you go into

782
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:50,398
a store and there'd be like a little

783
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:52,839
fridge and you'd be like oh they're

784
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:55,839
keeping it cold the only thing in the

785
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:58,678
fridge was beverages with 10 milligrams

786
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:02,278
of distillate so no volatile organic

787
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:04,720
compounds no AR aromatic compounds just

788
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:08,200
distill it and that's the only thing in

789
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,399
the store that's cold everything else in

790
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,360
in on the shelves in the in the back is

791
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:16,038
all at room temperature and the whole

792
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:18,158
store of course reeks like weed and I'm

793
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:19,519
like oh that smells so good and then the

794
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,559
person behind the counter is like yeah

795
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,720
it doesn't it and then I'm like it's too

796
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:26,879
bad it's not still in the product I was

797
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,880
going to buy and then they're like oh

798
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,919
it's like that's a one way of looking at

799
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,880
it it's like cold chain I'd be in like

800
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,360
the center of Canada in Saskatchewan and

801
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,200
the guy would be like well that's

802
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,240
expensive to keep it cold and I'm like

803
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,319
bro you live in Saskatchewan it's like

804
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,839
minus 40 degrees eight months of the

805
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:46,798
year here just put a hole in your roof

806
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:50,278
and pull the air from outside like it's

807
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:52,638
the cold chain if anything else I pray

808
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,919
that the Cannabis uh industry figures

809
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:57,439
out the uh Cold Supply Chain because

810
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:59,600
that's got to be that's a pretty

811
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,840
difficult thing to work like when you've

812
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:05,158
done everything right from growing the

813
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:08,078
Cannabis to harvesting it to processing

814
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:10,679
it to getting it packaged and ready for

815
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,839
market and then someone leaves that [ __ ]

816
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:16,000
in a warehouse that's like uh 9906

817
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,639
degrees in the shade for the weekend and

818
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,838
it's a long weekend go ahead mi in

819
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,838
Canada you guys have like a central drro

820
00:34:20,838 --> 00:34:24,519
and I did some Consulting for them on

821
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:26,119
what temperatures they should be keeping

822
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:27,719
their products at actually you know

823
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:29,559
fairly recently so hopefully that does

824
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,480
does change soon well they're all

825
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:36,639
provincial too so it's like you got the

826
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,639
agcl and the ALG AGL it's in that's the

827
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,800
Alberta one there's the OCS in Ontario

828
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,559
there's the bldb in British Columbia

829
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,039
that each province has their own one and

830
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:47,039
I know they're going to figure it out

831
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,878
eventually and I know it has to work

832
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,239
because I know they do it for like

833
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,519
spinach and cucumbers and tomatoes and

834
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:55,118
[ __ ] they don't just send that stuff at

835
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,400
room temperature and there's very small

836
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,519
margins on that product compared to the

837
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,639
mar that are available on our product so

838
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:05,119
it has to be an affordable option I mean

839
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,480
Caitlyn don't you want your [ __ ] to be

840
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,680
preserved right to the day someone

841
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,000
cracks it open and takes a rip so bad so

842
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:15,319
bad it drives me nuts um somehow we

843
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,079
ended up the lucky one in BC and the BC

844
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,800
Provincial board is the body that sells

845
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:20,200
our product across the country and for

846
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,359
some reason they've chosen us as the

847
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:23,598
ones that they're going to keep cold but

848
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:24,880
they won't keep us in the fridge they'll

849
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,440
keep us in the coldest section of their

850
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,160
warehouse which makes no sense so by the

851
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,000
time the product gets to the consumer

852
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:33,078
it's not what left my building right

853
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,838
it's very frustrating we have a second

854
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:36,960
delivery option where we can ship from

855
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:38,639
my facility two stores directly which is

856
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,760
nice so those ones stay cold and that's

857
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,039
how I know the stores that know the

858
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,839
premium product because they know

859
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,960
they're purchasing from me from my

860
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:47,239
fridge and putting it into their fridge

861
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,838
which is what we need to happen across

862
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:51,000
the board but I can't convince Ontario

863
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:52,880
to put our product in the fridge it

864
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,880
would be a pretty crazy product if

865
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,760
someone invented the stay cold jar that

866
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,680
was some sort of like advanced

867
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,480
technology wasn't wasteful and

868
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:02,919
detrimental to the environment because I

869
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,358
can already see the comments in the

870
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,318
YouTube page but wow wouldn't that just

871
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:10,119
be a Dre dream you just had a jar that

872
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:12,440
you could like just set the temperature

873
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:15,400
on it and whenever you opened it it was

874
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,519
just like a cool oh that's honey bananas

875
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,559
that's

876
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:20,880
nice or like here we have to do a

877
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:23,039
significant amount of secondary

878
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,640
packaging so I can send you my jar but I

879
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,759
can send it it has to go in this because

880
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,838
of all these warning labels but maybe if

881
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,359
this package keep the jar cold that

882
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:34,358
would be pretty sweet it'd be so sweet

883
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:37,119
somehow some way it would be amazing do

884
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:40,000
consumer direct consumer I feel like is

885
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,480
the only way to like really control if

886
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,480
you're gonna I I teach my clients not to

887
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,719
launch with melt or fresh press unless

888
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,760
they have a direct consumer model just

889
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:52,078
because it's there's no control over it

890
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,119
unless you have that control and as a

891
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,440
hash maker you know we we need that

892
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,280
control so I feel like certain direct

893
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,920
consumer models are the only where to go

894
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:04,440
with those you know unstable products I

895
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,240
will say that the patella if you do have

896
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,599
a six-star and you want to stabilize it

897
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:12,159
somewhat if you turn it into

898
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:16,359
patella I mean that's basically buttered

899
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:18,159
out sugary resin shippable right it's it

900
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:20,598
I think it would be interesting I had

901
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:23,199
some on my counter here for months and

902
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:24,960
it pretty much stayed it it dried out a

903
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,759
little over time and became a little

904
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,280
less turpy but uh for the most part it

905
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,400
kept its sort of foamy hashy look that

906
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,280
uh which goes back to you know Temple

907
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,800
balls and a lot of the other technology

908
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:43,400
in our history of being able to you know

909
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:45,599
import export transport that material um

910
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,200
that's why they were doing it that way I

911
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,680
feel like it just kind of is a nice

912
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:51,159
throwback I love that patella's kind of

913
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,799
brought it back to the

914
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:57,598
Forefront yeah this might be my rose

915
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:00,240
tinted glasses but I I I just missed

916
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,440
that that deli style like this is coming

917
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,039
from someone who has a bunch of

918
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,480
packaging like you guys like it's it's

919
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:08,880
crazy you know and like I miss like

920
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,280
having the relationship with the bud

921
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,440
tender and they like you so they'll give

922
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,960
you the fat nug they're like I got you I

923
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,599
see that fat Nug in that jar yeah or you

924
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,119
know like back in the day you know back

925
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:19,960
in the day people used to just cut our

926
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,000
hash up for us you know they you bring

927
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,760
the ball you sell the ball as is I

928
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,239
missed yeah yeah I just want to sell the

929
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,160
ball as is and that is up to you how you

930
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,239
store that and if you [ __ ] it up that's

931
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,118
not my

932
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:36,598
problem y I have people all the time oh

933
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:38,318
how do you you know cure your hash like

934
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,960
do you cure it in the fridge and I'll be

935
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:43,639
like well that's more of a Preserve in

936
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,240
the fridge but uh yeah it depends on

937
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:47,519
what you want to do like do you want to

938
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,838
off gas some of your volatile organic

939
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,759
compounds because you think the ones

940
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:55,639
underneath might be better or are you of

941
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,720
the school that you want every last one

942
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:59,559
I'm not wasting a single one of those

943
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:02,598
and those are very different schools and

944
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:04,440
they're they're very stubborn each side

945
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,119
like you can't convince one side of the

946
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,599
other they both I'm kind of in the

947
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:11,880
middle I appreciate both sides um I do

948
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,838
appreciate a very nice cured full melt

949
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,599
or dry sift but at the same time I'll

950
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:19,639
smash something that was freshly made

951
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:22,000
and has all the costic monot turps in

952
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:24,639
there too grabbing me by the back of my

953
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,079
throat hey what do you all think about

954
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:29,279
argon um I know you know this is a a

955
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:32,680
salt V group but I've been seeing a lot

956
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,880
of uh really cool results from utilizing

957
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:37,399
argon to remove oxygen in the

958
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,599
environment and and stop oxidization

959
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,880
long PA and things it it was originally

960
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:46,680
a mix people were talking 80% um

961
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,800
nitrogen 20% CO2 but what they found is

962
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:50,519
that the Cannabis when it degrades in

963
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,800
the containers because that's what

964
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:55,800
happens in California it actually turns

965
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,960
to CO2 so the change in niik was to

966
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,800
argon um that way it was another stable

967
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,318
uh innert gas uh to stabilize that with

968
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,079
the nitrogen seems to be better that way

969
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,838
if you read any um CO2 you know that

970
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:10,680
it's the degradation of the plant so

971
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:12,838
that's where science has recently

972
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:15,000
interacted but I don't see a lot of

973
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:19,480
products that unfortunately do and I

974
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,519
wish we had Co chain and that 8020 mix

975
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,358
would

976
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:28,480
stabilize argon argon argon is heavier

977
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:33,880
than air right so AR it'll push

978
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:36,559
yeah argon well pushes out so air is 79%

979
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,200
nitrogen right so it's mostly nitrogen

980
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:42,239
what we're breathing there's a little

981
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:45,159
bit of oxygen in there but so argon in a

982
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:48,159
container like if you're flushing out a

983
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:49,440
container people like to blanket you

984
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,799
know

985
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,079
uh any product with yeah even flour hey

986
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,640
Nika it's good to see you again buddy so

987
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,599
so good to see you when you're up here

988
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:04,400
in Vermont it's good to see your bearded

989
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:08,559
face here on camera um yeah so argon

990
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:11,318
which is more expensive than nitrogen is

991
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,559
heavier and so it'll actually

992
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:15,759
volumetrically displace everything

993
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:19,159
that's underneath it in a closed

994
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,079
container so it's just more efficient

995
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:24,559
I've been using a lot of my cold cure in

996
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:26,599
my parts it's just uh I don't know I

997
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:29,920
think uh for shelf stability it's been a

998
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:35,559
fun little new toy newer for me anyways

999
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:38,440
absolutely I I used it 25 years ago in

1000
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:41,440
my dry suit for scuba diving in the

1001
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,639
Pacific Ocean in the winter and so when

1002
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,880
you when you when you regulate with

1003
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:49,799
argon because it's heavier and this is

1004
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,039
weird because it would you're warmer

1005
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,839
with Argon gas regulating your buoyancy

1006
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,960
compensator which basically is your dry

1007
00:41:54,838 --> 00:42:00,000
suit and uh when your dry suit diving

1008
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,400
um so yeah I used argon the ocean's

1009
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,358
really cold like it's cold on top but

1010
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,318
when you go down like 20 or 30 feet oof

1011
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:10,400
gets wicked wicked cold so yeah dry suit

1012
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:13,358
little argon in there and I guess the

1013
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,559
heavier aspect of it just makes the air

1014
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:19,598
or the space between your body and the

1015
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:22,679
dry suit warmer than

1016
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,079
colder yes another thing you have to be

1017
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:27,159
careful about we should make sure

1018
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:30,000
everyone knows about this is you can

1019
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:32,440
iate yourself you can literally die by

1020
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,800
breathing argon so if you took a balloon

1021
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,720
like you were sucking on a nitrous

1022
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,400
balloon and that was full of argon and

1023
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:40,759
you suck that in you can die because

1024
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,680
it'll volumetrically displace all the

1025
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,040
air which is the oxygen in your lungs

1026
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:46,919
and now it's going to take several

1027
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,838
breathing cycles for you to completely

1028
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:53,119
clean that out so yes this is why our

1029
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:57,480
drysuits were

1030
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,400
yeah bre it did youti

1031
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,039
I've seen lots of people knock

1032
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:05,960
themselves out with n nitrous oxide from

1033
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:11,039
breathing it straight without taking a

1034
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:14,559
pause with oxygen oh yeah that's a fish

1035
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:16,318
fish lot standard yeah they they they

1036
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,280
could have not only died from

1037
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:22,440
asphixiation you know uh when you have

1038
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,960
nitrous in your system it starts

1039
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,119
affecting main brain stem function like

1040
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,280
like your pulmonary function and your

1041
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,280
your ability to breathe and your ability

1042
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,359
to so here's here's a weird thing Dr

1043
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,640
Mark when I broke my when I broke my

1044
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:38,960
collar bone about four months ago I went

1045
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:40,759
to the hospital in in Whistler and she

1046
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,559
was like oh let me get you some pain

1047
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,760
meds and I was like oh I don't I don't

1048
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:46,440
take those and she's like ooh she's like

1049
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,680
this is a really painful break I'm like

1050
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,720
I know I I did it on this side already

1051
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:53,440
and you guys told me the same thing and

1052
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,959
we got oural I'm I'm good or whatever

1053
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,159
and she's like okay well what about like

1054
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,519
do you want some nitrous oxide she's

1055
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:02,399
like you there's no amount you can do of

1056
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:07,119
that that's too much and she like Wheels

1057
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:09,920
this nitrous oxide uh tank into my and I

1058
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,838
I've never used nitrous oxide as a pain

1059
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,318
uh relief but holy [ __ ] dude this [ __ ]

1060
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:18,440
was I wasn't laughing it just melted the

1061
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,920
pain the shock I was in total shock it

1062
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,358
had happened like 20 minutes prior so I

1063
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,400
was just like in shock it melted the

1064
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:26,558
shock

1065
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,880
away I just thought it was the strangest

1066
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:28,960
thing she was like here's the nitrous

1067
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,640
and then she was like and remember

1068
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,519
there's no amount you can do that can

1069
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:35,639
kill you or something like that or I was

1070
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:37,358
just like that's a weird thing and it's

1071
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:40,519
like they have some oxygen in there to

1072
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:42,480
make sure that you're not gonna die May

1073
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:44,880
probably when it's medically

1074
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,480
administered yeah they don't they don't

1075
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,838
kill people at hospitals you got in

1076
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:53,199
America dentists have used it for years

1077
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:54,719
oh yeah absolutely you you go to also

1078
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:57,879
remember this just on the chemistry side

1079
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:59,439
of thing that any other combination so

1080
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,160
nitrous oxide is

1081
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,358
n2o but any other combination of

1082
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:09,358
nitrogen and oxygen is

1083
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:12,400
toxic right so NO2 is toxic n2o2 toxic

1084
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,838
you know all the other you know possible

1085
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,280
compounds you could make between

1086
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:18,279
nitrogen and oxygen are really bad for

1087
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:22,599
you and the reason why it works on pain

1088
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:27,519
Mark is it does have some action at at

1089
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:29,480
the um uh pain receptors and or

1090
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,159
something yeah absolutely there's some

1091
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,119
type of analgesic function that nitrous

1092
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,279
actually I can attest my dentist has

1093
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:37,920
never used it I've never taken it I

1094
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,000
think I might have tried a balloon in

1095
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:44,000
the early 90s or something on tour it

1096
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,400
wasn't my vibe but uh this was like I

1097
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,800
was hitting it they were laughing

1098
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,440
because every time you hit it it has a

1099
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,720
regulator mouthpiece that

1100
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,480
goes so you can hear it throughout the

1101
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:56,598
whole I'm like in a closed room and it

1102
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,530
started really like b b bu and then at

1103
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:01,039
the end was

1104
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:03,480
[Laughter]

1105
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:05,000
like people were giggling they were like

1106
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,559
hey you might want to go take that oxy

1107
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,480
that tank away from him it's like bubble

1108
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,760
man getting down hey I want to talk more

1109
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,440
about the C weed and music thing I will

1110
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,920
tell you Caleb the most excited I ever

1111
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,000
was I have a huge connection to reggae

1112
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:24,240
music it's like my favorite music of all

1113
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,719
time and so to have to be to be sung

1114
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:29,039
about in a reggae song was kind of like

1115
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:32,439
okay okay like when who who's going to

1116
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:34,318
drop it right ET right so yeah I think

1117
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:37,318
it I can't remember I play that tune

1118
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:40,639
isn't it a um uh lenf fire somebody from

1119
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:43,239
that camp luten fire did one I think he

1120
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:46,440
did one called sweet Tricom Richie Spice

1121
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:48,239
did one called dabin which is amazing

1122
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,079
because Richie Spice the first time he

1123
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:53,558
ever went up to my rig in Kingston it

1124
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:56,400
was the straight Fab that actually this

1125
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:58,880
friend he has that straight Fab that I

1126
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,680
dabbed Richie out with in in Jamaica so

1127
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,240
the first time he ever saw it he was you

1128
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:03,838
know Richie's kind of a quiet dude he's

1129
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,838
just like kind of in the background

1130
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,279
quiet and we brought him up to the pipe

1131
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:09,639
and he didn't really know what to do so

1132
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,319
he blew on it and the water came up out

1133
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:13,879
of the denail it was a denail sick dish

1134
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:16,318
so it was like it was no like if it was

1135
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,720
a sapphire oo that thing would have

1136
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:19,639
cracked right in half it would have been

1137
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:21,799
a bad scene but it was the sick dish the

1138
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:23,719
silicone carbide dish and so I was like

1139
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,480
dude it's totally doesn't matter at all

1140
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:28,399
I can wipe this down no harm done but

1141
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,480
that was the beginning of the first time

1142
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,039
I ever dabbed him out and then two years

1143
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,880
later he wrote that song dabbing which

1144
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:38,558
is definitely uh I actually got to in

1145
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:41,838
Jamaica at a concert go on stage with

1146
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,920
him and dab while he was singing that

1147
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,519
song He's like he's like bubble man come

1148
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,519
dab dab up on stage you know while I

1149
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:51,358
sing the song I was just like this is

1150
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:53,639
[ __ ] surreal so how many different

1151
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,920
things like that did you look at Caleb

1152
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:57,960
is it just CI weed right now sort of on

1153
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,000
the surface or are you going a little

1154
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:04,159
deeper into sort of these certain terms

1155
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,880
that catch on and Germany of all places

1156
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,598
that's interesting which also has

1157
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,519
probably I don't know what you would say

1158
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,240
Nic outside of California one of the

1159
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:15,679
largest reggae followings on the planet

1160
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:18,039
they got to be up there and Japan I mean

1161
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,358
Japan loves Bob Marley but yeah Germany

1162
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:22,920
is huge Germany is huge for

1163
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:24,880
reggae um like the pressings that I get

1164
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,440
from Germany the seven inch pressings

1165
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,400
are always way more high quality than

1166
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:33,079
any us pressing any Jamaican pressing

1167
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:35,318
German vinyl is of another level they're

1168
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:38,359
real audio files that come out of you

1169
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:41,039
know German production I feel yeah

1170
00:48:38,358 --> 00:48:45,598
German German audio files German audio

1171
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:47,599
files for real that's what's up yeah the

1172
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,920
culture is pretty popular in Japan

1173
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:53,000
actually when I was a kid I used to go

1174
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,760
shopping at these little rosta stores in

1175
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,838
Japan and it kind of you wouldn't think

1176
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,520
but yeah to your point Nick like they

1177
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:03,920
they really do love their Reay music and

1178
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,559
they're really good at it too um they

1179
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,240
have some really great groups that come

1180
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:09,559
out of Japan and Korea I think at Sierra

1181
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:11,598
Nevada I don't know if you were there

1182
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:15,519
Nick but one year at Sierra Nevada there

1183
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:19,440
was this Korean uh Reay band and they

1184
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,920
they just they they killed it that was

1185
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,240
one of the best shows I've I've seen but

1186
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,920
I wish I can remember their name but

1187
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,279
that was fun Sierra Nevada is a really

1188
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:32,000
fun Festival that used to happen out

1189
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:34,240
here in mesino County we've gone for two

1190
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,039
decades or some [ __ ] it's really sad

1191
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:40,118
that it's not g to be happening anymore

1192
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:42,759
um but yes si Nevada was like my

1193
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:46,119
stomping grounds I feel like probably

1194
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,839
where we met initially yeah probably

1195
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:51,519
probably but that you were like little

1196
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:53,960
little yeah I was really young you know

1197
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:56,039
man I you know like I was I was W you

1198
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,838
know I was really like in my early 20s

1199
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:00,558
when when you saw me walking around with

1200
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:02,480
Frenchie everywhere no I think even

1201
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,359
before that I think I'm talking well

1202
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,798
before the Frenchie time I'm talking

1203
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:08,838
like when I would you know see your

1204
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:12,519
brother in the dance when we were

1205
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:14,159
teenagers oh oh okay okay I hear you I

1206
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:16,400
hear you yeah I think that's probably

1207
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:18,679
when I first met you you were probably

1208
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,358
like real young when when did you first

1209
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:22,960
started going C no well you might be

1210
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:25,159
confusing me for somebody else just

1211
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,760
because I get that a lot in my town

1212
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:29,399
don't get me wrong I get that a ton

1213
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,559
there is somebody out here that looks

1214
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,798

1215
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:36,960

1216
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:38,480
I was a teenager I grew up over seed

1217
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,318

States when I was 19 years old all right

1219
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:44,838

00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,798
what a great show and God that Korean

1226
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,519

1227
00:51:00,798 --> 00:51:05,880
like that that I would my jaw drop to

1228

1231
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:16,358
the comments later once I once I find

1232
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:20,358
it go ahead Sam I like the ray gay music

1233
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:22,039
that includes songs like skunk and hay

1234
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:25,358
and

1235
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:27,239
you dude your your mark that you put on

1236
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:31,039
the the the I'm

1237
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:32,719
sure is is uncomparable like when I

1238
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,639
first went to Amsterdam everything was

1239
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:39,318
skunk number one in like 95 it was it

1240
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:41,879
was every coffee shop was like skunk

1241
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:44,440
Haze Northern Lights it was like those

1242
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,640
were the standards those were the ogs uh

1243
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:49,280
Caleb it was uh you were about to answer

1244
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:52,558
before uh you you missed it so why don't

1245
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,160
you go ahead now got it this time so um

1246
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,798
yeah brother with uh with reggae

1247
00:51:55,159 --> 00:52:00,598
specifically um you know when they are

1248
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:03,159
singing about C weed there's a portion

1249
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:06,960
of time when it's not about California

1250
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:10,558
it's Cali with a K right or it's c o l l

1251
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:13,838
i e and that that transition itself can

1252
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:16,040
be viewed as well and that's very and so

1253
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:20,558
for people that don't know p with the K

1254
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:22,880
is referring to a Indian deity that is

1255
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,760
you know P related and so like there are

1256
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,760
certain cultivars right like C Miss with

1257
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,000
a k that you might see people selling

1258
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,359
with a c and they're just getting the

1259
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,920
story wrong

1260
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:37,078
arguably but there are also artists

1261
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,559
where you know like for instance colie

1262
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:41,720
buds uh who right there between reggae

1263
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:44,400
and Hip Hop where you can see like when

1264
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:47,439
early on in his career he mentions CI

1265
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,720
weed with a K later on it's C weed with

1266
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,760
a c and you can see the context of the

1267
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:54,239
mentions changing and everything like

1268
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,880
that across reggae artists and you know

1269
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,159
hip-hop artists even hip-hop artists

1270
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,318
originally

1271
00:52:57,159 --> 00:53:02,399
might have been mentioning it with the K

1272
00:52:59,318 --> 00:53:05,880
before you know C really became online

1273
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:08,680
and um it's very to go off what uh Sam

1274
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,440
the skman was saying um I have been

1275
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:13,399
looking a lot also on like specific

1276
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:17,119
cultiv our mentions so I sent him a a

1277
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:19,639
very funny song about skunk from the UK

1278
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,760
that um love to send everyone else as

1279
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:23,960
well the chorus basically goes you know

1280
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,000
he didn't sell me weed he sold me skunk

1281
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,358
and the whole song about how skunk got

1282
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,798
him way too high and it's just

1283
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:31,279
hysterical that this kind of stuff

1284
00:53:29,798 --> 00:53:34,480
happens and it's totally part of the

1285
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,400
Cannabis culture and so this C weed

1286
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,760

small list of a few hundred songs that

1289
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,400

able to see it ongoing has really been

1319

lots of time in in re I mean kie c o l i

1335
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:45,960
e I mean I heard that for for years um

1336
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:47,960
Caleb is that only referenced in

1337
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:51,798
Jamaican music the kweed before it

1338
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:53,798
became C weed um because to my knowledge

1339
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:56,838
I only heard it through you know reggae

1340
00:55:53,798 --> 00:55:58,038
or dub style you know

1341
00:55:56,838 --> 00:56:01,440
yeah and

1342
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:03,200
so go ahead sorry kie is like a pwa

1343
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,000
version of Cali which came from the

1344
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:07,399
Indian culture because there's so much

1345
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,358
Indian culture in Jamaica there's just

1346
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:13,440
you know there's that uh indocar

1347
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:14,920
Caribbean the coolies yeah yep the

1348
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,679
coolies everywhere they went they

1349
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:19,960
brought their ganja and that is the

1350
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:22,960
beginning of smoking culture in a lot of

1351
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:25,159
dis they also went where they went at

1352
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,358
their own accord right like becoming

1353
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:28,719
indentured slaves Jamaica but they still

1354
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:31,279
got on the boats and packed their

1355
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:33,358
luggage they did not do that in Africa

1356
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,680
Africans weren't grabbing cannabis seeds

1357
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,960
and like recipes and [ __ ] they were just

1358
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:40,838
getting like thrown on the boats Indians

1359
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:42,599
were like packing suitcases and like oh

1360
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:44,639
we're going to live in a better world

1361
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:46,440
like this is going to be amazing so it's

1362
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,440
pretty crazy how that that played out

1363
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:52,318
but the Indian culture has a big

1364
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,039
footprint in Jamaica I'm convinced

1365
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:57,519
Jamaican patties are flattened out

1366
00:56:54,039 --> 00:57:00,839
samosas like almost certainly

1367
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:04,400
um the whole like all the the the like

1368
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:07,078
the when you meet a dread in in Jamaica

1369
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:10,639
that has like nine or 10 foot long

1370
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:13,440
dreadlocks for sure he comes from India

1371
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:15,960
his family is is of Indian lineage those

1372
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,079
guys grow dreadlocks like nobody's

1373
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:22,679
business but then they can't grow facial

1374
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:25,280
hair either you know certain redish

1375
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:27,358
tinted skin and you know yeah like I

1376
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,720
mean [ __ ] like Richie spice I'd say is

1377
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:36,159
is from

1378
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:36,159
that cultural push also in serom same

1379
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:40,639
story yep and there were Indian

1380
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:46,960
indentured servants that went to

1381
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:46,960
Cambodia as well and um a lot of other

1382
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:53,559
places what's the earliest song that you

1383
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:56,280
have found that has a reference to

1384
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:57,640
cannabis so when I first started looking

1385
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,440
you know it was just what I could find

1386
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:02,480
on YouTube so it was limited also to

1387
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,679
like English language stuff so you know

1388
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:07,880
I got to like some early jazz songs

1389
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:10,679
maybe the 1920s and then once I talked

1390
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:13,000
with Skunk Man Sam through you ATN uh

1391
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:15,279
learned about other older music that's

1392
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,719
not even in English that's about passion

1393
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,359
cannabis so really there's always stuff

1394
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:24,919
to learn so you're deep diving on that

1395
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:26,960
now gotcha Pakistan India yeah they all

1396
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:29,480
have old cannabis

1397
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,720
music well then Sam what's the oldest

1398
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:34,440
reference of music that you have found

1399
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:38,038
that has cannabis you know I I don't

1400
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:41,159
know the the true history and dates of a

1401
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:44,079
lot of this music and uh a lot of it I

1402
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:49,078
can't understand because it's in Hindi

1403
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:52,200
or uh a a different language but uh I I

1404
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:55,039
I I did turn

1405
00:58:52,199 --> 00:59:01,078
uh

1406
00:58:55,039 --> 00:59:03,480
uh CB onto uh the uh Greek stuff I was

1407
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:08,079
familiar with which is some of it's

1408
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:11,519
pretty old the retico retico yeah I've

1409
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,519
got a huge collection of

1410
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:17,038
that as well I uh I downloaded a bunch

1411
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:20,000
of them for this high tea event because

1412
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:24,440
I felt like it was very fitting um yeah

1413
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:27,400
it's Trippy retico hashishin

1414
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:30,639
Music the high te event was a perfect

1415
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:33,318
place for that music to be

1416
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:37,078
playing people don't understand that

1417
00:59:33,318 --> 00:59:43,480
Greece used to be the major exporter of

1418
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:45,839
hashish in Europe uh long long before uh

1419
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:50,639
I mean they were making hash in linen

1420
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:54,838
bags like Lebanon does today how long

1421
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:56,960
ago oh like a hundred years ago or

1422
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:59,480
longer h

1423
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:03,318
H

1424
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:05,679
interesting linen yeah that's uh tell

1425
01:00:03,318 --> 01:00:07,838
you use your head and you can come up

1426
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:10,558
with some pretty good

1427
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:11,719
ways I saw a video in Afghanistan the

1428
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,039
other day where they were doing the

1429
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:16,000
linen and it was just the seeve but it

1430
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:18,119
was a real nice one he had broken up

1431
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,920
weed on top and it was just

1432
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:22,318
raining dry sift down it actually had a

1433
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:25,000
nice looking color even though it's

1434
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:28,239
always done in the darkest dingiest kind

1435
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,719
of basement with that window

1436
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:34,239
room some great videos on YouTube of

1437
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:36,879
traditional hash making in Afghanistan

1438
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:40,679
if you search for it I think

1439
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:43,200
Chari is one of them that has just all

1440
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:45,440
the pressing the heating the the the

1441
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:47,719
whole process from like harvesting all

1442
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,079
the way to the end and it's very very

1443
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:52,439
traditional and

1444
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:55,318
authentic um it's pretty cool to see

1445
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,920
it's absolutely fascinating how you know

1446
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:59,719
cannabis was made you know oppressed in

1447
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,200
various different cultures so we hid it

1448
01:00:59,719 --> 01:01:06,239
in song right in in in Egypt they they

1449
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:08,639
even changed the name of hashish right

1450
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:10,318
so that you know when the uh Napoleonic

1451
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:13,639
people were trying to make it illegal so

1452
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:17,400
it's fascinating how we still found ways

1453
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:19,798
to hide it in plain sight right that we

1454
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:22,440
we did right we saw you know it really

1455
01:01:19,798 --> 01:01:24,880
emerg sociologically through song right

1456
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,280
it was Cypress Hill was a really big

1457
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,760
push in the hipop community that really

1458
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,640
broke that door open right remember the

1459
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,680
high times when they had the showing how

1460
01:01:31,639 --> 01:01:36,519
to roll a blunt I mean that was

1461
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:40,000
culturally huge in the sense and that

1462
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:42,920
those ripples then felt safer for other

1463
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:47,358
musicians to well if they can do it then

1464
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:49,079
maybe I can because you know um um they

1465
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:52,440
go out on stage and smoke and have

1466
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:55,599
smoked on stage every [ __ ] show since

1467
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:58,240
the beginning you know so I mean be real

1468
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:01,119
and have n nothing but keep it real but

1469
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:04,439
also open that door so others can do the

1470
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:06,960
same right yeah

1471
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:11,639
remember you got to remember that the

1472
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:14,278
Egyptians were pulling the feet out of

1473
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:16,798
hashish uh consumers because they

1474
01:02:14,278 --> 01:02:20,199
weren't smoking it back then they were

1475
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:22,318
eating it and they would pull your teeth

1476
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:25,199
out but what they would do is give you

1477
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:27,838
rotten milk to drink make you throw up

1478
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:32,278
and if it came up green they pulled your

1479
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:35,798
teeth out yeah and and those guys kept

1480
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:39,719
eating hash proving that even 400 years

1481
01:02:35,798 --> 01:02:43,480
ago um prohibition didn't work yeah they

1482
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:45,639
destroyed the garden of Cur which was a

1483
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:47,880
a center of

1484
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:50,239
hashish we celebrated the garden of

1485
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,480
kafur at one of the legends of hashish

1486
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:56,239
uh years ago I have the card in one of

1487
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:59,838
these uh absolutely correct yeah that

1488
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:02,078
was awesome The Garden of

1489
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:04,440
kafur I was looking for the garden of

1490
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:07,200
kafur and in instead I think I found

1491
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,278
like a a Simpsons sticker of big Buddha

1492
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,719
eating a

1493
01:03:08,278 --> 01:03:12,179
burger the [ __ ] you find man the [ __ ]

1494
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:13,598
you

1495
01:03:12,179 --> 01:03:16,798
[Laughter]

1496
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:18,359
find it's everywhere it's all around me

1497
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:20,719
it's

1498
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:23,639
ridiculous oh my

1499
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:25,439
goodness yeah 2025 I'm pretty excited

1500
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:28,239
for this year I got to say it seems like

1501
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:31,079
things are picking up and uh the further

1502
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:35,439
away we get away from that whole covid

1503
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:37,359
uh disaster is uh better I feel every

1504
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:40,480
year that we get past that is just like

1505
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:42,679
another better year and feel pretty

1506
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,920
positive I started the year off uh by

1507
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:49,000
jumping in the Pacific Ocean it was cold

1508
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,480
let me tell you but I did it with my

1509
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,960
whole Community I don't know there was

1510
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,400
probably 200 of us or a hundred of us I

1511
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,358
don't know how many of us it's a small

1512
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,400
community here there's only about 1100

1513
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:01,519
people that live in my little village I

1514
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:06,000
love that I live in a village I live in

1515
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:09,400
the village of Lions Bay a small Seaside

1516
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,278
Shanty it's quite lovely just across

1517
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:14,880
from Bowen Island Davis just across from

1518
01:04:12,278 --> 01:04:16,559
Bowen Island Lions Bay is definitely a

1519
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,920
really special spot for sure I've been

1520
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:21,319
going there since I was like pretty

1521
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,920
young amazing amazing out there yeah

1522
01:04:21,318 --> 01:04:25,119
there's something really distinct about

1523
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,240
like the small communities around in BC

1524
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,160
it's really

1525
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:29,798
uh the people are really Pleasant

1526
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:32,440
there's really that sense of community

1527
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:34,278
too that I really like that I feel like

1528
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,278
maybe don't necessarily get as much

1529
01:04:34,278 --> 01:04:38,760
these days in smaller towns it's kind of

1530
01:04:36,278 --> 01:04:41,278
becoming more decentralized the way like

1531
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,359
people do things but I I can't speak for

1532
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:45,760
Lions Bay but I feel over here there's

1533
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:47,598
still a lot of that which is fantastic

1534
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:50,000
well you have your hall right your town

1535
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:51,318
hall that everyone goes to for parties

1536
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
and stuff and when you go to those

1537
01:04:51,318 --> 01:04:56,159
parties in a place like Salt Spring

1538
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Island or Bowen island or even Lions Bay

1539
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:01,598
you'll see people of all ages at those

1540
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,318
parties from like three years old up to

1541
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:06,798
like 85 or 90 years old our Elder was

1542
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:09,440
103 years old she just passed away last

1543
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:10,639
year Bernice but yeah it was just kind

1544
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,639
of like you get together with your

1545
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:14,519
community you didn't have to like

1546
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:18,400
there's definitely a price you pay when

1547
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:21,358
you isolate yourself towards like people

1548
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,358
that are only like like-minded people

1549
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:25,159
and there's a total value I mean it's

1550
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:28,318
why I love hash church so much of having

1551
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:30,719
your community of your tribe who who

1552
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:32,960
vibrate at your frequency but there's

1553
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,598
also a real value in hanging out with

1554
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,720
people who are in your community

1555
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:38,599
regardless of their frequency and

1556
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:41,239
learning things that you would otherwise

1557
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:44,720
completely not be exposed to I have a

1558
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:46,919
real appreciation uh for that small

1559
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:49,199
village mentality and that's why we we

1560
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,920
raised our kids here not in a not in a

1561
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:52,679
big

1562
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,159
city there's all that diversity you're

1563
01:05:52,679 --> 01:05:56,399
right like what's really interesting

1564
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:59,199
over here is that whe whether it's uh

1565
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,680
politics or just individual uh let's say

1566
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:04,000
like ideology there's a really diverse

1567
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:05,719
set and for me at least I found I was

1568
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,679
really fortunate to grow up with people

1569
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:10,199
who had very different perspectives and

1570
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:11,679
maybe I don't necessarily agree with

1571
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:14,558
everything they say but I can see the

1572
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:16,199
logic and points and uh arguments that

1573
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,920
they have that maybe I disagree with but

1574
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:20,358
I see where their logic's coming from

1575
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:23,119
and I feel that these days you know you

1576
01:06:20,358 --> 01:06:24,400
kind of tend to stay more in your group

1577
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,400
and then when there's that you don't

1578
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,240
really necessarily open up to any ideas

1579
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,880
that aren't yours or aren't what people

1580
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:34,598
around you would have I think also was

1581
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,760
pretty unique here is that it's such a

1582
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:38,440
diverse set of what people's professions

1583
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:41,278
are I mean don't get me wrong there's a

1584
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:42,720
lot of um construction here but I mean

1585
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:44,880
there's a lot of artists I mean I came

1586
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,879
from a family of artists and a lot of

1587
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:49,000
people around me are and then on top of

1588
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:51,559
that too I mean we have researchers like

1589
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,760
Wayne Davis who live on Bowen Island so

1590
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:55,920
it's pretty mind-blowing and if people

1591
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:59,319
aren't aware of his work it's uh done a

1592
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,480
lot of work on uh psychoactive drug

1593
01:06:59,318 --> 01:07:04,358
research which is pretty fascinating

1594
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:06,838
ranging from U all different

1595
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:09,078
continents yeah Wade's amazing for sure

1596
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:11,119
no doubt about it yeah there's a real

1597
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:13,760
value in that

1598
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:15,720
um maintaining access to people that

1599
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,440
don't necessarily think like you I think

1600
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:20,199
what happens when you hang out with

1601
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:23,039
people in a in a village like that you

1602
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:25,879
become less polarized and you all tend

1603
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,920
to live metaphorically kind kind of in

1604
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,519
the body of the bird when it comes to

1605
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,200
your belief systems you're mostly in

1606
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:34,119
agreeance and it's only in the isolation

1607
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:36,278
when you isolate yourself into these

1608
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:38,278
particular groups and really isolate

1609
01:07:36,278 --> 01:07:40,358
that you that you get pushed further and

1610
01:07:38,278 --> 01:07:43,480
further into the extreme left or the

1611
01:07:40,358 --> 01:07:46,719
extreme right but it's like those wings

1612
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:48,719
can't fly without the bird and one of

1613
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:50,879
those wings can't fly without the other

1614
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:53,679
Wing so it's like the bird needs to be

1615
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:56,400
whole figure it

1616
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:58,798
out no definitely

1617
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,599
I just wanted to sa to uh what Caleb's

1618
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:02,440
been talking about about the history of

1619
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:04,760
music and its connection with cannabis

1620
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:06,960
like American culture in terms of the

1621
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:09,520
development from like jazz in the 20s to

1622
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:12,679
then Blues to then rock all the way up

1623
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:16,278
to hip hop and the current age like it's

1624
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:19,479
amazing how many references and how

1625
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:21,520
entangled I guess I'd say both are I

1626
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:23,158
mean like the the Jazz Community would

1627
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:26,560
not have been what it was through the

1628
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:28,119
20s to the 60s if it wasn't for the

1629
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,798
connections it had to the Cannabis

1630
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:32,559
industry even all the way back then and

1631
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:35,399
same I'd say the same would apply to

1632
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,480
blues and rock as well and hipop and

1633
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:40,838
glass

1634
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:43,158
blowing yeah oh yeah yeah there's

1635
01:08:40,838 --> 01:08:46,679
connection about it that just lifts your

1636
01:08:43,158 --> 01:08:48,318
soul you just get um I you know when I

1637
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:50,520
was a kid it's almost like I had like

1638
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:54,480
two left feet I did dance you know I did

1639
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:57,120
all that and when I started smoking weed

1640
01:08:54,479 --> 01:09:00,238
I could dance I could feel Rhythm like

1641
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:03,399
music was like like I don't know there's

1642
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:05,519
just another level that like I I I just

1643
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:08,158
wish like I I wasn't shamed on as a kid

1644
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,480
for for like wanting to smoke weed

1645
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:12,519
because there was something where where

1646
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,479
like Not only was dance and Rhythm so

1647
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,679
much more easier but math was easier I

1648
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:18,838
was like oh I can I can do math really

1649
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:20,960
quick in my head now there I I don't

1650
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:23,759
know what it is but uh but there's

1651
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,759
something about making music while

1652
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,960
you're high and you're just on this

1653
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:31,158
level and you're and especially like

1654
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:34,158
you're saying Davis the the Jazz like

1655
01:09:31,158 --> 01:09:36,920
everybody is playing a different in

1656
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:41,039
instrument but they're all on the same

1657
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:43,359
vibration yeah and like and weed is like

1658
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:44,798
I it it and and it happens with a lot of

1659
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,880
things you know you can be like we are

1660
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:48,479
now we're all high and we're all having

1661
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,400
a really deep you know in depth

1662
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:53,759
conversation where we're on the

1663
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:55,839
vibration but um it's crazy that weed

1664
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:57,279
has influen through time and that's

1665
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,319
that's just talking about jazz I mean

1666
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:01,079
who knows what the tribal music drum

1667
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:03,119
circles were like when everybody was

1668
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:05,399
high that must have been lit they must

1669
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:08,800
have had so much

1670
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:11,158
fun yeah it's also not just the names in

1671
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:14,520
music now I mean the names of bands have

1672
01:10:11,158 --> 01:10:16,839
gone cannabis right um which has been a

1673
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:20,120
significant shift right that's it's one

1674
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:22,520
thing to hide that right with within a

1675
01:10:20,119 --> 01:10:25,399
song it's another thing to really out

1676
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:27,440
yourself in the early 90s I I traveled

1677
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:29,759
with another um band out of San

1678
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:32,238
Francisco called total devastation and

1679
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,960
they were totally about cannabis from

1680
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:37,759
the top to the bottom and you know the

1681
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:40,960
reactions we got when we were in New

1682
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:44,320
Mexico versus Arizona early on I mean

1683
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:47,319
people were like what the flying [ __ ]

1684
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:49,599
are you guys talking about how dare you

1685
01:10:47,319 --> 01:10:52,399
come to Texas and talk about Mara

1686
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,480
[ __ ] hanana you know and be not not

1687
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:58,519
even Whit and saying that sort of [ __ ]

1688
01:10:54,479 --> 01:11:00,759
dude it was really challenging

1689
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:03,280
Stephen no I was going to piggyback on

1690
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,360
what Laura said like etn and I are both

1691
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:06,800
veterans um a lot of the work that I do

1692
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:09,599
is with athletes I know you were talking

1693
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:13,760
about your Jiu-Jitsu I think it's funny

1694
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:15,600
that we want our musicians to be high

1695
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,560
but then we ridicule our athletes for

1696
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,800
being high and it's just like that

1697
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,640
performance that you were just talking

1698
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,400
about that flow state which is like the

1699
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,760
focus of my whole work um that flow

1700
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:28,198
state does go back to indigenous culture

1701
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,920
across every continent like you said

1702
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:31,879
drum circles and different things like

1703
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,920
that and I think it's funny that we do

1704
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,840
want our artists like if there's an

1705
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,239
artist who you know smokes and they

1706
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,239
didn't smoke before that performance

1707
01:11:37,238 --> 01:11:41,279
you're gonna be like oh man this isn't

1708
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:44,000
this isn't GNA be as good as I it could

1709
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:46,198
be but if if you find out that your best

1710
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,880
athlete you know broke some record and

1711
01:11:46,198 --> 01:11:49,839
they had cannabis in their system then

1712
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,639
we're just like that's actually

1713
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,920
penalized we don't want that but it's

1714
01:11:51,639 --> 01:11:55,639
all flow States it's all performance

1715
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,560
that's a good way of putting it the Flow

1716
01:11:55,639 --> 01:12:02,279
State and it yeah I like that and the

1717
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:04,520
how it really does help achieve the Flow

1718
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:06,880
State even in yeah you're right in my

1719
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:09,080
martial arts if I'm if I'm on a Vibe and

1720
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:12,039
not only on weed too sometimes mushrooms

1721
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:13,920
you know sometimes a little acid it I'm

1722
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:15,399
like I'm real about it but not a lot you

1723
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,319
know but there's a point where it's just

1724
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:19,879
like I achieve this Flow State like the

1725
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:22,399
music's going you're just going with

1726
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,800
your partner like nothing else matters

1727
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:28,119
in the world and you're just like it's

1728
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,760
it's a amazing it feels really good and

1729
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:32,880
it feels good to achieve that with

1730
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,560
instruments too Laur did you also feel

1731
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,079
that you know when you were also you

1732
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,800
know doing your you know your your uh

1733
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:41,600
martial arts that it helped Center you

1734
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:43,560
you know because when I was a kid I

1735
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,159
remember you know when I would go for my

1736
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:47,920
Taekwondo we would sit and we'd have to

1737
01:12:45,158 --> 01:12:50,158
Center ourselves and get ourselves there

1738
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:52,359
I would have the hardest time doing that

1739
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:56,039
but if I smoked a little bit of pot I

1740
01:12:52,359 --> 01:13:00,599
was there and ready did you find that

1741
01:12:56,039 --> 01:13:02,519
preparation yes yeah I I I like doing

1742
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:06,120
both like I like doing it just through

1743
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:08,840
breathing and and and like finding

1744
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:11,599
self-acceptance and like accepting

1745
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:13,400
myself accepting my choices like loving

1746
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,600
myself you know like trying it through

1747
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:18,920
the yogi style too like breathing but

1748
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,239
every now and then like um I I find

1749
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,600
myself more of than knot because I have

1750
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:26,718
to check out through a busy day I have

1751
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:30,440
to switch hats it's like I have to take

1752
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:33,679
a production hat off and put uh martial

1753
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:35,879
arts hat on and weed helps achieve that

1754
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:38,119
flow State and helps me get into that

1755
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:40,800
moment and like really just have a good

1756

01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:10,359
kind of not having to think about

1767
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,960
anything else um outside of just like

1768
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:13,839
what you guys are doing like dancing

1769
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,760
it's like it's very much like dancing

1770
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,079
too and it gets you kind of in the mood

1771
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,679
for

1772
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:21,960
dancing I get it on my snowboard when

1773
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:24,199
I'm ripping down the backside of whistle

1774
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:28,319
bowl and I've got like Metallica

1775
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:32,238
disposable here blaring in my

1776
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:35,880
ears amazing oh my God probably going

1777
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:38,319
around 80 kilometers an hour just what's

1778
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:40,960
that no I was saying that's superhero

1779
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:43,639
stuff right there like that's it is like

1780
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:45,198
my job because people now know like

1781
01:14:43,639 --> 01:14:46,880
music can put you in this heightened

1782
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:48,279
State and then if you're you have

1783
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,359
cannabis in your system you're in this

1784
01:14:48,279 --> 01:14:53,000
Flow State so you're almost in this

1785
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:55,479
balance of like the energy of the music

1786
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,238
is like surging through me I can feel my

1787
01:14:55,479 --> 01:15:00,718
body but I'm also very calm and focused

1788
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:02,638
I can see everything right before it

1789
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:04,119
happens and I think that's what all of

1790
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:06,400
us are looking for like when people

1791
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:08,198
think everybody's getting blitzed a lot

1792
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:10,839
of us are so stressed out this does

1793
01:15:08,198 --> 01:15:13,319
bring us to that like very natural flow

1794
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,159
state of balance I told somebody the

1795
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:17,399
best way I can explain mushrooms to

1796
01:15:15,158 --> 01:15:19,519
people imagine you bought like a million

1797
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:21,679
doll hat and you walked outside and a

1798
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:24,280
bird [ __ ] on it your natural reaction is

1799
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:25,920
to freak out and panic but you consume

1800
01:15:24,279 --> 01:15:27,439
mushrooms you buy a million dollar hat

1801
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,560
and walk outside and you go why would I

1802
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:31,158
spend a million dollars on a hat it

1803
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,960
literally changes your perspective and

1804
01:15:31,158 --> 01:15:36,439
it buffers D rage and it gives you a

1805
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:38,520
second to process that perspective is so

1806
01:15:36,439 --> 01:15:40,359
important because first my heart broke

1807
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:42,960
when Belle said I wish I hadn't been

1808
01:15:40,359 --> 01:15:45,880
shamed for my cannabis use and then I

1809
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:49,119
thought on the flip side of that he

1810
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:53,359
that's terrible shame on them

1811
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:57,599
but it's not the shame that brings us

1812
01:15:53,359 --> 01:16:00,519
down it's how we react to it it's our

1813
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:03,280
perspective that can either destroy us

1814
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:05,360
or it can build us and so for any people

1815
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:07,279
out there that are feeling shame in

1816
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:10,319
regards to their cannabis use or really

1817
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:13,840
anything just realize that you don't

1818
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:16,840
have to let it set in you know the way

1819
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:19,840
it can and does sometimes depending on

1820
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:22,600
your perspective and how you look at it

1821
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:24,360
you don't have to let it in quite as you

1822
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:26,199
know there's a Simpsons that was done

1823
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:29,479
recently

1824
01:16:26,198 --> 01:16:31,678
uh it was Marge and Lisa and Marge says

1825
01:16:29,479 --> 01:16:34,319
something to Lisa and she she means it

1826
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,119
with love but it's really like terrible

1827
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:39,238
I can't remember what it was but the

1828
01:16:36,119 --> 01:16:42,439
word in big thick font goes into whis uh

1829
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:45,759
Lisa's ear and it just like settles into

1830
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:48,119
her being and it's such a heavy episode

1831
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,440
of this mom daughter energy of the mom

1832
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:53,119
you know unwittingly destroying the

1833
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:55,599
daughter with these with these words not

1834
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,238
realizing that that that she's taking

1835
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,639
them the way she is when we're kids it's

1836
01:16:57,238 --> 01:17:01,839
hard we just take it the way we take it

1837
01:16:59,639 --> 01:17:04,239
and that becomes our trauma but as

1838
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,880
adults you can take it differently and

1839
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:07,718
that is really truly a a martial arts of

1840
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,400
its

1841
01:17:07,719 --> 01:17:13,719
own I can see how people would you know

1842
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:15,799
it's a it's a it's a fear of like will

1843
01:17:13,719 --> 01:17:17,480
they have self-control because I I do

1844
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,239
have friends that you know they they

1845
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:22,039
don't do anything man they play video

1846
01:17:19,238 --> 01:17:23,359
games all day and just smoke all day and

1847
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:25,679
and I mean that that brings them peace

1848
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:27,679
and happiness then by all means do you

1849
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:29,319
but like something tells me their

1850
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:32,079
trajectory isn't the most healthy

1851
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:34,759
trajectory sometimes and I can see how

1852
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:37,198
like a parent would fear they don't want

1853
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:38,760
their kids to they definitely want us to

1854
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:41,079
practice self-control but there's this

1855
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:42,920
stigma of like you know not letting

1856
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:45,439
teenagers smoke but I kind of really

1857
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:47,319
wish because like I really wish like

1858
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:49,519
they weren't so hard on teen we you know

1859
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:51,238
we weren't so hard on teenagers being

1860
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:54,159
able to access cannabis because if I

1861
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:57,079
were to Able if I were to to have that

1862
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:59,279
access as a teenager I I'm pretty sure I

1863
01:17:57,079 --> 01:18:00,920
probably would have done a lot better

1864
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:03,279
because there is something when I just

1865
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:05,239
started smoking weed like my mathematics

1866
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:07,319
you know my my writing skills like

1867
01:18:05,238 --> 01:18:08,399
everything just skyrocketed like

1868
01:18:07,319 --> 01:18:12,158
everything just

1869
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:14,238
clicked um but um not I mean it's not

1870
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:16,839
that it was hard for me necessarily but

1871
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:20,198
it's just like I feel like it would have

1872
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:22,199
just helped me a lot and I know coming

1873
01:18:20,198 --> 01:18:24,198
from a dad with a teenager I feel like

1874
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:26,000
if they start too too young you know

1875
01:18:24,198 --> 01:18:29,079
it'll [ __ ] them up in school they their

1876
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:32,000
their focus is isn't where it should be

1877
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:34,198
yeah you know but I don't know I try to

1878
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,840
find that balance still right now so

1879
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:37,319
yeah so I think that's the art right of

1880
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,760
finding that balance because that's very

1881
01:18:37,319 --> 01:18:40,920
interesting you know and a lot of the

1882
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:42,719
parents here and and and here in the

1883
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:44,239
Emerald Triangle do the same thing I had

1884
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,960
a friend you know we were driving her

1885
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:49,119
kid to school he took a huge bong rip

1886
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,960
put his bong back in his that cushion

1887
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:52,439
bong bag and got out you know while he

1888
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,039
was still blowing out the smoke I'm like

1889
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:58,000
dude you are the luckiest [ __ ] kid in

1890
01:18:55,039 --> 01:19:00,719
the world you just like rip mad bog rip

1891
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,639
and then put your bong back in but you

1892
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,560
know but this kid has

1893
01:19:02,639 --> 01:19:06,440
self-control I mean this kid now he

1894
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:09,560
built a cabin he built his own cabin

1895
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:11,559
he's a contractor you go it it's like

1896
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:13,360
how you finding that my kid's doing

1897
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:18,320
right now too he's

1898
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:20,359
gone contract own home you know not he

1899
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:23,319
just needed a little

1900
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:26,960
extra there's a lot of difference in in

1901
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:30,439
kids too I mean I mean some of them

1902
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:34,639
cannabis can be such a reward to them

1903
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:38,279
that it's hard for them to want to seek

1904
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:42,000
other things to find reward uh like hard

1905
01:19:38,279 --> 01:19:45,920
work or uh doing math or doing physical

1906
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:50,079
exercise whatever it is and uh the

1907
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,079
trouble is cannabis is just do

1908
01:19:50,359 --> 01:19:57,559
good I like it I think my favorite thing

1909
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:59,800
you know uh me and my business do a ton

1910
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:02,600
of work with athletes we're trying to

1911
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:04,400
tell athletes like it's not cannabis

1912
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:06,320
it's your system that cannabis is

1913
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:08,638
helping you balance right you're

1914
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:11,079
consuming so that you can help balance

1915
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:13,719
your own system that's essentially

1916
01:20:11,079 --> 01:20:15,158
disregulated or dysfunctional uh as

1917
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:17,560
veterans I always have to tell people

1918
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:19,839
nobody wakes up and like I want to throw

1919
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:22,360
my life away or do a bad drug but people

1920
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:24,000
do wake up looking for relief in

1921
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:25,238
different kinds of ways and I think if

1922
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,439
we acknowledge

1923
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:30,198
children also feel trauma and they do

1924
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:32,000
feel relief if you don't educate them on

1925
01:20:30,198 --> 01:20:34,039
right the right Pathways that's how you

1926
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,238
end up consuming something that's may be

1927
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:37,560
more dangerous so to your point I think

1928
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:39,718
there is balance because if there's a

1929
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:42,080
kid at your school that has epilepsy and

1930
01:20:39,719 --> 01:20:44,560
you know he's got a you know a medical

1931
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:46,238
permit to consume cannabis you can't be

1932
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:48,560
the parent that just says cannabis is

1933
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:50,879
bad there's different forms and ways and

1934
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:53,320
reasons that people consume it that's

1935
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,920
why education is so important because

1936
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:56,920
the kids know about it like they listen

1937
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:59,560
to the music they know all this stuff

1938
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:03,600
but to your point balance for all of us

1939
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:05,120
at a 1.8 GPA coming out of high school I

1940
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,239
started consuming cannabis after the

1941
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:10,000
Marines and I got ivy league offers to

1942
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:12,319
do a PhD and I couldn't the stress

1943
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,800
levels I had growing up on the south

1944
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:17,158
side of Chicago I couldn't focused on

1945
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,600
school once I started consuming cannabis

1946
01:21:17,158 --> 01:21:21,519
as an adult like Laura said School

1947
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,880
became like a video game almost it's

1948
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:26,360
just like if I focus on it I bet you I

1949
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:29,520
can do it just give me some

1950
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:31,799
time God I stunk like weed all the way

1951
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:34,440
through High School it was just like

1952
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:36,880
total potentiator of my stereotype

1953
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:40,279
selling weed to everyone every it

1954
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:42,639
allowed me to meet every group right

1955
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:44,559
like there was guys who were like metal

1956
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:45,760
heads that smoked weed well I was

1957
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,639
friends with those guys there were like

1958
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:49,920
Sporto guys that played like football or

1959
01:21:47,639 --> 01:21:52,159
basketball or hockey I I could sell weed

1960
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:55,480
to those guys you know there was there

1961
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:57,119
was just every group in the school but

1962
01:21:55,479 --> 01:21:59,559
they all had something in common they

1963
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:02,079
all had weed smokers in each of each of

1964
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:05,960
their groups which uh kind of gave a

1965
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:07,319
nice in to that group and I just uh my

1966
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:09,679
goodness that I potentiate that

1967
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:12,880
stereotype driving an orange Volkswagen

1968
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:14,800
van 74 West faila I park it in the

1969
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,920
teachers parking lot because it was

1970
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:19,560
right where the kids all came out of

1971
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:21,760
this long concrete pathway and I would

1972
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:25,120
sit in the back with my little 90°

1973
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:27,280
window open and I would uh I had a stove

1974
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:30,880
with like blades on the stove and I

1975
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:32,519
would sell hash hits for like I can't

1976
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:35,960
remember if it was two for five or

1977
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:38,320

1978
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:43,480

1979
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:46,559
lot oh yeah yeah Heat score super Heat

1980
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:48,238

1981
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,560
taking anything with them do you know

1982
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:53,039
what I mean like when they walked away

1983
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:57,520
from the van they just

1984
01:22:53,039 --> 01:23:00,000
exhaled hot hot knives too o glowies

1985

right well not quite glowies I always

1986
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,560
like to let it not glow but I bet you it

1987
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:09,639
was still like 850 to 900

1988
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:12,639
Degrees oh God I'm sorry to all of you

1989
01:23:09,639 --> 01:23:15,960
who we paid for that actually oh my

1990
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:15,960
goodness this is

1991
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:20,759
insane

1992
01:23:18,679 --> 01:23:23,480
Bonkers

1993
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:26,480
Bonkers yes Stephen I wanted to comment

1994
01:23:23,479 --> 01:23:30,279
on um you know you must have a lot of

1995
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:32,559
experience of athletes having you know

1996
01:23:30,279 --> 01:23:35,319
athletes and the the Cannabis World kind

1997
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:37,880
of coming together I know that we were

1998
01:23:35,319 --> 01:23:40,279
talking about how it's like we expect

1999
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:44,400
our music artists

2000
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:45,840
to to it's okay like they get a pass for

2001
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,158
being all high because it makes good

2002
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:50,079
music but it's not okay for an athlete

2003
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:51,920
who's in a lot of pain to use cannabis

2004
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:54,439
no no no you'll get kicked out of the

2005
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:57,960
UFC or no no no you know you'll get k

2006
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:59,759
kicked off of the football team um so I

2007
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:02,439
found that like you know I hope that can

2008
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:04,600
change for for our society I'm just

2009
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:06,399
curious to see like what you know the

2010
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:08,800
athletes that you are curious to hear

2011
01:24:06,399 --> 01:24:12,559
like the athletes that you work with and

2012
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:15,000
like how they go about um advocating for

2013
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:17,480
cannabis usage for other

2014
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,880
athletes yeah I mean my consulting

2015
01:24:17,479 --> 01:24:21,759
company as is Consulting we do a bunch

2016
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:23,960
of work with Ricky Williams and other

2017
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:26,800
pro athletes people kind of know those

2018
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:28,198
stories but now we're trying to get like

2019
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,360
deeper into those stories where we

2020
01:24:28,198 --> 01:24:33,319
realize

2021
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:35,639
where it's it's 75% of some of these pro

2022
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:37,960
sports leagues I heard somebody recently

2023
01:24:35,639 --> 01:24:40,359
say in the NBA they have a second bus on

2024
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:42,560
the team drives for all the guys who

2025
01:24:40,359 --> 01:24:45,319
smoke weed because that's how many

2026
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:47,639
people on one team actually consume

2027
01:24:45,319 --> 01:24:49,679
cannabis and most people's eyebrows

2028
01:24:47,639 --> 01:24:52,199
would raise until you've had the

2029
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:53,920
experience of pain relief from Cannabis

2030
01:24:52,198 --> 01:24:56,359
until you've had the experience of I

2031
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:58,679
wasn't sleeping well cannabis help me

2032
01:24:56,359 --> 01:25:00,279
sleep then it makes sense why these

2033
01:24:58,679 --> 01:25:02,679
people who are on the road their whole

2034
01:25:00,279 --> 01:25:06,000
lives the most athletic people we've

2035
01:25:02,679 --> 01:25:08,639
ever seen whose bodies are breaking down

2036
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:11,880
right they they have a a very low range

2037
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:13,800
of how they uh we say your best asset is

2038
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:16,840
your availability if you're hurt and not

2039
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:18,880
available your assets drop exponentially

2040
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:21,639
so cannabis keeps most of them going

2041
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:24,079
secretly and it has for decades and

2042
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:26,199
decades and decades they've been friends

2043
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:28,000
like bubble man said they've been

2044
01:25:26,198 --> 01:25:29,799
friends with the same people who are

2045
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,359
artists they've been friends with the

2046
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,880
people who sell in college I know a lot

2047
01:25:32,359 --> 01:25:35,479
of people who sold weed said their best

2048
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:37,440
clients were

2049
01:25:35,479 --> 01:25:39,118
athletes so it's just like this is

2050
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:41,519
something that's always been known if we

2051
01:25:39,118 --> 01:25:43,960
can stop like hiding when I hear guys in

2052
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:46,159
the NFL say 85% of their team smokes

2053
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:48,520
lead I'm like at this point we might as

2054
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:49,839
well actually talk about it so yeah I

2055
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,400
mean it is something that they are

2056
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,520
advocating for but you have to realize

2057
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:55,960
there's organizational structures that

2058
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,280
those millions and millions of dollars

2059
01:25:55,960 --> 01:26:00,118
you make like Ricky Williams was such a

2060
01:25:58,279 --> 01:26:02,599
Visionary because he did walk away at

2061
01:26:00,118 --> 01:26:04,279
the top of the game unreal leaving

2062
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:06,960
Millions behind but that's what makes

2063
01:26:04,279 --> 01:26:09,880
him a Visionary to this day dude Ricky

2064
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:12,359
is unbelievable man that is the talk

2065
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:15,840
about putting your uh your money where

2066
01:26:12,359 --> 01:26:17,279
your mouth is holy [ __ ] yeah I I gave up

2067
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,440
on the money I'm like why'd you do that

2068
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:21,840
he's like so I could H so I could have

2069
01:26:19,439 --> 01:26:23,719
weed I'm like damn dude that is like one

2070
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:27,360
of the most powerful statements he told

2071
01:26:23,719 --> 01:26:29,560
me that in Barcelona many many years ago

2072
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:31,079

2073
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:33,159
him at all I don't know football

2074
01:26:31,079 --> 01:26:35,519
actually Tony V was next to me and he

2075
01:26:33,158 --> 01:26:37,638
was all star star struck because he was

2076
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,920
big football fan I had no idea who the

2077
01:26:37,639 --> 01:26:42,639
dude was but I was like that dude was

2078
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:45,279
prolific what he said I got the best

2079
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:47,760
Ricky Williams story so this is back

2080
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:50,439
when he was still playing for Miami I'm

2081
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:53,280

2083
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:58,399
up the stairs and he is

2084
01:26:56,039 --> 01:27:00,319
hyperventilating his name's Dr Tom he's

2085
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:04,238
actually a doctor now and he is just

2086
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:06,960
hyper ventilating because as you can see

2087
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:10,198
I've been a New Orleans Saint fan all my

2088
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:13,560
life I'm from New Orleans right

2089
01:27:10,198 --> 01:27:18,319
so I followed Ricky's whole path from

2090
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:21,239
when he was drafted so my guy is is is

2091
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:21,238
can't he can't breathe he's

2092
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:27,920
like I just can't make get out and and

2093
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:31,520
eventually he says Ricky Williams

2094
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:33,800
downstairs and I'm like [ __ ] and

2095
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,199
he's like no look outside and I go and I

2096
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:39,440
look outside because we're in a second

2097
01:27:35,198 --> 01:27:40,399
story window and I see a orange flaked

2098
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:44,238
Hummer

2099
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:46,920
one with you know Florida plates I'm

2100
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:52,399
like oh [ __ ] he's

2101
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:55,480
here so I casually go downstairs and I

2102
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:59,359
see him and he's registering

2103
01:27:55,479 --> 01:28:01,158
and I'm like all right this is cool

2104
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:03,880
Ricky Williams he's actually still

2105
01:28:01,158 --> 01:28:07,198
playing in the NFL at this time so and

2106
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:08,960
he's here so I'm like okay I go around I

2107
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:10,559
this is back when we had before we got

2108
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,198
evicted from the federal government so

2109
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,199
we had on-site

2110
01:28:12,198 --> 01:28:17,839
consumption and not only did we have

2111
01:28:14,198 --> 01:28:19,919
on-site consumption we had comedy and

2112
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:23,639
various other Live Events so we had a

2113
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:28,600
female comedian randomly that particular

2114
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:31,239
day it was was a Friday and Ricky he

2115
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:34,600
registers and he comes in and he sits

2116
01:28:31,238 --> 01:28:36,599
down in the table next to me and so I'm

2117
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:38,440
just kind of casually just smoking a

2118
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:40,400
joint that I had rolled and I had gotten

2119
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:42,719
some weed and I was actually rolling a

2120
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:46,479
joint because I was going to ask him to

2121
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:48,920
smoke a joint which he did but as I was

2122
01:28:46,479 --> 01:28:53,319
doing it casually and watching him this

2123
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:56,560
comedian on stage is like so has anybody

2124
01:28:53,319 --> 01:29:00,359
ever been to Texas and nobody raises

2125
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:03,719
their hand and so he kind of raises his

2126
01:29:00,359 --> 01:29:05,839
hand and she's like all right has

2127
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:09,399
anybody ever been to the University of

2128
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:12,279
Texas and of course that's where I went

2129
01:29:09,399 --> 01:29:14,638
to school so he raises his hand and she

2130
01:29:12,279 --> 01:29:18,000
goes well who the hell are you Ricky

2131
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:20,600
Williams and he goes yes ma'am and then

2132
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:24,158
the entire room just stopped and turned

2133
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:25,880
around and were like oh [ __ ] cuz he had

2134
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:28,079
just shaved his head he was very clean

2135
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:30,920
shaven but he still had the beard so you

2136
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:36,600
could recognize who he was and the

2137
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:38,679
comedian just like oh [ __ ] uh well

2138
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:41,800
welcome Ricky and of course nobody's

2139
01:29:38,679 --> 01:29:43,920
facing her at all they're all just

2140
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:45,119
like and that's when I took the moment

2141
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,279
and I kind of went over to him I like

2142
01:29:45,118 --> 01:29:49,039
hey Ricky I know you I sorted my tattoo

2143
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:50,399

2144
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:51,880
life can I smoke a joint with you and

2145
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:54,799
just shoot the [ __ ] this is my

2146
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:58,400
establishment he's like oh yeah sure

2147
01:29:54,800 --> 01:30:00,079
and he was the most downto Earth uh

2148
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:02,399
recognized guy called my friend Jeff

2149
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:03,359
Jones He rushed over with a vaporizer to

2150
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:05,000
give him because he's like he should

2151
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:06,960
have a healthier version and he gave him

2152
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,760
a volcano vaporizer and we sent him on

2153
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:12,319
his way so that was you know that was my

2154
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:14,719
my my Ricky Williams story which was

2155
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:16,759
absolutely hilarious just because I felt

2156
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:18,520
bad for the poor comedian you know she's

2157
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:20,440
just trying to do her thing and she's

2158
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:22,639
got a joke and she unfortunately never

2159
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:25,279
was able to recover from it but it was

2160
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:27,159
just one of those epic moments so ask uh

2161
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:28,479
Stephen if you see him next time ask if

2162
01:30:27,158 --> 01:30:31,198
he remembers

2163
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:34,000
that yeah I'm ask him yeah Rick is very

2164
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:37,319
down to earth he's always made itself

2165
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,359
very accessible to the community um I

2166
01:30:37,319 --> 01:30:41,359
think I actually met Rick on a ganji air

2167
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:44,679
call where we were I was there as a

2168
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:47,000
triome Institute like um person he was

2169
01:30:44,679 --> 01:30:48,199
there as a ganier person and we were

2170
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,399
there with a bunch of people just

2171
01:30:48,198 --> 01:30:52,879
talking about the quality of product and

2172
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:54,879
he was explaining how athletes are some

2173
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,239
of the best people as an audience to

2174
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,639
explain quality to you could tell the

2175
01:30:57,238 --> 01:31:00,000
whole country right now about the

2176
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,359
difference between craft and

2177
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,560
mass-produced cannabis they might not

2178
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:06,679
care you tell a athlete the difference

2179
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:09,039
between something like supplements or

2180
01:31:06,679 --> 01:31:10,520
Gatorade or you tell them anything they

2181
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:12,560
put in their body and you tell them hey

2182
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:14,960
this is premium and this is unlet it

2183
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:18,039
they're like oh I only want the premium

2184
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:19,719
right so Rick has been a huge person

2185
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:21,118
like to just talk about those different

2186
01:31:19,719 --> 01:31:24,719
things and the difference in product

2187
01:31:21,118 --> 01:31:27,920
quality and the athletes listen

2188
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:31,118
think think of if these companies

2189
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:33,399
actually figured it out all the NBA all

2190
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:35,238
the NFL right these massive

2191
01:31:33,399 --> 01:31:37,839
multi-billion dollar

2192
01:31:35,238 --> 01:31:40,039
teams this would be like the dream job

2193
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:42,560
too you get set up oh what what are you

2194
01:31:40,039 --> 01:31:44,719
doing it's like oh I'm the grower for

2195
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:46,800
the Kansas City Chiefs I grow all the

2196
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:48,800
flow that all of those players use and

2197
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,560
I'm the extract maker I make the hash

2198
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,560
for and they have a state-of-the-art

2199
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,960
facility it's all living soil it's all

2200
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,800
like there's a agronomists there's all

2201
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,239
these scientists that work and collect

2202
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:02,679
data we're like developing cultivars for

2203
01:31:59,238 --> 01:32:05,839
specific athletes like that [ __ ] who has

2204
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:07,840
money to burn like those companies could

2205
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:10,719
you imagine the grows and the hash

2206
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:15,159
making facilities that would exist in an

2207
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:16,960
NBA or a or or an NFL football team

2208
01:32:15,158 --> 01:32:18,879
pretty well that team would that team

2209
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,118
would Chief down wouldn't they they

2210
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,199
would they would that's why I picked the

2211
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:24,880
Chiefs man come on think that was a no

2212
01:32:22,198 --> 01:32:28,479
pun intended sort of thing or can can we

2213
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:30,679
change them to the kefs we can CH to say

2214
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:33,399
what you were saying about the athletes

2215
01:32:30,679 --> 01:32:36,480
anduh back when I worked at the Galaxy

2216
01:32:33,399 --> 01:32:39,319
gallery the head shop in the the 90s in

2217
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:44,039
um in Los Angeles the Portland

2218
01:32:39,319 --> 01:32:47,439
Trailblazers came in bought a rack of

2219
01:32:44,039 --> 01:32:49,800
bongs and pipes all the down stems all

2220
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:52,158
the rubber pieces cleaning

2221
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:54,760
equipment and the team equipment guy is

2222
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:57,920
the guy who came in and picked it all up

2223
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:59,600
and it actually traveled with the actual

2224
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,880
basketball and all of their training

2225
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:04,560
equipment so it's been part I mean trust

2226
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,239
me we were all we were all like yeah you

2227
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:09,039
never saw us here you know sort of [ __ ]

2228
01:33:06,238 --> 01:33:11,839
and this is way back in like I said 90

2229
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:15,439
you know 97 98 so that was really

2230
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:19,319
mindblowing to me to see how not only

2231
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:22,559
integrated it was within the system this

2232
01:33:19,319 --> 01:33:24,439
system adapted modified itself illegally

2233
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,159
cuz I know the commissioner and all them

2234
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:31,079
were like we never saw this sort of [ __ ]

2235
01:33:27,158 --> 01:33:34,599
but it still went on so how does I mean

2236
01:33:31,079 --> 01:33:37,639
the NBA is relaxed his policies right

2237
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:40,280
and the the NFL is in the midst of going

2238
01:33:37,639 --> 01:33:42,440
through that what's taking the NFL so

2239
01:33:40,279 --> 01:33:45,519
long because the NBA and the others have

2240
01:33:42,439 --> 01:33:48,079
seen the Direct effects cannabis has had

2241
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:50,440
positively on their athletes especially

2242
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:52,118
because of the you know the more games

2243
01:33:50,439 --> 01:33:53,960
and rushing them the Thursday night

2244
01:33:52,118 --> 01:33:57,000
games and things like that that are you

2245
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:59,560
know really forcing quick recovery that

2246
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,319
was unheard of back in you know the 80s

2247
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:06,600
and 90s but now they're forced to live

2248
01:34:02,319 --> 01:34:08,639
how do they negotiate that reality

2249
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:11,079
versus you know that corporate reality

2250
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:15,000
versus taking care of their

2251
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:16,679
bodies well they see them as assets

2252
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,880
right your team is good if your best

2253
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:20,560
players available if your players's

2254
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,199
constantly getting hurt every year and

2255
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,360
you're like we fired everybody we

2256
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:26,079
changed players what's something if

2257
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:28,238
there was this one tool that could keep

2258
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:30,439
our players healthy so that we can make

2259
01:34:28,238 --> 01:34:31,759
a bunch of money off of our players if

2260
01:34:30,439 --> 01:34:34,079
there was something that could with

2261
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:36,000
concussions and pain and it's just like

2262
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:37,479
they've been secretly trying to tell you

2263
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,760
that they already found something that

2264
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:42,439
works for them but your policy is why so

2265
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:45,719
many of them either secretly use it or

2266
01:34:42,439 --> 01:34:48,198
avoid it they they just want to deny CTE

2267
01:34:45,719 --> 01:34:50,118
even exist so this is the mentality like

2268
01:34:48,198 --> 01:34:52,439
when etan was wondering I wonder why the

2269
01:34:50,118 --> 01:34:54,198
NFL hasn't figured this out it's like I

2270
01:34:52,439 --> 01:34:56,839
think it has to do with their close

2271
01:34:54,198 --> 01:35:01,000
intimate relationship with

2272
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:03,360
Satan like I think I think the Mark I

2273
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,479
think there could be I I totally agree

2274
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:08,920
with you and like three or four years

2275
01:35:05,479 --> 01:35:10,439
ago when the NFL first mentioned that

2276
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:14,920
they were going to spend a billion

2277
01:35:10,439 --> 01:35:18,399
dollars in research on medical issues

2278
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:21,520
that impact football players their first

2279
01:35:18,399 --> 01:35:24,319
emphasis was not on CTE at all and that

2280
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:27,639
was right after the move movie

2281
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:29,759
concussion came out right where if

2282
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:32,079
you're a football player or if you

2283
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:34,639
played football or you're a fan football

2284
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:37,000
fan watch the movie concussion one with

2285
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:39,199
Will Smith yeah that's slapping the face

2286
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,238
Will Smith I think he's a douche for

2287
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:43,039
that but anyway make a long story short

2288
01:35:41,238 --> 01:35:44,678
it's a really good movie and I don't

2289
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:46,760
believe you'll ever watch a football

2290
01:35:44,679 --> 01:35:49,520
game in the same way again after

2291
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:51,920
watching that movie but if you look at

2292
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:55,360
the way the NFL spent their dollars so

2293
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:58,319
their first projects that they funded in

2294
01:35:55,359 --> 01:36:01,599
Academia to look at health related

2295
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:05,479
issues had nothing to do with CTE it had

2296
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:08,400
to do strictly with pain how do we deal

2297
01:36:05,479 --> 01:36:10,959
with pain so we can shoot the players

2298
01:36:08,399 --> 01:36:13,198
with something on the sideline and send

2299
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:16,039
those multi-million dollar people back

2300
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:18,719
out onto the field to generate billions

2301
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:21,479
of dollars for these corporates that are

2302
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:23,920
basically got their fingers in the pie

2303
01:36:21,479 --> 01:36:26,479
and that's the key just like de throat

2304
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:28,800
said follow the money the reason why

2305
01:36:26,479 --> 01:36:31,319
this hasn't been brought to the

2306
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:33,679
Forefront is because the right amount of

2307
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:36,198
Ben Franklin have not exchanged hands

2308
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:38,840
it's all having to do with money because

2309
01:36:36,198 --> 01:36:42,039
now if you look at their portfolio and I

2310
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:44,480
think ATN I think you had mentioned this

2311
01:36:42,039 --> 01:36:46,840
previously on an episode of hash church

2312
01:36:44,479 --> 01:36:51,399
and I think did we have the Canadian

2313
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:54,400
researcher on I I've met her but I know

2314
01:36:51,399 --> 01:36:56,679
her name is Liz Liz Liz Thompson right I

2315
01:36:54,399 --> 01:37:00,158
know they're now shifting their

2316
01:36:56,679 --> 01:37:03,118
portfolio to focus on CTE so I think

2317
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:06,359
they're recognizing that yes the human

2318
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:09,198
brain inside the skull inside a football

2319
01:37:06,359 --> 01:37:11,920
helmet was never meant to handle this

2320
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:14,439
level of trauma and if you play football

2321
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:16,359
from your Pee-Wee years completely

2322
01:37:14,439 --> 01:37:19,599
through High School completely through

2323
01:37:16,359 --> 01:37:22,639
college complet you've experienced a

2324
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:24,920
lifetime of brain trauma it's amazing

2325
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:27,079
it's not more prevailance stepen right

2326
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:29,480
if you think about it and the other

2327
01:37:27,079 --> 01:37:32,519
thing I guess is that think about the

2328
01:37:29,479 --> 01:37:34,399
football NFL's business model when those

2329
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:35,960
players are being paid millions of

2330
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:38,559
dollars and they're on that field

2331
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:41,800
they're generating advertising revenues

2332
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,719
for all of the sponsors and all the when

2333
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:45,800
they're

2334
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:47,760
retired the NFL could give a [ __ ] about

2335
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:50,239
them right and those are the people who

2336
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:52,960
come down with CTE after they leave the

2337
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:54,799
game and there's certainly players who

2338
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:57,039
leave the game either on their own

2339
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,679
accord like Ricky and other people but

2340
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:01,880
there's also people who end up leaving

2341
01:37:58,679 --> 01:38:04,480
the game not realizing they have CTE and

2342
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:07,199
then later on end up killing themselves

2343
01:38:04,479 --> 01:38:09,839
like Junior seal who shot himself in the

2344
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:12,759
gut knowing that they can study his

2345
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:15,920
brain right and so the whole notion is

2346
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:16,840
is that yes we need to come up with ways

2347
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:19,760
of

2348
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:23,599
intervening the thing that leads to

2349
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:26,199
Chronic conditions like CTE in players

2350
01:38:23,599 --> 01:38:27,840
after they retire from the game after

2351
01:38:26,198 --> 01:38:29,559
they retire from the game they're no

2352
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:32,199
longer generating revenue for the

2353
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:34,760
sponsors so guess what just shoot some

2354
01:38:32,198 --> 01:38:37,559
drones full of pain medicine send them

2355
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:40,039
back out onto the field get Revenue you

2356
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:41,719
know from advertising dollars up it's

2357
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:44,560
all having to do with money

2358
01:38:41,719 --> 01:38:47,039
unfortunately but I think again I I'll

2359
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:50,480
just say this is that it looks like the

2360
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:52,800
NFL has recognized that CTE is an issue

2361
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:54,799
because now they're funding research not

2362
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:58,199
just on pay pain but they're funding

2363
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:00,320
research on concussion and we all know

2364
01:38:58,198 --> 01:39:03,799
from and and at and we've talked about

2365
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:05,840
this before that that that um canabo

2366
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:08,320
reduce

2367
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:12,639
neuroinflammation and in the golden hour

2368
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:15,479
of trauma which is right after um a

2369
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:18,159
concussion occurs they need a shot of

2370
01:39:15,479 --> 01:39:20,158
canabo into their brains to reduce

2371
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:22,439
neuroinflammation because often what

2372
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:25,039
happens is that it's the it's the

2373
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:27,158
neuroinflammation and the fact that the

2374
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:29,760
cranium basically keeps the brain in

2375
01:39:27,158 --> 01:39:31,759
place there's no place for it to expand

2376
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:34,679
you often get hemorrhaging and you often

2377
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,280
have incidents that happen later on you

2378
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:39,039
know the other thing that I would just

2379
01:39:36,279 --> 01:39:40,840
say is that it's not just smoking

2380
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:44,000
cannabis I mean there could be other

2381
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:46,279
ways that they can use the endoc canabo

2382
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:49,118
system and there's so much research

2383
01:39:46,279 --> 01:39:50,800
that's being done on how to deliver

2384
01:39:49,118 --> 01:39:54,039
compounds across the bloodb brain

2385
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:56,960
barrier how to use not just

2386
01:39:54,039 --> 01:39:59,319
phyto canabo but the other synthetic

2387
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:01,920
canabo like the wind compound and the

2388
01:39:59,319 --> 01:40:04,479
other endoc canabo and things that act

2389
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:07,279
on the endoc canono system to try to

2390
01:40:04,479 --> 01:40:10,198
figure this all out I'm not saying that

2391
01:40:07,279 --> 01:40:12,840
that CTE and concussion can be treated

2392
01:40:10,198 --> 01:40:14,719
with cannabinoids but right now we don't

2393
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:16,239
really know because the plants been

2394
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:18,560
demonized there hasn't been a whole lot

2395
01:40:16,238 --> 01:40:20,718
of research but now there's a lot of

2396
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,880
things to believe that if we could

2397
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:26,319
administer canabo right after after so

2398
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:29,960
on the sideline these guys should be

2399
01:40:26,319 --> 01:40:32,079
getting nasal spray of cannabinoids goes

2400
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:33,760
right into the brain because that's the

2401
01:40:32,079 --> 01:40:36,279
quickest way into the brain is through

2402
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:38,159
the nose not smoking not vaping not

2403
01:40:36,279 --> 01:40:39,960
taking a pill this isn't something that

2404
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:42,719
a magic pill this is something that a

2405
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:46,079
transnasal formulation right into the

2406
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:48,439
brain can basically help reduce

2407
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:51,599
neuroinflammation and at and this could

2408
01:40:48,439 --> 01:40:56,039
be used in the theater to treat head

2409
01:40:51,599 --> 01:40:58,440
injury right in milary are yeah yeah

2410
01:40:56,039 --> 01:41:00,840
yeah I mean so so there's there's so

2411
01:40:58,439 --> 01:41:03,598
many different things that they ought to

2412
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:05,800
do that would actually be kind of like

2413
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:08,480
the way everyone's like well why did we

2414
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:10,480
pay NASA to put people on the moon it

2415
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:15,079
was all the technology that was

2416
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:17,678
developed around the moon landing that

2417
01:41:15,079 --> 01:41:20,399
that benefited Society well this is

2418
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:24,319
something that all the technology they

2419
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:26,879
lost yeah NFL should pay for because

2420
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:29,158
it's directly affecting the people who

2421
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:31,639
are generating the money every Sunday

2422
01:41:29,158 --> 01:41:34,319
when people tune in and watch NFL

2423
01:41:31,639 --> 01:41:35,840
football games there's probably a fair

2424
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:37,399
number of those people who are playing

2425
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:40,480
in that game who are going to suffer

2426
01:41:37,399 --> 01:41:42,279
from CTE later on in life and I think

2427
01:41:40,479 --> 01:41:44,079
that you know cannabinoids could be part

2428
01:41:42,279 --> 01:41:46,599
of the

2429
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:48,359
solution Stephen I actually reached out

2430
01:41:46,599 --> 01:41:49,800
I actually reached out to you by text

2431
01:41:48,359 --> 01:41:52,158
that's exactly what I want to talk to

2432
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:54,440
you about so let's reconnect after this

2433
01:41:52,158 --> 01:41:57,559
episode if we could

2434
01:41:54,439 --> 01:41:58,960
yeah the the uh realities of um I'm

2435
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:01,039
actually trying to bridge the state

2436
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:03,198
department trying to actually get that

2437
01:42:01,039 --> 01:42:05,319
uh name of that nasal medication that is

2438
01:42:03,198 --> 01:42:08,039
in the military packs currently in

2439
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:09,920
Germany and Israel that is exactly what

2440
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:12,719
it is as long as you can hit them within

2441
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:15,560
that golden hour Dr mulam found this

2442
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:18,599
back in the 60s that if you were well he

2443
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:21,360
said they smoked a joint within you know

2444
01:42:18,599 --> 01:42:25,319
that golden hour it can stop the you

2445
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:29,079
know that brain SW from happening and so

2446
01:42:25,319 --> 01:42:31,439
I'm rather surprised even that the NFL

2447
01:42:29,079 --> 01:42:33,920
wouldn't be interested in something that

2448
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:36,238
could you know help prolong and

2449
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:37,920
especially the teams right I saw you

2450
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:40,399
know they're trying every type of

2451
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:42,480
recovery method I saw they had no hand

2452
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:45,000
coolers that go over the wrists you know

2453
01:42:42,479 --> 01:42:47,919
to cool down the athletes it's rather

2454
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:52,399
surprising they won't look at protecting

2455
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:54,399
them that they know how serious CT is I

2456
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:56,759
I find it hard that you know the money

2457
01:42:54,399 --> 01:43:00,319
there's got to be some sort of weird

2458
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:02,719
Twisted effort to keep it from you know

2459
01:43:00,319 --> 01:43:04,679
I don't understand it's it's just it's

2460
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:07,439
just marketing dollars I wish there was

2461
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:09,440
like some Dr Evil on the moon like

2462
01:43:07,439 --> 01:43:12,279
rubbing his little grubby hands together

2463
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:14,359
it really is marketing dollars the NFL

2464
01:43:12,279 --> 01:43:16,039
only makes money if we watch the teams

2465
01:43:14,359 --> 01:43:17,880
that make the most money sell the most

2466
01:43:16,039 --> 01:43:19,840
tickets right this is all about

2467
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:22,118
attention so right if you can if they

2468
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,079
can get your viewing dollars then they

2469
01:43:22,118 --> 01:43:26,679
also can slip in and advertisement they

2470
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:28,679
can say hey we have the most viewers

2471
01:43:26,679 --> 01:43:31,199
anheiser Bush gets an advertising spot

2472
01:43:28,679 --> 01:43:33,440
anheiser P they pay a Tony money for it

2473
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:35,559
if anheiser Bush is their lead marketer

2474
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:37,799
they're not going to do something that's

2475
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:39,560
directly competitive that they know

2476
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:42,159
anheiser bush is probably on the back

2477
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:44,119
end trying to find its way into cannabis

2478
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:46,399
right so it's like when you get behind

2479
01:43:44,118 --> 01:43:48,719
closed doors this is when you find out

2480
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:51,238
like GTI just signed a deal with bar

2481
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:54,279
stool Sports when you find out cookies

2482
01:43:51,238 --> 01:43:57,279
signed a deal with USC called a CBD and

2483
01:43:54,279 --> 01:43:59,840
wellness deal the marketing dollars are

2484
01:43:57,279 --> 01:44:01,719
actually finally meeting cannabis the

2485
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,760
issue is there's no education or

2486
01:44:01,719 --> 01:44:05,840
guidance into it they're going for the

2487
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,639
biggest players in the industry the

2488
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:09,639
biggest names they don't know who built

2489
01:44:07,639 --> 01:44:11,480
the industry and they're like why aren't

2490
01:44:09,639 --> 01:44:14,239
we making any money so that's why the

2491
01:44:11,479 --> 01:44:15,439
education of athletes is huge right now

2492
01:44:14,238 --> 01:44:17,238
because they don't want to just sell

2493
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:19,158
Gatorade if there's a better alternative

2494
01:44:17,238 --> 01:44:20,598
to Gatorade they don't want to sell some

2495
01:44:19,158 --> 01:44:22,519
bad supplement if there's a better

2496
01:44:20,599 --> 01:44:24,760
alternative to supplements so they're

2497
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:28,320
like can is the first time athletes can

2498
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:30,199
say for themselves this is what helps me

2499
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:33,079
this you know this flower helped me this

2500
01:44:30,198 --> 01:44:34,799
hash helped me through my career but

2501
01:44:33,079 --> 01:44:36,319
you're still up against Big Marketing

2502
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,480
and that's why you can't get a cannabis

2503
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:40,079
Super Bowl commercial even if it's about

2504
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:42,399
sick kidss or veterans because people

2505
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:44,960
have applied for the last three years

2506
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:47,399
and those commercials have been

2507
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:49,399
denied I'm curious are any of these

2508
01:44:47,399 --> 01:44:50,719
organizations thinking about cannabis in

2509
01:44:49,399 --> 01:44:52,719
terms of the mental health of their

2510
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:54,840
athletes or their anxiety or performance

2511
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:56,079
anxiety

2512
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:59,319
yeah but you can't say that on the

2513
01:44:56,079 --> 01:45:02,760
Forefront as long as it's so w regulates

2514
01:44:59,319 --> 01:45:07,000
the glob doping recommendations and

2515
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:09,639
rules W follows the DEA scheduling of a

2516
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,118
no medical use so it creates a gridlock

2517
01:45:09,639 --> 01:45:12,920
people ask me as a researcher like

2518
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:14,639
what's the way through and I'm like well

2519
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:16,840
there's a grid lock as long as a DEA

2520
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:20,118
says no medical use the world

2521
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:22,000
anti-doping agency says no medical use

2522
01:45:20,118 --> 01:45:24,000
and the sports agencies have to follow

2523
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,639
water like shakeri Richardson

2524
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:29,639
technically didn't violate any rules she

2525
01:45:27,639 --> 01:45:32,079
didn't even violate you know as far as

2526
01:45:29,639 --> 01:45:34,639
like the NCAA would be now she violated

2527
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:37,039
wada which is the world anti-doping

2528
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:39,000
agency and everybody has to follow

2529
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:40,719
that yeah with a change in the

2530
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,399
scheduling I ultimately think that there

2531
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:44,319
will be a change in the perception that

2532
01:45:42,399 --> 01:45:47,238
people have on it like really what it

2533
01:45:44,319 --> 01:45:49,279
comes down to is like it's a combination

2534
01:45:47,238 --> 01:45:50,959
of changes with an understanding coming

2535
01:45:49,279 --> 01:45:52,719
from the government end and then on the

2536
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,560
other hand like Private Industry that

2537
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:57,560
has enough Capital to really push it

2538
01:45:54,560 --> 01:46:01,039
forward and the reality is there hasn't

2539
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:03,360
been that yet on either side I mean like

2540
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:06,880
to give a few examples up here in Canada

2541
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:08,039
like the majority of politicians don't

2542
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,480
understand any of it like I'm in

2543
01:46:08,039 --> 01:46:11,399
communication with the co-chair of the

2544
01:46:09,479 --> 01:46:12,759
Cannabis caucus for the federal liberals

2545
01:46:11,399 --> 01:46:14,759
I also have a contact with the

2546
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:17,440
conservative party as well and I'm

2547
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:19,639
mindblown like how little information is

2548
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:21,319
there it's not like I expect them to be

2549
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:23,239
experts just like I don't expect them to

2550
01:46:21,319 --> 01:46:26,118
know everything about like alcohol or

2551
01:46:23,238 --> 01:46:28,638
alcohol production for example but there

2552
01:46:26,118 --> 01:46:31,399
isn't really even the base you know

2553
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:33,079
Basics that are there and so like the

2554
01:46:31,399 --> 01:46:34,719
thing that's happening in the states is

2555
01:46:33,079 --> 01:46:36,719
when there's like a change in terms of

2556
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:39,000
the scheduling as long as the right

2557
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:41,118
information is getting through and as

2558
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,238
strange as this is to say but like

2559
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:45,479
corporations that maybe have Mal intent

2560
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:48,198
but at the same time at least they're

2561
01:46:45,479 --> 01:46:49,799
doing it right I really have an

2562
01:46:48,198 --> 01:46:52,279
optimistic stance that we're going to

2563
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:54,679
see changes like that because I mean up

2564
01:46:52,279 --> 01:46:56,759
here in Canada I know a lot of athletes

2565
01:46:54,679 --> 01:46:59,639
or ex-athletes who use cannabis I mean I

2566
01:46:56,760 --> 01:47:01,560
know one guy that was in the WHL one guy

2567
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:03,840
that was in the wfl that grew up in

2568
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:05,960
North Vancouver pretty close to me and

2569
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:08,480
both of them use lots of cannabis But

2570
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:10,118
ultimately even with legalization

2571
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:11,158
they're not this is the other side of it

2572
01:47:10,118 --> 01:47:13,519
too is there's still that kind of

2573
01:47:11,158 --> 01:47:15,598
discriminatory type stance on it they're

2574
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,840
not really comfortable going around

2575
01:47:15,599 --> 01:47:20,119
being the endorser of cannabis or having

2576
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:21,960
their name attached to it like sure they

2577
01:47:20,118 --> 01:47:24,759
use it it's a part of their life it's

2578
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:27,279
it's really important them but they feel

2579
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:30,079
they'll be maybe stigmatized maybe

2580
01:47:27,279 --> 01:47:32,399
discriminated against maybe not uh taken

2581
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:34,238
as seriously because of it and you know

2582
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:35,960
like someone like myself I was fortunate

2583
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:37,638
I never really had that kind of

2584
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:40,480
circumstance I've been a medical patient

2585
01:47:37,639 --> 01:47:42,239
since I was young I never had people

2586
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:43,919
like I went to high school in West

2587
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:46,079
Vancouver for those who don't know it's

2588
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:48,319
a one of the wealthiest areas in Canada

2589
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:50,639
there's a lot of let's say more like

2590
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:53,039
conservative or anti-drug type

2591
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:54,880
mentalities from people there I never

2592
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:57,599
found that when I communicated it or

2593
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:58,840
when I explained my use or explained

2594
01:47:57,599 --> 01:48:01,000
things about cannabis that they're

2595
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:03,520
unaware of but it doesn't change the

2596
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,399
fact that until there's those changes

2597
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:07,760
that are created it's it's kind of going

2598
01:48:05,399 --> 01:48:11,359
to be the stalemate of just waiting

2599
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:11,360
until something happens

2600
01:48:12,359 --> 01:48:17,079
realistically yeah indeed indeed go

2601
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:19,319
ahead just gonna show this product I

2602
01:48:17,079 --> 01:48:23,519
picked up this product at a cannabis

2603
01:48:19,319 --> 01:48:25,079
show a couple years ago and it's a CBD

2604
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:27,480
transnasal

2605
01:48:25,079 --> 01:48:29,198
Mist so I don't know it's probably I

2606
01:48:27,479 --> 01:48:31,079
don't think it's a nano Emulsion but

2607
01:48:29,198 --> 01:48:33,638
you'd imagine that just something like

2608
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:35,599
this you know just giving a couple shots

2609
01:48:33,639 --> 01:48:38,039
up the nose after

2610
01:48:35,599 --> 01:48:40,800
concussion Nano Emulsion isn't as

2611
01:48:38,039 --> 01:48:42,760
effective as exosomes they they load

2612
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:45,960
exosomes and that's what gives the

2613
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:48,960
payload to the to the brain yeah I mean

2614
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:51,239
I think that I so the research really is

2615
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:53,960
I mean a lot of the pieces are out there

2616
01:48:51,238 --> 01:48:58,399
people have shown that they could drugs

2617
01:48:53,960 --> 01:49:01,279
using these types of um uh Nano emotions

2618
01:48:58,399 --> 01:49:04,479
and you know or other types of

2619
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:07,920
formulations I think the the the the key

2620
01:49:04,479 --> 01:49:11,359
thing is that can you deliver it in a

2621
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:13,880
concentration that's effective to reduce

2622
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:16,118
neuroinflammation to create a better

2623
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:18,480
outcome for the patient the University

2624
01:49:16,118 --> 01:49:20,319
of Miami has a patent on it I'm almost

2625
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:22,198
certain they definitely have the

2626
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:24,319
knowledge on how they were the ones that

2627
01:49:22,198 --> 01:49:26,759
discovered using exosome because it was

2628
01:49:24,319 --> 01:49:28,519
my business partner Dr Brent Reynolds

2629
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:30,719
who I met through Tony and those guys

2630
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:33,480
and continued to work with him after

2631
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:34,920
Jamaica that um was working at the

2632
01:49:33,479 --> 01:49:37,399
University we were actually going to

2633
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:38,880
load up psychedelics into the exosomes

2634
01:49:37,399 --> 01:49:41,719
and deliver them right to the brain but

2635
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:43,679
no we we spoke about this it was a 45

2636
01:49:41,719 --> 01:49:47,679
times payload to the brain that they had

2637
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:50,359
ever seen 45 times more so what why

2638
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:53,000
doesn't the NFL I mean it seems like

2639
01:49:50,359 --> 01:49:57,039
this is just an obvious low-lying route

2640
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:59,880
for them to go after um given the safety

2641
01:49:57,039 --> 01:50:01,920
of canabo you know humans can tolerate

2642
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:03,359
canabo I think it would be a thing that

2643
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,960
the NFL wouldn't even have to pay

2644
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:06,639
attention to just the doctors that

2645
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:09,319
worked for them would have it in their

2646
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:12,239
bags yeah I mean again when it comes to

2647
01:50:09,319 --> 01:50:14,118
Sports Marketing fizer is like a big if

2648
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:17,638
you ever watch sports you'll see fizer

2649
01:50:14,118 --> 01:50:20,359
advertised right fizer is very much into

2650
01:50:17,639 --> 01:50:22,760
the synthetic canabo field they spent a

2651
01:50:20,359 --> 01:50:24,960
couple billion dollars to acquire Arena

2652
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:26,840
pharmaceutical Arena pharmaceutical if

2653
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:29,920
you don't know they specialize in

2654
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:31,440
irritable bowel syndrome drugs which I

2655
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:33,920
don't know if you know but cannabis

2656
01:50:31,439 --> 01:50:36,759
helps irritable bowel syndrome like

2657
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:38,960
pretty much most of the time are they

2658
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:40,560
spinoid like or they completely

2659
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:42,840
synthetic or what are their active

2660
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,320
ingredients look like Stephen I don't

2661
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,960
know exactly because when the merger

2662
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:47,799
went through everything went quiet but

2663
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:50,279
they let people know what the intent was

2664
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:53,239
behind it but what it tells me is if

2665
01:50:50,279 --> 01:50:56,118
fizer as big a company as it is spent

2666
01:50:53,238 --> 01:50:57,919
billions of dollars to acquire a company

2667
01:50:56,118 --> 01:51:01,238
that specializes in

2668
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:03,440
can the NFL on the back end knowing that

2669
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:04,839
fizer is one of their Partners these

2670
01:51:03,439 --> 01:51:06,519
these people all talk it's corporate

2671
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:09,078
money they're just moving money around

2672
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:10,719
the same plate so that then lets me know

2673
01:51:09,078 --> 01:51:13,359
the NFL is funding cannabis and

2674
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:14,760
concussion research fizer is doing some

2675
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:17,880
stuff over here with irritable bowel

2676
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:19,639
syndrome to me to the people on this

2677
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:21,679
call like I don't always want that to be

2678
01:51:19,639 --> 01:51:24,039
the Forefront of the conversation I

2679
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:26,078
think that is the corporate model but I

2680
01:51:24,039 --> 01:51:28,238
think just like craft beer and just like

2681
01:51:26,078 --> 01:51:29,880
craft Burgers I think this is going to

2682
01:51:28,238 --> 01:51:31,718
push craft cannabis exactly where we

2683
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:34,719
want it to be there's going to be so

2684
01:51:31,719 --> 01:51:37,198
much mass-produced big just stuff on

2685
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:39,439
Walgreens shelves I think that you will

2686
01:51:37,198 --> 01:51:42,078
get that other person who I don't want a

2687
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:43,960
50 Cent beer I don't I don't want a

2688
01:51:42,078 --> 01:51:46,000
dollar burger what I want is a dollar

2689
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:48,560
that maybe cost a burger that cost 15

2690
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:50,039
bucks but I know it's all locally raised

2691
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:52,239
I know where my you know I know where

2692
01:51:50,039 --> 01:51:54,359
all the ingredients came from and I know

2693
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:55,879
where the money goes back too but we

2694
01:51:54,359 --> 01:51:57,519
didn't care about that type of quality

2695
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:59,960
in food until we started getting

2696
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:01,719
educated as a public hey McDonald's

2697
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:03,520
burgers are not good for you if you're

2698
01:52:01,719 --> 01:52:05,840
going to eat a burger maybe look towards

2699
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:07,440
these type of raised you know this is

2700
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:09,360
how your beef was raised I think

2701
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:11,638
cannabis is about to go the same way

2702
01:52:09,359 --> 01:52:13,799
because of the model that these big

2703
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:15,440
corporations are taking talk about

2704
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:17,840
having blinders on though where it's

2705
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:19,919
like it takes you to gain 200 lb before

2706
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:22,800
you realize I don't think this burger is

2707
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:25,158
good for me uh it's changing me a little

2708
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:28,440
bit I uh I don't know what's going on

2709
01:52:25,158 --> 01:52:29,839
here I don't feel good yeah well I don't

2710
01:52:28,439 --> 01:52:32,078
know if you saw this thing that was in

2711
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:36,760
the news this week Marcus but there was

2712
01:52:32,078 --> 01:52:38,759
um a a a statement made by the Surgeon

2713
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:43,039
General in the United States that

2714
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:45,599
connects alcohol to increase risk of

2715
01:52:43,039 --> 01:52:48,800
certain kinds of cancers it was in the

2716
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:50,840
news surprise the most poisonous thing

2717
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:53,560
causes cancer I I don't believe it well

2718
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:56,360
so so if this is gets to the point where

2719
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:59,239
they actually want to put warning and

2720
01:52:56,359 --> 01:53:01,198
recommendation labels on like you know

2721
01:52:59,238 --> 01:53:04,078
the way they used to put things on

2722
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:06,479
cigarettes that cigarettes cause cancer

2723
01:53:04,078 --> 01:53:08,880
that you know again consuming alcohol

2724
01:53:06,479 --> 01:53:11,879
even like one or two drinks a day they

2725
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:14,359
said you know statistically increases

2726
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:17,800
your risk for all these cancers and

2727
01:53:14,359 --> 01:53:20,559
everything well my gosh where are the

2728
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:24,719
labels on anything containing high

2729
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:28,320
fructose corn syrup and diabet IES right

2730
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:31,118
so like well it's it's kind of like you

2731
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:33,759
know cancer is a multibillion doll

2732
01:53:31,118 --> 01:53:35,839
industry and just like Stephen said you

2733
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:38,599
know you got companies like fizer and

2734
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:41,319
other huge multinational public

2735
01:53:38,599 --> 01:53:42,920
corporations that again are all about

2736
01:53:41,319 --> 01:53:46,279
return to the shareholders so they're

2737
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:49,078
looking to make as much money as they po

2738
01:53:46,279 --> 01:53:51,319
uh possibly can and we vot we've said it

2739
01:53:49,078 --> 01:53:53,118
here on hash Church before the Mantra of

2740
01:53:51,319 --> 01:53:56,439
the pharmaceutical company

2741
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:59,359
is not to cure disease it's to hook

2742
01:53:56,439 --> 01:54:01,719
customers for life and start sucking on

2743
01:53:59,359 --> 01:54:03,198
that insurance teeth and that's another

2744
01:54:01,719 --> 01:54:05,599
thing that was in the news you know this

2745
01:54:03,198 --> 01:54:07,719
guy was gunned down on the streets of

2746
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:12,520
New York a place I just visited last

2747
01:54:07,719 --> 01:54:15,599
week for what for being the the the CEO

2748
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:18,239
of a of a huge medical insurance thing

2749
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:20,440
called United whatever they I don't even

2750
01:54:18,238 --> 01:54:22,439
want to say their name but the the point

2751
01:54:20,439 --> 01:54:24,719
is is that our health care System at

2752
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:27,598
least here in the states is completely

2753
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:30,639
being sucked dry because it's a

2754
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:33,400
for-profit Health Care System where you

2755
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:35,359
have this insurance industry in between

2756
01:54:33,399 --> 01:54:37,759
the providers and the people who need

2757
01:54:35,359 --> 01:54:39,880
health care and they're sucking all the

2758
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:42,280
money out and determining who gets

2759
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:44,440
coverage and who doesn't what things are

2760
01:54:42,279 --> 01:54:47,479
covered and what aren't covered so yeah

2761
01:54:44,439 --> 01:54:51,039
man there's such big money in keeping

2762
01:54:47,479 --> 01:54:53,759
people sick keeping people sick that's

2763
01:54:51,039 --> 01:54:57,599
like an industry it's an industry that

2764
01:54:53,760 --> 01:55:00,960
makes money for shareholders oh you know

2765
01:54:57,599 --> 01:55:02,679
how do you fix that can cannabis help it

2766
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:05,760
definitely goes to show you that for

2767
01:55:02,679 --> 01:55:08,359
sure evil exists regardless of your

2768
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:12,560
religious or spiritual beliefs you have

2769
01:55:08,359 --> 01:55:14,319
to know that evil exists and it's uh I

2770
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:16,599
I'm I've got I've said it before it's

2771
01:55:14,319 --> 01:55:18,880
it's got to be a part of Free Will right

2772
01:55:16,599 --> 01:55:22,400
like without it free will isn't free

2773
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:25,560
will it's like when Elon Musk says that

2774
01:55:22,399 --> 01:55:27,479
censorship or free speech is only really

2775
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:29,679
free speech when someone says something

2776
01:55:27,479 --> 01:55:31,319
you don't like because it's easy when

2777
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:33,840
people are saying the things that you do

2778
01:55:31,319 --> 01:55:36,039
like it's when they say things you don't

2779
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:37,840
like that it's that it becomes free

2780
01:55:36,039 --> 01:55:39,238
speech that you have to like well people

2781
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:40,800
should be allowed to say what they want

2782
01:55:39,238 --> 01:55:43,198
and if they're saying stupid heinous

2783
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:45,079
[ __ ] well most likely Society will get

2784
01:55:43,198 --> 01:55:47,198
on that and kind of you know create

2785
01:55:45,078 --> 01:55:50,078
boundaries around those people but it's

2786
01:55:47,198 --> 01:55:52,919
hard to have free speech when when

2787
01:55:50,078 --> 01:55:55,039
you're censoring any side

2788
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:57,158
yeah I saw a friend of mine she's a a

2789
01:55:55,039 --> 01:56:00,679
political cartoonist she had she had to

2790
01:55:57,158 --> 01:56:03,279
resign from Washington Post and peles

2791
01:56:00,679 --> 01:56:05,800
because of of a political cartoon she

2792
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:08,840
did of Jeff bezos's bowing and giving

2793
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:12,480
money to [ __ ] the Trump

2794
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:15,078
campaign she got fired yeah and her job

2795
01:56:12,479 --> 01:56:19,078
is to make social commentary through

2796
01:56:15,078 --> 01:56:21,158
cartoon jokes yep except against except

2797
01:56:19,078 --> 01:56:23,000
except against the oligarchy then then

2798
01:56:21,158 --> 01:56:26,158
that's that's an issue

2799
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:28,520
Jesus Christ [ __ ] censorship yeah I'd

2800
01:56:26,158 --> 01:56:31,638
say so but it's you know that does have

2801
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:34,440
a very sharp ended sword on the other

2802
01:56:31,639 --> 01:56:37,639
side it's very much it can't put it this

2803
01:56:34,439 --> 01:56:41,879
way a lack of censorship in that on that

2804
01:56:37,639 --> 01:56:44,039
level Cann not exist in a world where if

2805
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:45,760
you can hurt someone's feelings you've

2806
01:56:44,039 --> 01:56:48,279
broken a

2807
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:50,360
law well they they will think that you

2808
01:56:48,279 --> 01:56:52,880
know people are getting an oligarchy but

2809
01:56:50,359 --> 01:56:56,078
I think the oligarchy via luig found

2810
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:57,760
that at 1735 in France and we're not

2811
01:56:56,078 --> 01:57:00,399
going to tolerate it we'd rather have

2812
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:02,360
Guillotines than live with this [ __ ]

2813
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:04,759
yeah and they're talking about taking

2814
01:57:02,359 --> 01:57:07,759
over Canada and Greenland for Christ

2815
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:10,400
sakes I mean where what world do we live

2816
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:12,960
in today oh my god well we live in a

2817
01:57:10,399 --> 01:57:15,279
world that has already done exactly what

2818
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:17,359
you just said the whole world is a cut

2819
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:19,920
up Board of countries and how that

2820
01:57:17,359 --> 01:57:22,839
happened was all these different groups

2821
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:24,719
took those countries and put up borders

2822
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:26,760
and said this is ours and they fought

2823
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:28,599
for it so this has been happening if you

2824
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:30,480
look at a map and it just doesn't say

2825
01:57:28,599 --> 01:57:32,800
Earth but it has all these different

2826
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:35,439
countries names then exactly what you

2827
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:37,560
just said is is exactly what's been

2828
01:57:35,439 --> 01:57:40,479
happening since the beginning of time

2829
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:43,199
people are taking that

2830
01:57:40,479 --> 01:57:45,078
[ __ ] I think that's what's interesting

2831
01:57:43,198 --> 01:57:47,919
something that Laura said earlier about

2832
01:57:45,078 --> 01:57:49,840
people being on the same page something

2833
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:53,359
in the military and something in sports

2834
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:55,119
that we notice is during times of trauma

2835
01:57:53,359 --> 01:57:57,719
people who are on the same page hit

2836
01:57:55,118 --> 01:58:00,279
these unified flow states which is when

2837
01:57:57,719 --> 01:58:02,319
[ __ ] gets really crazy it's one thing to

2838
01:58:00,279 --> 01:58:04,078
see Steph Curry shooting threes and

2839
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:06,158
you're like yo Steph Curry's in Flow

2840
01:58:04,078 --> 01:58:08,479
State it's another thing to watch all

2841
01:58:06,158 --> 01:58:11,000
his teammates moving at the exact same

2842
01:58:08,479 --> 01:58:12,519
time and you're just like how much

2843
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,719
training did it take for you all's

2844
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:17,440
brains to

2845
01:58:13,719 --> 01:58:19,279
synchronize on the road hostile crowd

2846
01:58:17,439 --> 01:58:21,279
people screaming and you all are pretty

2847
01:58:19,279 --> 01:58:23,759
much like doing a synchronized dance

2848
01:58:21,279 --> 01:58:25,359
right now like I think we we've shown

2849
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:27,360
that our bodies can do it with

2850
01:58:25,359 --> 01:58:29,719
performance and I think now one of the

2851
01:58:27,359 --> 01:58:31,880
things I love about being a researcher

2852
01:58:29,719 --> 01:58:34,198
every time civilization hits some crazy

2853
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:34,960
major Breaking Point researchers across

2854
01:58:34,198 --> 01:58:38,719
the

2855
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:40,520
planet before WiFi all came up with like

2856
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:42,719
similar discoveries because they were

2857
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:44,119
going through similar types of stress I

2858
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:46,198
think that's why hash church is so

2859
01:58:44,118 --> 01:58:48,039
important because you find out the more

2860
01:58:46,198 --> 01:58:49,198
people that you reach out to you're like

2861
01:58:48,039 --> 01:58:50,960
you're doing something a little

2862
01:58:49,198 --> 01:58:52,319
different than what we're doing but

2863
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:54,000
everybody's trying to move there a

2864
01:58:52,319 --> 01:58:56,118
little bit forward and I think that's a

2865
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,760
unified Flow State that we're all in

2866
01:58:56,118 --> 01:58:59,479
like you get to a certain point of

2867
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:02,039
trauma and I can say this as a veteran

2868
01:58:59,479 --> 01:59:04,000
where you're just like I'm not afraid of

2869
01:59:02,039 --> 01:59:06,319
my fear anymore like I'm not afraid of

2870
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,880
trauma like those different things and

2871
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:10,759
what Laura said earlier is you actually

2872
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:12,760
start building a self- resiliency you're

2873
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:14,400
like I can actually move this thing

2874
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:17,159
forward and I think everybody on this

2875
01:59:14,399 --> 01:59:19,679
call is moving their local you know kind

2876
01:59:17,158 --> 01:59:21,479
of group forward as much as possible I

2877
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:22,560
think when the whatever rescheduling

2878
01:59:21,479 --> 01:59:24,359
happens

2879
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:25,880
it's going to benefit big ass companies

2880
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:28,479
everybody here pretty much agrees on

2881
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:30,199
that but like my work with athleticism

2882
01:59:28,479 --> 01:59:31,879
the work with veterans everything that

2883
01:59:30,198 --> 01:59:33,678
everybody's doing on here there's going

2884
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:35,760
to be more opportunities to pop up one

2885
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:37,599
way or another it's not just gonna big

2886
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:39,920
companies can't benefit if there's no

2887
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:42,560
consumers but consumers are also now

2888
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:44,560
investors and business owners themselves

2889
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:47,079
so that's what makes this kind of

2890
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:49,480
domestic circular economy so interesting

2891
01:59:47,078 --> 01:59:53,279
right now they want the masses they want

2892
01:59:49,479 --> 01:59:56,439
the Botanical turps with uh floor

2893
01:59:53,279 --> 01:59:58,439
sweepings and uh distillate sprayed on

2894
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:59,799
them and they can have that market most

2895
01:59:58,439 --> 02:00:03,919
of the people in here are more

2896
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:06,320
specialized in like accessing a certain

2897
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:09,399
part of the market and there's you know

2898
02:00:06,319 --> 02:00:12,639
as uh my Jamaican friends always told me

2899
02:00:09,399 --> 02:00:14,960
J made enough for everyone so just uh

2900
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:17,000
focus on what you're doing and uh we

2901
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:19,800
should be good and who wants that anyway

2902
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:22,319
I don't really want to sell floor

2903
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:24,119
sweepings and and distillate and po iCal

2904
02:00:22,319 --> 02:00:26,719
turps and pre-rolled Joints with thick

2905
02:00:24,118 --> 02:00:29,319
paper I don't want to do that yet

2906
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:31,679
there's millions of people who want to

2907
02:00:29,319 --> 02:00:33,960
smoke that and so who am I to say that

2908
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:36,039
they shouldn't uh I'm definitely going

2909
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:38,760
to do my best on the other side of the

2910
02:00:36,039 --> 02:00:41,960
market to try and like send in little

2911
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:44,119
lures over to that side of the camp to

2912
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:45,800
kind of like bring them over to a

2913
02:00:44,118 --> 02:00:47,880
different sort of hey have you heard of

2914
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:49,960
this like have you seen have you tried

2915
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:51,440
smoking just the hash off the plant in a

2916
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:53,118
smaller amount from the health

2917
02:00:51,439 --> 02:00:55,238
perspective there's so many different

2918
02:00:53,118 --> 02:00:57,479
perspectives that people have today that

2919
02:00:55,238 --> 02:01:00,479
they didn't necessarily have 25 to 30

2920
02:00:57,479 --> 02:01:05,439
years ago and people are more cognitive

2921
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:07,359
of health and you know longevity and you

2922
02:01:05,439 --> 02:01:09,839
know being more safe in the things that

2923
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:12,198
you do on a regular basis and I think

2924
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:15,400
that a lot of

2925
02:01:12,198 --> 02:01:18,279
the aspects of the market that we in

2926
02:01:15,399 --> 02:01:21,000
this room seem to be focused on uh feed

2927
02:01:18,279 --> 02:01:23,078
into that so it's okay if it's not the

2928
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,760
uh yeah kind says say no to floor

2929
02:01:23,078 --> 02:01:29,319
sweeping say yes to abundance yeah no

2930
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:32,280
[ __ ] dude I feel that unfortunately a

2931
02:01:29,319 --> 02:01:34,519
lot of people out there are focusing on

2932
02:01:32,279 --> 02:01:36,359
the money and saying there's a sucker

2933
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:38,840
born every

2934
02:01:36,359 --> 02:01:40,759
minute well they're not wrong there is a

2935
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:43,000
sucker born every minute but my goodness

2936
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:45,079
be nicer you don't have to like take

2937
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:48,078
people down like just go do something

2938
02:01:45,078 --> 02:01:50,439
good with your life and put some sort of

2939
02:01:48,078 --> 02:01:53,118
better frequency into the world the

2940
02:01:50,439 --> 02:01:54,759
world can use it the it's all frequency

2941
02:01:53,118 --> 02:01:57,960
we're all putting these vibrations out

2942
02:01:54,760 --> 02:02:00,599
into the world and uh I think that's

2943
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:05,158
what the Indians called karma because

2944
02:02:00,599 --> 02:02:07,400
that stuff uh comes

2945
02:02:05,158 --> 02:02:08,920
around the world could be such a better

2946
02:02:07,399 --> 02:02:11,439
place if everybody smoked the quality of

2947
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:14,039
hash that we were smoking I feel that

2948
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:16,799
too Caitlyn I do feel that then on the

2949
02:02:14,039 --> 02:02:18,679
flip side sometimes I feel like oh my

2950
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:22,119
God I don't know if that's the case even

2951
02:02:18,679 --> 02:02:25,719
though I I need it to be the case I want

2952
02:02:22,118 --> 02:02:27,238
it to be the case but that's funny that

2953
02:02:25,719 --> 02:02:28,920
Caitlyn said that because I was just

2954
02:02:27,238 --> 02:02:31,638
about to say the same thing I was about

2955
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:34,480
to be like man like I wish this was I

2956
02:02:31,639 --> 02:02:37,000
wish hash was available in Japan and

2957
02:02:34,479 --> 02:02:39,039
Southeast Asia places in Southeast Asia

2958
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:41,840
where um they could really use it you

2959
02:02:39,039 --> 02:02:45,399
know there's a lot of drinking Japanese

2960
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:49,760
people love to man they love to drink

2961
02:02:45,399 --> 02:02:52,839
theyve can drink and I think they could

2962
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:55,039
really yeah yeah and uh not that I have

2963
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:57,159
anything about against drinking or beer

2964
02:02:55,039 --> 02:03:00,118
I I personally really really love beer

2965
02:02:57,158 --> 02:03:02,279
myself um but I just noticed that you

2966
02:03:00,118 --> 02:03:04,719
know there's a lot of people that could

2967
02:03:02,279 --> 02:03:06,840
really benefit from it um

2968
02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:09,920
internationally just smoking some really

2969
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:13,400
good hash and um being one with

2970
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:15,840
theirselves and achieving flow

2971
02:03:13,399 --> 02:03:17,679
States totally and connecting with that

2972
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:19,000
Universe energy around them right

2973
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:20,440
there's so many people that just get

2974
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,920
lost in this world and are just not

2975
02:03:20,439 --> 02:03:23,519
paying attention to the things happening

2976
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:26,239
that a little bit of cannabis can just

2977
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,800
quiet that noise and sort of bring that

2978
02:03:26,238 --> 02:03:29,118
attention back to what's in front of you

2979
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:31,639
and what's around you and I think people

2980
02:03:29,118 --> 02:03:33,639
forget that cannabis can tune Us in that

2981
02:03:31,639 --> 02:03:35,599
way and that we can really connect with

2982
02:03:33,639 --> 02:03:37,840
others and ourselves and you know

2983
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:39,239
everything happening around us for me as

2984
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:42,400
a young person when I first tried

2985
02:03:39,238 --> 02:03:44,039
cannabis I was a very scared of Life

2986
02:03:42,399 --> 02:03:47,238
person and when I first tried cannabis

2987
02:03:44,039 --> 02:03:49,158
with my friends um it quieted all that

2988
02:03:47,238 --> 02:03:51,879
noise and all of that fear and all of

2989
02:03:49,158 --> 02:03:53,439
that anxiousness and it really let me

2990
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:54,880
actually pay attention to what was

2991
02:03:53,439 --> 02:03:57,198
happening around me instead of me just

2992
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:58,920
being afraid of what happened around me

2993
02:03:57,198 --> 02:04:00,919
it let me connect with new people it let

2994
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:02,118
me walk up to strangers and say hey do

2995
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:03,639
you want to spend some time together and

2996
02:04:02,118 --> 02:04:05,639
smoke this joint and get to know each

2997
02:04:03,639 --> 02:04:07,400
other and it really opened up a whole

2998
02:04:05,639 --> 02:04:10,840
world for me that I didn't have access

2999
02:04:07,399 --> 02:04:12,598
to prior to cannabis and so for me I

3000
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:14,920
love to see a world where everybody

3001
02:04:12,599 --> 02:04:17,520
doesn't have that stigma and is to try

3002
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:19,520
and see what sort of mental health

3003
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:21,440
relief they could get from that from

3004
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:23,400
that experience to me it was it was

3005
02:04:21,439 --> 02:04:25,238
massive and I think I think the world

3006
02:04:23,399 --> 02:04:27,118
underestimates the mental health relief

3007
02:04:25,238 --> 02:04:30,319
from

3008
02:04:27,118 --> 02:04:32,319
Cannabis absolutely I think the world uh

3009
02:04:30,319 --> 02:04:35,719
underestimates the mental health relief

3010
02:04:32,319 --> 02:04:38,519
from living in the cies yes that too

3011
02:04:35,719 --> 02:04:41,639
this place is magical it is absolutely

3012
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:44,000
magical it's like a bunch of like dudes

3013
02:04:41,639 --> 02:04:46,078

3014
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,840

blessed to be all of our leaders to take

3031
02:05:20,679 --> 02:05:25,279
mushrooms and

3032
02:05:22,238 --> 02:05:27,399
weed yes yes I think Terrence McKenna

3033
02:05:25,279 --> 02:05:29,519
said that quite quite some years ago

3034
02:05:27,399 --> 02:05:31,598
saying that if they just uh you know if

3035
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:33,440
if all the people stopped consuming

3036
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:35,559
alcohol for like a week and were

3037
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:38,479
consuming psychedelics or cannabis the

3038
02:05:35,559 --> 02:05:42,599
entire world would have like a monstrous

3039
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:45,839
it is crazy how much how how people

3040
02:05:42,599 --> 02:05:49,119
don't really realized how they were like

3041
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:51,679
funneled towards alcohol you know you

3042
02:05:49,118 --> 02:05:54,000
get funneled towards alcohol it

3043
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:57,039
particularly depending on the level of

3044
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:59,039
prohibition that your country has um you

3045
02:05:57,039 --> 02:06:02,078
know I grew up in a police family and of

3046
02:05:59,039 --> 02:06:04,439
course cannabis was illegal and so all

3047
02:06:02,078 --> 02:06:06,519
of the cops I knew were alcoholics which

3048
02:06:04,439 --> 02:06:08,879
was like scary when you think about it

3049
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:10,800
it was kind of like o that seems like a

3050
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:12,520
you got a gun there and how old were you

3051
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:14,079
right it was sociologically okay for

3052
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:17,119
your parents to say okay you can have a

3053
02:06:14,078 --> 02:06:18,799
sip of alcohol with your huh right and

3054
02:06:17,118 --> 02:06:20,319
how old were you when you had your first

3055
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:22,599
taste of alcohol markers from your

3056
02:06:20,319 --> 02:06:24,840
parents I would probably have been like

3057
02:06:22,599 --> 02:06:27,000
eight or nine years old but I was also

3058
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:30,440
that age when I saw the police come

3059
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:32,198
visit my house in full uniform and the

3060
02:06:30,439 --> 02:06:35,158
guy was big his name was Rick he was

3061
02:06:32,198 --> 02:06:37,638
like 68 and 280 pounds he would drink

3062
02:06:35,158 --> 02:06:39,439
like a couple of Miller Killers which I

3063
02:06:37,639 --> 02:06:41,359
think were two or three cans of beer I

3064
02:06:39,439 --> 02:06:43,158
don't know if you're I I don't know if

3065
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:45,479
what level of white trash you had to be

3066
02:06:43,158 --> 02:06:48,638
to know about the Miller Killers but uh

3067
02:06:45,479 --> 02:06:50,359
I was at that level and so we we had

3068
02:06:48,639 --> 02:06:53,440
them in our fridge they were these giant

3069
02:06:50,359 --> 02:06:56,359
[ __ ] cans like super sized cans of

3070
02:06:53,439 --> 02:06:58,759
beer and he would come crush two of them

3071
02:06:56,359 --> 02:07:01,198
and then jump in his his police car and

3072
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:01,199
hey what's up

3073
02:07:01,479 --> 02:07:05,558
buddy sorry my son was just saying

3074
02:07:04,039 --> 02:07:07,800
goodbye to me for the day he's going to

3075
02:07:05,559 --> 02:07:10,520
play with his little buddy Jude so I had

3076
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:12,239
to uh say goodbye to him but yeah it was

3077
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:14,639
a weird thing to just kind and then get

3078
02:07:12,238 --> 02:07:17,158
kind of get older and as I got older I

3079
02:07:14,639 --> 02:07:19,920
remember the entire vice squad would

3080
02:07:17,158 --> 02:07:21,519
would have would come to my mom's house

3081
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:24,000
she had a pool and there would be like

3082
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:26,280
like a pool party in my backyard with

3083
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:28,800
the entire Vice Winnipeg vice squad

3084
02:07:26,279 --> 02:07:30,920
they'd all have these like sort of black

3085
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:33,800
wife beater shirts with the uh with

3086
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:36,279
Winnipeg Vice and a and a neon pot leaf

3087
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:39,159
and it was just like I was like okay

3088
02:07:36,279 --> 02:07:42,198
that's like these are not my people I

3089
02:07:39,158 --> 02:07:44,839
was like just swimming in my I was a bit

3090
02:07:42,198 --> 02:07:46,638
of uh I was a bit of the black sheep in

3091
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:49,319
my

3092
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:52,719
family how awesome is that I feel like

3093
02:07:49,319 --> 02:07:54,118
this is a whole panel full of people

3094
02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:56,239
that could have potentially been that in

3095
02:07:54,118 --> 02:08:00,039
their families or at least you know the

3096
02:07:56,238 --> 02:08:02,439
person who was to educate their families

3097
02:08:00,039 --> 02:08:04,238
in a way that their family that's what

3098
02:08:02,439 --> 02:08:06,319
kids do they blow your minds they're

3099
02:08:04,238 --> 02:08:09,000
just going to find some weird thing that

3100
02:08:06,319 --> 02:08:10,479
maybe you've pushed into a crevice and

3101
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,520
you I don't want anything to do with I

3102
02:08:10,479 --> 02:08:14,118
don't want to talk about that and they

3103
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:16,119
just pull it out and put it right in

3104
02:08:14,118 --> 02:08:17,639
front of you it's uh I can't wait for my

3105
02:08:16,118 --> 02:08:19,439
kid well my kids have already done it

3106
02:08:17,639 --> 02:08:22,599
but they'll do it more and I'll be

3107
02:08:19,439 --> 02:08:27,078
better for it so try not to

3108
02:08:22,599 --> 02:08:29,319
uh resent anybody who's I I ended up you

3109
02:08:27,078 --> 02:08:31,479
know years ago um well right at high

3110
02:08:29,319 --> 02:08:33,719
school I had a uh I end up working for a

3111
02:08:31,479 --> 02:08:35,000
con man and he ended up coming over the

3112
02:08:33,719 --> 02:08:37,039
house and saying I'm going to get your

3113
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:39,078
mom to smoke marijuana and I remember

3114
02:08:37,039 --> 02:08:40,960
him saying that to my mom and my stepdad

3115
02:08:39,078 --> 02:08:44,599
and they're like yeah not a chance in

3116
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:45,880
hell dude and uh no he didn't but years

3117
02:08:44,599 --> 02:08:47,520
later after I went through the hemp

3118
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:49,440
industry and then I was in cannabis

3119
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:51,520
industry then my mom was like so I'm

3120
02:08:49,439 --> 02:08:54,519
losing my memory can I try this marij

3121
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:56,199
Iana and uh you know it worked I was

3122
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:59,639
able to have te's I start off with the

3123
02:08:56,198 --> 02:09:03,078
te's that was a very ENT easy entry

3124
02:08:59,639 --> 02:09:05,039
point for because she had smoked earlier

3125
02:09:03,078 --> 02:09:07,118
in her life but she didn't want to smoke

3126
02:09:05,039 --> 02:09:10,599
anything right she was worried about

3127
02:09:07,118 --> 02:09:12,839
coughing she was in her you know 70s so

3128
02:09:10,599 --> 02:09:16,520
you know it was not something uh that

3129
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:20,000
was there so to you know to actually

3130
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:23,040
then have her use cannabis and then

3131
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:26,000
decide you know this works for me was

3132
02:09:23,039 --> 02:09:29,078
lifechanging for me in that sense of

3133
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:30,439
going from you know the um you know you

3134
02:09:29,078 --> 02:09:32,639
can't do this I can't believe what

3135
02:09:30,439 --> 02:09:34,558
you're doing to okay well what you're

3136
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:37,239
doing is fine and normal and I like it's

3137
02:09:34,559 --> 02:09:39,480
so normal that I I want to try this now

3138
02:09:37,238 --> 02:09:40,799
I mean d That's amazing that's my mom's

3139
02:09:39,479 --> 02:09:42,759
the same way my mom worked for the

3140
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:44,960
police for 35 years was never going to

3141
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:47,520
use cannabis never used it in her entire

3142
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:49,239
life then it was like she started using

3143
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:51,159
it she started going to bed with it then

3144
02:09:49,238 --> 02:09:52,799
she got a grow and a license and then

3145
02:09:51,158 --> 02:09:54,920
she was cutting clones and sharing them

3146
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:59,199
with other people and it was just like

3147
02:09:54,920 --> 02:10:00,920
this like pretty awesome growth of uh

3148
02:09:59,198 --> 02:10:02,439
just being involved with the plant she

3149
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:04,319
got right into it you know planting it

3150
02:10:02,439 --> 02:10:06,759
in her backyard having a little indoor

3151
02:10:04,319 --> 02:10:09,399
grow getting getting getting cuts for

3152
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:12,639
her brother so did you show her how to

3153
02:10:09,399 --> 02:10:14,799
grow or yeah I mean my friend Al uh this

3154
02:10:12,639 --> 02:10:18,078
guy Reggie the Rody from back in the day

3155
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:20,239
Al has was really helpful he was really

3156
02:10:18,078 --> 02:10:23,238
like he would bring her you know Edibles

3157
02:10:20,238 --> 02:10:25,399
and clone B and all sorts of things so I

3158
02:10:23,238 --> 02:10:27,118
wasn't there so it was really him more

3159
02:10:25,399 --> 02:10:29,799
than me in regards to that but I had

3160
02:10:27,118 --> 02:10:31,558
shown my uncle how to make hash so they

3161
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:33,400
were also making well I showed her how

3162
02:10:31,559 --> 02:10:35,840
to make hash too she made hash with me

3163
02:10:33,399 --> 02:10:38,799
years ago before she even tried it and I

3164
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:40,400
remember because she was I don't know

3165
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:43,119
how old she was at the time probably 60

3166
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:45,039
years old she made full m hash the first

3167
02:10:43,118 --> 02:10:47,238
time she ever made it I just was like a

3168
02:10:45,039 --> 02:10:49,000
and that was with a cake mixer remember

3169
02:10:47,238 --> 02:10:50,959
when we used to make six-star full Mount

3170
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,840
bubble has with a cake mixer like come

3171
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:54,279
on

3172
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:56,599
I know that we're all professionals now

3173
02:10:54,279 --> 02:11:00,039
and we use professional equipment and we

3174
02:10:56,599 --> 02:11:01,559
all have very high levels of skill but I

3175
02:11:00,039 --> 02:11:03,359
do remember those days where I would

3176
02:11:01,559 --> 02:11:05,159
just put the little Walmart cake mixer

3177
02:11:03,359 --> 02:11:07,279
i' I'd go buy like four or five of those

3178
02:11:05,158 --> 02:11:08,359
things before I went to Jamaica I'd be

3179
02:11:07,279 --> 02:11:09,840
like yeah dude I'm going to bring all

3180
02:11:08,359 --> 02:11:12,000
these little you know and then giving

3181
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:15,400
away bubble bags with one of those

3182
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:18,880
little um those little cake mixers was

3183
02:11:15,399 --> 02:11:21,399
uh just I'm happy to have been a part of

3184
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:24,319
that point in time where I got to go to

3185
02:11:21,399 --> 02:11:27,319
Jamaica a group of people who just have

3186
02:11:24,319 --> 02:11:29,399
so much biomass available this was even

3187
02:11:27,319 --> 02:11:32,479
before they were planting plants just to

3188
02:11:29,399 --> 02:11:35,359
extract they just had so much trim or

3189
02:11:32,479 --> 02:11:37,598
Mash as they would call it that uh it

3190
02:11:35,359 --> 02:11:39,319
was a no-brainer to to go there and make

3191
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:42,559
cash anyone to this day if you're going

3192
02:11:39,319 --> 02:11:44,799
to Jamaica bring a set of Bubble Bags

3193
02:11:42,559 --> 02:11:47,440
find a cool dude that has access to a

3194
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:49,400
field make some fresh Frozen bubble hash

3195
02:11:47,439 --> 02:11:52,238
and when you leave just uh leave the

3196
02:11:49,399 --> 02:11:55,000
bags behind because it's a really like

3197
02:11:52,238 --> 02:11:57,000
lifechanging thing to uh to leave a

3198
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,960
grower with those bags suddenly they can

3199
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,599
I mean personally I wish I could just go

3200
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:02,279
to Jamaica and buy the hash I don't want

3201
02:12:00,599 --> 02:12:04,599
to have to make the hash every time it

3202
02:12:02,279 --> 02:12:06,800
was a whole was a whole thing it took

3203
02:12:04,599 --> 02:12:10,000
days of my time to be like just to try

3204
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:11,320
and buy like a 32 gallon bucket in

3205

Jamaica first of all that's going to

3206
02:12:11,319 --> 02:12:16,759
cost you like $150 US like and it's

3207
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:19,559
going to be square and all weird and

3208
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:23,239
[ __ ] up and not fit your bags and just

3211
02:12:26,279 --> 02:12:30,639
with that yeah finding finding the the

3212
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:32,960
right

3213
02:12:30,639 --> 02:12:35,319
barrels yeah how about ice we end up

3214
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:37,000
finding these blue ones these blue ones

3215
02:12:35,319 --> 02:12:39,359
the like um you know I think they're

3216
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,158
like from the [ __ ] government or some

3217
02:12:39,359 --> 02:12:43,000
[ __ ] these blue barrels that we ended up

3218
02:12:41,158 --> 02:12:46,759
using and they're the right size you

3219
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:49,800
know they're food grade too are the ones

3220
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:51,280
yep Tak some time though yeah it takes

3221
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:53,360
time and you don't realize everything is

3222
02:12:51,279 --> 02:12:56,359
so slow in Jamaica that it's like when

3223
02:12:53,359 --> 02:12:59,238
you get there like if I wasn't me and

3224
02:12:56,359 --> 02:13:02,078
imposing my will and just non-stop

3225
02:12:59,238 --> 02:13:05,158
working at making this happen i e the

3226
02:13:02,078 --> 02:13:06,960
ice you have to be [ __ ] militant and

3227
02:13:05,158 --> 02:13:09,000
then even still it takes two and a half

3228
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:11,118
days luckily I just started going to

3229

Jamaica for like 20 30 days at a time

3230
02:13:11,118 --> 02:13:15,039
but if you're on like a five or a six

3231
02:13:12,679 --> 02:13:17,760
day trip and it takes you two or three

3232
02:13:15,039 --> 02:13:19,559
days before you even make your hash I I

3233

3268
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:43,118
something to be said man when I first

3269
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:45,440
kind of discovered that my own minor

3270
02:14:43,118 --> 02:14:48,960
realization certainly many people knew

3271
02:14:45,439 --> 02:14:51,039
before I did but that was kind of like

3272
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:52,359
you know one of the first vaporizers

3273
02:14:51,039 --> 02:14:55,599
that I couldn't really figure out a

3274
02:14:52,359 --> 02:14:58,319
vaporizer that existed before that and

3275
02:14:55,599 --> 02:15:01,880
how powerful and strong pipe is a

3276
02:14:58,319 --> 02:15:05,399
vaporizer right yeah it is I just didn't

3277
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:06,800
see it like in India or Jamaica or sort

3278
02:15:05,399 --> 02:15:10,558

with some spritzer it's real like it's

3288

extra little citrus from the um from the

of vibe is just up my alley I guess

3313
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:45,000
forever once once I found OG kush for

3314
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:46,920
the first time in my homie Jorge's shed

3315
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,519
he opens up this bag you know Turkey

3316
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:51,439
bags we were doing a bunch of work back

3317
02:16:48,519 --> 02:16:54,040
then and uh I was like oh my God God I

3318
02:16:51,439 --> 02:16:56,280
have to have that I I only want that

3319
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:59,399
that's different than the the diesel or

3320
02:16:56,280 --> 02:17:01,599
whatever it was you know um yeah I

3321
02:16:59,398 --> 02:17:05,039
needed it and since that

3322
02:17:01,599 --> 02:17:07,439
day [ __ ] over 20 years ago I can't have

3323
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:09,080
enough I still grow it I'm having an

3324
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:11,200
issue right now though I'm almost like

3325
02:17:09,079 --> 02:17:13,679
it's genetic drift some you know might

3326
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:15,840
say that it's like that hlvd thing going

3327
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:17,920
around it could be something like that

3328
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:20,478
but um [ __ ] I've been growing these OG

3329
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:23,318
Cuts this you know Ghost and the SF and

3330
02:17:20,478 --> 02:17:25,679
the and stuff for you know 20 years or

3331
02:17:23,318 --> 02:17:27,840
some [ __ ] and they're just now starting

3332
02:17:25,679 --> 02:17:30,200
to have some issues and I don't know if

3333
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:32,040
I can work my way out of it or not I'm

3334
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:34,120
hearing that I can like cut from just

3335
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:36,599
the tops and and kind of work my way out

3336
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:39,160
of a a weird

3337
02:17:36,599 --> 02:17:41,120
situation style or whatever yeah yeah

3338
02:17:39,159 --> 02:17:43,119
yeah yeah no I definitely want to TC

3339
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:45,160
them and clean them up I guess is is the

3340
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:48,240
goal now because I've had these things

3341
02:17:45,159 --> 02:17:51,478
for so long that's scary when that

3342
02:17:48,239 --> 02:17:53,199
happens to like special gentics too yeah

3343
02:17:51,478 --> 02:17:54,799
got people that have been in my garden

3344
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:56,319
that aren't as crazy as I I use a

3345
02:17:54,799 --> 02:17:58,199
different razor blade for every plant

3346
02:17:56,318 --> 02:18:01,199
and I've got 30 moms right now I'm a

3347
02:17:58,200 --> 02:18:03,800
little crazy and I'm OCD I'm super clean

3348
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:05,679
not everyone's like that um and I think

3349
02:18:03,799 --> 02:18:07,840
it takes being like that for years but

3350
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:09,960
then you know I I just went on tour I'm

3351
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:12,558
traveling so much I can't be the only

3352
02:18:09,959 --> 02:18:15,799
one to have my hands on these

3353
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:19,438
ogs um yeah

3354
02:18:15,799 --> 02:18:21,558
anyways we wish your OG's the best OG to

3355
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:26,239

3356
02:18:21,558 --> 02:18:29,039
null and void of hlvd virus not exist in

3357
02:18:26,239 --> 02:18:31,239
them and maybe or HL yeah just that

3358
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:34,439
shit's terrible it's scary I I'm pretty

3359
02:18:31,239 --> 02:18:38,478
sure I had seeds from a champagne hash

3360
02:18:34,439 --> 02:18:41,200
plant that were 25 years old and when I

3361
02:18:38,478 --> 02:18:44,000
popped those seeds at first I thought it

3362
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:46,719
was like that bint membrane that was

3363
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:48,359
stuck on the uh coddon when the seedling

3364
02:18:46,718 --> 02:18:50,358
first popped up I didn't take it off

3365
02:18:48,359 --> 02:18:52,840
fast enough so sometimes that can like

3366
02:18:50,359 --> 02:18:55,079
you know damage the codon and then if

3367
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:57,000
the first set of leaves come out the

3368
02:18:55,079 --> 02:18:59,200
Epic cotle they can kind of even be

3369
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:00,718
damaged by it and I kind of thought it

3370
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:03,639
was that but I was cutting it and

3371
02:19:00,718 --> 02:19:05,919
cloning it and it was just growing like

3372
02:19:03,638 --> 02:19:10,199
like it had some [ __ ] up virus and

3373
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:12,439
after 25 years I just uh I let it go I

3374
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:15,280
did not have the tools available to me

3375
02:19:12,439 --> 02:19:18,679
to keep that particular one alive I also

3376
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:21,639
cracked a lamb's uh

3377
02:19:18,679 --> 02:19:24,679
bread around that same time which Caleb

3378
02:19:21,638 --> 02:19:27,358
that's another interesting like uh uh

3379
02:19:24,679 --> 02:19:30,159
thing that happened in history the the

3380
02:19:27,359 --> 02:19:32,200
Lamb's bread the the the the cultivar in

3381
02:19:30,159 --> 02:19:34,599
Jamaica I think a lot of people

3382
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:37,399
mispronounced it or couldn't understand

3383
02:19:34,599 --> 02:19:39,920
the Jamaican pwa so they turned it into

3384
02:19:37,398 --> 02:19:41,478
breath and a lot of people for a long

3385
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:43,558
time thought that it was the Lamb's

3386
02:19:41,478 --> 02:19:45,799
breath it's a very human thing for us to

3387
02:19:43,558 --> 02:19:48,599
kind of create those mistakes I can only

3388
02:19:45,799 --> 02:19:51,519
imagine how many of those

3389
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:54,640
misunderstandings are a part of our

3390
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:56,280
everyday uh you know conversation but

3391
02:19:54,639 --> 02:19:59,879
that one was a big one Lamb's bread for

3392
02:19:56,280 --> 02:20:01,239
sure as it's a Biblical uh um it's

3393
02:19:59,879 --> 02:20:03,879
definitely the Lamb's bread not the

3394
02:20:01,239 --> 02:20:06,280
Lamb's breath and I I never saw a single

3395
02:20:03,879 --> 02:20:08,039
cultivar that they called Lamb's bread

3396
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:11,880
Lamb's bread just seemed to be like a

3397
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:14,359
kind of land racy long flowering narrow

3398
02:20:11,879 --> 02:20:17,119
Leaf drug cultivar AKA

3399
02:20:14,359 --> 02:20:19,559
sativa um I saw lots of different plants

3400
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:21,640
that they called Lamb's bread that were

3401
02:20:19,559 --> 02:20:25,439
all nice and their own right but

3402
02:20:21,639 --> 02:20:27,639
certainly not the same population my

3403
02:20:25,439 --> 02:20:29,800
first time to Jamaica you know was I

3404
02:20:27,639 --> 02:20:32,760
start talking about the OG and stuff oh

3405
02:20:29,799 --> 02:20:34,159
yeah on the most wanted they called it

3406
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:36,960
the most wanted but then you start

3407
02:20:34,159 --> 02:20:38,799
seeing what they call OG and it's you

3408
02:20:36,959 --> 02:20:41,358
know Jamaicans have a tendency to want

3409
02:20:38,799 --> 02:20:43,920
to breed in general it's how the island

3410
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:46,840
has survived is is from

3411
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:49,079
breeding um so you know you can't blame

3412
02:20:46,840 --> 02:20:51,478
them but anytime I brought in a clone

3413
02:20:49,079 --> 02:20:53,799
only Cult of art to Jamaica they're like

3414
02:20:51,478 --> 02:20:56,039
oh yeah man we going to breed it and I'm

3415
02:20:53,799 --> 02:20:58,398
like no no no no keep this one as like

3416
02:20:56,040 --> 02:21:01,800
you know that special one no mind we off

3417
02:20:58,398 --> 02:21:04,358
a breed so

3418
02:21:01,799 --> 02:21:06,199
anyways know trust me and then so many

3419
02:21:04,359 --> 02:21:08,800
people bringing genetics there over the

3420
02:21:06,200 --> 02:21:11,520
years there was probably some really

3421
02:21:08,799 --> 02:21:13,478
special I I would guess that anything

3422
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:16,120
that was even close to a land race would

3423
02:21:13,478 --> 02:21:18,000
have come from India or that sort of

3424
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:21,399
side of things that would have ended up

3425
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:23,359
there in in those earlier days but uh

3426
02:21:21,398 --> 02:21:24,279
what do you think uh Sam you spent some

3427
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:27,960
time in

3428
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:31,760
Jamaica uh I can remember the time that

3429
02:21:27,959 --> 02:21:36,159
uh some guys were on the street

3430
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:39,398
uh uh trying to sell herb and they said

3431
02:21:36,159 --> 02:21:42,959
they walked up to me and said hey M you

3432
02:21:39,398 --> 02:21:42,959
want the pineapple

3433
02:21:43,318 --> 02:21:51,079
skunk and and I says well I know a

3434
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:53,359
little bit about skunk and uh I I tried

3435
02:21:51,079 --> 02:21:55,719
to explain to them that I bred the first

3436
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:58,200
skunk but they didn't want to hear it

3437
02:21:55,719 --> 02:22:01,039
they wanted to sell me pineapple skunk

3438
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:02,399
which was nothing to do with skunk but

3439
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:04,960
whatever those were just those were like

3440
02:22:02,398 --> 02:22:08,799
Street dealers since then like many of

3441
02:22:04,959 --> 02:22:10,919
the actual Growers know who you are uh

3442
02:22:08,799 --> 02:22:12,519
and so that's like a a very different

3443
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:14,159
yeah those guys that used to stand on on

3444
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:15,720
the side of the road and you just drive

3445
02:22:14,159 --> 02:22:19,000
by from the airport that was kind of

3446
02:22:15,719 --> 02:22:20,719
wild times for as illegal as it was that

3447
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:23,359
they were standing there holding like

3448
02:22:20,719 --> 02:22:27,079
big Spears in their

3449
02:22:23,359 --> 02:22:29,040
hand oh love Jamaica oh 420 people

3450
02:22:27,079 --> 02:22:31,439
watching right now that's kind of a nice

3451
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:34,120
number it's been uh I do like I have

3452
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:37,000
mentioned before I plan on doing 52

3453
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:39,200
episodes of hash church this year so we

3454
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:43,000
will be very consistent if anyone has

3455
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:46,319
any ideas or wants to sort of uh you

3456
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:48,520
know have a little think tank in regards

3457
02:22:46,318 --> 02:22:52,600
to ideas and concept it does take a lot

3458
02:22:48,520 --> 02:22:54,880
of time and energy um to plan a show

3459
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:57,399
each week and it's hard to get people to

3460
02:22:54,879 --> 02:22:59,599
commit for a specific show in particular

3461
02:22:57,398 --> 02:23:02,239
but and I don't think every show should

3462
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:04,239
be that you know the Deep dive on very

3463
02:23:02,239 --> 02:23:05,959
specific subjects I do also like these

3464
02:23:04,239 --> 02:23:07,799
shows where you invite a variety of

3465
02:23:05,959 --> 02:23:10,559
people and everyone just sort of speaks

3466
02:23:07,799 --> 02:23:12,799
about whatever happens to come up in

3467
02:23:10,559 --> 02:23:14,359
conversation or in regards to what

3468
02:23:12,799 --> 02:23:16,119
they're doing or what they're looking up

3469
02:23:14,359 --> 02:23:19,239
to uh what they're going to be up to

3470
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:21,240
here in 2025 I'm happy to hear uh from

3471
02:23:19,239 --> 02:23:23,680
any of you that are in the on the panel

3472
02:23:21,239 --> 02:23:26,840
right now in regards to uh what your

3473
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:28,079
kind of 2025 plans are what you kind of

3474
02:23:26,840 --> 02:23:30,040
what you're thinking of doing a little

3475
02:23:28,079 --> 02:23:32,239
differently this year than uh maybe you

3476
02:23:30,040 --> 02:23:34,960
did last year I like to try and grow a

3477
02:23:32,239 --> 02:23:38,199
little bit each year because humans we

3478
02:23:34,959 --> 02:23:40,879
do tend to grow slowly it's not a quick

3479
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:43,000
thing with us um I'd love to hear from

3480
02:23:40,879 --> 02:23:46,358
you

3481
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:48,439
Stephen yeah I was going to say um my

3482
02:23:46,359 --> 02:23:50,159
Pivot has kind of been crazy from 2020

3483
02:23:48,439 --> 02:23:53,239
when I managed a dispensary and was

3484
02:23:50,159 --> 02:23:55,719
getting my degree um to going back to

3485
02:23:53,239 --> 02:23:59,199
working with athletes and stuff now my

3486
02:23:55,719 --> 02:24:01,438
2025 has been focused on the people who

3487
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:03,159
are going to smoke they're already here

3488
02:24:01,439 --> 02:24:04,639
like we already have their attention and

3489
02:24:03,159 --> 02:24:06,398
I think that Community knows that we

3490
02:24:04,639 --> 02:24:09,039
exist my

3491
02:24:06,398 --> 02:24:11,199
2025 is trying to find a meeting place

3492
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:13,800
for the people who will not listen to

3493
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:15,159
anything once you say the word cannabis

3494
02:24:13,799 --> 02:24:17,639
there's a group of people who once you

3495
02:24:15,159 --> 02:24:20,079
say cannabis they hear all the

3496
02:24:17,639 --> 02:24:23,000
negativity so my goal this year is to

3497
02:24:20,079 --> 02:24:25,600
talk about the endoc canabo system the

3498
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:28,680
fact that there's human and animal endoc

3499
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:31,359
canabo there's plant canabo and then

3500
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:32,920
there's synthetic canabo um so my

3501
02:24:31,359 --> 02:24:35,479
company has created a course that we're

3502
02:24:32,920 --> 02:24:38,200
marketing to the NCAA Major League

3503
02:24:35,478 --> 02:24:40,519
Baseball all the pro sports leagues and

3504
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:42,760
we're using athletes as like the target

3505
02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:44,479
audience to teach about the endoc canabo

3506
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:46,680
system because it relates to their

3507
02:24:44,478 --> 02:24:48,920
performance it relates to their diet and

3508
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:51,800
it relates to meditation and mind body

3509
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:53,318
stuff I think if we can get all of the

3510
02:24:51,799 --> 02:24:55,039
pro athletes this is why we're working

3511
02:24:53,318 --> 02:24:57,359
with Ricky Williams doing this type of

3512
02:24:55,040 --> 02:25:00,200
stuff our goal is essentially to shoot

3513
02:24:57,359 --> 02:25:02,479
this off like a flare if descheduling

3514
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:03,960
like happens it could be like a mountain

3515
02:25:02,478 --> 02:25:06,478
that crumbles and I don't want everybody

3516
02:25:03,959 --> 02:25:09,199
to feel like we have no way out to me

3517
02:25:06,478 --> 02:25:12,000
the endoc canabo system is why we like

3518
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:14,359
the [ __ ] that we like so why not educate

3519
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:16,959
people on that as a way that we'll

3520
02:25:14,359 --> 02:25:19,000
always have out you know it'll always be

3521
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:22,438
our kind of anchor so that's my

3522
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:24,600
initiative in 2025 and to be honest like

3523
02:25:22,439 --> 02:25:26,960
I think people get it I think people are

3524
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:29,159
surprised when you know they're ready to

3525
02:25:26,959 --> 02:25:31,278
talk anti-cannabis and you tell them

3526
02:25:29,159 --> 02:25:33,879
that bears you know hibernate using

3527
02:25:31,279 --> 02:25:35,600
endoc canabo when you tell when you tell

3528
02:25:33,879 --> 02:25:37,959
them those different things it takes

3529
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:40,079
them on like a totally different Journey

3530
02:25:37,959 --> 02:25:41,919
um and I you know I would invite anybody

3531
02:25:40,079 --> 02:25:43,840
to join us on this journey because it's

3532
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:46,439
not just athletes it's Fitness it's

3533
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:48,120
wellness it's mind body and I think

3534
02:25:46,439 --> 02:25:50,600
that's kind of like the whole essence of

3535
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:53,600
you know hash Church like hash is is our

3536
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:56,399
Gateway but it's a gateway to a more

3537
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:58,920
holistic uh approach as Civ you know

3538
02:25:56,398 --> 02:26:00,760
civilized people as we call ourselves so

3539
02:25:58,920 --> 02:26:03,040
yeah I'd love to have an episode where

3540
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:04,840
maybe we bring in some athletes we talk

3541
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:07,600
about the course I think people would

3542
02:26:04,840 --> 02:26:10,600
like that um it also applies to First

3543
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:12,840
Responders and Veterans too so this is I

3544
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:15,359
mean this is everybody like this is our

3545
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:17,200
people who need it most um so yeah

3546
02:26:15,359 --> 02:26:19,960
that's my 2025 pitch I think that'll be

3547
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:22,399
a dope episode oh I'm in for sure dude

3548
02:26:19,959 --> 02:26:25,559
putting top the list go ahead I

3549
02:26:22,398 --> 02:26:27,920
absolutely agree with you and uh for the

3550
02:26:25,559 --> 02:26:31,639
last four or five well at least four

3551
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:34,639
decades I've tried to reach out because

3552
02:26:31,639 --> 02:26:37,000
uh it's no use talking to the converted

3553
02:26:34,639 --> 02:26:39,879
reaching to the converted it's really a

3554
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:41,719
waste of time what you want to do is you

3555
02:26:39,879 --> 02:26:44,559
want to reach the

3556
02:26:41,719 --> 02:26:48,799
unconverted whether they're uh prison

3557
02:26:44,559 --> 02:26:51,439
guards or sheriffs or or preachers or

3558
02:26:48,799 --> 02:26:53,679
what whoever is the anti-c Canabis

3559
02:26:51,439 --> 02:26:55,880
people should be the people we're trying

3560
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:55,880
to

3561
02:26:56,520 --> 02:27:01,600
reach like that too I like that too so

3562
02:26:59,719 --> 02:27:04,879
we got to start finding a lot of those

3563
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:08,279
people and inviting them on hash church

3564
02:27:04,879 --> 02:27:09,719
that know episodes they got questions

3565
02:27:08,279 --> 02:27:11,920
they want to know where the people are

3566
02:27:09,719 --> 02:27:14,519
because what I realize is science

3567
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:17,439
doesn't change policy as a researcher I

3568
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:19,359
wish it did you know what changes policy

3569
02:27:17,439 --> 02:27:20,920
a bunch of people all knowing some

3570
02:27:19,359 --> 02:27:22,479
information that the politician doesn't

3571
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:24,279
know and they're like what are these

3572
02:27:22,478 --> 02:27:26,358
people talking about you should come to

3573
02:27:24,279 --> 02:27:28,359
this meeting and hear what's going on

3574
02:27:26,359 --> 02:27:30,479
and then they'll be now they'll be sway

3575
02:27:28,359 --> 02:27:33,600
to do something so yeah I think like

3576
02:27:30,478 --> 02:27:34,879
those people who are anti are always you

3577
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:36,439
know the people who will make the

3578
02:27:34,879 --> 02:27:39,039
biggest difference if we teach them just

3579
02:27:36,439 --> 02:27:42,200
a little bit of what we know absolutely

3580
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:44,800
Wade has his hand up uh and welcome Wade

3581
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:47,279
uh and happy New Year uh thank you

3582
02:27:44,799 --> 02:27:49,639
Marcus and uh great conversation this

3583
02:27:47,279 --> 02:27:52,200
morning I'm sorry I missed the first

3584
02:27:49,639 --> 02:27:55,278
part of the show

3585
02:27:52,200 --> 02:28:00,640
um I've been thinking

3586
02:27:55,279 --> 02:28:04,680
a I'll back up for a second my goal for

3587
02:28:00,639 --> 02:28:09,079
2025 is to learn how to ask for

3588
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:09,880
help I'm really good at giving help to

3589
02:28:09,079 --> 02:28:14,398
other

3590
02:28:09,879 --> 02:28:15,679
people but I am spectacularly bad at

3591
02:28:14,398 --> 02:28:19,119
asking for

3592
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:22,920
help and uh it occurs to me that an

3593
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:26,359
excellent topic for one of our shows

3594
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:29,200
would be the whole area of

3595
02:28:26,359 --> 02:28:32,279
compassion I mean we've got we managed

3596
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:35,800
to change the laws around cannabis

3597
02:28:32,279 --> 02:28:38,680
because of its effects on the endoc

3598
02:28:35,799 --> 02:28:41,840
canid system and for most people that

3599
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:45,880
means its effect on my health or my

3600
02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:48,000
child's health and I think there's it

3601
02:28:45,879 --> 02:28:52,039
can't hurt to

3602
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:55,318
remind everybody that uh it's the needs

3603
02:28:52,040 --> 02:29:01,000
of patients that got us where we are and

3604
02:28:55,318 --> 02:29:04,199
in too many places the uh adult use

3605
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:08,799
recreational part of the market has

3606
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:11,200
overrun uh patient access and uh it's

3607
02:29:08,799 --> 02:29:13,719
particularly an issue if you don't have

3608
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:16,640
money if you have money you can usually

3609
02:29:13,719 --> 02:29:18,719
F in a legal State you can find product

3610
02:29:16,639 --> 02:29:21,840
and buy it and maybe it's what you need

3611
02:29:18,719 --> 02:29:25,398
and works for you but it's typically not

3612
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:28,680
cheap and what we really need is um I

3613
02:29:25,398 --> 02:29:31,039
think I've heard Sam say cut cannabis

3614
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:33,520
should be as inexpensive as cut flowers

3615
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:35,720
in a grocery store and I think we could

3616
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:38,239
carry that through to the medical

3617
02:29:35,719 --> 02:29:42,278
products that we know can be made from

3618
02:29:38,239 --> 02:29:45,639
this plant and uh

3619
02:29:42,279 --> 02:29:47,239
and I'll just stop there for the moment

3620
02:29:45,639 --> 02:29:49,519
uh I certainly can think of a number of

3621
02:29:47,239 --> 02:29:52,799
folks that would uh welcome the

3622
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:55,560
opportunity to talk about their work of

3623
02:29:52,799 --> 02:29:58,478
providing cannabis products to folks who

3624
02:29:55,559 --> 02:30:01,760
need it at no cost that's always been

3625
02:29:58,478 --> 02:30:04,760
one of my things and I think it's uh a

3626
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:06,920
topic worth taking up so I'll go back to

3627
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:09,359
listening I probably have more to say

3628
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:10,040
today but right now that's all I got

3629
02:30:09,359 --> 02:30:13,159
thank

3630
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:16,120
you appreciate it Wade and uh those are

3631
02:30:13,159 --> 02:30:18,680
all great ideas from uh Stevens Sport

3632
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:21,200
Medicine Endo can avonoid athlete

3633
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:22,880
episode to Sam talking about inviting

3634
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:24,439
the other side of the argument instead

3635
02:30:22,879 --> 02:30:26,719
of preaching to the choir that would be

3636
02:30:24,439 --> 02:30:29,600
a rather intense some good episodes of

3637
02:30:26,719 --> 02:30:31,398
hash church and uh I welcome that and

3638
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:35,120
then Wade of course with a beautiful

3639
02:30:31,398 --> 02:30:37,318
idea for a show with the basis on

3640
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:41,079
passion that sort of thing that seemed

3641
02:30:37,318 --> 02:30:44,239
to be the thing that pushed cannabis

3642
02:30:41,079 --> 02:30:46,840
over the federal legalization here in

3643
02:30:44,239 --> 02:30:49,520
Canada and certainly Statewide uh

3644
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:50,680
legalization down in the US it's so

3645
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:54,120
crazy

3646
02:30:50,680 --> 02:30:57,000
that the guy who prosecuted Mark Emer in

3647
02:30:54,120 --> 02:31:00,680
Seattle Washington was the same guy who

3648
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:04,000
like spearheaded like legalization in

3649
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:06,600
that state like what a

3650
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:08,680
strange strange

3651
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:11,279
World

3652
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:16,120
compassion compassion is really

3653
02:31:11,279 --> 02:31:20,720
important uh I can remember about uh 20

3654
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:23,600
or 25 years ago when uh

3655
02:31:20,719 --> 02:31:27,599
the Attorney General excuse me the

3656
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:33,479
Surgeon General in America was about to

3657
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:37,760
be uh submitted for appointment by uh uh

3658
02:31:33,478 --> 02:31:39,438
it was from the the uh I guess it was

3659
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:42,600
from

3660
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:44,840
Clinton uh because it was from

3661
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:49,239
uh uh

3662
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:51,318
Arkansas and they invited me to come and

3663
02:31:49,239 --> 02:31:55,000
talk to her

3664
02:31:51,318 --> 02:31:57,719
before she was taken in front of the

3665
02:31:55,000 --> 02:32:01,040
Senate and the Congress for approval

3666
02:31:57,719 --> 02:32:05,679
because they were worried she had

3667
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:08,720
comeing out for uh teaching children

3668
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:13,800
masturbation instead of having sex and

3669
02:32:08,719 --> 02:32:17,039
she' come out in favor of uh teaching

3670
02:32:13,799 --> 02:32:20,799
allowing cannabis to be used in American

3671
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:22,560
medicine and uh they were worried that

3672
02:32:20,799 --> 02:32:26,519
she didn't have the science strong

3673
02:32:22,559 --> 02:32:30,318
enough so I went and talked to her cuz

3674
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:33,319
uh at the time I was really at the top

3675
02:32:30,318 --> 02:32:37,398
of the of the pyramid when it came to

3676
02:32:33,318 --> 02:32:40,760
medical cannabis and uh I went and

3677
02:32:37,398 --> 02:32:43,559
talked to her and I started to explain

3678
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:49,120
why they had sent me the Democratic

3679
02:32:43,559 --> 02:32:51,519
party had sent me from Europe and uh she

3680
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:54,200
and I says what is it that you were

3681
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:56,079
going to say when they question you and

3682
02:32:54,200 --> 02:32:58,600
I gave her a couple of hard questions

3683
02:32:56,079 --> 02:33:02,159
and she goes oh I don't care about the

3684
02:32:58,600 --> 02:33:06,000
science anywhere in there as much as

3685
02:33:02,159 --> 02:33:10,799
compassion if it helps people we have to

3686
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:12,639
be compassionate to ill people and uh it

3687
02:33:10,799 --> 02:33:16,199
it was hard for me to disagree with her

3688
02:33:12,639 --> 02:33:19,478
and I say you know what that is the best

3689
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:22,200
approach that was Joselyn Elders yeah

3690
02:33:19,478 --> 02:33:25,079
correct Johnn Elders who was a really

3691
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:30,479
nice sweet lady and uh yeah I went and

3692
02:33:25,079 --> 02:33:30,478
met her at her office in uh in

3693
02:33:31,439 --> 02:33:36,398
Arkansas oh [ __ ]

3694
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:39,398
he who's it gonna be now

3695
02:33:36,398 --> 02:33:45,559
RFK

3696
02:33:39,398 --> 02:33:47,799
or Dr Oz Dr Oz some other TV celebrity

3697
02:33:45,559 --> 02:33:50,159
that this guy is going to appoint to

3698
02:33:47,799 --> 02:33:54,959
basically be a human hanger grenade

3699
02:33:50,159 --> 02:33:58,439
inside our government I mean yeah I'm

3700
02:33:54,959 --> 02:34:00,398
very concerned about the direction that

3701
02:33:58,439 --> 02:34:02,079
our country does the US government not

3702
02:34:00,398 --> 02:34:04,478
need a hand grenade inside their

3703
02:34:02,079 --> 02:34:07,639
government right now like just out of

3704
02:34:04,478 --> 02:34:09,840
curiosity we got is about to get the

3705
02:34:07,639 --> 02:34:12,599
keys to the White House everyone just

3706
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:14,639
got a vaccine from a company that are

3707
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:16,800
serial

3708
02:34:14,639 --> 02:34:19,398
felons yeah

3709
02:34:16,799 --> 02:34:20,679
well the most powerful person in the

3710
02:34:19,398 --> 02:34:25,159
world

3711
02:34:20,680 --> 02:34:27,279
um should not be a puppet to uh

3712
02:34:25,159 --> 02:34:30,719
dictators I think it's always been that

3713
02:34:27,279 --> 02:34:32,680
way though scarily enough oh I really do

3714
02:34:30,719 --> 02:34:34,039
you don't think that the the past

3715
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:36,040
however many governments there have been

3716
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:37,640
in both of our countries have not been

3717
02:34:36,040 --> 02:34:40,840
like puppets to a

3718
02:34:37,639 --> 02:34:43,959
dictatorship no it this is a completely

3719
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:46,000
different situation than any other

3720
02:34:43,959 --> 02:34:47,000
person that's taken the realm at the

3721
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,000
White

3722
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:52,959
House you know

3723
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:54,200
well I'm hiding up here yeah yeah I mean

3724
02:34:52,959 --> 02:34:56,000
I don't want to turn this into a

3725
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:58,640
political conversation but you know this

3726
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:00,600
is the word reality that we're living in

3727
02:34:58,639 --> 02:35:03,278
but Marcus let's talk about hash Church

3728
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:05,200
episode so you know one of the things

3729
02:35:03,279 --> 02:35:07,520
that you and I have B have bannered

3730
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:09,000
about is perhaps doing a solvent you

3731
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:11,760
know we had a

3732
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:14,760
solventless episode right with Nic and

3733
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:17,760
all the you know masters of the solvent

3734
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:20,120
solventless realm you know why not do a

3735
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:23,239
solvent based

3736
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:26,079
episode right absolutely I think it be

3737
02:35:23,239 --> 02:35:28,680
pretty fun dedicated to the memory of

3738
02:35:26,079 --> 02:35:29,920
our friend Indra who's no longer with us

3739
02:35:28,680 --> 02:35:32,359
dude and

3740
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:34,840
Horatio yeah and Horatio I'm just trying

3741
02:35:32,359 --> 02:35:36,920
to think of who would make a good panel

3742
02:35:34,840 --> 02:35:39,799
for that you know I was thinking like

3743
02:35:36,920 --> 02:35:41,600
Chris Peron you know potentially getting

3744
02:35:39,799 --> 02:35:44,840
Giddy Up

3745
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:47,079
um uh you know just don't know like the

3746
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:49,159
busy be people maybe I mean there's a

3747
02:35:47,079 --> 02:35:50,920
lot of Innovations going on in solv and

3748
02:35:49,159 --> 02:35:53,559
extraction

3749
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:57,159
and um you know it's bring on

3750
02:35:53,559 --> 02:35:59,398
Murphy yeah Murphy absolutely Murphy I'm

3751
02:35:57,159 --> 02:36:01,000
so proud of Murphy you know I I met her

3752
02:35:59,398 --> 02:36:03,199
across the street from our one of our

3753
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:06,200
first dispensaries she was in the salon

3754
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:08,680
and so to see how far she's come from

3755
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:10,680
Bud tending for our shop after I pulled

3756
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:12,880
her from the salon to like just running

3757
02:36:10,680 --> 02:36:16,960
the hydrocarbon world I'm just she's

3758
02:36:12,879 --> 02:36:19,920
like one of my most pride you know proud

3759
02:36:16,959 --> 02:36:23,318
moments absolutely you you should be

3760
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:25,120
because he she is really you know I mean

3761
02:36:23,318 --> 02:36:27,039
she doesn't have a chemistry degree at

3762
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:30,079
all but I can tell you I've sat in many

3763
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:33,760
of an audience and listen to her speak

3764
02:36:30,079 --> 02:36:36,478
um everything she says is just right on

3765
02:36:33,760 --> 02:36:40,478
time I mean she does her homework she's

3766
02:36:36,478 --> 02:36:43,239
very um thorough and uh you know the the

3767
02:36:40,478 --> 02:36:46,119
quality of the the work speaks for

3768
02:36:43,239 --> 02:36:48,639
itself doesn't it I mean you could be

3769
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:50,840
the worst hash maker in the world and

3770
02:36:48,639 --> 02:36:53,559
know all about it not be able to

3771
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:56,520
translate it to somebody but when you

3772
02:36:53,559 --> 02:36:59,840
when in her wake you have basically Labs

3773
02:36:56,520 --> 02:37:03,439
that are producing high quality diamonds

3774
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:05,600
and getting the most productivity out of

3775
02:37:03,439 --> 02:37:08,600
their machines and doing so safely

3776
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:11,840
without blowing themselves up I mean

3777
02:37:08,600 --> 02:37:14,760
yeah I'd be you should

3778
02:37:11,840 --> 02:37:17,279
be&amp;d right now you know just some more

3779
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:20,079
fun different things utilizing

3780
02:37:17,279 --> 02:37:22,479
centrifuges instead of uh

3781
02:37:20,079 --> 02:37:24,000
heat and pressure if you will yeah so

3782
02:37:22,478 --> 02:37:25,799
Nick who else would be good for a

3783
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:27,760
solving you know I was thinking like

3784
02:37:25,799 --> 02:37:29,959
trying to get The Incredibles crew you

3785
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:32,760
know maybe reaching out to Derek I I'm

3786
02:37:29,959 --> 02:37:35,318
pretty good I'm in with Max and Telly

3787
02:37:32,760 --> 02:37:38,200
but who who would either way Max uh if

3788
02:37:35,318 --> 02:37:40,199
you get a hold of Max uh let him know to

3789
02:37:38,200 --> 02:37:43,319
he still owes

3790
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:47,079
me w Wait no sorry it wasn't Max it was

3791
02:37:43,318 --> 02:37:49,199
Telly Telly Telly Telly okay yeah yeah I

3792
02:37:47,079 --> 02:37:51,159
love all I probably wouldn't go there

3793
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:53,600
but who who would be good to get on a

3794
02:37:51,159 --> 02:37:56,119
hash Church panel and talk about salvin

3795
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:57,840
I mean there there was a girl there was

3796
02:37:56,120 --> 02:37:59,040
a girl by the name of I think her name

3797
02:37:57,840 --> 02:38:02,680
was

3798
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:05,200
Jacqueline she she made her own reactors

3799
02:38:02,680 --> 02:38:08,079
she was pretty I met she flew up and met

3800
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:10,920
me at my facility here she had a diamond

3801
02:38:08,079 --> 02:38:12,760
minor right yeah she I believe she has a

3802
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:15,279
degree in in

3803
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:17,719
chemistry there's a lot of good good

3804
02:38:15,279 --> 02:38:21,279
good good ones out there that I can

3805
02:38:17,719 --> 02:38:23,318
think of teaching classes and stuff you

3806
02:38:21,279 --> 02:38:26,439
would you'd mention the Busy B guys you

3807
02:38:23,318 --> 02:38:29,439
know he's a good guy Boris and them and

3808
02:38:26,439 --> 02:38:32,720
um you could bring on you know even the

3809
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:34,239
the solvent guys like you know the the

3810
02:38:32,719 --> 02:38:36,559
guys that are Distributing it like

3811
02:38:34,239 --> 02:38:39,039
solvent direct you could get them to

3812
02:38:36,559 --> 02:38:40,680
sponsor it and bring them on and you

3813
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:43,160
know some of the uh some of the

3814
02:38:40,680 --> 02:38:46,359
equipment side of things like Alex at C1

3815
02:38:43,159 --> 02:38:50,119
D1 labs and I don't know I work with all

3816
02:38:46,359 --> 02:38:53,960
of those guys very very closely um

3817
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:56,399
still to this day there's no division

3818
02:38:53,959 --> 02:38:58,239
between a lot of us hydrocarbon and

3819
02:38:56,398 --> 02:39:01,358
solventless guys even though I got it on

3820
02:38:58,239 --> 02:39:05,079
my sleeve you know I was I was thinking

3821
02:39:01,359 --> 02:39:07,600
about like like JD JD Garrick from uh

3822
02:39:05,079 --> 02:39:10,680
aluminated I mean I think their rigs are

3823
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:12,840
just about the best that are out there

3824
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:14,398
right Nick I mean I I don't know people

3825
02:39:12,840 --> 02:39:16,040
are talking really good aboutum the

3826
02:39:14,398 --> 02:39:19,879
illuminated crew and they've been doing

3827
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:23,479
a lot of rounds lately so yeah that's

3828
02:39:19,879 --> 02:39:25,679
chem Tech uh Center fuses you know for

3829
02:39:23,478 --> 02:39:28,159
separating sauce from diamonds you know

3830
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:30,800
they have the explosion proof Center

3831
02:39:28,159 --> 02:39:34,239
fuses that are used there um there's a

3832
02:39:30,799 --> 02:39:35,639
lot of invation going on there but

3833
02:39:34,239 --> 02:39:37,879
talking about playing with even the

3834
02:39:35,639 --> 02:39:39,639
solvent solventless side is we're

3835
02:39:37,879 --> 02:39:42,278
playing with centrifuges now which is a

3836
02:39:39,639 --> 02:39:43,959
trip you know separating membrane from

3837
02:39:42,279 --> 02:39:45,760
oil with

3838
02:39:43,959 --> 02:39:49,599
centrifuges that's what I was doing with

3839
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:50,760
Murphy and them yeah they they do the

3840
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:54,359
thing with

3841
02:39:50,760 --> 02:39:58,279
Ultrasonics also correct we were doing

3842
02:39:54,359 --> 02:40:02,439
it uh several decades ago with

3843
02:39:58,279 --> 02:40:05,960
Ultrasonics and alcohol and uh just

3844
02:40:02,439 --> 02:40:09,439
doing a ultrasonic shake for less than

3845
02:40:05,959 --> 02:40:12,278
one minute and what we got was just pure

3846
02:40:09,439 --> 02:40:16,880
gold I mean it was

3847
02:40:12,279 --> 02:40:19,720
amazing yeah the the the cool thing

3848
02:40:16,879 --> 02:40:21,278
85% yeah the cool thing we realized with

3849
02:40:19,719 --> 02:40:24,159
using a centrifuge rather than

3850
02:40:21,279 --> 02:40:26,439
impressing is under vacuum you know you

3851
02:40:24,159 --> 02:40:28,760
can basically utilize a lot lower

3852
02:40:26,439 --> 02:40:31,359
temperatures and control temperature

3853
02:40:28,760 --> 02:40:33,840
under vacuum utilizing the centrifuge

3854
02:40:31,359 --> 02:40:35,640
and strains like Oreos that like to me

3855
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:38,960
are one of the blandest strains out

3856
02:40:35,639 --> 02:40:42,159
there it's some crazy tpes came out of

3857
02:40:38,959 --> 02:40:43,719
pressing via centrifuge cultivars like

3858
02:40:42,159 --> 02:40:47,680
that so there's some cool you know

3859
02:40:43,719 --> 02:40:49,920
retaining volatile compounds if you will

3860
02:40:47,680 --> 02:40:51,600
with uh that technology I'm I'm

3861
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:55,279
intrigued by it I haven't really seen it

3862
02:40:51,600 --> 02:40:58,520
be viable yet but uh always future

3863
02:40:55,279 --> 02:41:00,359
playing is is what I love to do yeah so

3864
02:40:58,520 --> 02:41:02,800
I think that would be a great episode on

3865
02:41:00,359 --> 02:41:05,040
hash church right if we could get like

3866
02:41:02,799 --> 02:41:08,159
Murphy and get a few of these other

3867
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:10,520
folks on there to talk about solvent you

3868
02:41:08,159 --> 02:41:12,600
know it's solventless and solvent

3869
02:41:10,520 --> 02:41:15,560
solvent is like the ying and the yang

3870
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:16,960
right I mean it's there you know there

3871
02:41:15,559 --> 02:41:19,760
wouldn't be one without the other you

3872
02:41:16,959 --> 02:41:22,039
know like we cop a lot of what they did

3873
02:41:19,760 --> 02:41:23,920
for sure you know in the beginning it's

3874
02:41:22,040 --> 02:41:26,600
where the term even came from where the

3875
02:41:23,920 --> 02:41:28,279
term solness was I was just basically

3876
02:41:26,600 --> 02:41:30,079
copying what I was seeing in the

3877
02:41:28,279 --> 02:41:32,040
hydrocarbon world and being like well I

3878
02:41:30,079 --> 02:41:34,719
want to replicate that I want to copy

3879
02:41:32,040 --> 02:41:36,319
that um I want to make something that

3880
02:41:34,719 --> 02:41:40,599
dabs with zero

3881
02:41:36,318 --> 02:41:43,760
residue yeah and in Marcus we we have

3882
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:46,318
basically we put on hold the episode

3883
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:49,398
about the abstract Skies getting them on

3884
02:41:46,318 --> 02:41:53,000
with with Nick right we wanted to have

3885
02:41:49,398 --> 02:41:55,559
the volatile sulfur kind of I want to

3886
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:57,639
have that show I I guess that show I

3887
02:41:55,559 --> 02:41:59,799
think Nick is the gatekeeper to that

3888
02:41:57,639 --> 02:42:02,159
because it's a matter of everyone his

3889
02:41:59,799 --> 02:42:06,079
availability right well not his

3890
02:42:02,159 --> 02:42:08,119
necessarily it's his two colleagues who

3891
02:42:06,079 --> 02:42:10,200
put the equipment together that was

3892
02:42:08,120 --> 02:42:12,399
perceiving the one

3893
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:14,000
trillionth right like every time I asked

3894
02:42:12,398 --> 02:42:15,519
him to speak about that when he worked

3895
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:17,439
at yakam and chief Hops and they were

3896
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:20,040
like finding th that's when they found

3897
02:42:17,439 --> 02:42:22,960
the 1400 th and in the

3898
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:25,479
Hops um it was because of this piece of

3899
02:42:22,959 --> 02:42:28,398
equipment or it was really multiple

3900
02:42:25,478 --> 02:42:29,719
pieces of equipment kind of Jerry rigged

3901
02:42:28,398 --> 02:42:31,398
together I don't know I could be

3902
02:42:29,719 --> 02:42:34,599
completely wrong but anyway these two

3903
02:42:31,398 --> 02:42:36,358
people are the people that can speak to

3904
02:42:34,600 --> 02:42:38,559
that piece of equipment they're the ones

3905
02:42:36,359 --> 02:42:41,439
that did it and they did uh and they ran

3906
02:42:38,559 --> 02:42:44,639
it so uh he just doesn't you know want

3907
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:47,720
to speak on their behalf even though he

3908
02:42:44,639 --> 02:42:49,959
has yeah because it's like but I'd love

3909
02:42:47,719 --> 02:42:53,599
for the abstract and you and a whole you

3910
02:42:49,959 --> 02:42:56,398
know Jeremy to have there Ian Ian gives

3911
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:58,559
a great talk Marcus he he gave a talk I

3912
02:42:56,398 --> 02:43:01,398
think he gave two talks at biscon this

3913
02:42:58,559 --> 02:43:03,879
year and one of his associates twinkle

3914
02:43:01,398 --> 02:43:06,680
also spoke and you know she gives a

3915
02:43:03,879 --> 02:43:10,000
really good talk so yeah I mean this is

3916
02:43:06,680 --> 02:43:13,680
I think like The Cutting Edge

3917
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Frontier of cannabis chemistry today is

3918
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:19,279
these thols it's like we know about the

3919
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:21,359
tpin we know about the canavs the thols

3920
02:43:19,279 --> 02:43:23,920
I think are like some of the last nuts

3921
02:43:21,359 --> 02:43:27,279
to crack here and the other thing that's

3922
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:29,239
really cool about it is that you know

3923
02:43:27,279 --> 02:43:31,279
they're they're approaching this I love

3924
02:43:29,239 --> 02:43:32,079
the the word that they use they call

3925
02:43:31,279 --> 02:43:35,079
them

3926
02:43:32,079 --> 02:43:36,639
flavorants you know so I mean these are

3927
02:43:35,079 --> 02:43:37,920
flavorant and yeah would they be

3928
02:43:36,639 --> 02:43:40,519
different in

3929
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:43,200
different you know plants or different

3930
02:43:40,520 --> 02:43:45,960
fruits or different vegetables no Mother

3931
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:48,079
Nature has the same chemistry set in all

3932
02:43:45,959 --> 02:43:50,959
of her plants and all of her fruits and

3933
02:43:48,079 --> 02:43:55,200
vegetables so you know they find

3934
02:43:50,959 --> 02:43:58,599
similarities between Hops and and and

3935
02:43:55,200 --> 02:44:01,120
and cannabis but they also find some of

3936
02:43:58,600 --> 02:44:03,399
the dankness that you find in certain

3937
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:05,200
other vegetables and some of the Citrus

3938
02:44:03,398 --> 02:44:08,639
notes and some of the fruity notes I

3939
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:11,000
mean again there's lots of commonalities

3940
02:44:08,639 --> 02:44:12,959
in those chemistries and I think the

3941
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:14,799
hash Church audience would love that

3942
02:44:12,959 --> 02:44:17,839
because I think it would be a great

3943
02:44:14,799 --> 02:44:23,000
discussion to understand Again part of

3944
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:26,600
the um Artisan nature of small you know

3945
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:29,520
Artisan cannabis is the preservation of

3946
02:44:26,600 --> 02:44:31,399
those volle compounds maybe they're not

3947
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:34,399
necessarily tpin maybe they're these

3948
02:44:31,398 --> 02:44:36,680
sulfur compounds or Esters or alahh

3949
02:44:34,398 --> 02:44:39,519
Tides we don't know but these groups are

3950
02:44:36,680 --> 02:44:41,520
at basically at that Frontier cracking

3951
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:44,120
that nut and that's to me the most

3952
02:44:41,520 --> 02:44:47,520
exciting stuff going on in cannabis

3953
02:44:44,120 --> 02:44:49,680
today go ahead Laura your hand up

3954
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:53,239
especially especially

3955
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:56,880
go ahead oh oh excuse

3956
02:44:53,239 --> 02:44:59,000
Mead especially if they're uh

3957
02:44:56,879 --> 02:45:04,639
contributing to

3958
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:08,120
modulating or uh potentiating the canabo

3959
02:45:04,639 --> 02:45:10,599
then find that out we're gonna find that

3960
02:45:08,120 --> 02:45:13,079
out yeah that's really really

3961
02:45:10,600 --> 02:45:15,318
interesting to me yeah we're gonna find

3962
02:45:13,079 --> 02:45:17,079
that out that's going to be I think so

3963
02:45:15,318 --> 02:45:18,478
I'm actually going to speak with Ian

3964
02:45:17,079 --> 02:45:20,840
this week and I don't know but he's got

3965
02:45:18,478 --> 02:45:23,599
a couple projects in mind and I think

3966
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:25,398
yeah how they potentiate and modulate is

3967
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:27,318
going to be part of that discussion Sam

3968
02:45:25,398 --> 02:45:31,278
so I'll keep you posted maybe I'll reach

3969
02:45:27,318 --> 02:45:34,600
out to you between now and next

3970
02:45:31,279 --> 02:45:36,560
week Laura very interesting yeah very

3971
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:38,760
interesting I uh I want to keep that

3972
02:45:36,559 --> 02:45:40,239
rolling but I just wanted to comment on

3973
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:43,920
the the

3974
02:45:40,239 --> 02:45:46,318
episodes um Stephen just three quick

3975
02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:48,520
things um Stephen talked about the the

3976
02:45:46,318 --> 02:45:50,600
one with the athletes I would love that

3977
02:45:48,520 --> 02:45:53,239
I would love to see an array like you

3978
02:45:50,600 --> 02:45:56,680
know the kind of spread of a boxer with

3979
02:45:53,239 --> 02:45:58,959
an xgame athlete with a with a tennis

3980
02:45:56,680 --> 02:46:01,800
player with a soccer player you know

3981
02:45:58,959 --> 02:46:03,639
with a um it would be cool to see the

3982
02:46:01,799 --> 02:46:06,318
the spectrum of athletes and their

3983
02:46:03,639 --> 02:46:09,559
perspective to see them connect on that

3984
02:46:06,318 --> 02:46:12,719
and then the one um with service people

3985
02:46:09,559 --> 02:46:15,439
I would love to to for a calire person

3986
02:46:12,719 --> 02:46:17,159
to be on there talking about their grow

3987
02:46:15,439 --> 02:46:19,479
because there's a couple calfire guys

3988
02:46:17,159 --> 02:46:21,920
out here that have their own garden and

3989
02:46:19,478 --> 02:46:24,959
there's a couple people who were former

3990
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:27,239
cops you know former um deputies in the

3991
02:46:24,959 --> 02:46:29,478
area of sheriffs you know that have

3992
02:46:27,239 --> 02:46:31,359
their own grows it's like a different

3993
02:46:29,478 --> 02:46:33,239
world here the cops kind of approach it

3994
02:46:31,359 --> 02:46:36,680
differently so it'd be interesting to

3995
02:46:33,239 --> 02:46:38,799
hear that side of it and then on the um

3996
02:46:36,680 --> 02:46:42,800
hydrocarbon side of that I think that's

3997
02:46:38,799 --> 02:46:44,559
really cool um I would really you know I

3998
02:46:42,799 --> 02:46:48,438
would personally love to see some of the

3999
02:46:44,559 --> 02:46:50,680
guys from Leaf Labs Leaf Labs California

4000
02:46:48,439 --> 02:46:52,880
um they the buyb system you know their

4001
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:54,079
whole I can't speak much to it I know

4002
02:46:52,879 --> 02:46:56,199
that their whole their building is

4003
02:46:54,079 --> 02:46:57,920
basically a closed loop um you know they

4004
02:46:56,200 --> 02:46:59,240
were responsible last year they made

4005
02:46:57,920 --> 02:47:04,079
three million

4006
02:46:59,239 --> 02:47:05,680
grams of you know just just in their um

4007
02:47:04,079 --> 02:47:07,239
hydrocarbon dep Department alone like

4008
02:47:05,680 --> 02:47:09,439
they're they've been doing it for a long

4009
02:47:07,239 --> 02:47:11,959
time and there's some big producers you

4010
02:47:09,439 --> 02:47:14,720
know big shout out to Gary and Micah and

4011
02:47:11,959 --> 02:47:16,879
those guys who run the lab up there so

4012
02:47:14,719 --> 02:47:19,478
um those would be some great guys to

4013
02:47:16,879 --> 02:47:21,438
hear from I remember French you know he

4014
02:47:19,478 --> 02:47:23,438
schooled me Frenchie schooled me on you

4015
02:47:21,439 --> 02:47:26,680
know he he was talking to this group of

4016
02:47:23,439 --> 02:47:28,279
hydrocarbon guys and um you know I

4017
02:47:26,680 --> 02:47:31,279
thought Frenchie was just gonna do the

4018
02:47:28,279 --> 02:47:33,359
old you know solventless is somehow

4019
02:47:31,279 --> 02:47:35,640
Superior you know but he was like you

4020
02:47:33,359 --> 02:47:37,960
you don't even know you know he was

4021
02:47:35,639 --> 02:47:39,478
saying how that that technology is

4022
02:47:37,959 --> 02:47:41,799
precious you know it actually comes from

4023
02:47:39,478 --> 02:47:43,799
France niece France you know tpine

4024
02:47:41,799 --> 02:47:46,358
extraction is a really old ancient

4025
02:47:43,799 --> 02:47:49,398
precious art it's a very uh it's a

4026
02:47:46,359 --> 02:47:52,279
precious art to his place from niece

4027
02:47:49,398 --> 02:47:55,079
um and he I I can't say it as eloquently

4028
02:47:52,279 --> 02:47:56,960
as this gentleman did but um he really

4029
02:47:55,079 --> 02:47:59,159
schooled these he they their jaws

4030
02:47:56,959 --> 02:48:00,759
dropped to the ground just like was not

4031
02:47:59,159 --> 02:48:02,680
expecting Frenchie to say that but that

4032
02:48:00,760 --> 02:48:04,520
was that was excellent you know just

4033
02:48:02,680 --> 02:48:07,680
kind of hearing his perspective of how

4034
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:10,120
deep of a connection he has to that side

4035
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:14,079
of tpine extraction coming from the

4036
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:16,960
perfume industry from so for so long

4037
02:48:14,079 --> 02:48:19,478
ago yeah the understanding of preserving

4038
02:48:16,959 --> 02:48:22,599
those aromatic volatiles best that you

4039
02:48:19,478 --> 02:48:24,438
can it's definitely a big part of uh the

4040
02:48:22,600 --> 02:48:27,680
hash world it's

4041
02:48:24,439 --> 02:48:30,639
uh yeah I think it's why I just love

4042
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:35,920
hash over rosin every time the way the

4043
02:48:30,639 --> 02:48:35,920
glands hold in everything just seems to

4044
02:48:36,159 --> 02:48:41,799
be more preserve preserving it just it

4045
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:43,800
seems to be well it's the delivery

4046
02:48:41,799 --> 02:48:45,639
system that the plant decided to produce

4047
02:48:43,799 --> 02:48:48,318
it out of so it's like to just have it

4048
02:48:45,639 --> 02:48:49,559
in that little casing that little gland

4049
02:48:48,318 --> 02:48:51,680
head

4050
02:48:49,559 --> 02:48:54,719
I'm just uh I'm always the most excited

4051
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:56,639
about it I like Rosen and whipped and

4052
02:48:54,719 --> 02:49:00,318
reesy and sugary and all the different

4053
02:48:56,639 --> 02:49:02,799
ways Marcus you know it dawned on me too

4054
02:49:00,318 --> 02:49:05,439
as I was looking through some previous

4055
02:49:02,799 --> 02:49:09,358
episodes of hash Church from years ago

4056
02:49:05,439 --> 02:49:12,159
that maybe we should have um Jessica uh

4057
02:49:09,359 --> 02:49:15,318
back on and maybe even like a a patience

4058
02:49:12,159 --> 02:49:20,639
episode you know where we can get um

4059
02:49:15,318 --> 02:49:22,559
Wendy and and Colton on and you know um

4060
02:49:20,639 --> 02:49:26,079
see how they're doing see how these

4061
02:49:22,559 --> 02:49:28,840
patients are doing you know um we're all

4062
02:49:26,079 --> 02:49:31,680
patients in the way I

4063
02:49:28,840 --> 02:49:34,318
guess Yeah Wendy and Colton I'm just

4064
02:49:31,680 --> 02:49:36,960
taking notes while we do this I was

4065
02:49:34,318 --> 02:49:39,840
going to mention maybe maybe doing an

4066
02:49:36,959 --> 02:49:44,238
analytics episode where we do an episode

4067
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:45,920
comparing analytics and yields um from

4068
02:49:44,238 --> 02:49:49,559
different strains whether it be

4069
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:51,920
solventless or solvent-based

4070
02:49:49,559 --> 02:49:54,478
dry sift versus water hash versus

4071
02:49:51,920 --> 02:49:57,559
hydrocarbon per se I think it'd be cool

4072
02:49:54,478 --> 02:50:02,199
to bring everyone together very cool

4073
02:49:57,559 --> 02:50:02,199
conversation uh Rebecca you said

4074
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:07,920
right uh well uh you we're talking about

4075
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:14,040
the patients one again

4076
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:17,159
yeah um so uh Jessica and Jess Jess from

4077
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:21,439
Pittsburgh and Antonia her daughter and

4078
02:50:17,159 --> 02:50:24,318
um I was thinking of Forest right oh

4079
02:50:21,439 --> 02:50:26,238
Forest yeah yeah we have we haven't

4080
02:50:24,318 --> 02:50:29,760
heard from him in a while I mean Wade is

4081
02:50:26,238 --> 02:50:32,959
is there an update on those

4082
02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:34,680
folks pyramid when he came to Medical

4083
02:50:32,959 --> 02:50:39,119
canvas

4084
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:42,920
and I went and talk to her I started

4085
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:46,560
to sorry I had to mute Dr David's mic it

4086
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:48,238
was and welcome Dr David Allan uh his he

4087
02:50:46,559 --> 02:50:49,920
came in I think he had a TV on in the

4088
02:50:48,238 --> 02:50:52,959
background we just uh it was coming

4089

4091
02:50:56,439 --> 02:51:00,920
buddy so wait I had asked if if You'

4092
02:50:59,279 --> 02:51:02,560
heard from forest

4093
02:51:00,920 --> 02:51:04,879
lately

4094
02:51:02,559 --> 02:51:08,920
yes

4095
02:51:04,879 --> 02:51:11,318
um uh the short version is silus has

4096
02:51:08,920 --> 02:51:12,879
been free of

4097
02:51:11,318 --> 02:51:14,920
seizures

4098
02:51:12,879 --> 02:51:21,079
uh oh going

4099
02:51:14,920 --> 02:51:25,318
on four years now wow um he's in high

4100
02:51:21,079 --> 02:51:27,879
school um still has some challenges

4101
02:51:25,318 --> 02:51:31,238
healthwise for example

4102
02:51:27,879 --> 02:51:34,679
U uh the type of Diabetes that's

4103
02:51:31,238 --> 02:51:37,559
inherited from the genes is now a new

4104
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:39,159
threat in silas's life and it's a whole

4105
02:51:37,559 --> 02:51:41,559
another dimension about getting food

4106
02:51:39,159 --> 02:51:44,439
into it a

4107
02:51:41,559 --> 02:51:47,799
boy yeah anyway he's he's doing well

4108
02:51:44,439 --> 02:51:49,639
enough that he's as big as Forest is and

4109
02:51:47,799 --> 02:51:51,559
I don't really know any of you met

4110
02:51:49,639 --> 02:51:55,318
forest in person but he was a he's a

4111
02:51:51,559 --> 02:51:58,000
large human being and so yeah Silas his

4112
02:51:55,318 --> 02:51:59,278
physical body is doing quite well other

4113
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:02,079
than the

4114
02:51:59,279 --> 02:52:04,079
diabetes uh there is a challenge that

4115
02:52:02,079 --> 02:52:08,159
the uh

4116
02:52:04,079 --> 02:52:10,159
specific version of a plant that was

4117
02:52:08,159 --> 02:52:12,039
named medy

4118
02:52:10,159 --> 02:52:15,279
Haze

4119
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:19,319
um long story short yeah that particular

4120
02:52:15,279 --> 02:52:22,960
version of it we seem to be uh out of it

4121
02:52:19,318 --> 02:52:26,039
and uh we're getting low on the oil that

4122
02:52:22,959 --> 02:52:30,000
we made from it back in the day um and

4123
02:52:26,040 --> 02:52:32,840
so Forest has been U exploring what

4124
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:35,040
other cultivars what other versions of

4125
02:52:32,840 --> 02:52:39,000
the cannabis plant might provide that

4126
02:52:35,040 --> 02:52:42,160
exact lovely combination of chemistry

4127
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:46,639
that gave such miraculous results for

4128
02:52:42,159 --> 02:52:49,478
for stylus and I got to say that Forest

4129
02:52:46,639 --> 02:52:52,119
himself out of survival has has really

4130
02:52:49,478 --> 02:52:56,238
pulled back from any cannabis work other

4131
02:52:52,120 --> 02:52:59,279
than trying to keep silus healthy and U

4132
02:52:56,238 --> 02:53:01,559
able to go to school and whatnot so that

4133
02:52:59,279 --> 02:53:03,960
that's the report on Forest and silus

4134
02:53:01,559 --> 02:53:06,199
and I will I've spoken to Forest just

4135
02:53:03,959 --> 02:53:08,478
recently I'll ask him if he would be

4136
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:10,840
open to coming on the show and talking

4137
02:53:08,478 --> 02:53:13,559
about his experience over the last four

4138
02:53:10,840 --> 02:53:17,359
or five years be nice to catch up thanks

4139
02:53:13,559 --> 02:53:19,959
for asking the medy haze uh oil that

4140
02:53:17,359 --> 02:53:22,800
you're talking about was it analyzed for

4141
02:53:19,959 --> 02:53:27,759
tpine and canbo

4142
02:53:22,799 --> 02:53:31,879
content uh yes um we do have uh test

4143
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:35,200
results from uh different farmers of

4144
02:53:31,879 --> 02:53:39,159
that plant I I don't have any of it in

4145
02:53:35,200 --> 02:53:42,000
front of me Sam but uh yeah I I assure

4146
02:53:39,159 --> 02:53:44,359
you Forest is working on it and uh I

4147
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:47,879
will get up to speed with him on what's

4148
02:53:44,359 --> 02:53:50,439
uh what he sees as a potential benefit

4149
02:53:47,879 --> 02:53:50,438
for Sil

4150
02:53:51,478 --> 02:53:57,879
and yeah I I I would love to share that

4151
02:53:54,840 --> 02:54:00,520
information um with you

4152
02:53:57,879 --> 02:54:02,398
Sam well it's another great idea and I

4153
02:54:00,520 --> 02:54:05,880
have it in the notes here so I've got

4154
02:54:02,398 --> 02:54:09,039
one two three four five six seven eight

4155
02:54:05,879 --> 02:54:11,639
good idea for shows which just as I

4156
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:13,200
looked up and saw Dr Allen on the screen

4157
02:54:11,639 --> 02:54:15,559
I was like well there's like probably a

4158
02:54:13,200 --> 02:54:17,720
couple more we could throw in there so

4159
02:54:15,559 --> 02:54:20,079
it's good the more good ideas we come up

4160
02:54:17,719 --> 02:54:22,559
with for show the better less stress on

4161
02:54:20,079 --> 02:54:26,039
me and I can make sure we deliver

4162
02:54:22,559 --> 02:54:28,519
something positive every week for gez

4163
02:54:26,040 --> 02:54:31,439
you know the three to 400 or 500 people

4164
02:54:28,520 --> 02:54:35,920
that seem to uh want to hang out with us

4165
02:54:31,439 --> 02:54:35,920
for three to four hours on a Sunday

4166
02:54:39,719 --> 02:54:45,719
afternoon how you doing Dr Alan oh go

4167
02:54:42,559 --> 02:54:49,199
ahead Caleb oh just uh some quick uh

4168
02:54:45,719 --> 02:54:51,679
more I guess episode ideas um

4169
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:53,840
perhaps like a more music one there are

4170
02:54:51,680 --> 02:54:56,479
like rappers now that specifically rap

4171
02:54:53,840 --> 02:55:00,200
about dabbing and hash like I bet they'd

4172
02:54:56,478 --> 02:55:02,039
be an interesting talk and also um more

4173
02:55:00,200 --> 02:55:05,319
on what wolverine DZ was talking about

4174
02:55:02,040 --> 02:55:08,120
earlier um there are like a handful of

4175
02:55:05,318 --> 02:55:10,478
people who are going to wash and make

4176
02:55:08,120 --> 02:55:12,120
rosin or hash from whatever their

4177
02:55:10,478 --> 02:55:14,318
favorite cultivar is no matter what the

4178
02:55:12,120 --> 02:55:16,720
yields are and so like highlighting I

4179
02:55:14,318 --> 02:55:18,879
guess like the people who are doing that

4180
02:55:16,719 --> 02:55:21,199
with the terpinolene dominant stuff

4181
02:55:18,879 --> 02:55:23,159
the haze hashes like the Vietnamese hash

4182
02:55:21,200 --> 02:55:24,680
like Jerry with first cut Farms or

4183
02:55:23,159 --> 02:55:26,478
someone on the East Coast that also has

4184
02:55:24,680 --> 02:55:27,720
a Vietnamese hash and they're the only

4185
02:55:26,478 --> 02:55:32,199
two people I know like in the whole

4186
02:55:27,719 --> 02:55:33,959
world that do and um that type of um

4187
02:55:32,200 --> 02:55:36,520
guess episode would be interesting I

4188
02:55:33,959 --> 02:55:38,519
think and then also uh hash and food

4189
02:55:36,520 --> 02:55:42,279
pairings which is definitely like a

4190
02:55:38,520 --> 02:55:44,600
bleeding edge um with like the the chef

4191
02:55:42,279 --> 02:55:48,800
at the ganier campus Alex or the hash

4192
02:55:44,600 --> 02:55:50,439
somaler and um the food and hash fruit

4193
02:55:48,799 --> 02:55:53,278
pairings rare fruits and rare hash

4194
02:55:50,439 --> 02:55:55,600
pairings that she does um there's a lot

4195
02:55:53,279 --> 02:55:59,279
that goes there to like breaking the

4196
02:55:55,600 --> 02:56:01,000
stigma of hash for flower users or the

4197
02:55:59,279 --> 02:56:03,479
completely

4198
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:05,238
uninitiated excellent ideas and I have

4199
02:56:03,478 --> 02:56:07,358
them all down I particularly like the

4200
02:56:05,238 --> 02:56:09,600
hash and food pairing once I I did an

4201
02:56:07,359 --> 02:56:12,359
interview years ago with my friend

4202
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:15,159
merland and it was kind of in that vein

4203
02:56:12,359 --> 02:56:17,079
and it was this guy Pete Evans and he

4204
02:56:15,159 --> 02:56:18,879
seemed to be a pretty cool dude he was

4205
02:56:17,079 --> 02:56:20,760
like I guess he was pretty mainstream

4206
02:56:18,879 --> 02:56:23,639
back home but just right when I met him

4207
02:56:20,760 --> 02:56:25,600
he just was like Bo and just like took a

4208
02:56:23,639 --> 02:56:28,278
right turn in his career and became this

4209
02:56:25,600 --> 02:56:31,079
like he was like the enemy on TV in

4210
02:56:28,279 --> 02:56:33,720
Australia he was just like uh yeah I'll

4211
02:56:31,079 --> 02:56:37,200
tell you when mainstream comes after you

4212
02:56:33,719 --> 02:56:38,358
and wants to uh decimate you watch out

4213
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:40,079
because uh I think it might have

4214
02:56:38,359 --> 02:56:42,279
happened to him at least for his career

4215
02:56:40,079 --> 02:56:44,120
but he was a cool guy and it was all he

4216
02:56:42,279 --> 02:56:48,439
was a chef he had sold like I don't know

4217
02:56:44,120 --> 02:56:49,680
20 or 30 um uh cookbooks and he was was

4218
02:56:48,439 --> 02:56:52,479
quite well known he was a very

4219
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:54,760
mainstream Chef in Australia uh very

4220
02:56:52,478 --> 02:56:57,760
well known like on T their cable TV and

4221
02:56:54,760 --> 02:57:00,960
stuff and and very well known so he

4222
02:56:57,760 --> 02:57:02,600
suddenly became very uh he definitely

4223
02:57:00,959 --> 02:57:06,199
would have been speaking against the

4224
02:57:02,600 --> 02:57:08,439
covid-19 vaccine vocally right when it

4225
02:57:06,200 --> 02:57:12,479
was happening so that's uh that's who

4226
02:57:08,439 --> 02:57:15,680
Pete was God bless him how you doing Dr

4227
02:57:12,478 --> 02:57:17,840
Allen I muted you so now you have to

4228
02:57:15,680 --> 02:57:21,079
unmute yourself I can push this button

4229
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:23,040
that says ask to unmute and it might

4230
02:57:21,079 --> 02:57:25,000
bring up a button on your screen it is

4231
02:57:23,040 --> 02:57:27,000
trickier to find the mute and unmute

4232
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:28,799
button when you're on this zoom on a

4233
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:30,238
phone all right I think I got there you

4234
02:57:28,799 --> 02:57:34,000
are there you are dude how you doing

4235
02:57:30,238 --> 02:57:36,840
Happy New Year happy New Year Marcus uh

4236
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:38,559
so happy to be here I got a couple

4237
02:57:36,840 --> 02:57:41,559
things I would like to say about this

4238
02:57:38,559 --> 02:57:46,519
conversation and the first thing is

4239
02:57:41,559 --> 02:57:48,278
growing cannabis is a human right here's

4240
02:57:46,520 --> 02:57:52,520
why

4241
02:57:48,279 --> 02:57:55,800
because if you can't put it in your food

4242
02:57:52,520 --> 02:57:59,920
if it costs $10 a

4243
02:57:55,799 --> 02:58:03,959
gram so if you can't grow cannabis it

4244
02:57:59,920 --> 02:58:03,960
prevents you from using it as a

4245
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:09,120
neutraceutical and um everybody should

4246
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:12,520
know that cannabis is a

4247
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:14,160
neutraceutical and metabolic essential

4248
02:58:12,520 --> 02:58:18,159
and the reason it's a metabolic

4249
02:58:14,159 --> 02:58:19,200
essential is because if you block the CB

4250
02:58:18,159 --> 02:58:24,119
B1

4251
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:28,079
receptors sperm cannot enter the ovom so

4252
02:58:24,120 --> 02:58:32,079
it's necessary for you have an intact

4253
02:58:28,079 --> 02:58:35,639
endocannabinoid signaling system for

4254
02:58:32,079 --> 02:58:39,879
conception to occur and I call it the

4255
02:58:35,639 --> 02:58:43,318
endoc cannaboid signaling system

4256
02:58:39,879 --> 02:58:46,318
because as you know many of the

4257
02:58:43,318 --> 02:58:50,079
scientists that dis that studied

4258
02:58:46,318 --> 02:58:51,519
cannabis uh were affect by the society

4259
02:58:50,079 --> 02:58:55,398
that hated

4260
02:58:51,520 --> 02:59:00,079
cannabis and they didn't know the word

4261
02:58:55,398 --> 02:59:05,000
cannabis and so they named it the canono

4262
02:59:00,079 --> 02:59:07,799
system and it's not cannibis it's

4263
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:10,279
cannabis and that always irritated me

4264
02:59:07,799 --> 02:59:14,159
the endo and even

4265
02:59:10,279 --> 02:59:18,720
ruum called it the Endo canibano

4266
02:59:14,159 --> 02:59:22,799
system it's the I call it the endo

4267
02:59:18,719 --> 02:59:26,959
cannaboid signaling system because that

4268
02:59:22,799 --> 02:59:31,759
tells the function of it it's a chemical

4269
02:59:26,959 --> 02:59:35,278
communication system that regulates all

4270
02:59:31,760 --> 02:59:38,040
all of anatomy and

4271
02:59:35,279 --> 02:59:41,640
physiology so it's the

4272
02:59:38,040 --> 02:59:45,160
endocannabinoid signaling system thank

4273
02:59:41,639 --> 02:59:48,519
you appreciate you as always Dr Allan

4274
02:59:45,159 --> 02:59:52,600
appreciate you as always

4275
02:59:48,520 --> 02:59:54,439
very cool very cool I think uh that you

4276
02:59:52,600 --> 02:59:57,000
should definitely be in touch with

4277
02:59:54,439 --> 02:59:58,880
Stephen Philpot and with what he's doing

4278
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:02,238
with his course and stuff I think you

4279
02:59:58,879 --> 03:00:05,759
would be of good value to Stephen to uh

4280
03:00:02,238 --> 03:00:09,000
uh put put you guys uh hook us up love

4281
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:11,279
to talk to anybody to coll collaborate

4282
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:15,398
with love

4283
03:00:11,279 --> 03:00:18,359
it love it collaborate not

4284
03:00:15,398 --> 03:00:20,719
ciber it's not collate it's collabor

4285
03:00:18,359 --> 03:00:22,399
it's the endoc calibrate that was good

4286
03:00:20,719 --> 03:00:24,519
Dr Mark that was good I thought about it

4287
03:00:22,398 --> 03:00:29,079
in my head but you did

4288
03:00:24,520 --> 03:00:31,279
it you did it you Sneaky Pete um that's

4289
03:00:29,079 --> 03:00:34,680
great those are some those are some good

4290
03:00:31,279 --> 03:00:38,279
ideas for shows um can I suggest one

4291
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:41,559
more show Marcus of course I got 52 to

4292
03:00:38,279 --> 03:00:44,279
fulfill so perfect uh one thing I'd like

4293
03:00:41,559 --> 03:00:45,719
to suggest we talk about is uh cannabis

4294
03:00:44,279 --> 03:00:47,200
and mental health because I don't think

4295
03:00:45,719 --> 03:00:48,599
that that's discusted enough and I think

4296
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:51,040
for some people

4297
03:00:48,600 --> 03:00:52,880
it's been such a massive tool and key

4298
03:00:51,040 --> 03:00:54,200
for them to access their life and their

4299
03:00:52,879 --> 03:00:56,119
community that I think this would be a

4300
03:00:54,200 --> 03:00:57,680
great platform to just have one more

4301
03:00:56,120 --> 03:00:58,880
place where we can talk about this where

4302
03:00:57,680 --> 03:01:01,079
people are actually

4303
03:00:58,879 --> 03:01:03,119
listening yeah I think that's pretty

4304
03:01:01,079 --> 03:01:05,719
pretty good as well I think it's a very

4305
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:08,720
tricky one in the sense that do you go

4306
03:01:05,719 --> 03:01:11,760
the way where you only show people who

4307
03:01:08,719 --> 03:01:14,478
had good mental health um experiences

4308
03:01:11,760 --> 03:01:17,920
from it or do you also add the other

4309
03:01:14,478 --> 03:01:19,639
side of the the scope which is which

4310
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:21,879
which I only know about this cuz I had a

4311
03:01:19,639 --> 03:01:23,799
roommate who definitely was not better

4312
03:01:21,879 --> 03:01:27,079
off smoking cannabis at least to the

4313
03:01:23,799 --> 03:01:29,599
levels that he was doing it at and uh so

4314
03:01:27,079 --> 03:01:32,478
there's some people who are affected

4315
03:01:29,600 --> 03:01:34,840
negatively by their mental health from

4316
03:01:32,478 --> 03:01:36,039
from Cannabis whether it's overusing it

4317
03:01:34,840 --> 03:01:38,398
whether it's like taking High

4318
03:01:36,040 --> 03:01:40,720
concentration dabs I've only met a few

4319
03:01:38,398 --> 03:01:43,398
of them in my life but I happen to live

4320
03:01:40,719 --> 03:01:46,398
with one and knew him very very very

4321
03:01:43,398 --> 03:01:49,398
well so I certainly wasn't mixing it up

4322
03:01:46,398 --> 03:01:53,119
and I was certainly not biased to be

4323
03:01:49,398 --> 03:01:55,119
painting that picture um I tried to sort

4324
03:01:53,120 --> 03:01:57,399
of deny that picture for a long time as

4325
03:01:55,120 --> 03:02:00,120
I was quite younger but as as it was

4326
03:01:57,398 --> 03:02:02,439
undeniable at one point I sort of I

4327
03:02:00,120 --> 03:02:04,200
could see it thatth yeah not maybe not

4328
03:02:02,439 --> 03:02:05,720
for everyone Wade you've got your hand

4329
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:08,880
up go

4330
03:02:05,719 --> 03:02:13,478
ahead yeah I I want to jump in because

4331
03:02:08,879 --> 03:02:13,478
uh one of the things that I think hash

4332
03:02:16,520 --> 03:02:20,560
Church uh you

4333
03:02:18,520 --> 03:02:22,279
you hit your mute again Wade you started

4334
03:02:20,559 --> 03:02:26,920
into that and you said hash church then

4335
03:02:22,279 --> 03:02:31,720
you hit your there you go sorry uh shaky

4336
03:02:26,920 --> 03:02:34,398
hands um where was I oh I think it's one

4337
03:02:31,719 --> 03:02:39,000
of the challenges that we on hash Church

4338
03:02:34,398 --> 03:02:40,079
need to address we routinely glorify

4339
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:45,719
heroic

4340
03:02:40,079 --> 03:02:49,318
doses be it dabs or uh you know uh

4341
03:02:45,719 --> 03:02:51,559
six-star um in a in a bowl ho uh with a

4342
03:02:49,318 --> 03:02:54,159
trail of wooden matches and

4343
03:02:51,559 --> 03:02:57,318
screens uh there's a certain

4344
03:02:54,159 --> 03:03:00,200
glorification because we the panelists

4345
03:02:57,318 --> 03:03:04,238
actually have an endoc canono signaling

4346
03:03:00,200 --> 03:03:08,159
system that loves that experience that

4347
03:03:04,238 --> 03:03:10,359
feels enlivened uplifted if you will but

4348
03:03:08,159 --> 03:03:11,279
what's true is that is not the case for

4349
03:03:10,359 --> 03:03:13,559
most

4350
03:03:11,279 --> 03:03:15,760
people and when you start talking about

4351
03:03:13,559 --> 03:03:19,000
mental health and cannabis I really

4352
03:03:15,760 --> 03:03:23,359
think it's important to put into that

4353
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:26,318
conversation how do dose dependent

4354
03:03:23,359 --> 03:03:29,079
cannabis is and how you take it into

4355
03:03:26,318 --> 03:03:30,799
your body the Cannabis chemistry is

4356
03:03:29,079 --> 03:03:34,039
radically different if you're eating it

4357
03:03:30,799 --> 03:03:36,478
as versus smoking it and know that but

4358
03:03:34,040 --> 03:03:38,680
we we need to share that information is

4359
03:03:36,478 --> 03:03:42,398
my opinion and and the last thing I

4360
03:03:38,680 --> 03:03:45,238
would say is

4361
03:03:42,398 --> 03:03:47,879
um I love getting high I'll leave it at

4362
03:03:45,238 --> 03:03:51,000
that

4363
03:03:47,879 --> 03:03:53,438
so good I can't tell you how proud I am

4364
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:56,719
that you call it the endocannabinoid

4365
03:03:53,439 --> 03:03:58,439
signaling system we we should spread

4366
03:03:56,719 --> 03:04:00,438
this

4367
03:03:58,439 --> 03:04:02,318
worldwide well you know you're not the

4368
03:04:00,439 --> 03:04:05,800
only one that thinks it's important to

4369
03:04:02,318 --> 03:04:07,398
have the proper um language Chimera

4370
03:04:05,799 --> 03:04:09,519
who's not here today he is in the

4371
03:04:07,398 --> 03:04:12,519
YouTube chat or he was earlier oh no

4372
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:14,960
he's there um he's very much about like

4373
03:04:12,520 --> 03:04:17,399
making sure that we share the same

4374
03:04:14,959 --> 03:04:20,559
language that it's an accurate language

4375
03:04:17,398 --> 03:04:24,119
is that it's the properly agreed upon

4376
03:04:20,559 --> 03:04:27,639
language terminology is very correct so

4377
03:04:24,120 --> 03:04:31,120
mark two other ideas for episodes um

4378
03:04:27,639 --> 03:04:35,559
love it yeah so we we did this once

4379
03:04:31,120 --> 03:04:37,520
before we had the allom panel yep I love

4380
03:04:35,559 --> 03:04:40,318
and then did we ever pull this off

4381
03:04:37,520 --> 03:04:42,800
spouse Church did we ever do that we

4382
03:04:40,318 --> 03:04:45,680
talk we never did we never did spouse

4383
03:04:42,799 --> 03:04:47,318
chur but we weren't we if I remember

4384
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:49,680
correctly weren't you and I thinking

4385
03:04:47,318 --> 03:04:52,199
about this and we weren't going to tell

4386
03:04:49,680 --> 03:04:55,279
anybody and then all of a sudden there

4387
03:04:52,200 --> 03:04:56,680
it is yeah your wife was GNA start it my

4388
03:04:55,279 --> 03:05:00,040
wife was gonna get on we were gonna have

4389
03:04:56,680 --> 03:05:02,000
spouse Church let's see if we I think

4390
03:05:00,040 --> 03:05:04,680
that would be hilarious I'll get my wife

4391
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:06,559
she'll she'll Jo in yeah yeah but we

4392
03:05:04,680 --> 03:05:09,318
can't tell anyone it's gonna happen

4393
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:11,278
right we can't we can't Telegraph it's

4394
03:05:09,318 --> 03:05:14,439
just gota like told like 400 make it

4395
03:05:11,279 --> 03:05:17,040

miabi

4410
03:05:52,959 --> 03:05:59,839
Shields um and I think also um Dr Ethan

4412
03:05:59,840 --> 03:06:04,760

4414
03:06:04,760 --> 03:06:11,359
that'd be amazing yeah this this month

4415
03:06:08,238 --> 03:06:15,238
we should be hearing from Dr miabi as

4416
03:06:11,359 --> 03:06:18,520
well as her colleague uh Riley Dr Riley

4417
03:06:15,238 --> 03:06:20,238
I yes Dr Riley so I've been in touch

4418
03:06:18,520 --> 03:06:22,840
with both of them they're planning on

4419
03:06:20,238 --> 03:06:25,439
coming on and letting us know all about

4420
03:06:22,840 --> 03:06:27,719
their new podcast and I've also spoke to

4421
03:06:25,439 --> 03:06:30,960
them about potentially being a part of

4422
03:06:27,719 --> 03:06:34,238
uh Dr Allen and I's new show the

4423
03:06:30,959 --> 03:06:36,278
Cannabis Journal Club so it's all coming

4424
03:06:34,238 --> 03:06:39,760
together so yeah I wrote that down uh

4425
03:06:36,279 --> 03:06:41,479
for Caitlyn's show on mental health so

4426
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:43,680
you'll have to what I would suggest that

4427
03:06:41,478 --> 03:06:45,238
everyone that gave an idea like Stephen

4428
03:06:43,680 --> 03:06:48,398
who talked about sports medicine and the

4429
03:06:45,238 --> 03:06:50,959
endoc canot Cano signaling system and

4430
03:06:48,398 --> 03:06:52,519
the athletes uh Sam who talked about

4431
03:06:50,959 --> 03:06:54,398
inviting the other side of the argument

4432
03:06:52,520 --> 03:06:56,640
for some for some rather intense

4433
03:06:54,398 --> 03:06:59,398
episodes Wade with his idea for a show

4434
03:06:56,639 --> 03:07:01,358
on compassion Dr Mark came in with the

4435
03:06:59,398 --> 03:07:03,318
solvent episode well I've already been a

4436
03:07:01,359 --> 03:07:05,200
little bit on that we're creating this

4437
03:07:03,318 --> 03:07:07,600
is how it's easiest for me we create a

4438
03:07:05,200 --> 03:07:10,279
list we we create the phone numbers the

4439
03:07:07,600 --> 03:07:12,079
email contacts and then once I have

4440
03:07:10,279 --> 03:07:13,880
multiple ways of getting a hold of them

4441
03:07:12,079 --> 03:07:17,079
I can track them down and it becomes

4442
03:07:13,879 --> 03:07:18,238
fairly easy um I I think we should do a

4443
03:07:17,079 --> 03:07:21,520
solvent

4444
03:07:18,238 --> 03:07:24,920
uh less show I.E a full Mel bubble hash

4445
03:07:21,520 --> 03:07:27,120
episode um also Dr Mark which was I just

4446
03:07:24,920 --> 03:07:30,040
have it as Nick zegler the abstract

4447
03:07:27,120 --> 03:07:34,279
twinkle Nick zegler his two colleagues

4448
03:07:30,040 --> 03:07:36,560
you Jeremy Plum Chimera skunkman Sam um

4449
03:07:34,279 --> 03:07:39,040
the patient show with Wendy and Colton

4450
03:07:36,559 --> 03:07:42,079
and Jessica and Forest and other folks I

4451
03:07:39,040 --> 03:07:45,120
guess that ties into possibly similar to

4452
03:07:42,079 --> 03:07:47,079
Wade's idea for a compassion episode

4453
03:07:45,120 --> 03:07:48,319
Wolverine buds mentioned an analytics

4454
03:07:47,079 --> 03:07:50,520
episode

4455
03:07:48,318 --> 03:07:53,079
uh Caleb had a bunch of ideas music

4456
03:07:50,520 --> 03:07:54,560
rappers who sing about cannabis the

4457
03:07:53,079 --> 03:07:58,680
highlighting the people who are washing

4458
03:07:54,559 --> 03:08:01,119
tpine tpen dominant materials like the

4459
03:07:58,680 --> 03:08:03,238
real small percentage of the small

4460
03:08:01,120 --> 03:08:04,800
percentage and then hash and food

4461
03:08:03,238 --> 03:08:08,439
pairings

4462
03:08:04,799 --> 03:08:11,278
um I have a doctor show with you Dr

4463
03:08:08,439 --> 03:08:13,238
Allen um Caitlyn mentioned cannabis and

4464
03:08:11,279 --> 03:08:15,800
mental health positive and negative

4465
03:08:13,238 --> 03:08:18,159
sides of cannabis use I added Dr miabi

4466
03:08:15,799 --> 03:08:21,679
she and and uh uh

4467
03:08:18,159 --> 03:08:24,238
Dr Ethan Russo there as well um Dr Mark

4468
03:08:21,680 --> 03:08:26,159
mentioned the allom panel and Dr Mark

4469
03:08:24,238 --> 03:08:28,079
also mentioned spouse Church which is

4470
03:08:26,159 --> 03:08:29,840
pretty pretty hilarious so there's a

4471
03:08:28,079 --> 03:08:31,959
bunch of ideas that those of you that

4472
03:08:29,840 --> 03:08:34,639
are watching right now the 400 all right

4473
03:08:31,959 --> 03:08:39,039
Mark I have an idea please

4474
03:08:34,639 --> 03:08:42,000
please uh many anti-cannabis people come

4475
03:08:39,040 --> 03:08:46,160
up to me and one of the first thing they

4476
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:47,920
say is uh cannabis is associated with

4477
03:08:46,159 --> 03:08:52,238
schizophrenia

4478
03:08:47,920 --> 03:08:55,000
H and um you know there's no studies

4479
03:08:52,238 --> 03:08:57,439
that proved a direct correlation but but

4480
03:08:55,000 --> 03:09:00,040
here's some some information for

4481
03:08:57,439 --> 03:09:03,840
people people have been smoking cannabis

4482
03:09:00,040 --> 03:09:08,000
for hundreds of years and the incident

4483
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:10,840
of schizophrenia is the same in every

4484
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:15,600
country all over the

4485
03:09:10,840 --> 03:09:21,079
world uh and uh the incidence of

4486
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:23,720
cannabis use has skyrocketed since the

4487
03:09:21,079 --> 03:09:26,600
50s and if

4488
03:09:23,719 --> 03:09:28,000
schizophrenia was directly associated

4489
03:09:26,600 --> 03:09:31,318
with cannabis

4490
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:34,680
use then there should be a massive

4491
03:09:31,318 --> 03:09:38,639
increase in schizophrenia since the

4492
03:09:34,680 --> 03:09:38,639
1950s which has not

4493
03:09:38,799 --> 03:09:45,959
occurred now does that mean that's

4494
03:09:42,920 --> 03:09:51,000
delative that there's no correlation at

4495
03:09:45,959 --> 03:09:52,639
all uh no it doesn't but uh people that

4496
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:55,879
are in mental

4497
03:09:52,639 --> 03:09:58,760
trouble use cannabis because it calms

4498
03:09:55,879 --> 03:10:01,719
them down and so you would expect

4499
03:09:58,760 --> 03:10:04,238
schizophrenia people to be using

4500
03:10:01,719 --> 03:10:07,119
cannabis at a little bit higher rate

4501
03:10:04,238 --> 03:10:09,439
than the average person but there should

4502
03:10:07,120 --> 03:10:12,120
be schizophrenics everywhere and the

4503
03:10:09,439 --> 03:10:16,279
same thing about

4504
03:10:12,120 --> 03:10:19,520
driving um they they associate cannabis

4505
03:10:16,279 --> 03:10:23,760
with B bad driving habits but there's a

4506
03:10:19,520 --> 03:10:27,079
US patent on or there's a study on this

4507
03:10:23,760 --> 03:10:27,079
it's called

4508
03:10:27,959 --> 03:10:34,559
Uh

4509
03:10:29,719 --> 03:10:38,398
uh driving habits Under the Influence or

4510
03:10:34,559 --> 03:10:40,079
SE it's called sexual differences in the

4511
03:10:38,398 --> 03:10:45,398
driving

4512
03:10:40,079 --> 03:10:48,920
performance of people are using cannabis

4513
03:10:45,398 --> 03:10:51,238
and what they did was this was NIH study

4514
03:10:48,920 --> 03:10:52,760
National Institute of Health and what

4515
03:10:51,238 --> 03:10:55,079
they did was they took people and they

4516
03:10:52,760 --> 03:10:58,359
put them on driving

4517
03:10:55,079 --> 03:11:01,039
simulators and they they would put like

4518
03:10:58,359 --> 03:11:03,840
animals driving out in front of them and

4519
03:11:01,040 --> 03:11:06,080
they would test their reaction times and

4520
03:11:03,840 --> 03:11:09,279
their amount of Crash

4521
03:11:06,079 --> 03:11:13,439
avoidance and uh you have to kind of

4522
03:11:09,279 --> 03:11:15,880
look through the whole study to really

4523
03:11:13,439 --> 03:11:19,600
delineate what what's really going on

4524
03:11:15,879 --> 03:11:21,278
because these summary is a a government

4525
03:11:19,600 --> 03:11:23,960
summary and they're not going to say

4526
03:11:21,279 --> 03:11:27,238
okay it's it's safe to use cannabis but

4527
03:11:23,959 --> 03:11:31,318
if you read the tables especially table

4528
03:11:27,238 --> 03:11:33,959
two it proves that women uh what they

4529
03:11:31,318 --> 03:11:36,119
did was they they give them cannabis and

4530
03:11:33,959 --> 03:11:38,079
examine them and then they would or they

4531
03:11:36,120 --> 03:11:40,479
let them do it first without cannabis

4532
03:11:38,079 --> 03:11:43,559
and then they would let them do it after

4533
03:11:40,478 --> 03:11:48,278
smoking cannabus and women had no

4534
03:11:43,559 --> 03:11:49,639
difference in in reaction time time or

4535
03:11:48,279 --> 03:11:54,640
crash

4536
03:11:49,639 --> 03:11:58,599
avoidance but men had 1.1 seconds faster

4537
03:11:54,639 --> 03:12:00,000
reaction time and three times better

4538
03:11:58,600 --> 03:12:03,200
crash

4539
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:06,719
avoidance so now this isn't a definitive

4540
03:12:03,200 --> 03:12:09,079
study that shows everything but on some

4541
03:12:06,719 --> 03:12:12,519
studies apparently even government

4542
03:12:09,079 --> 03:12:15,719
studies it shows that you are no worse a

4543
03:12:12,520 --> 03:12:18,238
driver when you're smoking and maybe

4544
03:12:15,719 --> 03:12:21,559
even safer driver

4545
03:12:18,238 --> 03:12:23,920
uh when you're smoking cannabis but you

4546
03:12:21,559 --> 03:12:26,959
can't just look at the summary you have

4547
03:12:23,920 --> 03:12:29,040
to look at the the charts to determine

4548
03:12:26,959 --> 03:12:32,719
what I just

4549
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:34,840
said I love it just coming out of left

4550
03:12:32,719 --> 03:12:38,278
field constantly with all the most

4551
03:12:34,840 --> 03:12:39,799
random awesome [ __ ] thank you Dr Allen

4552
03:12:38,279 --> 03:12:41,319
for sharing that that's pretty cool

4553
03:12:39,799 --> 03:12:43,719
there's a lot of studies you know in the

4554
03:12:41,318 --> 03:12:47,159
last you know five years regarding you

4555
03:12:43,719 --> 03:12:49,679
know safety and uh you know travel in in

4556
03:12:47,159 --> 03:12:51,439
vehicles but of course the NTSB and

4557
03:12:49,680 --> 03:12:53,159
others have buried these studies because

4558
03:12:51,439 --> 03:12:55,479
they don't necessarily want this

4559
03:12:53,159 --> 03:12:58,159
information out but if you actually do

4560
03:12:55,478 --> 03:13:00,039
do a Google search on it you will find

4561
03:12:58,159 --> 03:13:01,840
quite a few different studies in

4562
03:13:00,040 --> 03:13:04,760
different countries regarding cannabis

4563
03:13:01,840 --> 03:13:07,000
use and driving uh we of course uh here

4564
03:13:04,760 --> 03:13:08,920
in America we are dealing with you know

4565
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:12,600
the insurance institutes are still

4566
03:13:08,920 --> 03:13:15,238
trying to find a pathology or a way to

4567
03:13:12,600 --> 03:13:18,479
test for how high you are right because

4568
03:13:15,238 --> 03:13:20,879
there is actually no test to figure out

4569
03:13:18,478 --> 03:13:23,119
if you are intoxicated regarding

4570
03:13:20,879 --> 03:13:25,839
cannabis there is tests regarding right

4571
03:13:23,120 --> 03:13:28,279
how alcohol is done but currently the

4572
03:13:25,840 --> 03:13:29,960
only way to know you know you can do a

4573
03:13:28,279 --> 03:13:32,238
blood test and tell there's cannabis in

4574
03:13:29,959 --> 03:13:35,039
your system but that can stay up to 40

4575
03:13:32,238 --> 03:13:37,760
plus days depending on your usage Etc

4576
03:13:35,040 --> 03:13:40,600
but there is no definitive test that

4577
03:13:37,760 --> 03:13:42,680
proves cannabis impairment at this time

4578
03:13:40,600 --> 03:13:45,318
scientifically and I think this is what

4579
03:13:42,680 --> 03:13:47,559
a lot of us have found anecdotally from

4580
03:13:45,318 --> 03:13:50,519
our own experiences from using cannabis

4581
03:13:47,559 --> 03:13:52,398
and driving um but it's fascinating that

4582
03:13:50,520 --> 03:13:55,319
science is you know caught up to the

4583
03:13:52,398 --> 03:13:58,559
anecdotal discussions as well so I mean

4584
03:13:55,318 --> 03:14:00,199
you could do a deeper dive on you know

4585
03:13:58,559 --> 03:14:01,920
some of those studies regarding in

4586
03:14:00,200 --> 03:14:03,359
countries because there there's European

4587
03:14:01,920 --> 03:14:05,200
countries in the EU have done these

4588
03:14:03,359 --> 03:14:07,680
studies as well and they have proven

4589
03:14:05,200 --> 03:14:10,880
exactly what Dr Allen has stated is that

4590
03:14:07,680 --> 03:14:14,520
the uh the Cannabis drivers are

4591
03:14:10,879 --> 03:14:17,719
sometimes safer than non-cannabis

4592
03:14:14,520 --> 03:14:21,079
users well the same person not using

4593
03:14:17,719 --> 03:14:24,318
cannabis right correct in

4594
03:14:21,079 --> 03:14:28,039
addition there's probably a major

4595
03:14:24,318 --> 03:14:31,719
difference between chronic users who are

4596
03:14:28,040 --> 03:14:31,720
experienced and new

4597
03:14:33,520 --> 03:14:39,279
users so uh Stephen you just said that

4598
03:14:36,478 --> 03:14:42,159
we all metabolize cannaboids differently

4599
03:14:39,279 --> 03:14:44,720
so they'll never be able to find a test

4600
03:14:42,159 --> 03:14:47,600
that will be able to single shot is what

4601
03:14:44,719 --> 03:14:49,719
your science is telling us

4602
03:14:47,600 --> 03:14:49,720
I

4603
03:14:50,639 --> 03:14:57,680
me if you understand why the blood

4604
03:14:54,879 --> 03:15:00,079
alcohol content work it's because we

4605
03:14:57,680 --> 03:15:02,720
understand how alcohol is metabolized by

4606
03:15:00,079 --> 03:15:04,238
the liver we know that consistently

4607
03:15:02,719 --> 03:15:06,559
enough to go if you have this much

4608
03:15:04,238 --> 03:15:08,840
alcohol in your blood we're GNA consider

4609
03:15:06,559 --> 03:15:11,680
that impaired or intoxicated that

4610
03:15:08,840 --> 03:15:13,799
doesn't exist for cannabis and to me you

4611
03:15:11,680 --> 03:15:16,000
would be trying to like shoot a moving

4612
03:15:13,799 --> 03:15:18,119
Target you know that's like in space

4613
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:20,680
trying to do something crazy like

4614
03:15:18,120 --> 03:15:23,620
that and the officer would have to ask

4615
03:15:20,680 --> 03:15:24,880
you are you a chronic user or a

4616
03:15:23,620 --> 03:15:27,239
[Laughter]

4617
03:15:24,879 --> 03:15:29,639
newbie yeah there's just so many factors

4618
03:15:27,238 --> 03:15:31,959
that play into it and then like even the

4619
03:15:29,639 --> 03:15:33,959
medical use you know I'm like hey what

4620
03:15:31,959 --> 03:15:36,039
about the person who has Parkinson's who

4621
03:15:33,959 --> 03:15:39,639
consumes cannabis to actually stop their

4622
03:15:36,040 --> 03:15:41,800
trimmers are they then safer when their

4623
03:15:39,639 --> 03:15:43,398
system is now being regulated but they

4624
03:15:41,799 --> 03:15:45,198
have it in their see what I'm saying the

4625
03:15:43,398 --> 03:15:47,519
cannaboids don't actually equal

4626
03:15:45,199 --> 03:15:50,640
impairment all the time some sometimes

4627
03:15:47,520 --> 03:15:54,079
there there's a net increase in

4628
03:15:50,639 --> 03:15:57,639
function I think uh Dr Zachary Walsh

4629
03:15:54,079 --> 03:15:59,879
who's based out of ubco he did um I

4630
03:15:57,639 --> 03:16:02,959
remember back in 2018 I want to say that

4631
03:15:59,879 --> 03:16:04,959
he was doing some research into cannabis

4632
03:16:02,959 --> 03:16:07,119
use and driving and just like you guys

4633
03:16:04,959 --> 03:16:09,159
are saying back then he was

4634
03:16:07,120 --> 03:16:11,600
communicating exactly the same point

4635
03:16:09,159 --> 03:16:13,318
that it's very individualistic as well

4636
03:16:11,600 --> 03:16:15,439
as someone who's new to it versus

4637
03:16:13,318 --> 03:16:17,238
someone who's experienced with cannabis

4638
03:16:15,439 --> 03:16:19,559
would have different you know potential

4639
03:16:17,238 --> 03:16:22,520
levels of impairment and so ultimately

4640
03:16:19,559 --> 03:16:24,398
it's problematic to try to uh create

4641
03:16:22,520 --> 03:16:27,000
like a standard protocol whereas with

4642
03:16:24,398 --> 03:16:29,639
alcohol you know blood alcohol content

4643
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:32,199
is relative to how much alcohol is in

4644
03:16:29,639 --> 03:16:33,599
you I mean if you're bigger small maybe

4645
03:16:32,199 --> 03:16:35,279
if you're a bigger person you can have a

4646
03:16:33,600 --> 03:16:37,079
bit more alcohol if you're smaller you

4647
03:16:35,279 --> 03:16:39,120
could you less would put you over the

4648
03:16:37,079 --> 03:16:41,120
limit but with cannabis it doesn't

4649
03:16:39,120 --> 03:16:43,000
really work in the same way they're

4650
03:16:41,120 --> 03:16:45,520
they're missing the point this is how

4651
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:47,959
they should be doing the study it

4652
03:16:45,520 --> 03:16:50,079
doesn't matter what you think how well

4653
03:16:47,959 --> 03:16:53,238
someone reacts or doesn't react the

4654
03:16:50,079 --> 03:16:56,279
study should be about this you give keys

4655
03:16:53,238 --> 03:16:58,159
to a person who hasn't consumed cannabis

4656
03:16:56,279 --> 03:17:01,479
and they jump in the car and they drive

4657
03:16:58,159 --> 03:17:04,398
away then you get that same person high

4658
03:17:01,478 --> 03:17:06,438
on cannabis maybe uncomfortably high and

4659
03:17:04,398 --> 03:17:08,959
guess what none of them will take those

4660
03:17:06,439 --> 03:17:10,760
keys and get in a car and drive that's

4661
03:17:08,959 --> 03:17:14,000
the difference it has from alcohol right

4662
03:17:10,760 --> 03:17:17,279
away that's the study because alcohol

4663
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:19,318
inhibits you know you're like oh oh yeah

4664
03:17:17,279 --> 03:17:21,840
like I can do it it's like Dunning

4665
03:17:19,318 --> 03:17:24,680
Krueger alcohol is like Dunning Krueger

4666
03:17:21,840 --> 03:17:26,880
on crack it's like steroid Dunning

4667
03:17:24,680 --> 03:17:29,720
Kruger you're just like I'm so [ __ ]

4668
03:17:26,879 --> 03:17:32,959
good I'm [ __ ] I'll be okay to drive

4669
03:17:29,719 --> 03:17:35,159
cannabis is like Humble Pie I just got

4670
03:17:32,959 --> 03:17:37,079
higher than I want to be and 100% of

4671
03:17:35,159 --> 03:17:39,238
people would be like I don't want to

4672
03:17:37,079 --> 03:17:41,279
drive right now I I'm that's an

4673
03:17:39,238 --> 03:17:44,198
excellent point it's

4674
03:17:41,279 --> 03:17:47,319
a Canabis has its own

4675
03:17:44,199 --> 03:17:50,920
Governor I especially you know if you

4676
03:17:47,318 --> 03:17:54,398
smoke cannabis I don't want to drive I

4677
03:17:50,920 --> 03:17:55,879
I'll find something else to do and so

4678
03:17:54,398 --> 03:17:58,519
it's it's

4679
03:17:55,879 --> 03:18:00,920
actually its own Governor it prevents

4680
03:17:58,520 --> 03:18:03,319
you from going out and being crazy

4681
03:18:00,920 --> 03:18:04,600
correct I saw it time and time again

4682
03:18:03,318 --> 03:18:06,639
mainly because I guess I was

4683
03:18:04,600 --> 03:18:09,720
experimenting with these super high

4684
03:18:06,639 --> 03:18:12,358
percentage and quality and Purity uh

4685
03:18:09,719 --> 03:18:14,278
extracts so everyone I was around me was

4686
03:18:12,359 --> 03:18:15,760
kind of getting exposed to this stuff

4687
03:18:14,279 --> 03:18:19,199
sometimes unwittingly where they would

4688
03:18:15,760 --> 03:18:21,000
just be like whoa was really strong and

4689
03:18:19,199 --> 03:18:22,560
people would go and get in their they'd

4690
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:23,840
follow all the steps that they were

4691
03:18:22,559 --> 03:18:25,760
going to do but then they get in their

4692
03:18:23,840 --> 03:18:27,398
car and they would just sit out in front

4693
03:18:25,760 --> 03:18:31,000
of my house or maybe down the street at

4694
03:18:27,398 --> 03:18:33,799
the stop sign very but very close this

4695
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:35,318
was like 25 to 35 years ago and they

4696
03:18:33,799 --> 03:18:37,519
would just sit there and then I'd kind

4697
03:18:35,318 --> 03:18:38,920
of realize and be like hey like I don't

4698
03:18:37,520 --> 03:18:40,960
can't be sitting up in front of my house

4699
03:18:38,920 --> 03:18:42,398
man that's a Heat score right get in my

4700
03:18:40,959 --> 03:18:44,879
house so I bring them in the house and

4701
03:18:42,398 --> 03:18:46,799
then just be like wow like that's so

4702
03:18:44,879 --> 03:18:49,559
interesting if they left my house

4703
03:18:46,799 --> 03:18:52,079
hammered like Beyond drunk like barely

4704
03:18:49,559 --> 03:18:55,760
able to make it to their car they would

4705
03:18:52,079 --> 03:18:57,959
for sure drive like for sure they would

4706
03:18:55,760 --> 03:19:00,600
think that is an absolutely great idea

4707
03:18:57,959 --> 03:19:03,519
so Dunning Krueger should do some

4708
03:19:00,600 --> 03:19:06,479
alcohol uh uh tests because there's

4709
03:19:03,520 --> 03:19:08,560
something to be said uh for that you

4710
03:19:06,478 --> 03:19:10,398
know that that weird mentality where you

4711
03:19:08,559 --> 03:19:13,519
think you're better at something or more

4712
03:19:10,398 --> 03:19:16,318
capable of something in a in a mindset

4713
03:19:13,520 --> 03:19:17,600
that you absolutely are not brave and

4714
03:19:16,318 --> 03:19:19,278
crazy

4715
03:19:17,600 --> 03:19:23,079
yeah Brave and Crazy I'll tell you

4716
03:19:19,279 --> 03:19:23,079
that's uh liquid

4717
03:19:23,159 --> 03:19:27,840
courage she might be right about the dun

4718
03:19:25,318 --> 03:19:30,639
and Krueger thing though because it's a

4719
03:19:27,840 --> 03:19:32,520
knowledge to confidence curve and the

4720
03:19:30,639 --> 03:19:35,119
the less knowledge you have the higher

4721
03:19:32,520 --> 03:19:38,238
your confidence is but the moment you

4722
03:19:35,120 --> 03:19:40,760
get but the moment you get 1% more piece

4723
03:19:38,238 --> 03:19:43,318
of information your confidence

4724
03:19:40,760 --> 03:19:46,960
drops so the less information you have

4725
03:19:43,318 --> 03:19:49,198
the more confident you will remain

4726
03:19:46,959 --> 03:19:49,198
that's

4727
03:19:49,238 --> 03:19:55,359
terrifying and there's no such thing as

4728
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:58,079
an expert in the endoc cannaboid

4729
03:19:55,359 --> 03:20:01,079
signaling system because we're in the

4730
03:19:58,079 --> 03:20:04,439
infancy of this science because the

4731
03:20:01,079 --> 03:20:09,398
science has been re repressed by

4732
03:20:04,439 --> 03:20:13,279
law for 40 years or more and no one

4733
03:20:09,398 --> 03:20:16,760
knows everything and my advice to you is

4734
03:20:13,279 --> 03:20:18,520
if anybody says I'm a

4735
03:20:16,760 --> 03:20:21,279
I'm an expert

4736
03:20:18,520 --> 03:20:23,079
grower uh be careful because they may

4737
03:20:21,279 --> 03:20:26,520
not

4738
03:20:23,079 --> 03:20:28,559
be yeah it's a dangerous uh uh well it

4739
03:20:26,520 --> 03:20:30,960
was like uh the the great debate of

4740
03:20:28,559 --> 03:20:34,198
LeBron James and Michael Jordan Michael

4741
03:20:30,959 --> 03:20:37,559
Jordan never ever ever in the days

4742
03:20:34,199 --> 03:20:39,800
called himself like the the greatest to

4743
03:20:37,559 --> 03:20:41,600
ever play the game it's other people do

4744
03:20:39,799 --> 03:20:43,119
that if you have other people saying

4745
03:20:41,600 --> 03:20:45,559
that for you then great you know they

4746
03:20:43,120 --> 03:20:47,720
can they can do that if they like but uh

4747
03:20:45,559 --> 03:20:49,600
if you're saying it yourself like I I

4748
03:20:47,719 --> 03:20:52,079
remember when when Sam andai started

4749
03:20:49,600 --> 03:20:53,640
Legends of hash and people would like I

4750
03:20:52,079 --> 03:20:55,199
can't remember where I first saw it but

4751
03:20:53,639 --> 03:20:57,439
it were these attacks like those guys

4752
03:20:55,199 --> 03:21:00,239
are so full of themselves they think

4753
03:20:57,439 --> 03:21:01,680
they're Legends of hash and Sam and I

4754
03:21:00,238 --> 03:21:04,600
were like what the [ __ ] is this guy

4755
03:21:01,680 --> 03:21:07,398
talking about like we're we we CBR

4756
03:21:04,600 --> 03:21:12,120
Growers we were they're Master baiters

4757
03:21:07,398 --> 03:21:14,840
they uh they we were selling the idea of

4758
03:21:12,120 --> 03:21:16,920
like appreciating hash being a hash

4759
03:21:14,840 --> 03:21:19,159
effici a that was really what Legends

4760
03:21:16,920 --> 03:21:22,559
was about and then we would we would

4761
03:21:19,159 --> 03:21:24,639
sort of promote for the evening a legend

4762
03:21:22,559 --> 03:21:26,799
like one year it was The Gardens of

4763
03:21:24,639 --> 03:21:29,318
kafur which Sam was talking about

4764
03:21:26,799 --> 03:21:32,559
earlier but it was also different like

4765
03:21:29,318 --> 03:21:34,959
sort of uh characters in hashish

4766
03:21:32,559 --> 03:21:38,799
cultures uh over the years that we would

4767
03:21:34,959 --> 03:21:40,959
celebrate leg H City HTI that's right we

4768
03:21:38,799 --> 03:21:42,799
we we we celebrated him one year there

4769
03:21:40,959 --> 03:21:45,398
was a whole variety of them that we did

4770
03:21:42,799 --> 03:21:47,559
over the 13 years that we did it in

4771
03:21:45,398 --> 03:21:51,079
Amsterdam

4772
03:21:47,559 --> 03:21:52,680
babaou babaou was another one absolutely

4773
03:21:51,079 --> 03:21:54,639
these are great and when you came and

4774
03:21:52,680 --> 03:21:57,159
sat down at the Legends of hash dinner

4775
03:21:54,639 --> 03:21:59,879
there'd be a little folded out piece of

4776
03:21:57,159 --> 03:22:02,199
paper for you that would uh that would

4777
03:21:59,879 --> 03:22:04,959
have this storyline on who we were

4778
03:22:02,199 --> 03:22:09,560
celebrating that year at the Legends of

4779
03:22:04,959 --> 03:22:12,519
hash so no we never were celebrating

4780
03:22:09,559 --> 03:22:15,879
ourselves bring back the real Legends

4781
03:22:12,520 --> 03:22:19,359
that's right dude bring it back the

4782
03:22:15,879 --> 03:22:21,920
original game aners bring it back it was

4783
03:22:19,359 --> 03:22:23,559
a small special little event you know

4784
03:22:21,920 --> 03:22:25,559
it' be fun to get a lot of those people

4785
03:22:23,559 --> 03:22:28,519
in a room together again one day because

4786
03:22:25,559 --> 03:22:30,519
that was uh that was quite an experience

4787
03:22:28,520 --> 03:22:31,840
those old Amsterdam days who would have

4788
03:22:30,520 --> 03:22:34,720
known that those would have been the

4789
03:22:31,840 --> 03:22:37,199
days I would have never guessed that

4790
03:22:34,719 --> 03:22:40,398
Amsterdam would change so drastically in

4791
03:22:37,199 --> 03:22:40,399
regards to how it viewed

4792
03:22:40,959 --> 03:22:48,079
cannabis you surprised me didn't that

4793
03:22:44,520 --> 03:22:48,079
surprise you Sam

4794
03:22:51,318 --> 03:22:57,000
did you just ask me a question yeah I

4795
03:22:53,959 --> 03:22:59,839
was wondering if it surprised you at how

4796
03:22:57,000 --> 03:23:02,079
Holland the Netherlands perspective on

4797
03:22:59,840 --> 03:23:06,960
cannabis changed I moved to the

4798
03:23:02,079 --> 03:23:13,359
Netherlands after visiting it in 84 and

4799
03:23:06,959 --> 03:23:17,000
85 I moved here uh today it's completely

4800
03:23:13,359 --> 03:23:20,079
changed uh for example

4801
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:25,520
we were driving down the the

4802
03:23:20,079 --> 03:23:27,478
freeway and uh my friend Rob was smoking

4803
03:23:25,520 --> 03:23:31,960
a big giant

4804
03:23:27,478 --> 03:23:36,679
Reaper and uh we pulled a cop pulled up

4805
03:23:31,959 --> 03:23:40,438
next to us and uh pointed his finger at

4806
03:23:36,680 --> 03:23:43,439
Rob when we were driving and

4807
03:23:40,439 --> 03:23:46,040
uh he he freaked out you know he was

4808
03:23:43,439 --> 03:23:47,398
going to eat the joint or do something

4809
03:23:46,040 --> 03:23:52,160
stupid

4810
03:23:47,398 --> 03:23:56,439
and uh the the cop sh shook his finger

4811
03:23:52,159 --> 03:23:59,520
back and forth and pointed to seat belt

4812
03:23:56,439 --> 03:24:01,880
Rob didn't have a seat belt on oh my God

4813
03:23:59,520 --> 03:24:05,560
so

4814
03:24:01,879 --> 03:24:07,438
uh once he did that the cop drove up and

4815
03:24:05,559 --> 03:24:10,478
said

4816
03:24:07,439 --> 03:24:12,040
goodbye wow so that's good that's that's

4817
03:24:10,478 --> 03:24:15,358
the way you want

4818
03:24:12,040 --> 03:24:19,600
it but today that's not how it

4819
03:24:15,359 --> 03:24:21,760
is absolutely give you uh driving well

4820
03:24:19,600 --> 03:24:25,439
intoxicated and take your license away

4821
03:24:21,760 --> 03:24:29,600
for a period of time it's a

4822
03:24:25,439 --> 03:24:33,199
real real you don't want to be pulled

4823
03:24:29,600 --> 03:24:35,520
over smoking while you're driving or

4824
03:24:33,199 --> 03:24:37,439
under the

4825
03:24:35,520 --> 03:24:40,479
intoxication yeah it's easy enough for

4826
03:24:37,439 --> 03:24:42,639
me to avoid I love puffing but I don't

4827
03:24:40,478 --> 03:24:44,559
have to be puffing the entire time I'm

4828
03:24:42,639 --> 03:24:47,639
driving in a car it's like you could

4829
03:24:44,559 --> 03:24:49,559
just have a giant session way before and

4830
03:24:47,639 --> 03:24:52,519
get your get get whatever you need to

4831
03:24:49,559 --> 03:24:53,760
get out of the plant but uh that's

4832
03:24:52,520 --> 03:24:56,960
that's not one we're going to be

4833
03:24:53,760 --> 03:24:59,600
changing the minds of many on anytime

4834
03:24:56,959 --> 03:25:01,238
soon I think personally I don't think

4835
03:24:59,600 --> 03:25:03,159
there should really have to be a test

4836
03:25:01,238 --> 03:25:05,398
it's like if it's an intoxication

4837
03:25:03,159 --> 03:25:07,680
whether it's a pharmaceutical or alcohol

4838
03:25:05,398 --> 03:25:10,358
or even someone that for whatever reason

4839
03:25:07,680 --> 03:25:13,159
was legitimately unable to drive

4840
03:25:10,359 --> 03:25:14,960
properly on cannabis if you're like a

4841
03:25:13,159 --> 03:25:16,600
police officer you should be trained at

4842
03:25:14,959 --> 03:25:18,559
least to recognize what being being

4843
03:25:16,600 --> 03:25:19,680
intoxicated looks like it doesn't mean

4844
03:25:18,559 --> 03:25:22,478
you have to

4845
03:25:19,680 --> 03:25:23,520
identify what they're intoxicated on you

4846
03:25:22,478 --> 03:25:26,879
just have to be like I don't feel

4847
03:25:23,520 --> 03:25:30,920
comfortable letting this person Drive

4848
03:25:26,879 --> 03:25:35,159
the in Australia I saw Police pulling

4849
03:25:30,920 --> 03:25:37,840
over cars and testing the passengers for

4850
03:25:35,159 --> 03:25:41,520
cannabis was that on the way to Mullen

4851
03:25:37,840 --> 03:25:43,840
Bimi or nimen it was on the way to niman

4852
03:25:41,520 --> 03:25:43,840
called

4853
03:25:43,959 --> 03:25:48,559
it yeah that's crazy dude that's like

4854
03:25:46,600 --> 03:25:50,960
some cotney [ __ ] they did stuff in the

4855
03:25:48,559 --> 03:25:52,639
cies like that back in the day where if

4856
03:25:50,959 --> 03:25:54,478
you were like pulled over during like

4857
03:25:52,639 --> 03:25:57,039
the season where it was time to plant

4858
03:25:54,478 --> 03:26:00,639
your plants and you had like any type of

4859
03:25:57,040 --> 03:26:04,279
gardening gear like shovels or pots or

4860
03:26:00,639 --> 03:26:07,318
soil or tarps like it could really lead

4861
03:26:04,279 --> 03:26:08,479
you to be like be under an investigation

4862
03:26:07,318 --> 03:26:10,079
just from getting pulled over at a

4863
03:26:08,478 --> 03:26:14,159
roadblock with like gardening supplies

4864
03:26:10,079 --> 03:26:17,398
in the back of your truck right pretty

4865
03:26:14,159 --> 03:26:19,719
brutal totally called that though nimon

4866
03:26:17,398 --> 03:26:21,840
that's weak sauce it's like wow like you

4867
03:26:19,719 --> 03:26:24,719
really don't just dislike this you

4868
03:26:21,840 --> 03:26:27,960
[ __ ] hate

4869
03:26:24,719 --> 03:26:30,238
it like they hate it it's like a very

4870
03:26:27,959 --> 03:26:32,919
strange it's almost disconcerting how

4871
03:26:30,238 --> 03:26:34,520
much they hate it you know they because

4872
03:26:32,920 --> 03:26:37,799
they can't use

4873
03:26:34,520 --> 03:26:39,199
it well sometimes I think that's a good

4874
03:26:37,799 --> 03:26:41,198
part of it but there's got to be a

4875
03:26:39,199 --> 03:26:43,840
reason why they hated it in the first

4876
03:26:41,199 --> 03:26:45,800
place instead of appreciated the using

4877
03:26:43,840 --> 03:26:48,520
of it there's some other value they get

4878
03:26:45,799 --> 03:26:51,039
out of it by hating on it by keeping it

4879
03:26:48,520 --> 03:26:53,800
illegal by making it unaccessible

4880
03:26:51,040 --> 03:26:57,840
there's a huge value that they get for

4881
03:26:53,799 --> 03:27:01,799
doing that and that's uh yeah that's

4882
03:26:57,840 --> 03:27:03,760
another show so to is freaking out who

4883
03:27:01,799 --> 03:27:06,398
said earlier and then they freaked out I

4884
03:27:03,760 --> 03:27:08,719
think it was Sam yeah Rob freaking out

4885
03:27:06,398 --> 03:27:11,760
there's a whole show right there

4886
03:27:08,719 --> 03:27:15,519
freaking out let's go into the depths of

4887
03:27:11,760 --> 03:27:17,800
what it is that is freaking out because

4888
03:27:15,520 --> 03:27:20,720
it is the worst feeling ever it happens

4889
03:27:17,799 --> 03:27:23,519
in an instant often it happens from a

4890
03:27:20,719 --> 03:27:25,119
thought and uh it's the worst reaction

4891
03:27:23,520 --> 03:27:27,840
where I don't know if it's just like I

4892
03:27:25,120 --> 03:27:31,040
always think of it as like pumping a

4893
03:27:27,840 --> 03:27:33,600
giant shot of adrenaline into my body uh

4894
03:27:31,040 --> 03:27:36,279
into my brain but uh who knows what

4895
03:27:33,600 --> 03:27:39,680
exactly is happening in the chemistry of

4896
03:27:36,279 --> 03:27:42,279
the infamous freakout and can any good

4897
03:27:39,680 --> 03:27:45,279
come from freaking out next on hash

4898
03:27:42,279 --> 03:27:45,279
Church

4899
03:27:46,520 --> 03:27:51,600
usually

4900
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:55,159
not like looking in your mirror and

4901
03:27:51,600 --> 03:27:57,000
seeing a police car exactly dude that's

4902
03:27:55,159 --> 03:27:59,680
one level of it it doesn't all have to

4903
03:27:57,000 --> 03:28:01,760
be I got high and had a bad experience

4904
03:27:59,680 --> 03:28:04,920
it's literally the same experience that

4905
03:28:01,760 --> 03:28:06,960
you just said right or or realizing that

4906
03:28:04,920 --> 03:28:09,040
you have to do the Jedi mind trick in

4907
03:28:06,959 --> 03:28:11,039
the moment right because you no this is

4908
03:28:09,040 --> 03:28:13,000
not this is not the marijuana you were

4909
03:28:11,040 --> 03:28:15,359
smelling officer no no this is not the

4910
03:28:13,000 --> 03:28:16,840
situation that you believe it to be oh

4911
03:28:15,359 --> 03:28:20,159
my god dude you ever had those

4912
03:28:16,840 --> 03:28:24,680
situations I got stories I had to

4913
03:28:20,159 --> 03:28:27,559
many stories I remember with pride when

4914
03:28:24,680 --> 03:28:31,479
I was busted about 15 years ago in a

4915
03:28:27,559 --> 03:28:34,278
hotel room I was set up and there was

4916
03:28:31,478 --> 03:28:36,879
like five police in the hotel room and

4917
03:28:34,279 --> 03:28:41,279
I'm sitting there on handcuffs and I

4918
03:28:36,879 --> 03:28:45,159
told the police you guys don't have the

4919
03:28:41,279 --> 03:28:48,399
educational level to understand that

4920
03:28:45,159 --> 03:28:52,799
you're hurting people in your own family

4921
03:28:48,398 --> 03:28:55,198
by enforcing these cannabis laws people

4922
03:28:52,799 --> 03:28:58,159
in your own family could benefit from

4923
03:28:55,199 --> 03:29:01,399
Cannabis but you don't know

4924
03:28:58,159 --> 03:29:03,879
that damn you said that to them you were

4925
03:29:01,398 --> 03:29:05,719
like a a an MD at the time like you were

4926
03:29:03,879 --> 03:29:09,398
actively doing

4927
03:29:05,719 --> 03:29:09,398
surgery right

4928
03:29:09,478 --> 03:29:14,119
Jesus yeah that's pretty crazy it's

4929
03:29:12,359 --> 03:29:16,559
pretty crazy when they start arresting

4930
03:29:14,120 --> 03:29:18,399
the surgeons

4931
03:29:16,559 --> 03:29:20,000
it's like it really goes to show you

4932
03:29:18,398 --> 03:29:24,799
that like all you have to do is speak

4933
03:29:20,000 --> 03:29:27,760
out in promotion it's why for so long so

4934
03:29:24,799 --> 03:29:30,559
many people hid their cannabis use

4935
03:29:27,760 --> 03:29:33,359
because it was just like it just kind of

4936
03:29:30,559 --> 03:29:36,278
wasn't worth the the potential life

4937
03:29:33,359 --> 03:29:38,520
altering problems that came with it I'm

4938
03:29:36,279 --> 03:29:40,520
talking to all of you residents of the

4939
03:29:38,520 --> 03:29:43,439
State of

4940
03:29:40,520 --> 03:29:46,040
Texas okay I I got a something to say

4941
03:29:43,439 --> 03:29:47,680
about that that's a really important

4942
03:29:46,040 --> 03:29:53,439
important

4943
03:29:47,680 --> 03:29:56,439
point so um as a heart surgeon I was a

4944
03:29:53,439 --> 03:29:58,840
specialist in protecting the heart from

4945
03:29:56,439 --> 03:30:02,479
what's called reperfusion

4946
03:29:58,840 --> 03:30:04,840
injury and I read the cannaboid patent

4947
03:30:02,478 --> 03:30:07,198
cannaboids as antioxidants and

4948
03:30:04,840 --> 03:30:10,520
neuroprotectants and in that patent it

4949
03:30:07,199 --> 03:30:13,960
actually says that cannab the CBD will

4950
03:30:10,520 --> 03:30:18,720
be used for open heart

4951
03:30:13,959 --> 03:30:22,799
surgery um uh during coronary Ry bypass

4952
03:30:18,719 --> 03:30:24,559
and I immediately recognized holy [ __ ]

4953
03:30:22,799 --> 03:30:28,079
this has great

4954
03:30:24,559 --> 03:30:31,559
potential but I couldn't tell any of my

4955
03:30:28,079 --> 03:30:34,079
colleagues anything about this because

4956
03:30:31,559 --> 03:30:36,920
if I said anything about these

4957
03:30:34,079 --> 03:30:40,120
cannaboids can protect a heart and brain

4958
03:30:36,920 --> 03:30:42,639
during surgery it would immediately out

4959
03:30:40,120 --> 03:30:45,199
me as a cannabis user user and I

4960
03:30:42,639 --> 03:30:47,920
couldn't say anything to my fellow

4961
03:30:45,199 --> 03:30:47,920
colleagues

4962
03:30:51,000 --> 03:30:56,719
I want to mention one thing you were

4963
03:30:52,959 --> 03:31:00,318
talking about cannabis and driving the

4964
03:30:56,719 --> 03:31:05,318
first studies that showed that

4965
03:31:00,318 --> 03:31:06,639
cannabis was likely making driver safer

4966
03:31:05,318 --> 03:31:10,600
was done in

4967
03:31:06,639 --> 03:31:12,719
1994 in the Netherlands it was a study

4968
03:31:10,600 --> 03:31:16,079
by

4969
03:31:12,719 --> 03:31:17,559
uh Dr

4970
03:31:16,079 --> 03:31:23,799
H

4971
03:31:17,559 --> 03:31:26,318
WJ robe r o BBE e in

4972
03:31:23,799 --> 03:31:29,559
1994 and they had to do it in the

4973
03:31:26,318 --> 03:31:32,760
Netherlands because they could not get

4974
03:31:29,559 --> 03:31:36,799
permission at the time to do the actual

4975
03:31:32,760 --> 03:31:39,478
driving studies in America so they came

4976
03:31:36,799 --> 03:31:44,000
worked with the university here and did

4977
03:31:39,478 --> 03:31:46,959
the studies and it was uh absolutely uh

4978
03:31:44,000 --> 03:31:50,238
true that the uh

4979
03:31:46,959 --> 03:31:53,639
driving was safer because people had a

4980
03:31:50,238 --> 03:31:55,639
tendency to slow down rather than you

4981
03:31:53,639 --> 03:31:56,680
know the way a drunk will speed up

4982
03:31:55,639 --> 03:32:00,000
because he's

4983
03:31:56,680 --> 03:32:03,920
Invincible I would love a copy of that

4984
03:32:00,000 --> 03:32:06,478
uh I've got Bunches of them because I

4985
03:32:03,920 --> 03:32:07,520
used to sell them from the international

4986
03:32:06,478 --> 03:32:10,358
hemp

4987
03:32:07,520 --> 03:32:11,880
Association this be reviewed on cannabis

4988
03:32:10,359 --> 03:32:15,640
Journal club for

4989
03:32:11,879 --> 03:32:19,358
sure yeah okay absolutely I I'll try and

4990
03:32:15,639 --> 03:32:23,559
find you a copy uh it's tucked away with

4991
03:32:19,359 --> 03:32:26,359
all the rest of my cannabis uh 10,000

4992
03:32:23,559 --> 03:32:29,840
freaking items that I've

4993
03:32:26,359 --> 03:32:32,399
got I I would say it's more than 10,000

4994
03:32:29,840 --> 03:32:35,680
but I I could just be completely wrong I

4995
03:32:32,398 --> 03:32:35,680
I wouldn't be surprised at

4996
03:32:35,799 --> 03:32:40,358
all [ __ ] that's awesome well I'll make

4997
03:32:38,478 --> 03:32:42,278
sure you guys get in touch and to help

4998
03:32:40,359 --> 03:32:44,318
out in any way we just need a digital

4999
03:32:42,279 --> 03:32:47,199
copy of it I do have a stack of those

5000
03:32:44,318 --> 03:32:50,159
books they're just not here at my house

5001
03:32:47,199 --> 03:32:53,239
but I might have a single copy here

5002
03:32:50,159 --> 03:32:56,799
which I can uh share with you but uh at

5003
03:32:53,238 --> 03:33:00,198
the very least I can uh connect you with

5004
03:32:56,799 --> 03:33:00,198
the book

5005
03:33:00,520 --> 03:33:07,520
right Dr Robert melamed had the biggest

5006
03:33:03,840 --> 03:33:11,040
collection that I know of of cannabis

5007
03:33:07,520 --> 03:33:16,560
scientific articles

5008
03:33:11,040 --> 03:33:19,640
and that I've got four or 5,000 PDF

5009
03:33:16,559 --> 03:33:23,079
and I've got uh perfect more than 2,000

5010
03:33:19,639 --> 03:33:25,719
books on the subject well you need be

5011
03:33:23,079 --> 03:33:28,559
involved in cannabis Journal Club he's

5012
03:33:25,719 --> 03:33:31,679
on the list for certain he's one of the

5013
03:33:28,559 --> 03:33:33,600
few MDS go ahead atan sorry Dr Allan do

5014
03:33:31,680 --> 03:33:37,120
we have any way to figure out or find

5015
03:33:33,600 --> 03:33:39,680
out what happened to uh Dr Mam's work he

5016
03:33:37,120 --> 03:33:42,279
passed away I know the other year so do

5017
03:33:39,680 --> 03:33:43,439
you have any idea if he left his uh his

5018
03:33:42,279 --> 03:33:46,680
work

5019
03:33:43,439 --> 03:33:51,359
somewhere I have a uh a number to one of

5020
03:33:46,680 --> 03:33:51,359
his close friends but uh that's all I

5021
03:33:51,879 --> 03:33:55,559
have but he was a

5022
03:33:56,079 --> 03:34:01,559
genius I loved listening to him talk he

5023
03:33:58,959 --> 03:34:03,159
had a real great way of speaking you

5024
03:34:01,559 --> 03:34:06,278
could

5025
03:34:03,159 --> 03:34:08,600
definitely feel and see how intelligent

5026
03:34:06,279 --> 03:34:11,640
he was but he was also like a Tripper

5027
03:34:08,600 --> 03:34:12,960
and a you know like a real just lover of

5028
03:34:11,639 --> 03:34:14,719
of getting

5029
03:34:12,959 --> 03:34:17,959
high

5030
03:34:14,719 --> 03:34:18,959
right I appreciate that yeah I was glad

5031
03:34:17,959 --> 03:34:22,039
to hear

5032
03:34:18,959 --> 03:34:25,879
his he he made connections between

5033
03:34:22,040 --> 03:34:30,560
nonlinear thermodynamics and the way the

5034
03:34:25,879 --> 03:34:33,318
body has evolved which is really a very

5035
03:34:30,559 --> 03:34:35,439
insightful way of looking at it because

5036
03:34:33,318 --> 03:34:38,799
if you think about it ever since Big

5037
03:34:35,439 --> 03:34:40,398
Bang the universe has become more random

5038
03:34:38,799 --> 03:34:42,840
right entropy is

5039
03:34:40,398 --> 03:34:46,879
increasing and he was able to kind of

5040
03:34:42,840 --> 03:34:49,318
pull it together into understand why

5041
03:34:46,879 --> 03:34:52,519
certain biological phenomena are

5042
03:34:49,318 --> 03:34:55,079
underpinned on defeating

5043
03:34:52,520 --> 03:34:57,238
thermodynamics and coming from someone

5044
03:34:55,079 --> 03:34:59,600
like myself who you know I'm a PhD

5045
03:34:57,238 --> 03:35:02,520
chemist I had to learn

5046
03:34:59,600 --> 03:35:04,880
thermodynamics every part of it you know

5047
03:35:02,520 --> 03:35:08,640
I mean I could really appreciate his

5048
03:35:04,879 --> 03:35:11,119
thinking he was definitely a very unique

5049
03:35:08,639 --> 03:35:12,920
person in the way he thought about

5050
03:35:11,120 --> 03:35:16,479
solving

5051
03:35:12,920 --> 03:35:19,398
problems totally I missing

5052
03:35:16,478 --> 03:35:21,799
and I never met hash Church misses him I

5053
03:35:19,398 --> 03:35:24,159
think he only made it on to a couple of

5054
03:35:21,799 --> 03:35:26,358
episodes of he was on a couple episodes

5055
03:35:24,159 --> 03:35:29,000
right and he was super confrontational

5056
03:35:26,359 --> 03:35:31,079
when he got on right I mean I remember

5057
03:35:29,000 --> 03:35:35,398
him coming to blows I forget with who

5058
03:35:31,079 --> 03:35:36,959
maybe with uh Todd who who did didn't

5059
03:35:35,398 --> 03:35:39,840
they have a little bit of

5060
03:35:36,959 --> 03:35:41,358
a possible there was something I always

5061
03:35:39,840 --> 03:35:43,040
I always got a kick out of that when it

5062
03:35:41,359 --> 03:35:46,720
happens on hash church because it's

5063
03:35:43,040 --> 03:35:51,600
funny but uh yes he I think it was with

5064
03:35:46,719 --> 03:35:55,438
sounds about right yeah but um yeah he

5065
03:35:51,600 --> 03:35:58,120
he he has a couple interesting YouTube

5066
03:35:55,439 --> 03:36:01,238
videos up uh that are definitely

5067
03:35:58,120 --> 03:36:02,880
worthwhile watching but you know you

5068
03:36:01,238 --> 03:36:04,279
know you guys talk about your literature

5069
03:36:02,879 --> 03:36:06,238
club and everything that's really

5070
03:36:04,279 --> 03:36:09,640
awesome I'd love to participate too as

5071
03:36:06,238 --> 03:36:13,198
well I have you on the list yeah I'm one

5072
03:36:09,639 --> 03:36:16,879
of those people who believes that we do

5073
03:36:13,199 --> 03:36:19,640
have a crystal ball we can see into the

5074
03:36:16,879 --> 03:36:23,679
future by ironically looking into the

5075
03:36:19,639 --> 03:36:27,000
past and so when the scientists look at

5076
03:36:23,680 --> 03:36:29,680
the scientific literature we we're all

5077
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:32,639
standing on the shoulders of giants even

5078
03:36:29,680 --> 03:36:34,880
michul Roger Adams they were all

5079
03:36:32,639 --> 03:36:39,599
standing on the people who came before

5080
03:36:34,879 --> 03:36:42,839
them and the collective body of of pure

5081
03:36:39,600 --> 03:36:45,199
reviewed research dealing with cannabis

5082
03:36:42,840 --> 03:36:47,639
is now tremendous there's a lifetime's

5083
03:36:45,199 --> 03:36:51,000
worth of literature out there on just

5084
03:36:47,639 --> 03:36:52,799
about every aspect of the endoc canabo

5085
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:58,478
signaling system David did I get it

5086
03:36:52,799 --> 03:37:03,198
right thank you okay on the bless you on

5087
03:36:58,478 --> 03:37:06,920
on the plant on genetics on uh every

5088
03:37:03,199 --> 03:37:10,439
aspect of just about every type of

5089
03:37:06,920 --> 03:37:14,359
medical condition and how people have

5090
03:37:10,439 --> 03:37:17,439
sought to you know treat them uh with

5091
03:37:14,359 --> 03:37:19,199
with cannabinoids I mean we know they're

5092
03:37:17,439 --> 03:37:20,238
anti-inflammatory we know that they

5093
03:37:19,199 --> 03:37:24,079
promote

5094
03:37:20,238 --> 03:37:26,719
apoptosis we know that they inhibit

5095
03:37:24,079 --> 03:37:29,680
tumor angiogenesis which is a very

5096
03:37:26,719 --> 03:37:33,159
powerful mechanism for um basically

5097
03:37:29,680 --> 03:37:36,760
stopping cancer in its tracts and I

5098
03:37:33,159 --> 03:37:38,760
think yeah D David you you you would I

5099
03:37:36,760 --> 03:37:43,279
think totally agree with me in this

5100
03:37:38,760 --> 03:37:46,359
assessment is that canabo are are are

5101
03:37:43,279 --> 03:37:50,359
more like the figh cannaboids in

5102
03:37:46,359 --> 03:37:54,120
particular are more like vitamins that

5103
03:37:50,359 --> 03:37:56,479
it's not canono it's cannaboids can

5104
03:37:54,120 --> 03:37:58,560
cannaboids I I'll get it

5105
03:37:56,478 --> 03:38:01,398
right one of these days I'll get it

5106
03:37:58,559 --> 03:38:04,760
right but so we're documenting

5107
03:38:01,398 --> 03:38:06,879
history right the true history and

5108
03:38:04,760 --> 03:38:09,719
there's going to be a lot of propaganda

5109
03:38:06,879 --> 03:38:12,759
false history about this and we got the

5110
03:38:09,719 --> 03:38:16,000
true history but the the the the

5111
03:38:12,760 --> 03:38:18,238
nourishment of humans

5112
03:38:16,000 --> 03:38:20,439
with the phyto cannabinoids I hope I

5113
03:38:18,238 --> 03:38:26,398
said it right is

5114
03:38:20,439 --> 03:38:30,520
cannaboids cannaboids is is nurturing A

5115
03:38:26,398 --> 03:38:35,000
system that in your body can suffer from

5116
03:38:30,520 --> 03:38:37,800
what um people have termed endoc canabo

5117
03:38:35,000 --> 03:38:40,439
deficiencies that our body afraid to say

5118
03:38:37,799 --> 03:38:41,840
the word cannabis so they had to alter

5119
03:38:40,439 --> 03:38:46,000
it

5120
03:38:41,840 --> 03:38:52,040
canabo right but I if if our body is

5121
03:38:46,000 --> 03:38:55,279
able to make its own level of 2ag and

5122
03:38:52,040 --> 03:38:56,840
anandamide people don't need phyto

5123
03:38:55,279 --> 03:38:59,520
canabo

5124
03:38:56,840 --> 03:39:02,279
supplementation is that basically what

5125
03:38:59,520 --> 03:39:07,439
the theory says is that endocannabinoid

5126
03:39:02,279 --> 03:39:10,000
deficiency is why humans use

5127
03:39:07,439 --> 03:39:13,120
cannabis well it's a it's a complex

5128
03:39:10,000 --> 03:39:16,159
system so it's not just a system of of

5129
03:39:13,120 --> 03:39:19,960
what makes the cannaboids it's a system

5130
03:39:16,159 --> 03:39:22,959
that transfers the can cannaboids and a

5131
03:39:19,959 --> 03:39:25,278
system that degrades the cannaboids

5132
03:39:22,959 --> 03:39:28,238
after they've been used enough and you

5133
03:39:25,279 --> 03:39:31,079
don't want their used to continue

5134
03:39:28,238 --> 03:39:34,398
working and you degrade the cannaboid so

5135
03:39:31,079 --> 03:39:36,199
they don't stay around long term so

5136
03:39:34,398 --> 03:39:39,278
here's something that happened to

5137
03:39:36,199 --> 03:39:41,640
me I fed my little

5138
03:39:39,279 --> 03:39:42,760
Chihuahua a little bit of a cook

5139
03:39:41,639 --> 03:39:46,079
cannabis

5140
03:39:42,760 --> 03:39:48,719
cookie and he was out for three days he

5141
03:39:46,079 --> 03:39:52,760
couldn't walk couldn't stand for three

5142
03:39:48,719 --> 03:39:55,238
days and what I got from that is the

5143
03:39:52,760 --> 03:39:57,398
system that removes the

5144
03:39:55,238 --> 03:40:00,159
cannaboids in

5145
03:39:57,398 --> 03:40:03,959
chihuaha wasn't as

5146
03:40:00,159 --> 03:40:06,840
robust as the system in humans so

5147
03:40:03,959 --> 03:40:09,398
different humans different animals have

5148
03:40:06,840 --> 03:40:12,439
different abilities to

5149
03:40:09,398 --> 03:40:15,119
metabolize the Cano once they're

5150
03:40:12,439 --> 03:40:15,840
there but David isn't it also true I

5151
03:40:15,120 --> 03:40:19,120
mean

5152
03:40:15,840 --> 03:40:21,880
so the fact that canabo or the the the

5153
03:40:19,120 --> 03:40:25,680
metabolic products of these are fat

5154
03:40:21,879 --> 03:40:28,839
soluble so they're stored in in fat and

5155
03:40:25,680 --> 03:40:31,279
as you burn fat that those compounds are

5156
03:40:28,840 --> 03:40:34,159
then released that's sort of an

5157
03:40:31,279 --> 03:40:37,199
evolutionary mechanism to hold on to

5158
03:40:34,159 --> 03:40:40,000
these beneficial compounds as long as

5159
03:40:37,199 --> 03:40:42,680
our bodies can right so the fact that

5160
03:40:40,000 --> 03:40:45,680
you could smoke a joint today and still

5161
03:40:42,680 --> 03:40:48,120
have so many nanograms of th in your

5162
03:40:45,680 --> 03:40:50,318
bloodstream next week that's actually

5163
03:40:48,120 --> 03:40:54,840
something that our body has evolved to

5164
03:40:50,318 --> 03:40:56,439
do right provide a constant level yeah

5165
03:40:54,840 --> 03:40:58,760
right

5166
03:40:56,439 --> 03:41:01,318
right

5167
03:40:58,760 --> 03:41:04,680
right well I think again that's that's

5168
03:41:01,318 --> 03:41:07,680
what sort of hampers the law enforcement

5169
03:41:04,680 --> 03:41:09,720
aspect of being able to do a a blood

5170
03:41:07,680 --> 03:41:12,120
level alcohol measurement well like they

5171
03:41:09,719 --> 03:41:14,599
do with alcohol to say okay you have so

5172
03:41:12,120 --> 03:41:17,319
much THC in your blood therefore

5173
03:41:14,600 --> 03:41:20,399
regardless of how you behaved regardless

5174
03:41:17,318 --> 03:41:24,318
of how you were able to pass a field

5175
03:41:20,398 --> 03:41:26,879
sobriety test this number from this

5176
03:41:24,318 --> 03:41:31,760
biological assay tells us that there's

5177
03:41:26,879 --> 03:41:35,158
enough THC or 11 hydroxy THC or whatever

5178
03:41:31,760 --> 03:41:37,520
is in your blood to make you intoxicated

5179
03:41:35,158 --> 03:41:40,680
therefore they want to change the

5180
03:41:37,520 --> 03:41:42,840
reality it's not how dangerous you are

5181
03:41:40,680 --> 03:41:46,040
we got a number that says you're

5182
03:41:42,840 --> 03:41:47,760
automatically dangerous right right so

5183
03:41:46,040 --> 03:41:49,720
they're not they're not saying that

5184
03:41:47,760 --> 03:41:51,439
you're dangerous and you hit something

5185
03:41:49,719 --> 03:41:52,920
they're saying we got a number that says

5186
03:41:51,439 --> 03:41:55,920
we can put you in

5187
03:41:52,920 --> 03:41:55,920
jail

5188
03:41:56,478 --> 03:42:02,039
right that seems

5189
03:41:59,520 --> 03:42:04,520
extreme I hope in the future one day

5190
03:42:02,040 --> 03:42:07,239
people will be like back in the day if

5191
03:42:04,520 --> 03:42:09,920
you smoked this one flower and drove a

5192
03:42:07,238 --> 03:42:11,760
car you could go to jail and if you grew

5193
03:42:09,920 --> 03:42:14,120
the flower you could like they could

5194
03:42:11,760 --> 03:42:16,840
kick your door down shoot your dog take

5195
03:42:14,120 --> 03:42:21,000
your kids and put you in jail and I hope

5196
03:42:16,840 --> 03:42:23,000
people are like no that never happened

5197
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:26,959
that couldn't

5198
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:29,359
happen well in in a free market economy

5199
03:42:26,959 --> 03:42:31,839
when people make money off of those

5200
03:42:29,359 --> 03:42:34,079
activities they want things to stay as

5201
03:42:31,840 --> 03:42:36,318
good and [ __ ] up so they could keep on

5202
03:42:34,079 --> 03:42:37,959
making their money think about people

5203
03:42:36,318 --> 03:42:41,238
who people who sell

5204
03:42:37,959 --> 03:42:44,119
breathalyzers PE it's a the drug testing

5205
03:42:41,238 --> 03:42:46,840
industry Marcus is a billion doll

5206
03:42:44,120 --> 03:42:49,920
industry billion dollar industry they

5207
03:42:46,840 --> 03:42:52,398
don't want people uh or companies to not

5208
03:42:49,920 --> 03:42:55,040
drug test their employees because their

5209
03:42:52,398 --> 03:42:56,799
livelihood is derived from that Revenue

5210
03:42:55,040 --> 03:42:58,479
stream and they don't want that Revenue

5211
03:42:56,799 --> 03:43:00,679
stream to go away can't they just test

5212
03:42:58,478 --> 03:43:02,840
owner of that company has got a big

5213
03:43:00,680 --> 03:43:05,279
yacht and some Harbor somewhere and he

5214
03:43:02,840 --> 03:43:09,279
needs to make sure that he keeps that

5215
03:43:05,279 --> 03:43:11,840
yacht and so yeah there's tip top shape

5216
03:43:09,279 --> 03:43:15,359
it's proba sure it

5217
03:43:11,840 --> 03:43:17,639
is well if you also think about what uh

5218
03:43:15,359 --> 03:43:20,158
communities and civilizations of the

5219
03:43:17,639 --> 03:43:22,000
past would have to say if you told them

5220
03:43:20,158 --> 03:43:24,199
what like what we did and no no more

5221
03:43:22,000 --> 03:43:29,279
hemp they would be like you guys did

5222
03:43:24,199 --> 03:43:31,239
what why like they would be so confused

5223
03:43:29,279 --> 03:43:33,600
you know at that point when it was in

5224
03:43:31,238 --> 03:43:37,000
everything it was baskets P like

5225
03:43:33,600 --> 03:43:38,359
everything people sales people I mean if

5226
03:43:37,000 --> 03:43:39,600
you told them like oh yeah that's not

5227
03:43:38,359 --> 03:43:45,760
going to be allowed anymore they would

5228
03:43:39,600 --> 03:43:48,000
be like what I know possible why Laura

5229
03:43:45,760 --> 03:43:50,680
do you know back in William Penn's

5230
03:43:48,000 --> 03:43:53,318
colonial Pennsylvania and you were a

5231
03:43:50,680 --> 03:43:56,199
farmer you were taxed if you did not

5232
03:43:53,318 --> 03:43:59,158
grow up that's true you get taxed if you

5233
03:43:56,199 --> 03:44:01,359
did not because what did her majesty the

5234
03:43:59,158 --> 03:44:03,520
Queen of England need to conquer the

5235
03:44:01,359 --> 03:44:06,040
world back in the day of you know the

5236
03:44:03,520 --> 03:44:08,158
British Empire she needed ships and what

5237
03:44:06,040 --> 03:44:11,359
do you do ships

5238
03:44:08,158 --> 03:44:13,119
across sails and ropes exactly right

5239
03:44:11,359 --> 03:44:15,559
yeah sails and ropes wouldn't have found

5240
03:44:13,120 --> 03:44:18,439
the new world without the uh without hey

5241
03:44:15,559 --> 03:44:20,278
CA it's the only only natural fiber that

5242
03:44:18,439 --> 03:44:22,318
can withstand seawater in that way

5243
03:44:20,279 --> 03:44:24,399
that's why they used it for ropes well

5244
03:44:22,318 --> 03:44:26,000
the the other thing and the Dutch

5245
03:44:24,398 --> 03:44:27,079
because who was building ships better

5246
03:44:26,000 --> 03:44:30,120
than those

5247
03:44:27,079 --> 03:44:32,639
[ __ ] as as they mow as they mow

5248
03:44:30,120 --> 03:44:36,079
down the old growth whenever they found

5249
03:44:32,639 --> 03:44:39,278
a a tree that was like straight for like

5250
03:44:36,079 --> 03:44:40,959
80 feet that was immediately cut down

5251
03:44:39,279 --> 03:44:43,479
and sent to England or sent to the

5252
03:44:40,959 --> 03:44:47,000
Netherlands to make Mass out of because

5253
03:44:43,478 --> 03:44:51,238
they need long strain or long straight

5254
03:44:47,000 --> 03:44:54,040
um uh trees to make masts

5255
03:44:51,238 --> 03:44:56,000
right another listen here's an important

5256
03:44:54,040 --> 03:44:58,520
thing to remember for people in on the

5257
03:44:56,000 --> 03:45:00,318
church discussion that was actual

5258
03:44:58,520 --> 03:45:04,000
Cannabis sativa so think of the time

5259
03:45:00,318 --> 03:45:06,039
frame this is like you know this is free

5260
03:45:04,000 --> 03:45:08,238
the use of and Discovery really by the

5261
03:45:06,040 --> 03:45:11,080
new world of cannabis indicia which is

5262
03:45:08,238 --> 03:45:13,439
the drug THC producing cannabis so all

5263
03:45:11,079 --> 03:45:15,520
that fiber back then was hemp right it's

5264
03:45:13,439 --> 03:45:17,520
none of that was we're not weed

5265
03:45:15,520 --> 03:45:21,600
today to describe

5266
03:45:17,520 --> 03:45:24,840
sativa is is an equatorial drug plant

5267
03:45:21,600 --> 03:45:27,318
but cannabis the the word the the name

5268
03:45:24,840 --> 03:45:29,719
was given to the to European hemp or

5269
03:45:27,318 --> 03:45:32,359
northern European hemp which is Cannabis

5270
03:45:29,719 --> 03:45:33,398
sativa so that's why like you know we

5271
03:45:32,359 --> 03:45:35,760
went through that period where we

5272
03:45:33,398 --> 03:45:38,318
started calling it like narrow Leaf hemp

5273
03:45:35,760 --> 03:45:40,158
and Broad Leaf hemp but really like I

5274
03:45:38,318 --> 03:45:42,920
think it's I think people using the word

5275
03:45:40,158 --> 03:45:44,639
sativa this the word sativa means useful

5276
03:45:42,920 --> 03:45:45,719
or cultivated like that's the Latin

5277
03:45:44,639 --> 03:45:49,398
trans

5278
03:45:45,719 --> 03:45:52,079
translation I didn't know that right and

5279
03:45:49,398 --> 03:45:54,879
um so yeah we're really talking about a

5280
03:45:52,079 --> 03:45:58,039
fiber plant and a seed plant not a drug

5281
03:45:54,879 --> 03:46:01,198
plant when we say sativa

5282
03:45:58,040 --> 03:46:04,000
okay another Dr Allan Epiphany that I

5283
03:46:01,199 --> 03:46:08,560
would like to spread to these people is

5284
03:46:04,000 --> 03:46:11,680
cannabis and hemp are in fact money and

5285
03:46:08,559 --> 03:46:14,559
if you legalize cannabis or hemp in your

5286
03:46:11,680 --> 03:46:18,439
state money will come to your state in

5287
03:46:14,559 --> 03:46:22,000
one of two Fashions if the people can

5288
03:46:18,439 --> 03:46:24,000
grow cannabis in hemp they will get the

5289
03:46:22,000 --> 03:46:27,639
money and they will spend the money

5290
03:46:24,000 --> 03:46:30,520
inside the state and the whole state

5291
03:46:27,639 --> 03:46:34,358
will prosper if the people are not

5292
03:46:30,520 --> 03:46:36,399
allowed to grow cannabis outside

5293
03:46:34,359 --> 03:46:39,120
cannabis

5294
03:46:36,398 --> 03:46:42,039
cartel companies I'd like to call them

5295
03:46:39,120 --> 03:46:43,920
carpet bagger companies I don't know if

5296
03:46:42,040 --> 03:46:46,880
you guys understand what that word means

5297
03:46:43,920 --> 03:46:49,238
carpet bagger companies so Carpet

5298
03:46:46,879 --> 03:46:51,879
Baggers were the people from the north

5299
03:46:49,238 --> 03:46:54,279
that came to the south after the Civil

5300
03:46:51,879 --> 03:46:56,398
War and they would extort money from the

5301
03:46:54,279 --> 03:46:59,680
south and they were called Carpet

5302
03:46:56,398 --> 03:47:02,439
Baggers so if the people can't grow

5303
03:46:59,680 --> 03:47:04,760
Carpet Baggers will come to your state

5304
03:47:02,439 --> 03:47:09,880
and they will extract the money from the

5305
03:47:04,760 --> 03:47:12,199
state and they will spend it outside the

5306
03:47:09,879 --> 03:47:15,198
state and you can't argue with that

5307
03:47:12,199 --> 03:47:15,199
statement

5308
03:47:15,478 --> 03:47:23,238
I wouldn't even try Dr Allen I I

5309
03:47:18,920 --> 03:47:28,840

03:47:38,279 --> 03:47:42,238

5317
03:47:49,359 --> 03:47:54,040
up hey I wanted to jump in on one other

5318
03:47:52,199 --> 03:47:56,880
quick little note we were talking about

5319
03:47:54,040 --> 03:47:59,680
the pronunciation of cannaboids or can

5320
03:47:56,879 --> 03:48:01,719
cannaboids and um I always thought it

5321
03:47:59,680 --> 03:48:04,120
was cannaboids too but the more I

5322
03:48:01,719 --> 03:48:06,840
traveled and got involved with

5323
03:48:04,120 --> 03:48:08,640
International um like the the

5324
03:48:06,840 --> 03:48:11,238
Neuroscience side the canab the

5325
03:48:08,639 --> 03:48:12,639
researchers that that work in the field

5326
03:48:11,238 --> 03:48:15,000
of discovering everything that's going

5327
03:48:12,639 --> 03:48:16,760
on in the brain and how how the OC

5328
03:48:15,000 --> 03:48:18,799
cannaboid system works they all use the

5329
03:48:16,760 --> 03:48:21,279
term cannaboid not

5330
03:48:18,799 --> 03:48:24,119
cannaboid yeah won't they be surprised

5331
03:48:21,279 --> 03:48:27,399
when they find out they were tricked by

5332
03:48:24,120 --> 03:48:29,199
the society to call it no that's not it

5333
03:48:27,398 --> 03:48:32,238
at all it's no that's not it at all it's

5334
03:48:29,199 --> 03:48:36,079
an American Centric idea that that

5335
03:48:32,238 --> 03:48:37,840
cannabis is is pronounced that way

5336
03:48:36,079 --> 03:48:40,520
there's other countries other countries

5337
03:48:37,840 --> 03:48:42,680
pronounce it Canabis right or Canabis so

5338
03:48:40,520 --> 03:48:46,920
it's oh really I didn't know that really

5339
03:48:42,680 --> 03:48:48,639
yeah yeah or Canabis like so it's it it

5340
03:48:46,920 --> 03:48:52,359
is in the way that we pronounce it in

5341
03:48:48,639 --> 03:48:52,358
North America that makes

5342
03:48:52,559 --> 03:48:56,519
us I'm a victim of

5343
03:48:58,879 --> 03:49:03,398
that yeah it's a tomato tomato

5344
03:49:06,600 --> 03:49:11,479
thing pronounced yeah how it's

5345
03:49:08,840 --> 03:49:11,478
pronounced

5346
03:49:13,279 --> 03:49:22,560
eh um so I just wanted to add to um to

5347
03:49:18,680 --> 03:49:24,040
the idea of the music artists by Caleb

5348
03:49:22,559 --> 03:49:29,000
um oh Caleb too when you were talking

5349
03:49:24,040 --> 03:49:30,399
about Jerry and that Vietnamese uh hash

5350
03:49:29,000 --> 03:49:31,879
I'm actually smoking that that's

5351
03:49:30,398 --> 03:49:33,680
actually been what I'm smoking I just

5352
03:49:31,879 --> 03:49:36,959
put two and two together I was like oh

5353
03:49:33,680 --> 03:49:39,279
nice I'm actually smoking Jerry's hash

5354
03:49:36,959 --> 03:49:42,079
that's so funny uh I just

5355
03:49:39,279 --> 03:49:45,199
realiz but uh it's really beautiful it's

5356
03:49:42,079 --> 03:49:46,600
there's nothing left but it was oh

5357
03:49:45,199 --> 03:49:49,399
his uh

5358
03:49:46,600 --> 03:49:52,040
Vietnamese uh land race strain that he

5359
03:49:49,398 --> 03:49:55,000
has is is really incredible but uh I

5360
03:49:52,040 --> 03:49:57,600
wanted to add to Caleb's music artists I

5361
03:49:55,000 --> 03:50:00,120
know this is changing the the topic I

5362
03:49:57,600 --> 03:50:02,640
just didn't want to forget is um I

5363
03:50:00,120 --> 03:50:05,239
really like the this group Out Here

5364
03:50:02,639 --> 03:50:08,238
Local to mesino called the meno Dope

5365
03:50:05,238 --> 03:50:09,959
Boys um they are a music group they're a

5366
03:50:08,238 --> 03:50:13,359
rap music group but they've also been

5367
03:50:09,959 --> 03:50:15,238
growing for a long long time and they've

5368
03:50:13,359 --> 03:50:17,000
definitely been reprimanded many many

5369
03:50:15,238 --> 03:50:18,760
times been raided many many times but

5370
03:50:17,000 --> 03:50:21,040
they're known really for their big ass

5371
03:50:18,760 --> 03:50:23,120
plants because here in you know here in

5372
03:50:21,040 --> 03:50:24,399
uh you know they were like okay well we

5373
03:50:23,120 --> 03:50:26,199
can't grow a lot of them so we'll just

5374
03:50:24,398 --> 03:50:28,559
grow them really [ __ ] big so they

5375
03:50:26,199 --> 03:50:30,199
were known for huge plants but they were

5376
03:50:28,559 --> 03:50:32,959
one of the first music groups that I've

5377
03:50:30,199 --> 03:50:34,439
ever seen personally that um man they

5378
03:50:32,959 --> 03:50:36,839
took the biggest pot you could find the

5379
03:50:34,439 --> 03:50:39,800
biggest smart pot you could find maybe

5380
03:50:36,840 --> 03:50:41,559
500 gallons but they planted one of the

5381
03:50:39,799 --> 03:50:44,039
biggest genetics they have in their

5382
03:50:41,559 --> 03:50:46,959
library and they they tamed it to go

5383
03:50:44,040 --> 03:50:50,600
around a platform that that that

5384
03:50:46,959 --> 03:50:52,919
eventually housed their recording studio

5385
03:50:50,600 --> 03:50:55,199
so the plant became their recording

5386
03:50:52,920 --> 03:50:58,520
studio and they would step up into their

5387
03:50:55,199 --> 03:51:00,158
cannabis plant and record their album um

5388
03:50:58,520 --> 03:51:02,399
and they did it all for the recording of

5389
03:51:00,158 --> 03:51:06,158
their album and you know

5390
03:51:02,398 --> 03:51:08,519
um uh old D he actually the lead singer

5391
03:51:06,158 --> 03:51:10,520
the lead of the group um and bzy old D

5392
03:51:08,520 --> 03:51:12,238
and bzy have a mic stand and it's really

5393
03:51:10,520 --> 03:51:14,600
cool it's their it's one of the biggest

5394
03:51:12,238 --> 03:51:16,680
cannabis stalks and you'll see them on

5395
03:51:14,600 --> 03:51:19,000
on stage with a huge cannabis stop you

5396
03:51:16,680 --> 03:51:22,199
know so um I think it would be really

5397
03:51:19,000 --> 03:51:27,318
interesting to get a perspective from um

5398
03:51:22,199 --> 03:51:29,439
Growers who are also um music artists

5399
03:51:27,318 --> 03:51:31,278
yeah those guys are awesome I don't know

5400
03:51:29,439 --> 03:51:33,158
if both of them have ever been on hash

5401
03:51:31,279 --> 03:51:34,640
church maybe once but I've definitely

5402
03:51:33,158 --> 03:51:36,000
reached out to them in the last couple

5403
03:51:34,639 --> 03:51:38,639
of months and been like got to get you

5404
03:51:36,000 --> 03:51:40,559

03:51:38,639 --> 03:51:44,559

03:51:40,559 --> 03:51:44,559
absolutely yeah

5407
03:51:44,719 --> 03:51:48,679

5408
03:51:46,680 --> 03:51:50,840

04:00:58,760 --> 04:01:02,398
like every once in a while we knock it

5605

out of the park and our our words are

5606
04:01:02,398 --> 04:01:06,158
important and they they mean stuff to

5607
04:01:04,199 --> 04:01:08,880
other people that are watching so that's

5608
04:01:06,158 --> 04:01:11,279

5609
04:01:08,879 --> 04:01:12,759
