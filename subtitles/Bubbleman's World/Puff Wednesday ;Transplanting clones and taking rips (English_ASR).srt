10
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,799
we're not really subject to any rules

11
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:50,718
just cuz we call it puff Wednesday but

12
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,479
uh today John came over nonetheless uh

13
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,960
and brought me some pots which was

14
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:58,038
perfect timing because I had a few

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,799
clones here um medy Hayes times 2 uh

16
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:04,118
with roots an afghan from the great

17
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,319
Gardener as well as a Barb nice and I

18
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:07,599
figured we'd just do a little

19
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,239
transplanting I basically I like that

20
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,039
yeah I already filled up the pots that

21
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,599
you brought by I used the smaller ones

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,439
cuz I thought I could use the space in

23
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,319
the room and I'll transplant them again

24
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,000
so these won't be the final size pots

25
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:21,919
that these plants go into I'll probably

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,400
transplant them in 10 days or

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,200
something so yeah if you wanted to go

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,400
with the Afghani and the medi Haze oh I

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:33,399
guess what I wanted to do

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,520
first oh you this card label your pots

31
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,879
it's not that hard to remember I just

32
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,840
did and so we're going to do that we're

33
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:42,359
going to be doing this one as an Afghan

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,040
perfect yeah Afghani so I'm going to

35
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:49,718
write that down as an Indica

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,840

66
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:10,158
you so that's Barb I'm going to get

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,639
ready and do a Med7 bet Hayes number

68
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,798
seven would you call that a sativa or a

69
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,919
hybrid I'm going to say Well it it's

70
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,439
it's very much um a hybrid it's not a

71
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:23,639
sativa because it is medic Kush crossed

72
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:26,280
into the nor Light number five Scot

73
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,438
hybrid okay which we believe came from

74
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,360
1992 cuz that's what was marked on the

75
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:32,000
bag right

76
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,439
awesome but it's definitely a hybrid

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,080
cool cool excellent I'll write it down

78
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:39,280
as such I like to try to be as accurate

79
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,280
as possible and the best part about that

80
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,840
is is when I was uh actually doing my

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,598
video this morning on transplanting

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,878
which is awesome I made mention of how I

83
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:51,238
finally labeled my plant people have

84
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,399
made mention to that in my videos so I

85
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,039
actually got some nice little white

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,760
steaks and it's not a bad idea is it I

87
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,679
figured you know

88
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,039
what it's it's it's should be marking my

89
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,200
plants I've never really gotten to the

90
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,318
point of actually carrying but uh you

91
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,798
know we're we're we're growing it

92

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,440
a lot of fun as you know last year had a

295
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,360
lot of fun of the booth there and uh I

296
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,360
had a good time last year last year was

297
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,759
was a great event see some good friends

298
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,120
I hadn't seen in a long time it was

299
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:50,679
great to see

300
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,799
Marcel it was great to be there with

301
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:55,399
almost just it was

302
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,759
very I I it was my first treating

303
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,799
yourself as many of you may or may not

304
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,159
know I had never gone to one of the

305
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:04,759
events before I had uh unfortunately

306
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,719
been written about in a ma in the

307
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,600
magazine uh treating yourself in a way

308
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,278
that I I wasn't supportive of so I sort

309
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,440
of pulled my support out for quite a

310
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,159
while there and uh well that's never

311
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,360
helpful to the community really so I

312
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:18,278
just thought it would be a good idea

313
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,240
last year to come back and check it out

314
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:22,519
which turned out it was the last year

315
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,879
that it would be a treating yourself and

316
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,159
now it's Champs Dash treating yourself

317
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,198
cup so it'll be it'll be cool to see

318
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:31,679
what's you know the whole what what the

319
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:34,359
Vibe is still like and whether it's as

320
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,120
as uh hyped and and as busy as last year

321
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,480
or whether we'll make get busier I think

322
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,879
we're going to see um a busier year I

323
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,839
think we're going to see a lot of people

324
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,639
coming from the industry taking a look

325
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,040
at having to help patients with the

326
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,278

Fresh Frozen whole plant extract that

352
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,639
John and I did uh I guess a couple of

353
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:53,800
days now ago that you grew that I did

354
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:57,639
indeed grow very very happy to say that

355
00:14:53,799 --> 00:15:01,240
so um we've got our flavors right here

356
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:03,879
we've got 25 micron 73 Micron 90 Micron

357
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,839
and 120 Micron all very blonde although

358
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:08,679
the 120 is the darkest of the four

359
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,199
they're all very glisteny and blonde and

360
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:13,958
full melt um and I guess what we're

361
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,319
going to do is hit them and talk about

362

365
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,560
in here from the 90 when you first

366
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,399

really nice resins they're supporting

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,039
their community they're doing toy drives

404
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,120
and raising cash here and there for

405
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:09,000
different

406
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:12,318
people that is a great for 25

00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:19,519
it was blonde it was full melt super

409
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:22,318
tasty totally got me nicely I definitely

410
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:25,199
got nicely medicated from it me I find

411
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,838
that that 7even that 25 is a just more

412
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,240
more rotchy on the throat that's what it

413
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,879
but definitely the the flavor the h it

414
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,480
could be that it's still not dry as well

415
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,440
though cuz there is still a tiny bit of

416
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,839
moisture content in there yes there is

417
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,759
and uh you know we're jumping the gun

418
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,879
cuz we're

419
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:42,079
excited um and it's worth it I but we'll

420
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,559
we'll do this again in about a week or

421
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:49,119
so in Toronto and you'll see that this

422
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:50,599
hash is uh much smoother even the 25 I'm

423
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,319
actually going to go home and do a run

424
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:54,839
of My Little Pony for Toronto so I'll

425
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,879
definitely film that with my little

426
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,079
tripod and uh maybe I'll get my neighbor

427
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,919
to come over and give me a hand tonight

428
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,319
so that'll be kind of fun

429
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,600
you know what definitely I'll bring some

430
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:07,798
of my uh treats

431
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:09,399
uh definitely um this is amazing which

432
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:11,599
one are you feeling here John you know

433
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,159
what I'm going to jump over to the 120

434
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,319
all right well what do you think I think

435
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:22,520
that you are welld deserving of

436
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:24,759
it oo these are just dabbing so gently a

437
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:27,440
gentle dab for the

438
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:30,480
John my God I can smell that in the air

439
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,600
just as I moved the dab by my nose tiny

440
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,159
little bit of Sizzle on the 120 showing

441
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:37,918
that there is indeed um a little bit of

442
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,679
moisture content still in there we're

443
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,480
not so lucky to be able to get hash

444
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,600
really dry in 48 hours here in British

445
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,279
Columbia uh not at least uh in the

446
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:49,719
coastal region

447
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,720
where where I

448
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,399
reside all right so well I guess I'm

449
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,720
going to join you with

450
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,720
that wow oh that's a thick

451
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
little

452
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:07,359
120 I definitely have to say is um boom

453
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,359
shank

454
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,119
yeah I was going to say I'm I'm still in

455
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,360
recovery mode

456
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,798
here oh my god did that taste good

457
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,719
though amazing The Taste on that was

458
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:30,720
tfold from the

459
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,839
25 and that's just a different size

460
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,038
gland

461
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,319
head and I'm sure there's a science

462
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:44,679
behind it whether those smaller heads

463
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,678
are more

464
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:51,200
bulbous or have a smaller tpine

465
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:54,360
turpenoid content I'm not sure but wow

466
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,000
from the bioassay aspect that was really

467
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,038
tasty always what I've talked about so

468
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,720
much is the different smell are the

469
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,200
different flavors that we get from every

470
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,720
different Micron and that's one thing it

471
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,679
paid attention to me when you showed me

472
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,640
how to wash my medicine properly and I

473
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,919
was like wow like really the difference

474
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,759
and then like with me I like the 73 but

475
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,200
the 90 fresh frozen works so amazing too

476
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:21,240
tot moving on to the

477
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,360
45 um it

00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:54,359
you said was going to just stop

490
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,240
everything so that's like the killer

491
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,798
he's like

492
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,519
really as we were talking in the

493
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,038
beginning we were talking about how this

494
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:06,038
monsterous hit was going to set you down

495
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,679
like the last one did yeah well here's

496
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:11,558
another one to set us down it's a dunk

497
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,080
not a dab this is

498
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:16,519
uh definitely got some Sizzle going on

499
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,759
there but you know what we made that

500
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:22,158
yesterday at this time that's what we're

501
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:26,599
doing yesterday we were actually making

502
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:30,559
this and just because we've been waiting

503
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:33,839
so long to smoke this like 3

504
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:33,839
months that was

505
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:45,759
unbelievable holy shets

506
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:48,678
shets down with a dunking and that last

507
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:50,599
one it really uh well you know what I'm

508
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,960
done that taste

509
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:56,558
was again even

510
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:00,360
better

511
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:01,278
cleaner and more potent

512
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:04,278
than the

513
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:08,798
120 that was strong that was 73 I love

514
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:12,119
the 73 ho [ __ ] a go wrong with the

515
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:15,319
73 and for me that one was the smoothest

516
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:19,199
out of the the 25 was madebe cough the

517
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:22,399
120 wasn't as much but it did the

518
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,558
73 it's coming that was like three three

519
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,798
hits though from my other two that's

520
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:29,278
that piece of 73 I hit was bigger than

521
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:32,440
both the pieces

522
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:34,880
of one of 120 and 25 Comin was one we

523
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,480

God once again another level of

546
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:24,278
smoothness I wouldn't say it's tastier

547
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,639
than the 73 but it tastes

548
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:30,359
different something to attributed to the

549
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,360
smoothness of it but yet

550
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:36,639
it still really grabs

551
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,278
you in the back of the

552
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,679
throat
