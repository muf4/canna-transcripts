1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,199
hey welcome to Bubble man's world uh

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,519
we're here with tip four in the

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:13,718
installment of water extraction tips um

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,118
I've covered uh a few different things

5
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:20,039
from Ice to um curing and drying

6
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:22,359
processes but today I wanted to address

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,760
a question that I get a 100 or so times

8
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:30,359
a day and it's the infamous is the

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,280
bubble dabbable is it dabbable is your

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,640
bubble dabbable does it dab I get this

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,920
question over and over and over again so

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,759
I wanted to answer it for all of you

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,520
okay um the dab ability of a of a water

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:49,718
hash or a dry sift is really dependent

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,239
upon the quality of that resin now a dry

16
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,520
sifter and a wet washer what we do as

17
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:58,000
hash makers we isolate the glandular

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,280
Tricom head and we do that by various

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,799
means uh water and ice extract ction

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,799
which is the easy no-brainer way and of

21
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,879
course um uh we also do dry sifting

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:12,439
methods so when we isolate the gland

23
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:16,560
head to a 99% pure gland head you get

24
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:19,839
what we call Purity now Purity will not

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,400
give you a dabbable product but Purity

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,200
plus quality will and unfortunately the

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,000
quality of hash is never decided by the

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,400
hash maker unless of course he is also

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,280
the grower so it's really the grower and

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,079
the genetics of that strain that are

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,320
going to decide the quality How well was

32
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:41,239
the resin grown was it was it grown to

33
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,639
mature the resin head out and the wax

34
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:45,519
membrane to be very thin upon Harvest or

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,319
was the grower focused on vegetative

36
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,879
yields and flowering periods these

37
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,279
prohibition based mindsets that how much

38
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,239
can I get and how fast can I get it are

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,920
detrimental to the cannabinoid profile

40
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:02,599
and the hash maker so is your product

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,560
appable well if your product is a 5year

42
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:09,159
cured Master cush then absolutely it is

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,759
dabbable this stuff's been curing um I

44
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:12,560
had it in a freezer for the last 2 and 1

45
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:14,679
half years to preserve Tarpin but for 2

46
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,400
and 1/2 years I had it out in a various

47
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,000
of ways and I basically cured it up uh

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,800
to a real nice incredible flavor and

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,598
taste and uh yeah going to take a little

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,519
dab with you right now just to see uh is

51
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,318
