56
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,840
yeah I'm looking on YouTube and I'm not

57
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:11,310
seeing it playing that's because you're

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,550
not looking at the right one it doesn't

59
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,920
play out on the one that we that I have

60
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,439
to the one I start that tells everyone

61
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,299
there's gonna be a show tomorrow that

62
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,340
goes through YouTube and I used to just

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,650
push a button called Google Chat and I

64
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,709
could go live through there but now soom

65
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:31,200
doesn't hook up that way when I go live

66
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,259
on zoom it starts a new YouTube box

67
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:39,929
immediately so I just put that into the

68
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:42,840
link I put it in an OG brick like that

69
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,300
post there oh maybe I'll go over to the

70
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,610
other one and post it because yeah I'm

71
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,189
in in both right now I probably want to

72
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:56,370
switch to speak review - it's on

73
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:58,169
grid-view I like the grid view but I

74
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,060
could spit I could change it we could go

75
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:02,009
to speaker view how's it I have a

76
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,120
question posted of the exact same

77
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:08,969
something that's funny like Sam

78
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,959
okay I'm using a microphone I'm gonna

79
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:16,738
turn it off and see if you still hear me

80
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:18,238
still hear me we can't yet don't

81
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,939
it's my on and off switch and the

82
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,779
microphone is useless the mic works

83
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:26,550
great but it doesn't turn on and off

84
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:27,759
well as long as it turns on that's all

85
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:33,250
that's important Sam

86
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,839
because we need to hear you yes well you

87
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,170
don't need to hear me anymore because

88
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:46,149
you could just read everything I know in

89
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:48,400
my bibliography no oh so what's going on

90
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:51,339
in the world of cannabis this last week

91
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:55,329
geez I I saw some funny stuff the other

92
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:56,949
day I found an account on Instagram and

93
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:58,779
at first I thought it was going to be

94
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:01,479
one of these sort of trolling accounts

95
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:06,429
that just trolls any aspect of legal

96
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:07,930
corporate cannabis well it was these

97
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,590
guys had a whole bunch of information

98
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:14,019
about what's the name of this company

99
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:17,289
the James II Wagner cultivation

100
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:18,689
corporation and Ravin question the other

101
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,970
one you gotta check out this guy James

102
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:24,939
JW see you can't even believe the stuff

103
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,710
that he says it's so ridiculous he

104
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:30,370
forgot the word I guess he doesn't use

105
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:32,409
the term entourage he uses the he's like

106
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,079
well it's about the cohort effect you

107
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,330
know it's all of our cannabis is 2.5%

108
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,579
terpenes minimum and it's all about the

109
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:41,379
cohort effect and trying to listen to

110
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:43,209
this guy talk I was it what the hell is

111
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:45,519
this guy talking about sort of went in a

112
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,930
little deeper and realized that I mean

113
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,519
we all know this coming from the

114
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,189
industry for as long as we've been here

115
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:53,379
but there are absolute frauds entering

116
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:56,050
the industry who are now just going to

117
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,969
sort of you know fake it till they make

118
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,550
it I guess like some of the things that

119
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,730
you hear these these these people say

120
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:06,250
you're funny Marcus I'm really honest so

121
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:10,600
when I start my cannabis cup a I'm gonna

122
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:14,250
call it frog cannabis fraud cannabis

123
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:19,390
from skunkman Sam won't get you high but

124
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:23,589
hey know everything I say about it we'll

125
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:25,899
be alive I like it I think oh I think

126
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:28,509
you should do that brand I think we'll

127
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:32,049
we'll release it in California and we'll

128
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:34,389
see how it goes there and we'll go from

129
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,699
there it'll fit right into the market

130
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:38,889
here now what's goin on with your market

131
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:40,110
like seriously is it just the nightmare

132
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,930
now like is it didn't

133
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,780
it's recovering it's recovering you know

134
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,370
we took it like at my shop we lost

135
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,019
almost a fifth of our customers to the

136
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,490
underground market yeah for a whole year

137
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,560
a whole year

138
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,960
but it's starting to come back now you

139
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,519
know because I mean so many of our

140
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,349
friends couldn't get into dispensaries

141
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,209
or get legal licenses so what were we

142
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,220
supposed to say the underground market

143
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:04,229
stayed alive that's probably the way it

144
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,740
should be you know if make such

145
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,879
restrictive regulations and then our

146
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,699
friends turn to the underground market

147
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,170
to buy their cannabis but I think part

148
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,599
of the bounce-back is you know the

149
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,370
quality is really up raised it's

150
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,430
incredible I can hardly even believe it

151
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,990
myself and of course we've got all this

152
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,850
toxic products on the market now with

153
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,160
these vape pens and that thickener stuff

154
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:29,100
giving people pneumonia what a nightmare

155
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,020
so we're seeing the bounce-back we've

156
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:40,110
almost got all of our games back now so

157
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:42,990
that's good smoke cannabis yeah some of

158
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,340
those cheap vape pens that popcorn lung

159
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,740
and some of the other things you see

160
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,819
going on I mean oh yeah I saw an article

161
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,590
the other day and they were like it's an

162
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,180
epidemic and I'm like like more of an

163
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:52,979
epidemic than half a million people

164
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,350
being killed from tobacco every year in

165
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,150
the US and like more of an epidemic than

166
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,850
three million people being killed from

167
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:01,979
alcohol-related deaths like I mean sure

168
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:05,910
it's probably bad but it's gotta still

169
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:09,000
be harm reduction to smoking radioactive

170
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:14,400
tobacco not only that the newest

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,699
epidemic in America is the random mass

172
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:33,149
killers I mean it used to be once a year

173
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:36,299
now it's once a week or twice a week so

174
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:38,069
when it's you strong ammonia so yeah I

175
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,299
mean to the point no harm reduction now

176
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:45,840
that we grow I use that stuff anymore or

177
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:47,370
well this is why we started testing for

178
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,680
this simple fact we wanted to know what

179
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,509
we couldn't see and once we started

180
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,319
testing we started to find all kind of

181
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:56,259
unsavory not good things

182
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,120
and that's one reason you may people

183
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:59,740
were complaining oh you're we costs more

184
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,970
well yeah we have to test fit we have to

185
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,060
pay employees we have to do all these

186
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,639
realities that come with you know

187
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:09,309
staffing 60 some-odd people to be here

188
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,710
and actually deal with and handle

189
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:15,369
everyone from patients to retail so

190
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:17,200
definitely we're seeing it bounce back

191
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,169
from people because they realized that

192
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,120
they are getting safe product because

193
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:23,979
there is a a plethora of bad products

194
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,049
out there I'm not saying every legal

195
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,730
products out there bad look I used to

196
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:29,799
support the black market used to be part

197
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,300
of the black market used to purvey some

198
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,509
of the best stuff in the black market so

199
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:38,049
I hadn't in the black market

200
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:40,509
okay still they said it was a third it's

201
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:41,889
probably closer to half now or you know

202
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:43,929
the numbers are bigger than what they

203
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:46,899
anticipated originally that's just the

204
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:51,099
fact of the situation but we need to

205
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:55,840
test everything correctly CED I don't

206
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,730
want it exactly Sam does not want a CBD

207
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,980
where as so many people want it and on

208
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,019
top of that I'm getting calls I talked

209
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,730
to people weekly who are asking hey

210
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,199
where do I get a safe CBD part what's

211
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,330
the safe sea Beach product I could order

212
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,310
in the middle of Texas and somewhere and

213
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,110
I tell everybody buyer beware

214
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,759
you know caveat emptor that's the

215
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,070
reality I have no idea what's out there

216
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,899
you have no idea if it's tested ask if

217
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,730
it's tested and that's what we tell

218
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,980
people is you know as much as they don't

219
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,840
want to hear it it's safest still in the

220
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,050
dispensaries to purchase because it's

221
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,690
actually safe efficacious as well as

222
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:30,129
it's been approved as well as it has lot

223
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,040
numbers if there's a problem it can

224
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:35,350
actually be pulled from shelves etc etc

225
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,139
whereas in the black market same thing

226
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,940
happened before 64 happened oh you don't

227
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:42,220
want it okay we'll just take this

228
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,690
somewhere else which they do and that

229
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,820
cannabis goes somewhere else all

230
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,770
together and where it goes nobody knows

231
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,810
and nobody knows to ask these questions

232
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:51,909
about why does this taste funny because

233
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:54,909
they're just going with the one choice

234
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:57,089
their dealer has we need legalization in

235
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:59,679
every state and I'm tired of people in

236
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,480
its where it's not legal yet or going I

237
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,219
got arrested can I get a lawyer still

238
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,980
you know there's still a lot of fight

239
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,059
that we have to do from you know testing

240
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,859
to a state

241
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:10,718
you know in states where it's not even

242
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:12,278
considered legal yet you know look at

243
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,379
Kansas look at some of the other places

244
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:16,599
in middle America where you know people

245
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:18,908
are wallowing while watching everybody

246
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:20,619
else get successful or get sick from

247
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:23,048
this cannabis so they're watching the

248
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:24,999
full caveat of reality of what we're

249
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:27,489
experiencing and wondering how can they

250
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:28,269
bring it to their reality yeah well I'll

251
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:30,069
tell you me

252
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:33,969
all right we're Sam being worried about

253
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:35,889
not getting CBD you know it works even

254
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:38,169
crazier the other way around because I

255
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:41,019
know someone who's super sensitive just

256
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:44,168
to THC does not have an interest in

257
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:46,688
having it in their body purchased a CBD

258
00:11:44,168 --> 00:11:49,688
product and I guess it ended up being

259
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:54,009
contaminated like vastly contaminated

260
00:11:49,688 --> 00:11:56,019
with THC that's super cooked it was like

261
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:58,269
she's a mother she was like she told me

262
00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:00,879
she was about to go to her kids like

263
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:03,489
play at the school and had to bring all

264
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,319
her other kids and it was not a good

265
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:08,229
vibe it was kind of like you know like

266
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:09,519
we need to make make sure that for

267
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:11,919
people like that that aren't really

268
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,558
cannabis users but they're now using

269
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:17,318
some of the you know maybe this person

270
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:19,208
was just using like a pure isolate and

271
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:21,908
it was working really nicely for them

272
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:24,368
until they got super stoned and now

273
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:26,379
they're like paranoid because it's like

274
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:28,629
they you know they took like an ml or

275
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:30,099
whatever it was it would be like the

276
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:32,199
equivalent of us eating like a strong

277
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:35,408
brownie or something she was she was lit

278
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:46,149
for a levy you have a poster on your

279
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:47,019
wall behind you from that hashish in no

280
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:49,389
it's funny

281
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:53,009
me and my wife stayed there for two

282
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:55,329
weeks in the hotel of course you did

283
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:57,068
yeah I found that poster out on dead

284
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:59,019
tour one time some guy had made a bunch

285
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:01,448
of them back in India and found him in a

286
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:03,729
garage was just sawing him on dead tour

287
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,958
so I think they're like real OG from

288
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:10,209
back in the day that place was really

289
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:12,188
ready yeah they had like a dozen

290
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:14,738
different kinds of cannabis and the

291
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:18,188
dozen different kinds of hashish and all

292
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:21,929
I had to do was knock on my floor and

293
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:21,928
somebody would come up and deliver me

294
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,149
yesterday I was thinking man

295
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:27,069
legalization is nice I can get all the

296
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:29,289
best flowers there's good concentrates

297
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,000
but I can't get any traditional hash I

298
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:32,889
mean that alone is probably worth the

299
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,049
trip to the Netherlands just to try or

300
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:39,059
you know where maybe the homeland where

301
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:41,559
it's sourced we were there in 71 72 when

302
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:43,719
marijuana and hashish was still illegal

303
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:55,689
it made it illegal a couple years later

304
00:13:43,720 --> 00:14:00,759
in by a guy named Sharma but I don't

305
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:04,089
remember very well it was quite a while

306
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,309
ago resurrection that's what I say

307
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:09,100
that's an opportunity right there one

308
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:22,208
day when worldwide global legalization

309
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:24,070
hits was that your spots a motel room

310
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:27,159
that's incredible well there you go

311
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,050
people there's a idea and concept in a

312
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:31,000
legal area that you have seen in the

313
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:32,649
past that somebody who's watching is

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,570
like what could I do in the world of

315
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:36,429
cannabis well there you go that you can

316
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,430
go open up a hotel in one of these legal

317
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:40,778
states and provide it for a nice

318
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:42,639
comfortable place for people to be I

319
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:44,470
know there's air B&amp;B ease but I don't

320
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,240
really know of too many hotels at this

321
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,480
particular Junction unless I'm incorrect

322
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,448
you see the top there was only about

323
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,610
four or five six rooms in the hotel

324
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:56,948
check check out the top of the sign the

325
00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:00,370
eden has she sent her what does it say

326
00:14:56,948 --> 00:15:04,509

330
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,929

342
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,779
Oh some of your old photo yeah like

344
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,279
are I mean they're epic they're

345
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,629
literally like you you got to do a book

346
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,009
one day I know you hate to be

347
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:55,110
photographed and you hate to be in

348
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:57,000
pictures but do it when you're like gone

349
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,830
and passed because people need to see

350
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,440
those those images I feel blessed to

351
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:04,740
have been yeah after I die I will

352
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,100
definitely make a book yeah once you're

353
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:13,129
dead you should make a book did you got

354
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:17,310
to get on that but once you're dead yep

355
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:21,179
puffs - I'll puff - Sam being alive and

356
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:29,029
talking to them I'm testing the karmic

357
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:36,209
up I don't know so it was number two

358
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:38,639
everybody's opinion - compared to the

359
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:41,040
other one was called Google Hangouts in

360
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,350
my opinion is that I like it I like the

361
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,990
option of doing like grid view versus

362
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,269
speaker view I like the fact that first

363
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:51,870
for whatever reason on this technology

364
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:54,659
us not having headphones and all and

365
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:57,240
constantly muting each other causes less

366
00:16:54,659 --> 00:17:00,809
of a problem feel like the audio and the

367
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,299
video is cleaner and I kind of miss

368
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:05,159
being able to post right through YouTube

369
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:06,599
the way we originally did it but I

370
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:14,180
figured out a way to work it so I'm not

371
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:14,179

430
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:54,499
security guards so we can't get away

431
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:56,658
with this [ __ ] so we go to the top we

432
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:57,950
find a stairwell well we didn't know the

433
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:58,970
stairwell was there we were waiting for

434
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,110

435
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,269
escalator

436
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:04,159
and then the guys like note the

437
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:05,450
escalators not go down you gotta take

438
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,570
the stairs of the elevator

439
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:11,059
as soon as you said stairs really yes we

440
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:12,529

441
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:14,629
no one in there we smoke two three

442
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:16,129
[ __ ] joints right away went in sat

443
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,540
down again and then we did it then we

444
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:21,680
did it again but we're doing it real

445
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:24,589
sneaky on the other side actually you

446
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,190
get much higher if you sneak it in the

447
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:28,970
bathroom

448
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,680
that's my bad too

449
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,420
we were gonna do that but we didn't end

450
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,670
up doing it we smoked in the stairwell

451
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,080
and we're smoking we still work up a

452
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,850
joint week we're like Coach we could

453
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,949
hear someone so we're being real quiet

454
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:41,480
and we can hear me give up looking

455
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,799
around looking we come around the corner

456
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,390
and there's two people doing the same

457
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,919
thing we were doing looking over to

458
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,230
someone that we just started [ __ ]

459
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,680
laughing shared the joints together and

460
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:53,480
[ __ ] and carrying on the contraband

461
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,549
getting kicked out of potentially

462
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,349
getting kicked out when you're VIP you

463
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:59,750
got the Good Seats you just you've

464
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:02,869
traveled ten hours or more on your

465
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:06,049
motorcycle a super nice hotel it's like

466
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:07,389
dude don't get us kicked out of here

467
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:10,129
tonight

468
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:12,230
that's the added risk in front of it all

469
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:17,870
as Sam said it gets just a little bit

470
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:20,630
higher you know I only got kicked out of

471
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:24,619
one concert and that was because I took

472
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:27,880
a portable dat digital recorder with me

473
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:31,909
he just pocket-sized like a larger

474
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:35,210
walkman but he refused to let me in with

475
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:41,750
it and I refuse to let somebody watch

476
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:43,340
over it for me so I left hey Darren I'm

477
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,859
thinking about the concert you go to the

478
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:48,019
top so you can smoke weed to come down

479
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:50,269
that staircase where every step is a

480
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:51,920
different size like one's a foot one's

481
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:53,509
three foot then two foot it's like

482
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,980
you're holding on to the railing does

483
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:57,789
that happen to anyone else

484
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,470
like can't they just make standard steps

485
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:02,210
there so actually the steps were

486
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:07,940
standard you weren't

487
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:12,519
hey Sam check this out oh it's a bad

488
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:12,519
recorder for mark

489
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:24,369
oh yeah someplace tasty shows from the

490
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:29,700
early nineties anyone think and coughing

491
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:29,699
in the background master's bro masters

492
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:35,829
let me show you what's on my wall

493
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,558
hey Darren just for shits and giggles

494
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:42,668
real quick my my foxhole in the Gulf was

495
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:52,779
named 22 acacia Avenue which is a maiden

496
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:55,390
Sun oh yeah what Sam sure it does demel

497
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:57,789
development of indication specific

498
00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:00,509
cannabis scheme of Arts to improve

499
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:03,190
efficacy and safety sorry

500
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:06,339
Rousseau and Mark Lewis yeah you're

501
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:08,230
gonna stick to brave that buddy is this

502
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:09,909
the poster that was in leiden that the

503
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:14,789
International cannabinoid Research

504
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:17,230
Society yeah sure that is hilarious dude

505
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:20,649
how about that study that just came out

506
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:23,140
about the cannabis flavonoid fights

507
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:25,600
pancreatic pancreatic cancer which is

508
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,070
absolutely terminal and they finally

509
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:31,599
found something that helps that cannabis

510
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:35,319
that's some flavonoid in campus science

511
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:37,808
everybody raves about flavonoids but if

512
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:40,539
you smoke them they're deactivated

513
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:45,789
you can't smoke flavor you gotta eat

514
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:47,710
them orally into the Z grade can you

515
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:52,089
suspend them so they won't degrade so

516
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:53,200
you can ingest them I don't know yeah

517
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:56,619
absolutely

518
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,539
yes go Candace go Candace go chemist yes

519
00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:01,239
oh yeah they'll do great if you heat

520
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:03,690
them up the coughing like the the color

521
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,849
that you seen a lot of cannabis extract

522
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,860
has to deal with flavonoids flavonoids

523
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:11,439
are highly colored and they're very

524
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:14,409
sensitive to exposure to air and oxygen

525
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,660
so they little dope I think they're

526
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:19,029
somewhat responsible for that so-called

527
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,159
red ring of death that you often find in

528
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:23,710
distillate where you'll see the

529
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,020
distillate that's exposed to the air

530
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,549
often turns sort of like this

531
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:29,349
reddish color I think that there's a

532
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,759
flavonoid chemistry it's involved in

533
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:33,549
that I don't know that for sure but

534
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:40,529
they're very highly colored compounds

535
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:49,059
I'm sorry in the resin head and you know

536
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:50,799
eaten the whole recipe I don't think

537
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:52,599
they're orally deactivated I mean

538
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:57,039
certainly there's a lot of flavonoids in

539
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:59,529
the human diet I just don't know about

540
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,990
their bioavailability and what

541
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:05,139
prevalence you get just from like an

542
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:07,329
oral consumption of cannabis you know

543
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,580
has done some work on this

544
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:12,460
I think nei Pro has done some work on

545
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:14,949
this I think they have a bunch of

546
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,019
unreleased information on flavonoids

547
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,710
yeah I mean an interesting question for

548
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:25,889
Sam as has anyone ever bred cannabis for

549
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:25,890
flavonoid content yes there are people

550
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:37,000
we have discovered in about 2000 that

551
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:40,120
the terpenes had the power to modulate

552
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,190
and potentially cannabinoids I was going

553
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:45,579
to look at later no it's next and then

554
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:49,360
dr. Michelle Amanda portrayed a few

555
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:57,299
others told me if you smoke completely

556
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:57,299
deactivated potentiate

557
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,389
does that mean raw so you couldn't like

558
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,019
say bake them into a brownie or

559
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,020
something like that

560
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:19,599
my feeling is if it decarboxylate it

561
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:22,750
will deactivate it maybe night so as

562
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,909
fresh as possible I think they're

563
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,950
thermally degraded so I think that's the

564
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:30,759
issue so again maybe this is an option

565
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:32,529
for you know juicing or things that you

566
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:35,769
know just carried out at lower

567
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:39,160
temperatures to isolate the extract so

568
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:44,139
so long as the extracts not

569
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:46,779
thermally were subjected to any Heat it

570
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,900
shouldn't degrade the flavonoids now

571
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:53,500
again I know that they're highly

572
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:57,100
sensitive to air and they oxidize and

573
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:59,200
form very highly color compounds and so

574
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:02,199
certainly just exposure to air or shelf

575
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,059
life could be an issue with slides but I

576
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,590
think what they turn into our actually

577
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:08,859
degradation products that are also

578
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:10,329
cancer fighting compounds as well so

579
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:13,929
they're just sort of like metastable

580
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:16,349
compounds that yeah do have somewhat of

581
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:19,180
a half-life but certainly have a lot of

582
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:23,230
biological activity and flavonoids are

583
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:24,759
rich in in antioxidant properties and

584
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,740
all kinds of things like that because

585
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:29,470
they're they're at their phenols and

586
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:35,519
these things react with ultraviolet

587
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:35,519
light and air like antioxidants should

588
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:49,989
twenty years later

589
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:52,059
99% of the are still there I was I was

590
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:54,160
contacted this week by a gentleman whose

591
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:57,009
wife is going through for Stage three

592
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,860
attic cancer and I put him in touch with

593
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,519
that article and he was like well what

594
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:03,099
do I do

595
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:05,109
how do I get it now for her and of

596
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:08,159
course I immediately shrugged because I

597
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:11,409
don't is is the patient a cannabis user

598
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,240
how's the patient because she is

599
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,220
responding to cannabis I have her on

600
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,670
different ratios of she's trying to

601
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:22,539
different priority no SACEUR she is in

602
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:24,100
cannabis a casual user barely once or

603
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:24,789
twice a year at a concert or something

604
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:26,980
like that

605
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:30,099
yeah I mean so this again speaks to that

606
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:32,500
notion that all cannabis uses is medical

607
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:37,329
because you know the cannabinoids

608
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:40,329
especially a CBD analyte basically act

609
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:43,990
as antioxidants in the body and fight

610
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:46,329
reactive oxygenated species that end up

611
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:49,059
leading to mutations that cause cancer

612
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:51,220
and the great thing about cannabinoids

613
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:52,470
is they're fat soluble unlike a lot of

614
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,839
the antioxidants

615
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,880
human diet which are water-soluble so

616
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:59,490
they protect fatty tissues like the

617
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:04,110
pancreas and the brain and the liver

618
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:08,548
from oxidative damage might really help

619
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:11,250
her is to eat resin in other words dry

620
00:29:08,548 --> 00:29:13,889
scepter water shift that has not

621
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:17,730
degraded at all and is basically still

622
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:22,788
THC a because she won't get very high

623
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:22,788
but she'll get a monoi effects

624
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:30,798
I wanted to welcome wade into the room

625
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:32,778
and Josh and Kelly as well snuck in

626
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,908
there I didn't I had to like move the

627
00:29:32,778 --> 00:29:36,919
thing over it was it just showed like

628
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:41,179
five or six of us so welcome to you guys

629
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:44,929
as well Harris hey good morning I waited

630
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:47,720
yeah hi guys my video camera is not

631
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:49,369
working today so I'm just listening in

632
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,368
and I'll pop and occasionally thank you

633
00:29:49,368 --> 00:29:54,709
nice to see you guys we appreciate in

634
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:56,928
all forms Wade we appreciate you in all

635
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,850
forms as long as we can hear your wisdom

636
00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:00,350
we're good

637
00:29:57,849 --> 00:30:03,769
there's something very soothing about

638
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:07,699
Wade's voice I think he could narrate

639
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:09,679
like a lot of good [ __ ] he has a gentle

640
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,110
timbre in his voice that is very

641
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,179
reassuring and calming it just puts me

642
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:16,308
at ease I'm like kind of at the end of

643
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:17,778
my seat kind of a guy and when Wade

644
00:30:16,308 --> 00:30:18,408
starts talking I'm a little bit like

645
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:20,929
alright

646
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:23,389
that Wade talk just like Wade song Shh

647
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:26,809
tell the story he's don't have much to

648
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:29,868
say this morning that's what I was gonna

649
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:33,200
say but wait he'll he'll speak when he

650
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:34,308
has something to say and I like that as

651
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,230
well about you son

652
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:39,710
I'm the other way I'll just say anything

653
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,099
any time exactly I do want to throw out

654
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,220
there

655
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:45,678
I love the conversation around that

656
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:49,339
flavonoid and the pancreatic cancer

657
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,690
study and yeah it really brings me back

658
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:55,898
to cold ethanol extractions and or

659
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:59,119
things that preserve the acid forms

660
00:30:55,898 --> 00:31:00,859
there's a whole area in these flavonoids

661
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:03,069
that likely are going to turn out to be

662
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:05,839
really interesting when we get out of

663
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:09,589
that thing of feeling like we have to

664
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:11,898
vaporize or smoke our cannabis in order

665
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:13,908
to get benefit from it so here's a

666
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:16,219
question to the panel what do you guys

667
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:19,340
think about different cannabinoid

668
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:22,278
profiles being present in the different

669
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:24,970
types of trichomes and the reason I say

670
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:27,349
this is I've noticed some difference in

671
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:29,298
I've noticed that the differentiator

672
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:32,028
between oil production and hash

673
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:34,548
production comes from the bulbous head

674
00:31:32,028 --> 00:31:36,940
meaning when I do mechanical screen

675
00:31:34,548 --> 00:31:38,849
separation or water extraction I can

676
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,380
isolate the glandular trichomes head

677
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:43,809
mostly off the capitate stocked in the

678
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:46,570
capitate sessile but the bulbous tend to

679
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:49,690
sit on that single Stipe cell and really

680
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:51,700
hug the leaf they don't snap off in the

681
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,170
water extraction process quite as easy

682
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,990
and they don't really even break off

683
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:58,660
when you make them extremely cold with

684
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:01,720
with screens and what I've noticed is

685
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:05,320
that cultivars that are high in CBD give

686
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,089
very very little hash from mechanical

687
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:09,189
screen separation and usually give them

688
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:13,029
much higher sometimes two times higher

689
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:15,100
like literally 50% of the yield is in

690
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:18,639
those bulbous heads and they're just one

691
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:21,939
resin that you get from CBD has a drier

692
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,350
feel to your hand yeah it's a totally

693
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,180
it's it's definitely different but I

694
00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:28,149
just wonder like if we're ever going to

695
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,980
go deep into what's being produced in

696
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,509
those different types of profiles and is

697
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,309
it when you put the two together that

698
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:35,079
you get this full profile that's hash

699
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:37,089
and when you put the three together when

700
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,099
you make oil because I remember from

701
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:41,439
being the bubble guy and being all into

702
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:43,859
obsessive about isolating out the heads

703
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,730
into different micron sizes and

704
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:47,859
realizing that there were actually

705
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:50,829
different highs and different effects

706
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:53,079
present in those different sized heads

707
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:55,599
because I've seen it over and over again

708
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:58,659
that I started to tell my oil friends

709
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,279
listen like why not make some hash first

710
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,380
so when you make your oil you've got

711
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:04,839
like some 90 microns oil or some

712
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:07,000
seventy-three micron oil and the few

713
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:09,339
that did it were definitely like had the

714
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,769
profound revelation that yeah that's

715
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:13,240
quite different but I just wonder if

716
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:14,769
there's going to be a conversation if

717
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,900
we're ever going to get to a point where

718
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:19,029
we can really decipher you know

719
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,370
isolating those heads separately seeing

720
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:23,019
what profiles produce in those heads and

721
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:25,449
just seeing if you guys have noticed

722
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:28,750
anything you really want different

723
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:33,370
cannabinoids the best idea is to breed

724
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:40,119
it with those particular cannabinoids in

725
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:43,049
faces there it would be a great study to

726
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:47,679
do in the fact that there's so much more

727
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:50,230
testing of cannabis down and you know

728
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,900
labs that are you know looking at

729
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,420
different

730
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:56,330
different aspects of cannabinoid

731
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:58,519
chemistry it's it's perfectly a valid

732
00:33:56,329 --> 00:34:02,210
study to do you know what's the impact

733
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:06,079
in terms of the chemical profile on on

734
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:09,320
screen size and and it would be a easy

735
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:13,730
study to do easy just mechanically if

736
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:16,730
you had all the instrumentation at your

737
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:18,440
access at a place that was growing

738
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:21,320
multiple cultivars you could generate

739
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,260
lots of data doing that study real quick

740
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,700
it's very a good study to do I think

741
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,680
it's gonna be any need to be studies

742
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:30,500
plural I think you'd need one on almost

743
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,599
every you know macron that available

744
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,219
currently and then you'd also need to

745
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:35,989
start to look at some other macron so

746
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:38,209
you could start to reach those so you

747
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:39,500
can isolate those even smaller ones

748
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,360
because as you know they're in all

749
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,489
different sizes and every different

750
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,289
genetic considering its growth cycle I

751
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:47,119
just want to say that I really

752
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:50,539
appreciate it the way he pronounced

753
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:53,389
micron macron I totally liked it I dug

754
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:58,360
it and I'm gonna smoke a bowl to it in

755
00:34:53,389 --> 00:35:01,639
fact right now it's really mad

756
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:05,480
I wasn't even busted I was straight like

757
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:07,329
I appreciated it you know I'm just gonna

758
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,559
say is like from a patient perspective

759
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:11,090
and when I separate and then do all

760
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:12,820
different mark you've taught me

761
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:16,010
everything from separation from how to

762
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:17,000
refine my hash even to my my dryer set

763
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,130
there's stuff like that and I always

764
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,019
talk about the different levels like

765
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:23,660
even I have that three or four it's

766
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:26,030
really fine there's a press much but the

767
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:28,250
resin that comes from it is just by far

768
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:31,160
more relaxing and I'm always wondering

769
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:32,809
if those you know has anybody ever

770
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:35,420
tested the different microbes that say

771
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:36,799
I've seen different profiles it's not

772
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,740
all the same profile but just in the

773
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,050
cannabinoid levels from what I've seen I

774
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:45,739
mean I would point to the research of

775
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:47,510
palm albergue in the late 70s and early

776
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:50,119
80's from University of Indiana

777
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:52,310
Bloomington who had a schedule one

778
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:56,380
license and did a lot of his testing

779
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:59,539
just on hemp but did do some testing to

780
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,610
basically his publications got like 12

781
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:04,519
publications in a period of about 10

782
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:09,380
years on you know the generation

783
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:11,900
of cannabinoids in the trico and he did

784
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,090
you know these micro pipetting

785
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,059
experiments where he actually went in

786
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:19,280
underneath the microscope and sucked the

787
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:22,279
fluid right out of the trico and

788
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:26,420
analyzed that by GC you know this is

789
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:29,210
back in like the late 70s and I wouldn't

790
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:34,099
visited his lab at Bloomington Indiana

791
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:40,539
at the University and that's also where

792
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:43,880
Rob Clark went yes he was working under

793
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:47,389
license so borrowing off the further off

794
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:51,829
of just even the Mac Ron's then even the

795
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:55,659
just taking vets migrants taking each

796
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:57,860
individual each individual one and then

797
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:59,929
vaporizing it at different temperatures

798
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:03,140
to to also see the different variables

799
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:05,059
that come off of each you know the one

800
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:06,949
that I'm most interested in is the

801
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:11,059
difference between the capitate sessile

802
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:14,089
and stalk for yeah what he found is that

803
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:15,949
there's the the the what I think re

804
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:17,840
doing this off memory so if I don't get

805
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:19,939
this right just look up his papers but

806
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,430
there's these cells that are called the

807
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:25,070
Stipe cells which is kind of like the

808
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:27,589
transition spells between the stock and

809
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,960
the bulbous head right so it's like

810
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:32,780
right where that right where the

811
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,570
junction of that gland is that Stipe

812
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:37,580
cells and I think they identified that

813
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:40,280
as being the area that's basically

814
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:42,949
making cannabinoids which are then

815
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,870
excreted into these things called

816
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:47,359
plastids which are these things that

817
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:50,449
migrate toward the edge of the membrane

818
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,550
and create the oil on the plant so I

819
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:54,349
think if I remember correctly and this

820
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,780
is all for memories so don't get me on

821
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:59,719
this but if you're if you're getting the

822
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:02,660
plant at the right period of time you're

823
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:06,399
you're getting it as that cycle is

824
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:08,719
completed such that the biosynthetic

825
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,750
pathway that's leading to both the

826
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:15,049
terpenes and that cannabinoid

827
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:17,550
biosynthesis has kind of like completed

828
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:20,280
its shuttle of all of these compounds

829
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:22,410
from those type cells into this what's

830
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,540
called secretory cavity I believe it's

831
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:26,940
called and there's just a bunch of these

832
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:29,519
little vessels that basically have the

833
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,470
oil that are like ready to burst or

834
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,139
ready to migrate to the surface of the

835
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:37,289
membrane to release it you know to the

836
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:40,409
extracellular world so it's fascinating

837
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:43,279
stuff he did some incredible work he

838
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:49,710
really really did Paul Marburg that's ma

839
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:58,980
h lb ER g i believe his paper in the

840
00:38:49,710 --> 00:39:02,639
hash church forum on facebook graduate

841
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:09,449
student from korea i think his name was

842
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:13,170
soon younger but he worked on all those

843
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:14,909
papers with dr. Mohler i also want to

844
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,490
mention how awesome i think that it was

845
00:39:14,909 --> 00:39:19,799
of course and standard when you know

846
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:22,529
mark mentions this paper from like

847
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,830
decades ago that your that your reply

848
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:28,590
Sam is yeah i went to his lab i went to

849
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:30,000
his lab yeah i was there i just yeah he

850
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,550
was a contemporary they were

851
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,980
contemporaries they were doing this this

852
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:37,590
work at the same time and the beautiful

853
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:40,860
thing is again i think he obviously had

854
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:43,740
to have night of funding and I believe

855
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:47,700
his material did come from El Sol is

856
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:51,959
operation down in University of

857
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:55,139
Mississippi Carl Hill

858
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,889
hilly working for him but did some of

859
00:39:55,139 --> 00:40:02,670
the first taxonomy papers using you know

860
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:08,309
DNA materials and he was growing seeds

861
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:11,430
I sent him legally from to dr. Mel

862
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:15,570
Burke's lab because dr. Mallard had a

863
00:40:11,429 --> 00:40:18,049
DEA importation license yeah if you look

864
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:20,610
at the way that cannabis has evolved the

865
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:22,740
they can't cannabis has evolved to

866
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:24,720
produce terpenes terpenoids

867
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:27,509
and cannabinoids throughout its

868
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,939
lifecycle but it expresses the terpenes

869
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:31,440
at different points terpenes terpenoids

870
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,690
and cannabinoids at different part

871
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,358
it's life cycle and throughout its plant

872
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:38,338
so when you look at you even that you

873
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,469
know vegetative vegetating plants

874
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:44,250
they're gonna contain primarily the

875
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:46,500
sisal stock tert trichomes which are the

876
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,489
hairs without the bulbous right try

877
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,000
crumbs at the head

878
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:52,679
those sisal stalks contain primarily

879
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,780
monoterpenes that are that scientists

880
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:56,848
are kind of believing are exhibiting a

881
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:00,180
anti insecticidal and anti fungal

882
00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:03,119
bacterial role but in order to actually

883
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:05,509
synthesize the precursors into the

884
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,970
cannabinoids because those cannabinoids

885
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:11,819
exhibit a anti bacterial fungal like and

886
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:14,939
microbial properties they have to be

887
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:16,170
produced in specialized cells the

888
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,780
glandular trichomes

889
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:21,030
so what you'll actually see is that in

890
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,859
vegetative stop and primarily sisal

891
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,560
stock you're gonna have those bond of

892
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:27,119
mono and die turbo noise whereas when

893
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:29,818
you start getting into the bulbous stock

894
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:34,740
and the glandular trichomes on the sisal

895
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:35,969
stock or yeah bulbous bulbous Hagen try

896
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:37,739
crumbs and sisal stock glandular

897
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:39,389
trichomes those are going to be the ones

898
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:42,299
that are actually exit ating that the

899
00:41:39,389 --> 00:41:46,559
two precursors in the that are then

900
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,818
synthesized into the cannabinoids now we

901
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,190
know that there there has been some

902
00:41:47,818 --> 00:41:52,469
studies produced recently that I are

903
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,260
showing tricyclic terpenoids even being

904
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:58,019
produced in the roots and one of the

905
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,180
more things I found it found learned

906
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:04,139
more recently is a lot of the precursor

907
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:06,358
terpenoids are translocated through

908
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:09,150
symbiotic relationships in the roots in

909
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:12,659
the in the root zones through symbiotic

910
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:15,030
relationships with micro by microbiome

911
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:19,920
in the soil that means the soil

912
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:21,720
microbiology that the fungi which are

913
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,309
which are bringing nutrients to the

914
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:28,889
roots and then the bacteria are our both

915
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:30,960
trading terpenes in exchange for sugar

916
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:33,629
from the blue from the roots because

917
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,659
obviously fungi don't produce sugars

918
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,818
sugars are produced by photosynthesis so

919
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:41,309
the plant will actually exude a - sugar

920
00:42:38,818 --> 00:42:43,789
into the root zone in exchange for

921
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:46,739
minerals as well as

922
00:42:43,789 --> 00:42:49,440
nutrients that are traded symbiotically

923
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:52,079
between bacteria and the cannabis roots

924
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,980
so as the cannabis absorbs those

925
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,389
minerals and transfers them up the stems

926
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:00,630
some of those trichomes are going to get

927
00:42:57,389 --> 00:43:01,829
exited into the sisal stock the non

928
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:07,200
Colangelo trichomes

929
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:11,519
but it isn't until the dry trichomes

930
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:13,859
a exude the THC a synthase or CBD a

931
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,329
synthase in the glandular trichomes that

932
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,820
you actually get that conversion from

933
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:26,880
the precursor mono terpenoids into the

934
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:31,380
dye or tri trip annoyed cannabinoids and

935
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:34,079
to Tim I just want to drop the mic for

936
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,660
Mike because that was really really well

937
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,639
put and I loved listening to that and it

938
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:42,210
really was a beautiful scientific

939
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:46,349
explanation of why a cannabis planet

940
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:50,010
seems to for a fact express itself so

941
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:51,929
much more abundantly when it's got that

942
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:55,770
living soil that it's growing out of

943
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:58,349
when it's got that entire living you

944
00:43:55,769 --> 00:44:00,599
know bacteria fungus all of those things

945
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:03,299
working together to like you say trade

946
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:05,159
terpenes in exchange for sugars I just

947
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,350
that was a really beautiful picture you

948
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:09,539
painted there man I appreciated that and

949
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:11,549
I also got what go ahead at ten

950
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:14,519
you succinctly broke it down you know

951
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:16,200
very eloquently actually because people

952
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:17,340
wonder the difference and always as well

953
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:20,309
what's the difference between soil in

954
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:22,440
hydroponics well right there alone is an

955
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:24,150
understanding on why the uptake and what

956
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,110
you're looking at scientifically at the

957
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:31,530
end so someone should write down at 42

958
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:36,510
minutes Mike West came in and started to

959
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:38,460
drop drop the knowledge I appreciate you

960
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,340
Mike I also search everybody thanks for

961
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,650
coming

962
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:47,400
using a lot of hash water on our plants

963
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:50,670
that are about three to four weeks into

964
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,970
flour right now and trading that terpene

965
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:56,260
rich water and those waxes and those

966
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:59,469
water-soluble terms and ends

967
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:01,630
that come off of the the trichome and go

968
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:06,669
into the water and then we spin it with

969
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:08,710
like a what do you call the plaster like

970
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,570
on a drill like you and we use that in

971
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:12,909
the water just to agitate just the water

972
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:14,860
and then we gravity feed it into our

973
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:17,799
greenhouses and I know that that goes

974
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:20,200
into the soil food web and I know I

975
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,510
trust that the microbiology knows what

976
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:24,639
to do that the plant knows what to do it

977
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:26,910
can take those that brought the raw

978
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:31,569
material from the plant before and

979
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:34,210
synthesize those compounds water it

980
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:37,450
don't want them it wants sugar that it

981
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:40,300
can trade from the dirt beet well it

982
00:45:37,449 --> 00:45:43,089
hears them it's my personality I mean

983
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:45,700
here's the thing we can the plants gonna

984
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:47,140
produce sugar and exudate that sugar

985
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:50,619
into the soil

986
00:45:47,139 --> 00:45:52,809
but humans culturing cannabis can

987
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:55,029
actually contribute to that soil

988
00:45:52,809 --> 00:45:56,949
microbiome there's things you know fresh

989
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:59,140
grant plant juices or fermented plant

990
00:45:56,949 --> 00:46:01,389
juices right now is actually a wonderful

991
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:04,389
time for everybody who's watching past

992
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:07,000
church if they have fruit fruits or

993
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:10,119
berries in their local environments they

994
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,769
can actually press those plant juices we

995
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:13,920
may not have time to ferment them but

996
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:16,150
obviously pressing a flank plant juice

997
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,490
incorporating that into your compost tea

998
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:20,980
or into your watering schedule for

999
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:23,169
example if you add blueberry choose to a

1000
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,719
compost tea that's brewing today and

1001
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:27,250
water it into your plants tomorrow that

1002
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:30,939
may add some of those blueberry

1003
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:33,210
blueberry terpenes to the soil that the

1004
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:36,519
soil microbiome is going to absorb

1005
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:40,389
potentially translocate the micro

1006
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:43,480
bacteria will likely use the sugar you

1007
00:46:40,389 --> 00:46:45,969
know it'll consume it and turn it into

1008
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,789
cita - before it even gets into the

1009
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:50,559
plant that those terpene terpenes in

1010
00:46:48,789 --> 00:46:53,860
soil I don't think they have much of a

1011
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,840
half-life if the bacteria is right you

1012
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,820
know that bacteria will consume those

1013
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:00,400
terpenes you're just feeding the

1014
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:03,940
bacteria in the soil by putting that

1015
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:06,369
organic matter in there now locating

1016
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:08,409
terpenes into the plant plant doesn't

1017
00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:09,639
have any problem making terpenes it

1018
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:12,409
makes the

1019
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:15,319
yeah you don't need to move terpenes and

1020
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:17,239
it's not not that you're taking terpenes

1021
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,920
from the plan the staking is straight

1022
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:20,449
into the root and getting turkeys out of

1023
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,220
it that's not last not what we're

1024
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:26,389
implying what we're implying is the

1025
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:28,608
train speeding the soil web the

1026
00:47:26,389 --> 00:47:31,549
intelligence of the microbiome and the

1027
00:47:28,608 --> 00:47:33,858
micro flora with soil knows what to do

1028
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:36,190
it exchanges the information with the

1029
00:47:33,858 --> 00:47:39,529
plant and then the plant says oh I have

1030
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:41,300
nutrients and and you know hormones to

1031
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:45,079
work with and that's where you just

1032
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:46,760
trust in you know evolution and and I

1033
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:48,410
just wanted to add really quickly to

1034
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,630
what Mike was saying you know we've been

1035
00:47:48,409 --> 00:47:53,179
doing fruit ferments you know for 20

1036
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:55,280
years plus because it's always the right

1037
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:57,440
time and when the apples are right or

1038
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,910
the plums are ripe on our property that

1039
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,260
that's when we'll start to do ferments

1040
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,420
and I just want to tell people at home

1041
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,010
that it's really important that when

1042
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:07,490
you're working with fruit and fruit

1043
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:10,300
juices it can turn to alcohol incredibly

1044
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:13,250
quickly especially with your fall

1045
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:16,010
through because you've got a lot of wild

1046
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:18,619
yeasts on the outer coating of that

1047
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:20,510
fruit so it will change very quickly so

1048
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:22,250
we always tell people that if you're

1049
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:23,869
going to be doing any type of fruit

1050
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:26,179
ferment that it's really just for a

1051
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:28,369
couple of days and make sure that you're

1052
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:30,469
testing it and really looking at it so

1053
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:32,119
it just turns to alcohol super quickly

1054
00:48:30,469 --> 00:48:33,909
and that will definitely kill a lot of

1055
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:36,740
the microbiology in your soil

1056
00:48:33,909 --> 00:48:38,989
st. Bernard's observation booth who is

1057
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:40,909
seems to be a smart fellow in the chat

1058
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:42,949
room is agreeing with mark he's saying

1059
00:48:40,909 --> 00:48:45,469
it's the microbial metabolites that the

1060
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:48,230
plant up takes is what will increase

1061
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:50,328
terpenes but who knows maybe we'll learn

1062
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:52,068
something new about cannabis with the

1063
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:53,869
way it operates and works I don't

1064
00:48:52,068 --> 00:48:56,690
pretend to think that we know everything

1065
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:58,400
I'm sure that we think we do but there's

1066
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,349
always breakthroughs every 10 years

1067
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,650
seemingly there's some sort of a new

1068
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:05,690
breakthrough where we understand a new I

1069
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:07,490
don't want to put words in Marc's mouth

1070
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:10,039
but what I think he was saying with it

1071
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:12,709
if you put terpenes in the soil and

1072
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:17,349
they're up taken by the roots that's not

1073
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:20,380
going to make more terpenes in the resin

1074
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:22,930
no but by feeding fight by providing the

1075
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,119
precursors which are oftentimes degra

1076
00:49:22,929 --> 00:49:27,879
debts of what you feed to the roots and

1077
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:30,940
by up by providing more of those

1078
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:33,400
nutrients that can be absorbed yet be

1079
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:35,889
symbiotically traded for sugar with the

1080
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,499
roots you're essentially increasing the

1081
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:41,679
fertility of the soil which then

1082
00:49:38,498 --> 00:49:43,778
increases the bioavailability rates to

1083
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,899
the roots I I think all you're doing is

1084
00:49:43,778 --> 00:49:48,068
you're feeding the nitrogen fixating

1085
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:51,249
bacteria that the plant relies on

1086
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:53,768
because plant doesn't fix nitrogen right

1087
00:49:51,248 --> 00:49:56,768
and so the bacteria and the my chrome

1088
00:49:53,768 --> 00:50:01,629
and the biome and the soil is sort of

1089
00:49:56,768 --> 00:50:05,169
symbiotic with plant and so in order to

1090
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:07,358
get soluble nitrogen to make the DNA and

1091
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:10,150
the protein and the enzymes that

1092
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:13,420
actually do the all those eith is it's

1093
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:15,519
you know the the synthesis those are all

1094
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:17,920
proteins and those proteins on the

1095
00:50:15,518 --> 00:50:20,498
nitrogen and needs to be soluble

1096
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,139
nitrogen and so I think it's just yeah I

1097
00:50:20,498 --> 00:50:26,259
mean like you guys have already talked

1098
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:28,449
about many times feeding the soil and

1099
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:32,139
the symbiotic relationship that the soil

1100
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:34,690
has with the plant has a lot I don't

1101
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:37,868
know if you remember mark but in the

1102
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:41,318
sixties people used to hang their plants

1103
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:46,390
upside down when they dried them because

1104
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:49,568
they thought all of the roots and drip

1105
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:51,489
down into the flowers that was still

1106
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:58,028
believed into the 90s for people there

1107
00:50:51,489 --> 00:51:00,429
Sam the rich don't produce THC they

1108
00:50:58,028 --> 00:51:04,358
produce tricyclic terpenes and bicycling

1109
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:07,448
turkeys I I was just at a Amish tobacco

1110
00:51:04,358 --> 00:51:10,719
farm last week and there's some truth to

1111
00:51:07,449 --> 00:51:13,930
that in tobacco drying apparently is

1112
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,139
that yeah they do hang the leaves upside

1113
00:51:13,929 --> 00:51:19,088
down and you start to actually see a

1114
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:23,440
collection of oil kind of as the plant

1115
00:51:19,088 --> 00:51:25,659
dries and she dribbles up of tobacco oil

1116
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:29,588
I guess or exude eight or whatever the

1117
00:51:25,659 --> 00:51:31,088
hell it is toxic [ __ ] and boy I tell you

1118
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:35,170
what I've never been to its back

1119
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:37,420
before it is intoxicating when you walk

1120
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:40,680
up to one of those drying barns such as

1121
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,680
chuck filled with tobacco

1122
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:50,318
bread tobacco if you grow the medicinal

1123
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:52,778
Indian varieties that they used to smoke

1124
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:55,358
before white men came let me tell you

1125
00:51:52,778 --> 00:51:59,139
something if you even touch the plant

1126
00:51:55,358 --> 00:52:03,009
it's there's so much resin onto those

1127
00:51:59,139 --> 00:52:05,588
tobacco yes have no conception you know

1128
00:52:03,009 --> 00:52:07,509
a neurology in herbology whenever you're

1129
00:52:05,588 --> 00:52:09,788
drying or you're working with herbal

1130
00:52:07,509 --> 00:52:12,190
herbal remedies you're always drawing it

1131
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:14,410
upside down because of those oils and

1132
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:17,019
and and then at the very end of the

1133
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:19,149
plant is where you know a lot of the

1134
00:52:17,018 --> 00:52:21,629
medicinal values are that particular

1135
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:24,278
plant which is where it's gonna dry out

1136
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:26,229
slower it's gonna have a slower dry

1137
00:52:24,278 --> 00:52:29,079
which makes you know a lot of herbal

1138
00:52:26,228 --> 00:52:31,598
plants you know more medicinal and

1139
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:33,519
harvesting them at dawn you know is the

1140
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,440
the most medicinal time to harvest your

1141
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:37,598
herbs with the highest terpene content

1142
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,818
and also I was just wanting to talk

1143
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,700
about a little bit about the living soil

1144
00:52:39,818 --> 00:52:47,068
I think that people who are cultivating

1145
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:50,528
in deep living soil you know we we are

1146
00:52:47,068 --> 00:52:52,268
preparing and and creating cannabinoids

1147
00:52:50,528 --> 00:52:54,150
that we don't even know about yet of

1148
00:52:52,268 --> 00:52:56,258
course there's an incredible

1149
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:58,539
relationship that goes on within the

1150
00:52:56,259 --> 00:53:00,909
rhizosphere that's giving the medicinal

1151
00:52:58,539 --> 00:53:04,450
values within the trichomes of the plant

1152
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:06,278
and when you have a beautiful soil than

1153
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:07,989
you're giving ultimate potential to that

1154
00:53:06,278 --> 00:53:11,469
particular varietal or that particular

1155
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:13,960
chemo VAR so I think that putting in its

1156
00:53:11,469 --> 00:53:16,929
most natural environment with the best

1157
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,369
food possible for the proper

1158
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:20,379
microbiology then you're definitely

1159
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:23,440
gonna get the ultimate potential that

1160
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:24,818
can out of that strain and you know it's

1161
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,889
really hard to tell but we were showing

1162
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:29,099
some of these hemp varietals that were

1163
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:31,538
growing this year and they're just

1164
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:34,539
unbelievably filled with trichomes

1165
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:36,789
and we're really excited to see what's

1166
00:53:34,539 --> 00:53:41,440
gonna happen this year with the testing

1167
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:43,810
and me I mean the trichomes are going

1168
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:47,650
all the way out to the leaves and

1169
00:53:43,809 --> 00:53:49,420
like a cartoon filter from like an app

1170
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:51,160
to anyone else because it looks super

1171
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:53,590
tricky when you've only got up you can

1172
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:56,739
tell it's frosty but it's it looks like

1173
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:58,269
a like a trippy filter to me yeah right

1174
00:53:56,739 --> 00:54:00,699
now you know in the way that we're

1175
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:02,769
breeding our hemp and the way we've been

1176
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:04,629
hopping of CBD values and a lot of the

1177
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:07,000
breeding here we can't actually tell the

1178
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:10,000
difference at all now after working with

1179
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,969
it for so long between our THC varietals

1180
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,269
you know our hemp varietals and our high

1181
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:19,000
CBD varietals are starting to create way

1182
00:54:16,269 --> 00:54:20,590
more you know smells the terpenes coming

1183
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,210
out of the greenhouses are just really

1184
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:32,590
phenomenal I branched between drug

1185
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:35,199
varieties and we have both on the

1186
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:37,840
property we have temporize that we've

1187
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:39,579
collected from Colorado and Oregon that

1188
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,890
are open to breed and we've been

1189
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:44,039
breeding with those you analyze

1190
00:54:41,889 --> 00:54:52,150
varieties they have a whole different

1191
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:54,070
suite of terpenes yeah we've just been

1192
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:56,970
doing quite a bit of testing and we're

1193
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:59,890
really noticing full-spectrum terpenes

1194
00:54:56,969 --> 00:55:03,179
really a whole bunch of them are present

1195
00:54:59,889 --> 00:55:05,920
whatever anon dia labs is is testing for

1196
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:08,529
you know all of them but a couple are

1197
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,230
not present so you know they're all

1198
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:12,850
there which is really exciting so and

1199
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:16,360
we're really being able to tell that so

1200
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:20,139
we're mixing the drug cultivar cultivars

1201
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,640
as well as CBD with CBD and I think

1202
00:55:20,139 --> 00:55:25,119
think that we're having a lot of success

1203
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:27,190
in both of them but incredible yields

1204
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,839
and the trichomes are just huge this

1205
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:32,440
year I mean we have everything from

1206
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:33,340
spectrum number five box Auto cherry

1207
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,849
wines

1208
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:42,070
we have Ringo's gift Carl azuz Ringo

1209
00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:46,059
Harless Aziz EC AB a kiss our healer

1210
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:48,340
strain which is a one-to-one ACDC to

1211
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:51,759
drug to 840 which is ours

1212
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:54,340
a temple spice which is a THC variety

1213
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,020
that got a lot of CBD in it recently in

1214
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:57,789
the last couple years yeah we're

1215
00:55:56,019 --> 00:56:00,730
definitely noticing that a lot of our

1216
00:55:57,789 --> 00:56:03,789
high THC varietals as we're working with

1217
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:06,219
them is is starting to show more full

1218
00:56:03,789 --> 00:56:08,469
spectrum cannabinoids our CBD production

1219
00:56:06,219 --> 00:56:10,869
is absolutely going up even in cultivars

1220
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:14,009
that weren't showing CBD before are

1221
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:17,500
showing CBD and I believe that this is

1222
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:19,120
part of you know living soil and the

1223
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,889
relationship within that rhizosphere

1224
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,900
that brings out the ultimate potential

1225
00:56:20,889 --> 00:56:24,849
that I was talking about these I'd like

1226
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:30,280
to give you skunk number one to grow

1227
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:33,000
because when it has a non-functional CBD

1228
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,000
synthase

1229
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:42,550
interesting interesting yeah purpose

1230
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:43,989
right yeah I mean you know it's what I

1231
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:46,150
love about the cannabis plant it's like

1232
00:56:43,989 --> 00:56:48,489
fractal medicine you know it just sits

1233
00:56:46,150 --> 00:57:00,190
it comes out whatever you know it's it

1234
00:56:48,489 --> 00:57:02,799
doesn't have we're only able to test for

1235
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:05,409
36 right now and we're showing pretty

1236
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:11,350
much about 34 being present in a lot of

1237
00:57:05,409 --> 00:57:13,000
our varietals yeah yeah you know it's

1238
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:15,429
just we don't have access to that type

1239
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,440
of testing and you know the more that

1240
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:19,269
we're learning and more scientific

1241
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,030
knowledge and and and money is being

1242
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:24,309
dumped into cannabis and people who are

1243
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:25,980
home growers even and people that are

1244
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:28,960
really trying to up their breeding

1245
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:30,579
program will have more access to be able

1246
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,470
to get better I need any grower would

1247
00:57:30,579 --> 00:57:34,449
want you know the best test that they

1248
00:57:32,469 --> 00:57:36,519
could get and isn't it not an issue that

1249
00:57:34,449 --> 00:57:39,069
all labs test a little bit differently I

1250
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:46,239
mean can we speak to that like how do we

1251
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:48,970
get all labs to create similar data yeah

1252
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:50,649
the issue with lab variation comes from

1253
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:53,250
because when you look at the way that

1254
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:55,869
labs run their run their equipment a

1255
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:57,579
they have to perform an extraction on

1256
00:57:55,869 --> 00:57:58,989
their equipment to make it into a

1257
00:57:57,579 --> 00:58:01,179
soluble form that they send to the

1258
00:57:58,989 --> 00:58:03,339
machine not all extractions are done the

1259
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:06,190
same way secondarily the way that they

1260
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:08,289
run their analytical equipment is not

1261
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:11,470
using the same standardized formula and

1262
00:58:08,289 --> 00:58:14,108
then obviously there are standardized

1263
00:58:11,469 --> 00:58:17,799
samples that you can get from cerulean

1264
00:58:14,108 --> 00:58:19,900
or standards but not every lab you know

1265
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:24,220
quantifies those standards this same way

1266
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:26,950
so you know if you run a GC or HPLC on a

1267
00:58:24,219 --> 00:58:29,079
method that takes five minutes to run or

1268
00:58:26,949 --> 00:58:30,759
ten minutes to run or an hour to run

1269
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:34,299
you're gonna have much better resolution

1270
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:36,369
on the longer runs but it obviously has

1271
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:40,150
a larger cost to run it for an hour

1272
00:58:36,369 --> 00:58:46,240
versus any lab that's testing

1273
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:47,858
once the five minute and that's what we

1274
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:49,479
see in the recreational market says you

1275
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:53,380
know they're gonna try and run as short

1276
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:56,679
of a lab as possible to get as not there

1277
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:59,470
to get as accurate as possible but still

1278
00:58:56,679 --> 00:59:02,289
be within a new acceptable margin of

1279
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:04,059
error and and then as long as possible

1280
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:06,550
yes the consumers aren't complaining

1281
00:59:04,059 --> 00:59:08,529
they're not gonna not gonna read fast I

1282
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:10,269
calibrated my machine they would show

1283
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:12,130
around the six-minute mark littell the

1284
00:59:10,269 --> 00:59:14,230
eight minute work all the different

1285
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:16,119
cannabinoids over that period and the

1286
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:17,769
same thing at the GC that Paul used to

1287
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:19,720
run to then they're also supposed to

1288
00:59:17,769 --> 00:59:22,480
calibrate that machine after each test

1289
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:23,709
as well okay so that you actually you're

1290
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,289
supposed to at least when I was

1291
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:28,300
originally doing it and actually working

1292
00:59:26,289 --> 00:59:29,650
on the testing here in the US but prior

1293
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:32,230
to everything I always showed a

1294
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:35,320
calibrated machine before the test was

1295
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:37,539
even done okay so this is how many how

1296
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:39,580
many standards fifteen hundred

1297
00:59:37,539 --> 00:59:42,009
well you cuz you know when you do your

1298
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:44,230
calibration curve right if you if you

1299
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:47,230
run it once with one standard serial

1300
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:48,309
dilution of a standardized sample you

1301
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:50,440
know that's going to give you a good

1302
00:59:48,309 --> 00:59:55,480
standard but if you run it at a you know

1303
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:58,088
six different dilutions yeah you don't

1304
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,760
need to run that between every standard

1305
00:59:58,088 --> 01:00:02,920
you need to basically ISO certified labs

1306
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,900
that do this in the non cannabis

1307
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,720
industries basically have to do that

1308
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:09,250
calibration maybe quarterly or maybe

1309
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:11,769
three times a year

1310
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:14,730
I'm just saying again if you're using if

1311
01:00:11,769 --> 01:00:16,989
you're using a standardized method where

1312
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:20,079
you're talking about measuring

1313
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:22,088
cannabinoid concentration yeah you're

1314
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:25,328
gonna be probably looking at anywhere

1315
01:00:22,088 --> 01:00:28,268
between 20 to 30 minutes per test

1316
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:30,969
and you have to do it in a way that you

1317
01:00:28,268 --> 01:00:34,389
know again just as reproducible from lab

1318
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:38,499
to lab to lab to lab and you know

1319
01:00:34,389 --> 01:00:42,009
there's a lot of sort of hyping numbers

1320
01:00:38,498 --> 01:00:45,098
in the testing industry to make sellable

1321
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:48,509
flowers and new markets because you know

1322
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:52,200
it seems as though I can't imagine

1323
01:00:48,509 --> 01:00:56,528
cannabis flower being greater than 30%

1324
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:59,038
in THC but I see it Margaret I'm mark

1325
01:00:56,528 --> 01:01:02,139
I'm from from labs that are basically

1326
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:05,140
certified or running you know equipment

1327
01:01:02,139 --> 01:01:07,690
these are the labs they that sell

1328
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:11,588
product in places like yours they attend

1329
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:14,639
so I mean the point is is that yeah

1330
01:01:11,588 --> 01:01:16,298
do we need standardized testing methods

1331
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:19,088
absolutely

1332
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:21,518
but part of what hinders that is the

1333
01:01:19,088 --> 01:01:23,288
whole schedule one thing because some of

1334
01:01:21,518 --> 01:01:25,868
these companies are even still scared

1335
01:01:23,289 --> 01:01:28,059
that cell you know the equipment that's

1336
01:01:25,869 --> 01:01:31,358
required but the companies that are have

1337
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:33,219
sold you know like shimasu and other

1338
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:35,259
companies that are basically customized

1339
01:01:33,219 --> 01:01:38,139
their equipment to do cannabinoid

1340
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:41,019
analysis you can basically get an HPLC

1341
01:01:38,139 --> 01:01:44,038
for well on the order of about 50,000

1342
01:01:41,018 --> 01:01:47,228
dollars u.s. that can basically measure

1343
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:49,930
cannabinoid concentration to the degree

1344
01:01:47,228 --> 01:01:53,048
that the industry needs to buy a

1345
01:01:49,929 --> 01:01:55,838
standardized method I believe even their

1346
01:01:53,048 --> 01:01:57,818
analyzer has internal standards already

1347
01:01:55,838 --> 01:02:00,190
built into the machine don't quote me on

1348
01:01:57,818 --> 01:02:02,409
that but I think you have to still get

1349
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:04,269
the standards you know every quarter and

1350
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:07,149
just do a calibration curve

1351
01:02:04,268 --> 01:02:11,528
same thing with terpenes you're running

1352
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:15,338
through GCMs yeah you do it once and

1353
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:17,650
then yeah and then your DMS is also

1354
01:02:15,338 --> 01:02:20,528
going to give you a way of determining

1355
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:23,739
whether there's trace other things like

1356
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:27,548
solvents or other you know because the

1357
01:02:23,739 --> 01:02:29,858
the GCMs is a lot more sensitive and it

1358
01:02:27,548 --> 01:02:32,018
could basically sniff cocaine off of a

1359
01:02:29,858 --> 01:02:34,778
dollar bill that's in anyone's pocket so

1360
01:02:32,018 --> 01:02:36,639
it's a very very sensitive technique for

1361
01:02:34,778 --> 01:02:39,159
you know basically determining trace

1362
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:41,259
amounts of contaminants that could

1363
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:43,599
there but again now you're talking about

1364
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:47,260
a piece of instrumentation that runs you

1365
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:50,380
know north of about $150,000 and you

1366
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:53,140
really need to have a trained you know

1367
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:55,869
chemist or scientist to basically

1368
01:02:53,139 --> 01:02:59,049
operate this because it's not a trivial

1369
01:02:55,869 --> 01:03:01,389
piece of instrumentation all right to

1370
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:02,769
clarify gentlemen to clarify what I was

1371
01:03:01,389 --> 01:03:04,089
talking about with the testing

1372
01:03:02,769 --> 01:03:05,679
in-between is when we're come up with

1373
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:07,750
the actual standardization I'm not

1374
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:10,299
saying what was there and to clarify

1375
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:12,280
further I was gonna say it's falling now

1376
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,860
more on human error and depending on

1377
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:17,620
who's working in the lab currently now

1378
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:19,630
more so than anything which is because

1379
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:20,920
we've seen also an exponential it was

1380
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,960
one thing when I was working one-on-one

1381
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:26,110
with a lab now you're talking about

1382
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:28,389
3,000 samples coming in and they're

1383
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:31,510
being absolutely run and then trying to

1384
01:03:28,389 --> 01:03:33,849
find you know qualified people to do

1385
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:35,290
anything from pipetting to you know

1386
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:37,239
getting everything up and running it

1387
01:03:35,289 --> 01:03:39,219
happens to be the biggest problem

1388
01:03:37,239 --> 01:03:40,899
because I'm having people too

1389
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:43,359
complaining and saying they're failing

1390
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:46,150
because the calibration or the cleaning

1391
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:48,880
machineries are off gassing is actually

1392
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:51,010
on the actual test well you bring up a

1393
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,230
good point and a lot of the error that's

1394
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:56,500
introduced into these measurements is

1395
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:59,460
the actual sample handling itself were

1396
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:02,199
not only it runs the risk of having

1397
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:05,230
contamination but there's just so many

1398
01:04:02,199 --> 01:04:08,199
places where error can can happen not

1399
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:10,030
just the the mixing up of samples if

1400
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:12,909
you're running hundreds of samples a day

1401
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:15,900
in these labs but just the notion that

1402
01:04:12,909 --> 01:04:18,699
again there's a systemic error in the

1403
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,710
SOP itself where you're constantly

1404
01:04:18,699 --> 01:04:22,689
getting either a higher or lower result

1405
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:25,510
because of the way the sample is weighed

1406
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:27,909
the way the sample is prepared as Mike

1407
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:30,180
was saying you know cannabis is

1408
01:04:27,909 --> 01:04:33,489
insoluble so if you're sending in flour

1409
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:35,619
it has to be dissolved so if you're

1410
01:04:33,489 --> 01:04:38,019
doing a weight determination for how

1411
01:04:35,619 --> 01:04:39,759
much percent of teeth seized in a sample

1412
01:04:38,019 --> 01:04:42,099
that's a weight determination so you

1413
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,630
have the way material means you have to

1414
01:04:42,099 --> 01:04:46,750
have somebody who's competent that's

1415
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:48,880
able to use a an analytical balance and

1416
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:51,340
weigh down to the you know 0.1

1417
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:54,220
milligrams I mean that's just anyone

1418
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:55,600
and a proper representative sample as

1419
01:04:54,219 --> 01:05:00,549
well how do you get a proper

1420
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:04,869
representative sample just imir gives

1421
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:08,740
you a little bud for testing but well

1422
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:10,630
yeah I mean it it's funny I mean just by

1423
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:13,089
analogy we're kind of going through this

1424
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:17,590
in Pennsylvania now with hem and so what

1425
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:20,590
the state requires is a sample of the

1426
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:24,519
have to basically certify it's below

1427
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:26,470
point three percent THC and they don't

1428
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:29,650
care and there's nothing in the

1429
01:05:26,469 --> 01:05:33,429
regulation that says when or where you

1430
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:35,500
take that sample from so here we are you

1431
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:38,500
know probably like a you know month will

1432
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:40,960
forget a part of it you know and we're

1433
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:43,179
we're basically just clipping leaves off

1434
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,949
the plant and saying okay state here's

1435
01:05:43,179 --> 01:05:46,750
here's here's your here's your test

1436
01:05:44,949 --> 01:05:48,969
result you know you bring up a really

1437
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:51,219
good point which is the sampling and how

1438
01:05:48,969 --> 01:05:54,279
do you how do you use a certificate of

1439
01:05:51,219 --> 01:05:56,949
analysis a laboratory result regardless

1440
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:59,230
of how precise that result can be how do

1441
01:05:56,949 --> 01:06:01,569
you use that result to characterize a

1442
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:05,559
bulk sample of cannabis or ham or

1443
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:08,080
whatever and so I'll point to the the

1444
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:10,150
Oregon folks seem to really think this

1445
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:13,000
thing out pretty well I think the Oregon

1446
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:14,740
Rea is the one that I've read bred the

1447
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,380
California one I've looked at a couple

1448
01:06:14,739 --> 01:06:19,479
of the other ones in other states seems

1449
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:21,599
like the Oregon folks gives us a lot of

1450
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:25,889
good thought on how to basically

1451
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:29,769
statistically represent a large bulk

1452
01:06:25,889 --> 01:06:32,379
sample of medical cannabis how many

1453
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:33,460
samples individual samples and how it

1454
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:35,980
like if you're looking at like a

1455
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:38,320
five-gallon pail or a bin or whatever

1456
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:40,240
you're storing your cannabis they

1457
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:42,130
actually talked about dividing it up in

1458
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:44,859
sectors and taking a sample from each

1459
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:46,869
sector and going lower in the barrel and

1460
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:50,050
you know I don't know who's got the time

1461
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:52,539
to stack their barrels with you know PI

1462
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:55,150
testing cannabis on the top low on the

1463
01:06:52,539 --> 01:06:57,579
bottom I've heard people who spray the

1464
01:06:55,150 --> 01:07:00,340
tops of their barrels or whatever with

1465
01:06:57,579 --> 01:07:01,798
with distillate so when the testing labs

1466
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:04,769
come in they could try to get

1467
01:07:01,798 --> 01:07:06,389
a higher test result because boy that'll

1468
01:07:04,768 --> 01:07:09,379
make it through the the marketplace

1469
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:12,808
quicker because it tests higher for some

1470
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:17,548
reason again the consumer who walks into

1471
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:19,679
the regulated market who feels that

1472
01:07:17,548 --> 01:07:22,108
again I'm in a dispensary so I'm already

1473
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:26,309
paying top dollar I'm gonna make a

1474
01:07:22,108 --> 01:07:28,828
choice based on THC content when I make

1475
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:31,229
my purchase so the test results have a

1476
01:07:28,829 --> 01:07:33,809
lot to do with what moves off the

1477
01:07:31,228 --> 01:07:36,058
shelves and so yeah I mean there's a lot

1478
01:07:33,809 --> 01:07:37,709
of moving parts here but to go back to

1479
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:40,739
the original question and I'll shut up

1480
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:43,858
which is that we do need a standard set

1481
01:07:40,739 --> 01:07:46,619
of tests but I would say that again if

1482
01:07:43,858 --> 01:07:50,778
you got either the schemata to cannabis

1483
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:53,099
analyzer or any current form of HPLC

1484
01:07:50,778 --> 01:07:57,778
that's going to require again

1485
01:07:53,099 --> 01:08:01,079
calibration as long as you stick to the

1486
01:07:57,778 --> 01:08:04,228
SOPs for cannabinoid separations there's

1487
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:07,650
really good analytical methods to give

1488
01:08:04,228 --> 01:08:10,919
you baseline separation of all the major

1489
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:15,209
cannabinoids and so with that type of

1490
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:17,460
you know testing available I'm sure that

1491
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:20,939
this will be something that won't be

1492
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:22,469
something that will be unknown in the

1493
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:24,388
future people will be able to have

1494
01:08:22,469 --> 01:08:26,819
access to these results there will be

1495
01:08:24,389 --> 01:08:29,338
testing there's companies that take

1496
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:31,289
out-of-state samples now that's a new

1497
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:34,109
thing because with the hemp industry

1498
01:08:31,289 --> 01:08:36,630
opening up it was difficult say if you

1499
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:38,880
weren't in California where SC labs is

1500
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:42,239
how do you get a sample tested at SC

1501
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:45,750
labs now there is mechanisms to send

1502
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:48,178
state or samples across state lines so

1503
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:53,219
it's becoming a hell a lot better I tell

1504
01:08:48,179 --> 01:08:55,588
you what it really is look at you know

1505
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:58,859
how we can how we can set the example

1506
01:08:55,588 --> 01:09:01,380
what hat I guess CBD extractors or hash

1507
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:03,420
extractors can look for I know that when

1508
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:06,239
when I've built my labs and there's

1509
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:08,429
especially the labs in Oregon for CBD

1510
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:11,638
you know we were sourcing biomass from

1511
01:09:08,429 --> 01:09:13,920
various farms in and around our region

1512
01:09:11,639 --> 01:09:15,220
trying to minimize the distance from the

1513
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,230
farms that we had

1514
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:19,390
but we would always obviously the

1515
01:09:17,229 --> 01:09:21,819
farmers had to test it before it could

1516
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:24,460
be sold to the processors to certify

1517
01:09:21,819 --> 01:09:27,130
that it was under 0.3 the minute we

1518
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:29,109
started processing it we in Oregon for

1519
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:30,970
example Oregon passed a rule in their

1520
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:34,779
administrative rules committee that

1521
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:38,199
allowed for the product to be sold after

1522
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:42,279
tests below 0.3 percent THC so when the

1523
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:45,819
processor processes that it may go above

1524
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:49,149
0.3 percent THC as long as you have a

1525
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:51,460
CoA independent third-party analytical

1526
01:09:49,149 --> 01:09:54,939
test result that certifies it below

1527
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:57,750
point 3 percent THC that's with that CoA

1528
01:09:54,939 --> 01:10:00,969
you can then sell the lot that's yeah

1529
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:03,819
yeah that's right and and you know

1530
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:06,190
here's the interesting scenario now that

1531
01:10:03,819 --> 01:10:08,349
there's interstate commerce thanks to

1532
01:10:06,189 --> 01:10:11,409
the farm bill you know when those

1533
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:13,780
tractor trailers or you know rent our

1534
01:10:11,409 --> 01:10:15,729
train cars get pulled over how do they

1535
01:10:13,779 --> 01:10:18,159
know they're based upon some piece of

1536
01:10:15,729 --> 01:10:20,079
paper but boy that stuff still smells

1537
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:22,090
like cannabis back there and you're

1538
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:24,819
looking at a huge tractor-trailer that's

1539
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:27,039
just full of em you know pull over on

1540
01:10:24,819 --> 01:10:29,199
the road side of i-95 in between

1541
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:30,989
Philadelphia and New York City it's just

1542
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:36,460
going to be really interesting to see

1543
01:10:30,989 --> 01:10:41,170
about the transport and and how how this

1544
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:43,449
is kept distinguished from babies gonna

1545
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:48,460
figure out how to get it stacks out of

1546
01:10:43,449 --> 01:10:50,590
it know for sure oh yeah you know about

1547
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:52,149
that have to be it's gonna have to be

1548
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:53,829
detained it's gonna have to be tested

1549
01:10:52,149 --> 01:10:56,170
and it's gonna have to find a lab to

1550
01:10:53,829 --> 01:10:58,029
actually test it so you know it's the

1551
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:59,890
reality is this time is gonna have to

1552
01:10:58,029 --> 01:11:01,840
happen and it's gonna be a long slow

1553
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:03,610
process and somebody is gonna be the

1554
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,279
test case and it's gonna be a very

1555
01:11:03,609 --> 01:11:09,579
expensive and a very sleepless night

1556
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:12,130
situation for those people but it's

1557
01:11:09,579 --> 01:11:13,989
already ongoing there's been truck loads

1558
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:16,510
seized in Oklahoma there's been truck

1559
01:11:13,989 --> 01:11:18,460
loads seized in southern Idaho no but

1560
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:20,230
it's gonna have to be in between in each

1561
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:22,539
individual state until that we have an

1562
01:11:20,229 --> 01:11:24,939
actual federal law right because as you

1563
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:27,189
know something passing through Oklahoma

1564
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:28,429
or Kansas is going to be different

1565
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:30,619
compared to like Texas

1566
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:32,300
watching sometimes I will watch live PD

1567
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:34,699
and watch these cops now struggle

1568
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:36,920
because it's a CBD pen we have to

1569
01:11:34,699 --> 01:11:39,260
actually feel tests that well you and I

1570
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:41,750
know also those field tests would fail

1571
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:44,600
you know saliva even you know there's

1572
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:46,609
just terrible tests and you know you're

1573
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:49,640
watching actual officers right now

1574
01:11:46,609 --> 01:11:52,219
struggling with that because Texas has

1575
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:54,470
law that allows for tea CBD but no THC

1576
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:56,810
whatsoever so you can still go to jail

1577
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:58,730
and watch this girl get arrested for

1578
01:11:56,810 --> 01:12:00,440
actually having THC in her pen so she

1579
01:11:58,729 --> 01:12:03,199
was actually arrested and thrown in pen

1580
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:05,329
where the cops are just like hmm you

1581
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:08,179
know so it's still a conundrum even in

1582
01:12:05,329 --> 01:12:12,019
these states depending on the access of

1583
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:14,030
the legal as well as in Texas is medical

1584
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:17,660
medical CBD they don't even they don't

1585
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:19,699
even allow CBD for hemp oh no cat no gas

1586
01:12:17,659 --> 01:12:21,949
stations to read either because there's

1587
01:12:19,699 --> 01:12:22,869
gas station CBD everywhere everywhere

1588
01:12:21,949 --> 01:12:26,359
else

1589
01:12:22,869 --> 01:12:29,569
ice ACM came out with a study that 14

1590
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:33,920
percent of Americans are using a CBD

1591
01:12:29,569 --> 01:12:35,420
product yeah and it's that's critical I

1592
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,609
mean that's it's the healing of the

1593
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:39,920
nation's right it's yeah if anything

1594
01:12:37,609 --> 01:12:42,500
it's gonna open up the doors I mean I I

1595
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:45,440
was surprised when I saw CBD in Kansas

1596
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:48,649
but Kansas has a state program allowing

1597
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:53,000
CBD and with within a month of Kansas

1598
01:12:48,649 --> 01:13:09,079
allowing a commercial CBD there was CBD

1599
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:11,359
being sold in gas station and we're are

1600
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:14,569
you familiar with the paper by Mark

1601
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:23,210
Lewis from April I think it's called

1602
01:13:14,569 --> 01:13:26,479
development validation of a robust is

1603
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:30,170
that the DeeZee paper isn't easy after

1604
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:33,729
and yeah yeah yeah Ryan's tell me that

1605
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:36,800
right we talked at a time area semi that

1606
01:13:33,729 --> 01:13:41,299
no that that's that's expensive superb

1607
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,640
method and also Justin fish addict I

1608
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,260
don't

1609
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:46,110
we're Justin as Justin's at one of the

1610
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:47,880
testing labs Justin's across the street

1611
01:13:46,109 --> 01:13:50,489
from me over here at IAS the original

1612
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:53,029
lab I've worked with Justin published a

1613
01:13:50,489 --> 01:13:56,550
great paper on correlations between

1614
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:58,949
different varieties and terpene profiles

1615
01:13:56,550 --> 01:14:01,289
he's coached a couple with Jeff raver

1616
01:13:58,949 --> 01:14:07,019
yeah I mean there's a few few good

1617
01:14:01,289 --> 01:14:10,500
methods that are out there in Sacramento

1618
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:12,770
and it's the best map I ever saw working

1619
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:16,470
with canvas yeah

1620
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:25,200
dr. Brennan Eisen dr. L Saleh's I've

1621
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:29,100
been yeah I mean the way that these G

1622
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:31,109
CMS's works you used to use GC fi DFID

1623
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:34,440
is just that the acronym for flame

1624
01:14:31,109 --> 01:14:36,899
ionization detector and so the way GC

1625
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:38,669
works is it separates mixtures of

1626
01:14:36,899 --> 01:14:41,269
compounds based on their different

1627
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:43,739
boiling points and different you know

1628
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:45,930
temperatures at which they boil and so

1629
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:48,149
the most volatile ones kind of come

1630
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:50,550
through the column first then higher

1631
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:53,879
boiling ones come through the column

1632
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:55,739
later and and and and what the FI D was

1633
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:58,500
was just a sniffer at the end of the

1634
01:14:55,739 --> 01:15:00,539
column that just smelled a compound

1635
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:03,149
coming out and would burn it and the

1636
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:05,220
intensity of the flame was correlated to

1637
01:15:03,149 --> 01:15:07,559
the peak height because the more intense

1638
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:09,240
the flame was the more compound was

1639
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,270
coming out so the higher the peak would

1640
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:14,689
be so mass spec what you're doing is

1641
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:18,870
you're putting that column now into a

1642
01:15:14,689 --> 01:15:21,179
mass spectrometer which fragments the

1643
01:15:18,869 --> 01:15:23,699
molecule and creates what's called a

1644
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:26,369
mass spectrum so it's it's how the

1645
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:30,809
molecule shatters when when it breaks

1646
01:15:26,369 --> 01:15:33,390
and so each molecule has a different

1647
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:35,789
pattern each per beam each cannabinoid

1648
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:37,980
the way that they shatter creates a

1649
01:15:35,789 --> 01:15:40,670
different mass spectrum and so those are

1650
01:15:37,979 --> 01:15:45,479
included in a library of compounds

1651
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:47,699
that's maintained by ni St the National

1652
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:50,750
Institutes for Standards and [ __ ] like

1653
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:55,019
that and so these libraries are all

1654
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:57,899
inside the software of this in

1655
01:15:55,019 --> 01:16:00,168
and so when they're looking at all these

1656
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:03,409
compounds coming out they're able to

1657
01:16:00,168 --> 01:16:06,208
identify down to a gnats eyebrow

1658
01:16:03,408 --> 01:16:09,558
everything that's in the you know these

1659
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:12,208
mixtures and this is just routine

1660
01:16:09,559 --> 01:16:15,119
analytical chemistry that just has have

1661
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:17,309
been happening in the food and non

1662
01:16:15,118 --> 01:16:19,078
cannabis industries for it for years in

1663
01:16:17,309 --> 01:16:21,748
the chemical industry pharmaceutical

1664
01:16:19,078 --> 01:16:24,238
industry so it's great that you know

1665
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:27,328
these instruments have now been applied

1666
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:30,358
to looking at these terpene profiles and

1667
01:16:27,328 --> 01:16:33,208
so the point is Sam is that the paper

1668
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:35,519
that you're recommending was actually

1669
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:38,729
carried out I think by fi D right I

1670
01:16:35,519 --> 01:16:44,189
think that was a G C F ID method but you

1671
01:16:38,729 --> 01:16:51,510
could easily they they had mass spec

1672
01:16:44,189 --> 01:16:54,359
yeah so much so you can easily yeah so

1673
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:59,099
you can easily apply that method which

1674
01:16:54,359 --> 01:17:00,929
just uses flame ionization detector mass

1675
01:16:59,099 --> 01:17:04,099
spec detection it's just a different

1676
01:17:00,929 --> 01:17:08,969
kind of detector you know the detector

1677
01:17:04,099 --> 01:17:16,319
glasses once you run a set of analytical

1678
01:17:08,969 --> 01:17:18,868
samples now you've got oh yeah yeah

1679
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:21,329
absolutely like that yeah that's I mean

1680
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:22,948
fact with the hydrogenated cannabinoids

1681
01:17:21,328 --> 01:17:25,139
that's how we knew we had something new

1682
01:17:22,948 --> 01:17:27,238
there is nothing in the library there

1683
01:17:25,139 --> 01:17:28,618
was like oh my god there's nothing in

1684
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:30,538
the library well there's something in

1685
01:17:28,618 --> 01:17:34,158
the library now now that we've made it

1686
01:17:30,538 --> 01:17:37,168
you know but it becomes yeah a great

1687
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:41,009
detective identification tool to

1688
01:17:37,168 --> 01:17:43,708
identify whatever is in a mixture or an

1689
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:46,319
extract or formulated product and you

1690
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:48,510
don't need analytical standards anymore

1691
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:49,949
well it's not it's not like you don't

1692
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:51,719
need analytical standards so the

1693
01:17:49,948 --> 01:17:53,428
analytical standards what those are used

1694
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:57,989
and this is what Mike was talking about

1695
01:17:53,429 --> 01:17:59,699
earlier is to develop yeah develop a

1696
01:17:57,988 --> 01:18:01,978
calibration curve so you want to

1697
01:17:59,698 --> 01:18:04,138
understand so when you get one of these

1698
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:06,029
chromatograms you get a bunch of Peaks

1699
01:18:04,139 --> 01:18:08,170
right which looks like a mountain range

1700
01:18:06,029 --> 01:18:10,900
and what you want to be able to do

1701
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:13,300
is correlate the peak area underneath

1702
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:15,250
the peak to the concentration of the

1703
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:18,639
compound that gives rise to that peak

1704
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:23,198
and the way you do that is you you run

1705
01:18:18,639 --> 01:18:26,289
that test on that pure analytical sample

1706
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:29,049
at different concentrations and you plot

1707
01:18:26,289 --> 01:18:31,439
on one axis the concentration and you

1708
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:34,539
plot the absorbance on the other and you

1709
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:37,269
generate a line which is in optical

1710
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:40,899
spectroscopy is referred to as beers law

1711
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:43,330
so beers law is the law that you know

1712
01:18:40,899 --> 01:18:45,759
the the darker a solution is the more

1713
01:18:43,329 --> 01:18:48,158
there is of the analyte in the solution

1714
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:50,020
absorbance is directly proportional to

1715
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:52,179
the concentration of whatever you're

1716
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:54,730
measuring and so those at those those

1717
01:18:52,179 --> 01:18:56,739
calibration curves it's very important

1718
01:18:54,729 --> 01:18:58,629
and again this speaks to how we get

1719
01:18:56,738 --> 01:19:01,209
consistent methods throughout the

1720
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:03,579
cannabis industry is that the labs who

1721
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:05,889
are doing the testing who are doing

1722
01:19:03,579 --> 01:19:09,639
routine testing and testing hundreds of

1723
01:19:05,889 --> 01:19:13,750
samples a week have to stop once a

1724
01:19:09,639 --> 01:19:17,079
quarter and basically show that their

1725
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:20,340
calibration curves are giving a linear

1726
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:23,109
relationship between the different

1727
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:24,670
concentration of the samples and what

1728
01:19:23,109 --> 01:19:26,948
they're reading from the machine and

1729
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:29,260
sometimes what you'll see is that as the

1730
01:19:26,948 --> 01:19:31,509
column begins to fail or if they have

1731
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:34,060
problems with their peristaltic pump

1732
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:37,239
which pumps the fluid through the column

1733
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:39,699
as it runs you start to get variations

1734
01:19:37,238 --> 01:19:42,968
either at high or low concentrations and

1735
01:19:39,698 --> 01:19:45,099
deviations from linearity along that

1736
01:19:42,969 --> 01:19:47,710
curve and so it's important to be able

1737
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:50,050
to show yeah you could run hundreds of

1738
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:51,670
samples hundreds of samples but you have

1739
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:53,619
to be able to maintain that linear

1740
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:56,350
calibration curve and when you don't

1741
01:19:53,618 --> 01:19:59,109
alarm bells should go off and I think

1742
01:19:56,350 --> 01:20:04,250
there's even programs that as the

1743
01:19:59,109 --> 01:20:06,719
machine runs lets the user know that hey

1744
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:08,099
hey we're starting to get something

1745
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,020
that's deviating here you start to see

1746
01:20:08,099 --> 01:20:11,730
what's called a floating baseline where

1747
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:13,409
the the baseline and the chromatogram

1748
01:20:11,729 --> 01:20:15,569
starts increasing and that just means

1749
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:17,788
that more shits going in this case with

1750
01:20:15,569 --> 01:20:20,340
HPLC you're doing a detection by

1751
01:20:17,788 --> 01:20:22,979
ultraviolet visible light so you're

1752
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:25,578
taking the ultraviolet visible light as

1753
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:27,839
the fluid comes off of the column and

1754
01:20:25,578 --> 01:20:29,819
the different cannabinoids have

1755
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,400
different ultraviolet spectrum so you're

1756
01:20:29,819 --> 01:20:35,099
able to determine which cannabinoid is

1757
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:36,988
which and also by running standards the

1758
01:20:35,099 --> 01:20:39,750
other thing that standards provide is

1759
01:20:36,988 --> 01:20:40,500
that if you have an unknown peak and you

1760
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:42,538
don't know what it is

1761
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:44,880
you could Speight that sample say is

1762
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:46,948
that thing THC well you could spike it

1763
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,288
with Delta 9 THC and see if that peak

1764
01:20:46,948 --> 01:20:51,598
grows if that peak grows then you know

1765
01:20:49,288 --> 01:20:54,229
that you've you know identified the peak

1766
01:20:51,599 --> 01:20:57,059
but these from chromatography you know

1767
01:20:54,229 --> 01:21:09,299
methods or devices are very useful for

1768
01:20:57,059 --> 01:21:11,849
analyzing first testing lab there's

1769
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:14,130
there's been testing on cannabis dating

1770
01:21:11,849 --> 01:21:28,590
dating back decades but obviously the

1771
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:30,929
first available yeah yeah so but only

1772
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:31,860
came under the time gentleman lays the

1773
01:21:30,929 --> 01:21:36,779
same time

1774
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:41,098
go ahead very good no I was saying that

1775
01:21:36,779 --> 01:21:43,380
I built it only for in-house use or

1776
01:21:41,099 --> 01:21:46,349
because we were plant breeders cannabis

1777
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:53,010
breeders and we used it we kept it for

1778
01:21:46,349 --> 01:21:54,960
we 50 to 100 samples a day yeah no I

1779
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:58,380
meant and that's what that's what I

1780
01:21:54,960 --> 01:22:01,139
think a lot of because with because none

1781
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:03,960
of the states started licensing cannabis

1782
01:22:01,139 --> 01:22:06,359
no no no commercial labs opened up tin

1783
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:08,788
until after we started seeing medical

1784
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:11,908
states opening up and off having having

1785
01:22:08,788 --> 01:22:14,158
that need so I think has progresses

1786
01:22:11,908 --> 01:22:16,979
worldwide we'll start to see more more

1787
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:20,279
standards more validation on those thing

1788
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:22,919
labs actually being held responsible to

1789
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:26,369
validate their lab standard monthly or

1790
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:28,739
quarterly and then that deviation from

1791
01:22:26,369 --> 01:22:30,599
those standards then we obviously labs

1792
01:22:28,739 --> 01:22:32,639
want to be able to earn heed to be able

1793
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:34,770
to you know shut down and either replace

1794
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,690
their column replace their pumps etc

1795
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:40,770
make sure that they can fall within

1796
01:22:36,689 --> 01:22:42,719
those state mandated standards we

1797
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:45,090
started in O eight and O nine with

1798
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,890
testing here in California and so we we

1799
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:48,690
didn't have any access to lab or in

1800
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:50,670
formation we tried to reach out to the

1801
01:22:48,689 --> 01:22:53,039
Research Triangle that's a University of

1802
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:55,199
Mississippi and they laughed at us so we

1803
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:56,640
that was in like oh seven so no eight we

1804
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:58,380
started to reach out to Ethan Rousseau

1805
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,910
and some of the other people and trying

1806
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:01,650
to find the right people to actually

1807
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:04,619
find to bring to the United States

1808
01:23:01,649 --> 01:23:07,500
actually have the actual calibration

1809
01:23:04,619 --> 01:23:09,449
liquid and equipment so I didn't know

1810
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,560
you back then Sam because I wish I would

1811
01:23:09,449 --> 01:23:13,170
have known you because it would have

1812
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:24,030
made it a lot easier but in the aspect

1813
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:28,949
and dr. Holloway they both helped me you

1814
01:23:24,029 --> 01:23:31,739
know they weren't so happy to help us we

1815
01:23:28,949 --> 01:23:33,750
would send the exact same sample to all

1816
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:37,579
three of us and we didn't come out with

1817
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:39,569
the same result was wrong but we did

1818
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:42,300
exact same result

1819
01:23:39,569 --> 01:23:44,130
I longed in dream that you people

1820
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:47,400
existed and apparently you did exist

1821
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:55,340
it's just we didn't touch base back then

1822
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:55,339
they also welcomed the dream catcher

1823
01:23:57,829 --> 01:24:04,519
we've been talking about labs for a bit

1824
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:07,139
now I apologize I'm just making a

1825
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:09,510
tracking out again and I appreciate that

1826
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:21,240
that's awesome now we've been going deep

1827
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:23,340
man testing with the Green Cross stay

1828
01:24:21,239 --> 01:24:25,199
with dr. Horne be back and it was oh six

1829
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:28,650
just after my accident that's when I got

1830
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:31,079
hurt and learned about decarboxylase and

1831
01:24:28,649 --> 01:24:32,969
how those brownies affected my pain

1832
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:34,829
controller that's when I kind of really

1833
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:37,860
found out about analytical testing and

1834
01:24:34,829 --> 01:24:39,449
started seeing all those all that great

1835
01:24:37,859 --> 01:24:41,579
wonders of cannabis at the beginning

1836
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:45,510
there that was you know 607 then that

1837
01:24:41,579 --> 01:24:48,960
was uh was some exciting times without

1838
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:53,239
labs with you as a breeder you don't

1839
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:53,239
know what you're doing just guessing I

1840
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:59,190
think it's really awesome we have the

1841
01:24:56,520 --> 01:25:02,130
ability to test the flour and we have

1842
01:24:59,189 --> 01:25:04,259
the ability to test the soil and and in

1843
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:08,159
the cannabis industry really getting

1844
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:10,350
good at both of those already together

1845
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:13,470
and the thing that I'm really interested

1846
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:17,220
in is the actual reaction from the soil

1847
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:19,680
into the flour which is really test the

1848
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:22,050
end acidic reaction that's going on

1849
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:24,780
within the plant and I don't know if any

1850
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:27,390
of you all know of any labs or anybody

1851
01:25:24,779 --> 01:25:30,750
who is testing and the fights within the

1852
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:33,360
plant that really is super exciting like

1853
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:36,149
for example tack salt from the yew tree

1854
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:39,119
was people were getting bark wanting to

1855
01:25:36,149 --> 01:25:40,949
extract tax all to cure cancer but after

1856
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:42,809
further testing years later they

1857
01:25:40,949 --> 01:25:45,269
realized there there was endo Finnick

1858
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:49,289
fungi and endo Finnick bacteria that was

1859
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:52,440
pulsing in the cambium between the birch

1860
01:25:49,289 --> 01:25:54,689
I mean authority you bark and the tree

1861
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:57,269
and the handle fights were extremely

1862
01:25:54,689 --> 01:25:58,819
medicinal towards cancer and other

1863
01:25:57,270 --> 01:26:01,620
things so we started looking up

1864
01:25:58,819 --> 01:26:04,349
endophytes in cannabis and there's

1865
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:07,319
minimal papers on it and the one where I

1866
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:10,950
found located that there was you know up

1867
01:26:07,319 --> 01:26:14,219
to 30 and endo critic fungi in cannabis

1868
01:26:10,949 --> 01:26:16,710
some of the endo fights were good fight

1869
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:20,100
powdery mildew and botrytis other

1870
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:22,829
endophytes were impossible to fight

1871
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:25,829
cancer area and and we're not talking to

1872
01:26:22,829 --> 01:26:27,149
endo mycorrhizal fungi and we're not

1873
01:26:25,829 --> 01:26:30,809
talking about that we're talking about

1874
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:33,689
endo FIDIC fungi and bacteria that live

1875
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:36,720
inside plant tissue and i feel like it

1876
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:38,399
may be a whole new medicinal frontier

1877
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:39,929
and i'm wondering if any of you all have

1878
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:44,129
learned about that

1879
01:26:39,929 --> 01:26:45,630
and also under I just wanted to kind of

1880
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:47,760
jump in on that that's I think that's

1881
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:49,800
one of my most like passionate and

1882
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,659
exciting kind of directions where I see

1883
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:54,538
things are going you know in so many

1884
01:26:51,658 --> 01:26:55,319
ways your candidates now especially you

1885
01:26:54,538 --> 01:26:57,208
know kind of what we're seeing in

1886
01:26:55,319 --> 01:26:59,399
California with as much testing is being

1887
01:26:57,208 --> 01:27:01,819
required you know we're seeing so many

1888
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:01,819
of the

1889
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,360
you

1890
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:13,119
did somebody freeze up on us

1891
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:18,230
no it's Mike went dead for some reason

1892
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:19,819
now he froze frozen so you know we'll

1893
01:27:18,229 --> 01:27:22,969
just build on that we can add

1894
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:24,889
information make our hemp oil we as we

1895
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:27,170
harvest the hemp we harvest the ribs

1896
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:28,610
thanks to Ethan Rousseau and some of

1897
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:30,380
those papers that have been written on

1898
01:27:28,609 --> 01:27:34,009
the roots and we also use parts of the

1899
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:35,840
stock and seeds in our medicine because

1900
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:38,090
we when you talk about whole plants like

1901
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:40,550
Marcus's shirt you know or whole plant

1902
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:42,949
medicine you know you were looking for

1903
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:45,920
the full range so and it's really

1904
01:27:42,949 --> 01:27:47,960
awesome because you found papers you

1905
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,970
know that back to the 50s that look at

1906
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:52,579
him and they're finding up to 30

1907
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:55,039
different varietals of Enda fitted fungi

1908
01:27:52,579 --> 01:27:57,409
within the cannabis plant and say like a

1909
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:59,600
tomato or some of our other food plants

1910
01:27:57,409 --> 01:28:00,829
or maybe tobacco or corn you're really

1911
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,900
only gonna have a couple different

1912
01:28:00,829 --> 01:28:05,869
varietals it's it's super interesting

1913
01:28:02,899 --> 01:28:08,299
that cannabis has so many and we know

1914
01:28:05,869 --> 01:28:10,489
that that's definitely playing in with

1915
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:13,070
cannabinoid and and terpene production

1916
01:28:10,489 --> 01:28:15,109
so alyx not alex now there's not enough

1917
01:28:13,069 --> 01:28:16,639
to hear you thank you thank you no thank

1918
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:18,439
you for your patience there i'm yeah i

1919
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:21,440
just don't make it to Wi-Fi so I'm

1920
01:28:18,439 --> 01:28:23,569
golden um so so yeah one dumb what I was

1921
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:25,579
kind of just wanting to kind of share

1922
01:28:23,569 --> 01:28:29,479
with share with everybody here kind of

1923
01:28:25,579 --> 01:28:34,399
be in response to the endo endo philic

1924
01:28:29,479 --> 01:28:37,250
is alright and acidic yeah yeah

1925
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:38,750
cool so yeah so anyway so the way I was

1926
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:39,890
going on that thought is like you know

1927
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:41,359
in so many ways you know Saints a

1928
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:43,190
cannabis testing you know we've been

1929
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:44,989
doing deep in this is our tenth year is

1930
01:28:43,189 --> 01:28:48,379
their decade of doing it you know can we

1931
01:28:44,989 --> 01:28:50,719
started towards the end of 2009 and and

1932
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:52,369
so being on this journey of analytical

1933
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:54,350
chemistry with cannabis and the science

1934
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:56,000
of cannabis has been you know one most

1935
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:59,210
educational magical experiences in my

1936
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,010
life and and in so many ways especially

1937
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:03,560
said you know over the last few years

1938
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:05,659
seeing a transition to this new space it

1939
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:07,340
regulated contested you know these

1940
01:29:05,659 --> 01:29:08,779
minimum quality standards that people

1941
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:10,640
have to meet to kind of you know get

1942
01:29:08,779 --> 01:29:13,880
product that we market you know in so

1943
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:15,920
many ways now on you know you know we're

1944
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:17,960
seeing the most fascinating trends

1945
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,510
around all the fails right and so so my

1946
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:21,340
job in such a big ways

1947
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:22,960
compliance fail happens and some BS to

1948
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:24,880
destroy product during mediate the

1949
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:26,679
product that pretty much means they're

1950
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,150
never gonna work with us again because

1951
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:31,149
there's a fifty hundred thousand dollar

1952
01:29:28,149 --> 01:29:32,888
plus loss of a cure and so so what we

1953
01:29:31,149 --> 01:29:34,929
found really early on last year when

1954
01:29:32,889 --> 01:29:36,460
testing kicked in is you know the buck

1955
01:29:34,929 --> 01:29:37,769
doesn't stop there if you if you as a

1956
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:40,480
lab or just delivering a fee-for-service

1957
01:29:37,769 --> 01:29:42,760
tests and the certificate analysis and

1958
01:29:40,479 --> 01:29:43,839
then bad news you know you know with

1959
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,550
someone having to destroy a hundred

1960
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,440
thousand dollars product and you know

1961
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:48,610
sure that never probably gonna work with

1962
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:49,988
you again but what else do you bring to

1963
01:29:48,609 --> 01:29:52,210
the table and so that's really where

1964
01:29:49,988 --> 01:29:53,919
we've drawn on our past decade worth of

1965
01:29:52,210 --> 01:29:55,630
experience of being in service to this

1966
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,788
plant and knowing this plan as well as

1967
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:59,529
we do both like you know on the you know

1968
01:29:57,788 --> 01:30:02,050
kind of cultivation manufacturing level

1969
01:29:59,529 --> 01:30:03,698
but also then on testing and so so one

1970
01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:04,840
of the things and this is I guess the

1971
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:06,638
big point of what I was trying to make

1972
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:08,230
it so cannabis this you know this great

1973
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:10,929
bioaccumulate implant you know now that

1974
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:12,399
we've tested it but to higher standards

1975
01:30:10,929 --> 01:30:14,380
than any other crop that's ever been

1976
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:16,808
tested you know we're we're you know the

1977
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:19,868
testing is almost like it's showing this

1978
01:30:16,809 --> 01:30:21,550
voice of the plant that's speaking about

1979
01:30:19,868 --> 01:30:23,618
the legacy of the toxicity and the

1980
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:26,170
contamination that's happened in all

1981
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:27,729
these major agricultural areas you know

1982
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:29,380
that are you know and so in so many of

1983
01:30:27,729 --> 01:30:31,569
these areas where the microbiome has

1984
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:35,139
been desertified you know and and now

1985
01:30:31,569 --> 01:30:36,969
it's just eroded you know soil that just

1986
01:30:35,139 --> 01:30:39,609
kind of gives super height or just like

1987
01:30:36,969 --> 01:30:41,529
a super low pH you know super root and

1988
01:30:39,609 --> 01:30:43,750
high levels of heavy metals and residual

1989
01:30:41,529 --> 01:30:47,109
pesticides from the environment from the

1990
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:49,359
neighboring farms there yeah it's dirt

1991
01:30:47,109 --> 01:30:51,130
exactly it's no longer soil and and so

1992
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:52,420
so so in so many ways like we're seeing

1993
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:55,480
this in California we're seeing this

1994
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:57,969
massive movement towards kind of the

1995
01:30:55,479 --> 01:31:00,669
this establishment of appellations of

1996
01:30:57,969 --> 01:31:02,380
origin and protected terms you know and

1997
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:03,300
and I love this conversation I'm

1998
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:05,920
actually gonna be speaking at a

1999
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:07,389
Appalachian conference look at some pose

2000
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:11,109
in at UC Berkeley in the next couple

2001
01:31:07,389 --> 01:31:12,130
months on but but basically you know

2002
01:31:11,109 --> 01:31:13,719
what we're seeing is you know

2003
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:15,130
Appalachian is something in this new

2004
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:17,710
world that you have to wear whether or

2005
01:31:15,130 --> 01:31:19,150
not you like it or not and and you know

2006
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:20,739
in certain areas you know the

2007
01:31:19,149 --> 01:31:23,049
Appalachian that you're going is almost

2008
01:31:20,738 --> 01:31:25,238
going to be seen as like a Scarlet

2009
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:28,119
Letter you know because I begin to

2010
01:31:25,238 --> 01:31:30,189
basically by the like five or six

2011
01:31:28,118 --> 01:31:32,229
different pesticides that will show up

2012
01:31:30,189 --> 01:31:33,189
either in flower or plant material or

2013
01:31:32,229 --> 01:31:34,899
annex

2014
01:31:33,189 --> 01:31:36,399
you know I've begun from the from the

2015
01:31:34,899 --> 01:31:37,989
routine I've had over a thousand of

2016
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:40,659
these fail calls over the last year but

2017
01:31:37,989 --> 01:31:42,130
now I can begin to predict the

2018
01:31:40,659 --> 01:31:44,109
appellation it was grown in by the

2019
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:45,880
pesticide signature that accompanies the

2020
01:31:44,109 --> 01:31:46,899
prop and that's one of those

2021
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,609
mind-blowing things I've ever seen

2022
01:31:46,899 --> 01:31:50,379
because I can predict if it's grown by

2023
01:31:48,609 --> 01:31:52,809
the almonds in Stanislaus or by the

2024
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:54,550
avocados in Carpinteria because this

2025
01:31:52,810 --> 01:31:56,590
appellation signatures following the

2026
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:58,029
plant and so that's the worst case I

2027
01:31:56,590 --> 01:32:00,250
think of the appellation conversation of

2028
01:31:58,029 --> 01:32:02,590
where I'm seeing it go but on the other

2029
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:05,560
side unlike with you know with you know

2030
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:07,840
pale laning gum and soil food web and

2031
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:09,670
all the like pioneering work of all the

2032
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,920
you know cannabis legends that have been

2033
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:14,319
trying to push the boundaries on organic

2034
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:16,569
farming to regenerative farming to like

2035
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:18,340
understanding the symbiosis that exists

2036
01:32:16,569 --> 01:32:19,989
in nature and how you know to really

2037
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:21,550
talk terroir and appellations of origin

2038
01:32:19,989 --> 01:32:23,469
you know you're it's it's the

2039
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:25,840
microclimate region of the area but it's

2040
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:27,789
the soil microbiome that exists and I

2041
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:29,980
think well and and and and real quick

2042
01:32:27,789 --> 01:32:31,840
just about the point and so so with with

2043
01:32:29,979 --> 01:32:34,479
that being said you know we're you know

2044
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:36,190
I've been to several landing them

2045
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:37,869
accomplish two workshops I we were

2046
01:32:36,189 --> 01:32:39,099
starting to do some of these trials but

2047
01:32:37,869 --> 01:32:41,739
you know they're showing whenever the

2048
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:44,050
soil microbiomes ideal you know for the

2049
01:32:41,739 --> 01:32:46,869
crop being grown comparatively to say

2050
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:48,909
hydroponically grown the tomatoes or

2051
01:32:46,869 --> 01:32:50,260
other types of fruits you know you can

2052
01:32:48,909 --> 01:32:52,000
track the doubling of a secondary

2053
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:54,610
metabolites being produced in the plant

2054
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,630
whenever the microbiomes ideal and they

2055
01:32:54,609 --> 01:32:57,759
probably has something to do these

2056
01:32:55,630 --> 01:33:00,730
endophyte or the certain types of fungi

2057
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:02,770
but whenever you know those so if you

2058
01:33:00,729 --> 01:33:04,809
can so if something's going the perfect

2059
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:06,430
microbiome in one of these real clean

2060
01:33:04,810 --> 01:33:09,250
areas that aren't they haven't been

2061
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:11,200
bombed on for 40 50 years by AG you know

2062
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:13,270
where their soil is actually rich and

2063
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:15,099
flourishing then you know you can

2064
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:17,980
actually be good we're starting to begin

2065
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:20,470
to track the secondary metabolite

2066
01:33:17,979 --> 01:33:22,119
production being released in cannabis

2067
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:24,340
which are tokine's in this case and

2068
01:33:22,119 --> 01:33:27,189
other you know minor compounds that

2069
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:28,989
we're not even testing yet but i but in

2070
01:33:27,189 --> 01:33:30,729
so many ways i'm seeing that as one of

2071
01:33:28,989 --> 01:33:33,010
the biggest competitive advantages that

2072
01:33:30,729 --> 01:33:34,629
a cannabis farmer has in this new world

2073
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:37,449
because if you were able to produce

2074
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:39,460
quality fiber quality cannabis that has

2075
01:33:37,449 --> 01:33:41,529
you know these big mark Lee expressed

2076
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:43,930
higher amounts of these secondary

2077
01:33:41,529 --> 01:33:45,460
metabolite sector beans as opposed to

2078
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:46,450
some of this mono crop cannabis that's

2079
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:48,970
going and AG

2080
01:33:46,449 --> 01:33:50,739
that doesn't have the secondary tab like

2081
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:53,079
boost but instead has this pesticide

2082
01:33:50,739 --> 01:33:54,550
signature accompanying it you know it's

2083
01:33:53,079 --> 01:33:56,680
like it's a really fascinating way to

2084
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:58,449
kind of look at the field in front of in

2085
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:00,280
front of everybody and who really or

2086
01:33:58,449 --> 01:34:02,529
who's really out of damage you know even

2087
01:34:00,279 --> 01:34:03,939
if some reason is small-town more you're

2088
01:34:02,529 --> 01:34:06,130
a small farm side of things instead of

2089
01:34:03,939 --> 01:34:07,479
like thirty acres mono crop you know

2090
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:10,539
who's really an advantage

2091
01:34:07,479 --> 01:34:12,429
that's where analytical testing really

2092
01:34:10,539 --> 01:34:14,170
aids the regenerative farmer or

2093
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:16,060
different bioregions which are

2094
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:18,989
essentially Appalachians because as

2095
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:22,210
South Africa and Colombia and all these

2096
01:34:18,989 --> 01:34:24,369
countries come in with thousands and

2097
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:25,930
thousands of hectares you know you got

2098
01:34:24,369 --> 01:34:27,939
to be like Oh am I gonna be able to sell

2099
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:29,680
you know the weeds still you're like

2100
01:34:27,939 --> 01:34:31,809
yeah you're definitely going to because

2101
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:33,940
of the certain bioregions that you live

2102
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:36,220
in a certain terroir and through

2103
01:34:33,939 --> 01:34:39,099
analytical testing and soil testing

2104
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:41,590
you'll be able to show the purity and

2105
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:43,780
show maybe the unique chemo bars that

2106
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:46,329
you have and I think that's extremely

2107
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:48,369
valuable and people trying to flip them

2108
01:34:46,329 --> 01:34:50,199
on and people trying to just grow

2109
01:34:48,369 --> 01:34:52,119
Kennedy and now that it's make upgrade

2110
01:34:50,199 --> 01:34:53,739
again and this whole movement of you

2111
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:55,750
know all the farmers just going for it

2112
01:34:53,739 --> 01:34:58,090
you know if you if you shift you know a

2113
01:34:55,750 --> 01:35:00,399
thousand acres GMO corn farm with glad

2114
01:34:58,090 --> 01:35:02,170
to save everything else in the soil you

2115
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:04,629
know I mean like I think a lot of the

2116
01:35:02,170 --> 01:35:06,069
testing kind of eventually wants it you

2117
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:08,560
know you knew people then have to either

2118
01:35:06,069 --> 01:35:10,809
go straight to isolating CBD to a single

2119
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,700
molecule just to purify it to not fail

2120
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:14,890
you know or they're gonna have to go

2121
01:35:12,699 --> 01:35:16,420
grow rope for ten years you know while

2122
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:18,190
they sit this one out and figure it out

2123
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:19,930
then clean up the environment and

2124
01:35:18,189 --> 01:35:21,819
involve all I would be else is able to

2125
01:35:19,930 --> 01:35:23,050
you know kind of show what they've done

2126
01:35:21,819 --> 01:35:24,670
I mean because it's almost like chickens

2127
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:34,329
come home to roost moment you know

2128
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:39,840
performing Appalachian in Los Angeles

2129
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:42,550
indoors under bites in in container soil

2130
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:46,110
is that what's your opinion on that

2131
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:48,820
that's that's a silly proposition sucks

2132
01:35:46,109 --> 01:35:50,859
here with a conversation on California's

2133
01:35:48,819 --> 01:35:52,569
version of appellations of origin I was

2134
01:35:50,859 --> 01:35:54,880
with the work the Appalachians working

2135
01:35:52,569 --> 01:35:58,170
group in Sacramento with CDFA and Cal

2136
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,279
cannabis this past year and

2137
01:35:58,170 --> 01:36:02,489
there's a there's an important

2138
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:05,189
distinction to be made what what the

2139
01:36:02,488 --> 01:36:07,109
folks in Los Angeles would like is for

2140
01:36:05,189 --> 01:36:10,759
state law to change so that you can

2141
01:36:07,109 --> 01:36:13,198
designate a geographic area of origin

2142
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:16,140
which fits right into what Alec was just

2143
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:18,629
saying but it's not appellations of

2144
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:20,369
origin appellations of origin are

2145
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:22,949
different that has to do with standards

2146
01:36:20,369 --> 01:36:26,519
and practices and cultivars at least by

2147
01:36:22,948 --> 01:36:27,479
law here in California and there are two

2148
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:29,640
different programs

2149
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:32,189
there's the appellation of origin

2150
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:36,480
program which is very exclusive if you

2151
01:36:32,189 --> 01:36:39,389
will and it requires creating a local

2152
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:41,069
Appalachian group that then applies to

2153
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:43,079
Cal cannabis for permission to have an

2154
01:36:41,069 --> 01:36:46,198
appellation of origin whereas the

2155
01:36:43,079 --> 01:36:49,079
geographic indicator system is what la

2156
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:52,939
is after and state law allows a county

2157
01:36:49,079 --> 01:36:55,529
of origin designation on packaging and

2158
01:36:52,939 --> 01:36:57,059
what we'd like to see changed is it

2159
01:36:55,529 --> 01:37:00,090
could be and there is a bill in the

2160
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:03,570
legislature to make this happen that it

2161
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:06,029
would be a city or county of origin and

2162
01:37:03,569 --> 01:37:08,130
that would allow the LA indoor growers

2163
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:11,130
and the San Francisco and Oakland indoor

2164
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:12,960
growers nobody knows Alameda County as a

2165
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:16,739
source of indoor cannabis but people

2166
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:18,689
know Oakland and so yeah they're two

2167
01:37:16,738 --> 01:37:21,509
different programs it's really important

2168
01:37:18,689 --> 01:37:24,059
to distinguish between them the the the

2169
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:27,600
geographic indicator county or city of

2170
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:29,880
origin is a very inclusive it includes

2171
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:33,929
everybody that's doing cannabis activity

2172
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:36,090
in that geographic area an appellation

2173
01:37:33,929 --> 01:37:37,710
of origin is a very exclusive thing

2174
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:45,440
that's all I got

2175
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:49,980
thank you you have to you don't add

2176
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:53,359
large fertilizer to grow more grapes

2177
01:37:49,979 --> 01:37:57,599
that's not the way they prefer like yes

2178
01:37:53,359 --> 01:38:00,779
dirt soil yeah France France is that

2179
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,230
there's actually fair laughs at lap

2180
01:38:00,779 --> 01:38:04,019
aleshia

2181
01:38:01,229 --> 01:38:06,359
eppley Shinto origin a French term is

2182
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:09,810
actually fairly well protected in France

2183
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:11,369
just because of the wine industry and it

2184
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:12,119
traces back to you know different types

2185
01:38:11,369 --> 01:38:14,158
of wine being

2186
01:38:12,118 --> 01:38:16,259
in different or different appellations

2187
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:20,279
in in France that way they could produce

2188
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:22,409
uniform wine that whether whether that

2189
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:24,809
wine has distributed work throughout the

2190
01:38:22,408 --> 01:38:27,839
world if it if it says it's a burgundy

2191
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:29,250
wine or says it's a champagne wine we

2192
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:32,099
know that it's going to be produced in

2193
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:33,840
in that region under the same soil with

2194
01:38:32,099 --> 01:38:36,989
the same weather that way

2195
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:39,060
if you you know try one year versus a

2196
01:38:36,988 --> 01:38:40,888
different here you can see variation

2197
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:42,780
within the year but the but if you try

2198
01:38:40,889 --> 01:38:44,460
two different wineries from the same

2199
01:38:42,779 --> 01:38:46,198
year they should have fairly uniform

2200
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:49,198
grape then that's what I want with

2201
01:38:46,198 --> 01:38:51,809
cannabis yeah and you're that's a great

2202
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:53,638
way for you know cuz there's everybody's

2203
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:55,349
focusing on trying to grow a thousand

2204
01:38:53,639 --> 01:38:57,090
acres what they don't realize is that

2205
01:38:55,349 --> 01:38:59,639
you're gonna make way more money as a

2206
01:38:57,090 --> 01:39:02,630
craft farmer growing high quality for

2207
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:05,849
high quality flavors in biodynamic soils

2208
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:07,770
producing phenomenal flavors that that

2209
01:39:05,849 --> 01:39:10,170
are going to be either extracted or

2210
01:39:07,770 --> 01:39:12,270
smoked or even consumed for the

2211
01:39:10,170 --> 01:39:13,980
flavonoid profile because all those are

2212
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:15,590
there other terpenes not the

2213
01:39:13,979 --> 01:39:19,129
cannabinoids are going to be what

2214
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:22,170
increases the value of your CBDs or th

2215
01:39:19,130 --> 01:39:25,529
yeah I couldn't agree more and to that

2216
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:27,719
point to you know I think um you know in

2217
01:39:25,529 --> 01:39:29,789
this in this world word like that big AG

2218
01:39:27,719 --> 01:39:31,889
approach towards mono cropping towards

2219
01:39:29,789 --> 01:39:33,840
moving it to conventional AG land has

2220
01:39:31,889 --> 01:39:36,510
happened I almost feel like the plants

2221
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:38,250
trolling us in this way busy and this in

2222
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:40,199
this great time of legalization where

2223
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:43,279
everybody's coming in to you know take

2224
01:39:40,198 --> 01:39:45,779
their piece and to crush the competition

2225
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:47,908
you know it's actually setting people up

2226
01:39:45,779 --> 01:39:49,710
for massive failures that we're walking

2227
01:39:47,908 --> 01:39:51,960
through every day you know around these

2228
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:54,329
these unavoidable residual environmental

2229
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:56,010
contaminants that have become legacy to

2230
01:39:54,329 --> 01:39:58,349
that land as a result of the Green

2231
01:39:56,010 --> 01:40:00,829
Revolution and as a result of you know

2232
01:39:58,349 --> 01:40:02,969
post-world war two practices around

2233
01:40:00,829 --> 01:40:05,639
petrochemicals and nerve agents being

2234
01:40:02,969 --> 01:40:07,139
now used on you know treating growing

2235
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:08,760
plants and treating you know keeping

2236
01:40:07,139 --> 01:40:11,099
away pests and paths of the pathology

2237
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:13,469
but you know but but now like I really

2238
01:40:11,099 --> 01:40:15,810
see from the analytical side of testing

2239
01:40:13,469 --> 01:40:17,520
on cannabis it's almost really it's

2240
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:19,920
reinforcing the slow food moving

2241
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:21,060
idealism know what the source of where

2242
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,649
you're getting your products and your

2243
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:24,630
ingredients and it's more about quality

2244
01:40:22,649 --> 01:40:25,920
of ingredients and it is just getting in

2245
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:27,960
bunions and mass

2246
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:35,609
biomass you know because one of us comes

2247
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:37,619
to and could look on the bright side yes

2248
01:40:35,609 --> 01:40:39,750
sir yeah after a bunch of people have to

2249
01:40:37,619 --> 01:40:40,829
go go go ropes for ten years you know

2250
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:42,869
because I mean a lot of these people

2251
01:40:40,829 --> 01:40:44,069
like they're like I'm watching it happen

2252
01:40:42,869 --> 01:40:45,988
they're being forced in these positions

2253
01:40:44,069 --> 01:40:47,579
where you know there's these certain

2254
01:40:45,988 --> 01:40:49,919
regions that are almost getting

2255
01:40:47,579 --> 01:40:53,219
blacklisted as a result of you know

2256
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:54,750
these like in you know can consistent I

2257
01:40:53,219 --> 01:40:55,829
mean so many people are spinning their

2258
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:57,289
wheels they have they're building out

2259
01:40:55,829 --> 01:40:59,488
these like twenty five million dollar

2260
01:40:57,289 --> 01:41:00,840
manufacturing facilities and then they

2261
01:40:59,488 --> 01:41:02,698
just have people on the road going to

2262
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:04,739
all the mega farms looking you know

2263
01:41:02,698 --> 01:41:06,599
living for material they're taking

2264
01:41:04,738 --> 01:41:09,059
samples of it they're going they're

2265
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:11,190
taking like a representative sample of

2266
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:13,020
say about thousand pounds they're micro

2267
01:41:11,189 --> 01:41:14,669
extracting it so they can concentrate

2268
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:16,410
anything all of it to see if it tests

2269
01:41:14,670 --> 01:41:19,289
clean and then they bring it to the lab

2270
01:41:16,409 --> 01:41:21,479
pass test dirty and you said and you

2271
01:41:19,289 --> 01:41:22,649
know just so on so forth you know so

2272
01:41:21,479 --> 01:41:24,329
people are just spinning their wheels in

2273
01:41:22,649 --> 01:41:26,549
this time and what we're seeing is so

2274
01:41:24,329 --> 01:41:28,439
many the small craft farms that have the

2275
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:31,050
quality ingredients that are preserving

2276
01:41:28,439 --> 01:41:32,579
their terpenes that are diversifying the

2277
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:35,159
terpenes you know people are starting to

2278
01:41:32,579 --> 01:41:36,988
like lock-in long term you know trend

2279
01:41:35,159 --> 01:41:38,609
contracts with these people for like

2280
01:41:36,988 --> 01:41:40,799
five to eight hundred dollars a pound

2281
01:41:38,609 --> 01:41:42,509
for Tran you know in this moment where

2282
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,560
nobody can even get rid of their trim in

2283
01:41:42,510 --> 01:41:45,239
a lot of these other areas unless

2284
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:47,850
they're going straight again to isolate

2285
01:41:45,238 --> 01:41:49,678
you know or remediation you know and so

2286
01:41:47,850 --> 01:41:51,660
it's in so many ways I feel like it's

2287
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:53,880
not only creating this barrier of entry

2288
01:41:51,659 --> 01:41:55,920
to for people to come in and try to

2289
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:59,130
pilfer this plant and it's giving this

2290
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:01,050
massive you know in robust advantage

2291
01:41:59,130 --> 01:42:02,279
then to the people that have taken care

2292
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:06,510
of this plant that I'm going to steward

2293
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:08,130
this platform ins and you know and then

2294
01:42:06,510 --> 01:42:10,230
through that I think it's also helping

2295
01:42:08,130 --> 01:42:12,239
to raise awareness to you know the food

2296
01:42:10,229 --> 01:42:14,129
we eat and what's on the food and and

2297
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:15,809
then you know I don't smoke coming back

2298
01:42:14,130 --> 01:42:17,969
to Seder and the other pesticide or

2299
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:20,400
fungicide so why would I want eat it and

2300
01:42:17,969 --> 01:42:23,579
I really in in real time and see kind of

2301
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:24,809
disaffection you know the plant exactly

2302
01:42:23,579 --> 01:42:26,729
if you're saying Sam it's like it's

2303
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:29,429
going to you know how those effects I'm

2304
01:42:26,729 --> 01:42:31,309
shifting at its trolling trolling the

2305
01:42:29,429 --> 01:42:34,020
people that are wasting money trying to

2306
01:42:31,310 --> 01:42:36,179
you grow for money right is that a lot

2307
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:39,840
of those people are gonna be planting in

2308
01:42:36,179 --> 01:42:43,380
contaminated soil it's gonna play dirty

2309
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:45,329
all of that stuff in various different

2310
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:47,159
parts of the plant we've we've seen you

2311
01:42:45,329 --> 01:42:49,470
know the plant will accumulate some of

2312
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:51,239
the heavy metals in the seed husk the

2313
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:53,130
seed shell but it actually will bio

2314
01:42:51,239 --> 01:42:56,250
accumulate other pesticides and other

2315
01:42:53,130 --> 01:43:00,810
parts to play it so I'd imagine

2316
01:42:56,250 --> 01:43:03,180
radioactive nucleotides yeah emulate it

2317
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:05,190
but it's gonna by accumulated parts of

2318
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:06,720
the plant so no matter what you your

2319
01:43:05,189 --> 01:43:10,789
crops gonna be you're gonna have to be

2320
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:10,789
able to test and identify what those bio

2321
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:23,220
as you're developing that process

2322
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:26,100
obviously using those contaminated

2323
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:27,930
biomass there's ways to clean it if you

2324
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:29,490
have competent labs and then confident

2325
01:43:27,930 --> 01:43:31,650
analytical labs that can help you

2326
01:43:29,489 --> 01:43:32,579
develop to remove those contaminants but

2327
01:43:31,649 --> 01:43:35,250
you're gonna have to go through a

2328
01:43:32,579 --> 01:43:37,500
greater amount of refining so then you

2329
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:39,239
know and there's going to me a market

2330
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:41,369
for distillate nice loot because it's

2331
01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:44,729
easier to export to to the three percent

2332
01:43:41,369 --> 01:43:47,279
or 1 percent water but that said

2333
01:43:44,729 --> 01:43:49,169
everyone who watches has Church

2334
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:54,210
obviously understands that higher

2335
01:43:49,170 --> 01:43:55,980
quality is more desirable than bulk so

2336
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:58,680
being able to produce you know have your

2337
01:43:55,979 --> 01:44:02,089
having quality as well as you know as

2338
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:04,079
trying to develop quality into scale

2339
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:05,760
there's gonna end up having better

2340
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:08,640
better results for the farmers and

2341
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:10,800
better results for the hash makers and

2342
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:13,380
Mike real quick a question for you you

2343
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:17,029
know so so we we've recently started to

2344
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:21,239
conduct a series of experiments because

2345
01:44:17,029 --> 01:44:22,920
we we have this hypothesis that a lot of

2346
01:44:21,239 --> 01:44:25,889
the bioaccumulation and metals and

2347
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:27,930
pesticides you know it's we are seeing

2348
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:29,520
and bioaccumulation you know through the

2349
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:32,070
plant of it whatever the toxin is right

2350
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:33,450
heavy metals we're really seeing kind of

2351
01:44:32,069 --> 01:44:36,329
on the flower whenever they're being

2352
01:44:33,449 --> 01:44:37,829
fully applied when water and combination

2353
01:44:36,329 --> 01:44:39,210
of foliar inputs are being fully applied

2354
01:44:37,829 --> 01:44:40,500
every five eight you know so the

2355
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:42,899
accumulation metals we're seeing one

2356
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:45,569
flower happening much more from fully up

2357
01:44:42,899 --> 01:44:47,309
against than from all beer soil coming

2358
01:44:45,569 --> 01:44:49,619
up three roots in the stock if your

2359
01:44:47,310 --> 01:44:54,700
loved one knows too

2360
01:44:49,619 --> 01:44:57,819
'i'm cadmium arsenic Latimer you know we

2361
01:44:54,699 --> 01:45:00,760
don't see well so that's that's kind of

2362
01:44:57,819 --> 01:45:03,579
it so so so with my second question is

2363
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:05,560
are they watered overhead by pivot or

2364
01:45:03,579 --> 01:45:08,050
are they flood are the fields flooded

2365
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:10,870
right because that pertains the delivery

2366
01:45:08,050 --> 01:45:13,539
on the planet sure Wilson well so it so

2367
01:45:10,869 --> 01:45:16,779
so we see we see a 2% fail rate in Flour

2368
01:45:13,539 --> 01:45:20,560
for heavy metals 1% for arsenic 1%

2369
01:45:16,779 --> 01:45:22,960
separately for cadmium and so well all

2370
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:24,880
over the state and so when we see what's

2371
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:26,439
the failure web so failure rate or

2372
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:29,650
what's the what's the what's the

2373
01:45:26,439 --> 01:45:33,159
threshold they have to me my love 200

2374
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:35,199
part per billion point 2 ppm yeah I mean

2375
01:45:33,159 --> 01:45:43,750
and this is just like redic isn't that

2376
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:46,000
ridiculous like you think well anything

2377
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:49,238
in the state of California below to

2378
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:51,970
whatever people you build you know we

2379
01:45:49,238 --> 01:45:55,059
only see 2% fill so I mean 98 percents

2380
01:45:51,970 --> 01:46:04,390
passing right so so anyway so real quick

2381
01:45:55,060 --> 01:46:07,180
so the emanation from mining or lumber I

2382
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:09,700
think a lot of its coming from folks who

2383
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:11,560
are foyer feeding as versus flooding the

2384
01:46:09,699 --> 01:46:12,939
root zone yeah well that's and that's

2385
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:14,170
what we found because like one of my

2386
01:46:12,939 --> 01:46:15,369
biggest parts of the biggest part of my

2387
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:17,710
job isn't somebody feel happy

2388
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:19,180
somebody's failing I engage in a root

2389
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:20,980
cause analysis and we go through a

2390
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:23,050
series of environmental assessment tests

2391
01:46:20,979 --> 01:46:24,399
such as testing water testing all the

2392
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:27,640
individual foliar inputs that you're

2393
01:46:24,399 --> 01:46:30,849
adding to the mixes and in with you know

2394
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:33,700
98 95 plus percent confidence we've

2395
01:46:30,850 --> 01:46:35,650
begun to identify the foliar inputs more

2396
01:46:33,699 --> 01:46:36,849
so than the water that you're feeding

2397
01:46:35,649 --> 01:46:39,579
into the roots because you could take

2398
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:41,380
you know any you know really high level

2399
01:46:39,579 --> 01:46:42,699
arsenic guano's and all these other

2400
01:46:41,380 --> 01:46:43,600
things and they're gonna accumulate in

2401
01:46:42,699 --> 01:46:45,309
the plant but it's not gonna

2402
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,989
bioaccumulate slip through and that's

2403
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:48,850
having a series of conversations with

2404
01:46:46,988 --> 01:46:50,649
Roy Upton who's the executive director

2405
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:53,230
of the American Herbal pharmacopoeia and

2406
01:46:50,649 --> 01:46:55,329
he wasn't actually surprised by the fact

2407
01:46:53,229 --> 01:46:57,579
that there was there was such a low fail

2408
01:46:55,329 --> 01:46:58,840
rate of flour two percent and and

2409
01:46:57,579 --> 01:47:00,219
wondered what he was getting into it he

2410
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:02,170
was he was making the comparison of

2411
01:47:00,219 --> 01:47:03,309
American ginseng because with American

2412
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:04,838
ginseng it's a Korean

2413
01:47:03,309 --> 01:47:07,179
a plant that grows year after year in

2414
01:47:04,838 --> 01:47:08,800
the soil and so so through the monograph

2415
01:47:07,179 --> 01:47:12,158
process they were actually able to

2416
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:14,559
identify the doubling each year of heavy

2417
01:47:12,158 --> 01:47:16,538
metal accumulation in the plant as it's

2418
01:47:14,559 --> 01:47:18,128
growing in the soil year up a year but

2419
01:47:16,538 --> 01:47:20,078
but he was saying with cannabis since

2420
01:47:18,128 --> 01:47:22,118
cannabis is such a short flowering

2421
01:47:20,078 --> 01:47:24,578
annual plan you know maybe if it flower

2422
01:47:22,118 --> 01:47:25,779
another 1825 weeks or something maybe

2423
01:47:24,578 --> 01:47:27,698
they'll be more of an accumulation

2424
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:30,488
further from the roots to the stock up

2425
01:47:27,698 --> 01:47:31,928
into the fruit right and so so so the

2426
01:47:30,488 --> 01:47:33,968
fact is we're not seeing the craziest

2427
01:47:31,929 --> 01:47:35,708
fail rates and flower you know but when

2428
01:47:33,969 --> 01:47:37,239
we are seeing it you know it's a it's

2429
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:38,828
being kind of correlated back to the

2430
01:47:37,238 --> 01:47:40,208
water you know cuz it's like are you

2431
01:47:38,828 --> 01:47:42,308
filtering or I'm filtering your water

2432
01:47:40,208 --> 01:47:43,988
you know ro what you're the what you're

2433
01:47:42,309 --> 01:47:45,429
spraying on the plants you know so

2434
01:47:43,988 --> 01:47:48,998
that's the start and then it's like okay

2435
01:47:45,429 --> 01:47:51,279
well guano seaweed fish pH ups and downs

2436
01:47:48,998 --> 01:47:53,108
but you don't the very policy and we've

2437
01:47:51,279 --> 01:47:55,029
tested for part four million of cadmium

2438
01:47:53,109 --> 01:47:57,039
and like but Paragard you know it's just

2439
01:47:55,029 --> 01:47:59,529
a series of different kind of both

2440
01:47:57,038 --> 01:48:02,889
beneficial or biological pesticides or

2441
01:47:59,529 --> 01:48:04,538
foliar sprays and nutrients but but I

2442
01:48:02,889 --> 01:48:07,569
guess the big part of where I was kind

2443
01:48:04,538 --> 01:48:09,938
of going through this is you know in

2444
01:48:07,569 --> 01:48:12,039
mono crop farming cannabis you know we

2445
01:48:09,939 --> 01:48:14,559
have this hypothesis that whenever you

2446
01:48:12,038 --> 01:48:17,349
if your row crop in thirty acres of

2447
01:48:14,559 --> 01:48:18,939
cannabis you no longer you harvesting it

2448
01:48:17,349 --> 01:48:20,619
with the sanctity at which we've harvest

2449
01:48:18,939 --> 01:48:21,399
in this plant all our life you know

2450
01:48:20,618 --> 01:48:23,348
which is there you taking the

2451
01:48:21,399 --> 01:48:25,449
inflorescence of the plant the sugar

2452
01:48:23,349 --> 01:48:27,010
leaf the flower you're separating it

2453
01:48:25,448 --> 01:48:28,238
from the stock you know but whenever

2454
01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:29,949
you're talking about farming with

2455
01:48:28,238 --> 01:48:32,018
tractors on this level and you and

2456
01:48:29,948 --> 01:48:34,628
you're truly farming for biomass where

2457
01:48:32,019 --> 01:48:36,399
you chip in the stock back with the

2458
01:48:34,628 --> 01:48:38,828
flower so you can do these industrial

2459
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:40,899
scale extractions on it you know we're

2460
01:48:38,828 --> 01:48:43,448
really curious as to whether there's

2461
01:48:40,899 --> 01:48:46,119
gonna be like multiple time increase in

2462
01:48:43,448 --> 01:48:47,918
metals and also potentially pesticides

2463
01:48:46,118 --> 01:48:49,538
because you're using the stock you're

2464
01:48:47,918 --> 01:48:51,568
almost it's almost again the plant

2465
01:48:49,538 --> 01:48:54,309
rolling mills you can't plate you can't

2466
01:48:51,569 --> 01:48:56,019
plant like broccoli or whatever you know

2467
01:48:54,309 --> 01:48:58,329
and and and whenever you if you're gonna

2468
01:48:56,019 --> 01:49:00,429
try to harvest it in this way that's not

2469
01:48:58,328 --> 01:49:02,378
your cherishing the flowers and all the

2470
01:49:00,429 --> 01:49:04,059
you know the part of the plant that

2471
01:49:02,378 --> 01:49:05,889
we're harvesting I'm gonna use the stack

2472
01:49:04,059 --> 01:49:08,498
is this talking to bring about like five

2473
01:49:05,889 --> 01:49:09,279
types contamination concentration on top

2474
01:49:08,498 --> 01:49:12,099
of the fact that you're already

2475
01:49:09,279 --> 01:49:14,378
contaminated in Baghdad absolutely

2476
01:49:12,099 --> 01:49:16,569
absolutely and it all has to do with you

2477
01:49:14,378 --> 01:49:17,559
know we can lurk in it to what they are

2478
01:49:16,569 --> 01:49:19,289
grape growing we

2479
01:49:17,559 --> 01:49:22,689
Larkin it - you know the way that you

2480
01:49:19,288 --> 01:49:24,908
jab some japanese gardeners will you

2481
01:49:22,689 --> 01:49:26,769
know cut down and only grow melons in

2482
01:49:24,908 --> 01:49:28,779
one specific way and they'll put them in

2483
01:49:26,769 --> 01:49:34,208
shape so that they grow a heart-shaped

2484
01:49:28,779 --> 01:49:36,188
melon that they and then in japan that

2485
01:49:34,208 --> 01:49:38,229
kind of craft melon production has

2486
01:49:36,189 --> 01:49:41,409
melons selling extreme attica lee higher

2487
01:49:38,229 --> 01:49:43,989
prices and that really boils down good

2488
01:49:41,408 --> 01:49:46,779
genetics of the plant good terroir it's

2489
01:49:43,988 --> 01:49:48,848
gonna be child grown how its culture

2490
01:49:46,779 --> 01:49:50,318
didn't et cetera but in many cases

2491
01:49:48,849 --> 01:49:52,569
they're taking much more care of the

2492
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:55,209
plant than they are growing it on in

2493
01:49:52,569 --> 01:49:58,359
trying to grow it in mass it when when

2494
01:49:55,208 --> 01:50:00,608
we're growing monocultures of CBD you

2495
01:49:58,359 --> 01:50:04,300
have to take more you it's difficult to

2496
01:50:00,609 --> 01:50:06,099
have the labor that's incorporated in it

2497
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:09,159
so that you're gonna see stratification

2498
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:14,199
in the CBD industry where you a raft

2499
01:50:09,158 --> 01:50:17,138
grow craft grown see Wow reach a premium

2500
01:50:14,198 --> 01:50:17,678
whereas if you if you grow it in the

2501
01:50:17,139 --> 01:50:20,168
desert

2502
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:21,368
for biomass it's not gonna it's not

2503
01:50:20,168 --> 01:50:22,809
going to produce as many of those

2504
01:50:21,368 --> 01:50:24,279
monitor but no it's because a lot of

2505
01:50:22,809 --> 01:50:30,878
those monitor fluids are gonna get flash

2506
01:50:24,279 --> 01:50:32,679
off during the drying for isolate

2507
01:50:30,878 --> 01:50:35,019
production there's there's use for that

2508
01:50:32,679 --> 01:50:36,368
and if you're but like like you said if

2509
01:50:35,019 --> 01:50:38,469
you're not removing those fan leaves

2510
01:50:36,368 --> 01:50:42,398
you're gonna be increasing the amount of

2511
01:50:38,469 --> 01:50:44,979
wax concentration that's in dependable

2512
01:50:42,399 --> 01:50:46,769
mass if you're not removing the stems

2513
01:50:44,979 --> 01:50:49,838
you're gonna you know be able to pull

2514
01:50:46,769 --> 01:50:51,849
whatever is potentially bioaccumulative

2515
01:50:49,838 --> 01:50:53,649
in those stems and if you're trying to

2516
01:50:51,849 --> 01:50:55,239
extract seeded bud you're not only going

2517
01:50:53,649 --> 01:50:58,599
to extract the oil that's in the seeds

2518
01:50:55,238 --> 01:51:03,279
but you're gonna make metals that are

2519
01:50:58,599 --> 01:51:05,019
found in the seed coat hold on somebody

2520
01:51:03,279 --> 01:51:08,288
somebody is asking but what about

2521
01:51:05,019 --> 01:51:10,569
chemtrails you know what's really funny

2522
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:11,889
about chemtrails is i mean like what's

2523
01:51:10,569 --> 01:51:13,389
funny about chemtrails is everybody

2524
01:51:11,889 --> 01:51:15,668
always thought when heavy-metal testing

2525
01:51:13,389 --> 01:51:17,588
kicked in the areas were that are highly

2526
01:51:15,668 --> 01:51:19,448
sprayed we're gonna be the ones that

2527
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:21,309
just had the craziest agreed as fail

2528
01:51:19,448 --> 01:51:22,808
rates for metals and I mean we're

2529
01:51:21,309 --> 01:51:25,748
testing for cadmium we're not test I

2530
01:51:22,809 --> 01:51:27,219
mean you know in the idea of what you

2531
01:51:25,748 --> 01:51:29,288
know the thought of what has been in

2532
01:51:27,219 --> 01:51:31,569
Cantrell's you know maybe we should we

2533
01:51:29,288 --> 01:51:31,880
test it for more metals would see but

2534
01:51:31,569 --> 01:51:33,800
we're not

2535
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:37,219
seeing any cut type of insanely higher

2536
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:39,650
rate of fail are you testing for

2537
01:51:37,219 --> 01:51:42,319
aluminum well so aluminum no where was

2538
01:51:39,649 --> 01:51:44,899
the california peñalosa art when we

2539
01:51:42,319 --> 01:51:46,819
tested with the full library we tested

2540
01:51:44,899 --> 01:51:48,799
we're building a bike a prop 65 metal

2541
01:51:46,819 --> 01:51:51,019
tusks - that's for you know however many

2542
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:53,210
total metals are on that list right now

2543
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:55,250
like you know the the kind of throughput

2544
01:51:53,210 --> 01:51:58,279
service we offer is primarily for these

2545
01:51:55,250 --> 01:52:00,139
four regulated metals LED at 500 parts

2546
01:51:58,279 --> 01:52:02,630
per billion mercury at 100 parts per

2547
01:52:00,139 --> 01:52:06,949
billion arsenic and cadmium each at 200

2548
01:52:02,630 --> 01:52:08,449
billion and so you know like it was it

2549
01:52:06,948 --> 01:52:09,619
was interesting because everybody one of

2550
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:12,408
her face three kicked in at the

2551
01:52:09,619 --> 01:52:14,389
beginning of two you know this year 2019

2552
01:52:12,408 --> 01:52:16,549
and heavy metal testing was part of the

2553
01:52:14,389 --> 01:52:17,989
regimen everybody was thinking it was

2554
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:19,789
gonna be this extinction level of that

2555
01:52:17,988 --> 01:52:21,049
and everybody's gonna be dead and just

2556
01:52:19,789 --> 01:52:23,149
it was gonna be the thing that killed

2557
01:52:21,050 --> 01:52:24,679
everybody's business but you know we'd

2558
01:52:23,149 --> 01:52:26,359
spend quite the opposite focusing you

2559
01:52:24,679 --> 01:52:28,609
know again it's you know these really

2560
01:52:26,359 --> 01:52:30,619
low percent fail rates like land were

2561
01:52:28,609 --> 01:52:32,359
almost exclusively saying as a part of

2562
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:34,819
manufacturing process cartridges

2563
01:52:32,359 --> 01:52:36,799
particularly but also shitty cheap

2564
01:52:34,819 --> 01:52:41,238
chinese glass and other types of you

2565
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:44,570
know leaching any shiny metal from from

2566
01:52:41,238 --> 01:52:47,539
china could potentially be he be

2567
01:52:44,569 --> 01:52:51,349
contaminated with either lead or cadmium

2568
01:52:47,539 --> 01:52:53,060
or nickel or i'm surprised just given

2569
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:55,730
the whole erin brockovich thing that

2570
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:58,610
kali hasn't also put chromium on that

2571
01:52:55,729 --> 01:53:00,619
list right chromium six is another bad

2572
01:52:58,609 --> 01:53:03,559
actor it's interesting because chromium

2573
01:53:00,619 --> 01:53:06,109
three is fine right you can buy chromium

2574
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:09,050
three at GNC and pop a couple capsules

2575
01:53:06,109 --> 01:53:10,849
of it today but chromium six is that's

2576
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:13,100
the Erin Brockovich chromium right

2577
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:15,230
that's the bad chromium that's the

2578
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:17,630
chromium that they use to code airplanes

2579
01:53:15,229 --> 01:53:20,209
and and and ships with and [ __ ] like

2580
01:53:17,630 --> 01:53:21,469
that that's what you and Mark you know

2581
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:22,969
what's what's interesting about the

2582
01:53:21,469 --> 01:53:25,939
whole thing is because I mean California

2583
01:53:22,969 --> 01:53:29,480
from from what I see did didn't you

2584
01:53:25,939 --> 01:53:31,219
indeed learned and an advanced past kind

2585
01:53:29,479 --> 01:53:33,349
of all them you know this mistake

2586
01:53:31,219 --> 01:53:35,810
mistakes of the previous states that

2587
01:53:33,350 --> 01:53:38,300
regulated and so you know some say that

2588
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:39,860
you went too far but again like you know

2589
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:42,050
whenever you look at these like you know

2590
01:53:39,859 --> 01:53:43,179
Google California average fail rates

2591
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:45,449
across all these different categories

2592
01:53:43,179 --> 01:53:46,829
it's not as gnarly as

2593
01:53:45,449 --> 01:53:48,779
you know everybody thought you know once

2594
01:53:46,829 --> 01:53:50,340
these minimum level is a quality hit you

2595
01:53:48,779 --> 01:53:53,219
know we've seen you know from before

2596
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:55,199
regulation to after you know he was like

2597
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:57,390
fifty sixty percent reduction in a lot

2598
01:53:55,199 --> 01:54:00,239
of these common pesticides making it

2599
01:53:57,390 --> 01:54:02,070
through to the final retail space but

2600
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:04,050
anyway like with your the metals and

2601
01:54:02,069 --> 01:54:06,000
with pesticides though there there could

2602
01:54:04,050 --> 01:54:08,909
be more more compounds added like

2603
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,350
chromium states like Nicola and I've

2604
01:54:08,909 --> 01:54:12,869
been hearing of nickel poisoning being

2605
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:14,490
about breaking from mortgages and like

2606
01:54:12,869 --> 01:54:16,019
nickel-plated cartridges but then also

2607
01:54:14,489 --> 01:54:18,569
glyphosate how much glad to States

2608
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:19,940
sprayed in California yeah we're seeing

2609
01:54:18,569 --> 01:54:22,289
kind of hemp farmers that are

2610
01:54:19,939 --> 01:54:24,809
desiccating thirty acres of their

2611
01:54:22,289 --> 01:54:27,180
Tomatoes so that they can kind of pull

2612
01:54:24,810 --> 01:54:29,100
it out and then replant it with hemp you

2613
01:54:27,180 --> 01:54:33,409
know is that gonna be poison I think so

2614
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:36,270
I would never want I was like and

2615
01:54:33,409 --> 01:54:40,619
smoking reports that I'm seeing in the

2616
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:43,680
news or what Mike blow cards macro cards

2617
01:54:40,619 --> 01:54:46,890
I mean it's it's it's unknown like I

2618
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:48,360
mean that that's a whole other just will

2619
01:54:46,890 --> 01:54:50,130
do the e-juice thing is one of the

2620
01:54:48,359 --> 01:54:51,539
gnarliest things I've ever seen in my

2621
01:54:50,130 --> 01:54:53,909
life because I was puffing those tools

2622
01:54:51,539 --> 01:54:55,769
really really tough we started doing a

2623
01:54:53,909 --> 01:54:58,409
pretty quick pretty big assessment of

2624
01:54:55,770 --> 01:55:01,710
the e-juice you because somebody told me

2625
01:54:58,409 --> 01:55:03,569
that it's like the e that e-cigs and the

2626
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:04,949
nicotine that come from me sings like I

2627
01:55:03,569 --> 01:55:06,809
was saying I'm just puffing one of these

2628
01:55:04,949 --> 01:55:08,939
jewels and my body was like you're

2629
01:55:06,810 --> 01:55:10,230
really smart I can't believe you're just

2630
01:55:08,939 --> 01:55:12,599
puffing up and he's like where do you

2631
01:55:10,229 --> 01:55:14,729
think that nicotine comes from and as I

2632
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:16,980
what it's like synthesized nicotine so

2633
01:55:14,729 --> 01:55:19,859
he's like no dude it's the hot dog water

2634
01:55:16,979 --> 01:55:22,679
distillate of the tobacco crop and I was

2635
01:55:19,859 --> 01:55:32,219
like wow and so I immediately went back

2636
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:34,380
to it's more isolated like like cocaine

2637
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:36,770
would be because it's an alkaloid you

2638
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:40,619
can crash out the hydrochloride saw of

2639
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:42,420
my well so I'm sure I'm sure

2640
01:55:40,619 --> 01:55:43,920
because that's what's real quick because

2641
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:46,260
Merck that's what we're seeing so we're

2642
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:48,899
seeing if we test a bunch of tobacco

2643
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:51,659
like Marlboro and all these other kind

2644
01:55:48,899 --> 01:55:54,269
of conventional graham-cracker crops we

2645
01:55:51,659 --> 01:55:56,340
see a series of pesticides right cat1

2646
01:55:54,270 --> 01:55:59,469
cat2 pesticides different concentrations

2647
01:55:56,340 --> 01:56:03,399
etc etc when we're testing a Jew

2648
01:55:59,469 --> 01:56:07,269
we're almost exclusively seeing Diamond

2649
01:56:03,399 --> 01:56:08,499
azide owl our uh our I know like say

2650
01:56:07,269 --> 01:56:10,179
diamond is because there's certain

2651
01:56:08,498 --> 01:56:12,128
compounds like even Mike would be

2652
01:56:10,179 --> 01:56:13,689
positive an example like that needs

2653
01:56:12,128 --> 01:56:15,760
Sampson Poseidon the extraction process

2654
01:56:13,689 --> 01:56:17,859
was separate with certain process he's

2655
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:19,359
nonpolar polar you know with filtration

2656
01:56:17,859 --> 01:56:21,699
these different things but we're seeing

2657
01:56:19,359 --> 01:56:24,699
other ones you will kind of linearly

2658
01:56:21,698 --> 01:56:26,438
concentrate with the extraction and and

2659
01:56:24,698 --> 01:56:31,628
so what's what's really really weird

2660
01:56:26,439 --> 01:56:32,949
it's only twenty degrees off weight but

2661
01:56:31,628 --> 01:56:34,599
I don't know what's up in the diamond is

2662
01:56:32,948 --> 01:56:36,608
out into conversation but diamonds are

2663
01:56:34,599 --> 01:56:38,708
you know Foss belowed flower dragon this

2664
01:56:36,609 --> 01:56:40,090
plant growth retardant you know that was

2665
01:56:38,708 --> 01:56:43,538
part of the a lower scare of the

2666
01:56:40,090 --> 01:56:46,208
eighties you know where they're ours you

2667
01:56:43,538 --> 01:56:47,800
approve to use on Apple crops and you

2668
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:49,538
know they're you know and on orchards

2669
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:51,550
and they're make huge apples and they're

2670
01:56:49,538 --> 01:56:54,340
all going to baby food and then the

2671
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:56,139
skeevy a report came out in like 1987 or

2672
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:58,479
88 detailing the carcinogenic properties

2673
01:56:56,139 --> 01:57:00,639
of diamonds I'd and how it broke down

2674
01:56:58,479 --> 01:57:02,409
into a chemical called udmh which is in

2675
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:04,359
the hydrogen family which is even more

2676
01:57:02,408 --> 01:57:06,969
toxic like a rocket fuel derivative

2677
01:57:04,359 --> 01:57:08,919
compound and from that point on it was

2678
01:57:06,969 --> 01:57:10,840
banned for use on any consumable crop

2679
01:57:08,918 --> 01:57:13,118
sense but then it was like really

2680
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:15,399
popular you used you know in the you

2681
01:57:13,118 --> 01:57:17,648
know late 90s through kind of a lot of

2682
01:57:15,399 --> 01:57:19,479
the 2000s by various types of growers

2683
01:57:17,649 --> 01:57:21,039
growers going oh gee Kush you know

2684
01:57:19,479 --> 01:57:23,260
stretch your kind of plants and in

2685
01:57:21,038 --> 01:57:25,538
indoor environments and so it really

2686
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:27,189
popularized you know I'm on cannabis but

2687
01:57:25,538 --> 01:57:29,559
now it's a category one pesticide so

2688
01:57:27,189 --> 01:57:31,329
anything detected at the detection limit

2689
01:57:29,559 --> 01:57:34,090
or above which is about 30 parts per

2690
01:57:31,328 --> 01:57:36,279
billion point zero three is a fail you

2691
01:57:34,090 --> 01:57:38,800
know and so we've seen the you the the

2692
01:57:36,279 --> 01:57:39,908
fail rates of it on cannabis go down

2693
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:43,119
incredibly low

2694
01:57:39,908 --> 01:57:45,038
you know below way below 1% you know so

2695
01:57:43,118 --> 01:57:46,569
that's amazing but then for the fact

2696
01:57:45,038 --> 01:57:49,208
that a juice and the fact that

2697
01:57:46,569 --> 01:57:51,429
cigarettes are showing such consistent

2698
01:57:49,208 --> 01:57:53,948
amounts of diamonds at across all the

2699
01:57:51,429 --> 01:57:56,590
crop is really complying my mind you

2700
01:57:53,948 --> 01:57:58,538
know that that's that's and they because

2701
01:57:56,590 --> 01:58:00,248
we're testing these eg pins and there's

2702
01:57:58,538 --> 01:58:02,529
like 15 part per million of lead and

2703
01:58:00,248 --> 01:58:05,019
there's like two thousand times of a

2704
01:58:02,529 --> 01:58:06,698
limit for diamonds I don't and they

2705
01:58:05,019 --> 01:58:09,039
don't fail California guys look what

2706
01:58:06,698 --> 01:58:10,658
just came out with this week with you

2707
01:58:09,038 --> 01:58:12,439
know there's approximately 20 to 25

2708
01:58:10,658 --> 01:58:15,920
people now with actual home

2709
01:58:12,439 --> 01:58:17,719
issues due to illegal cartridge is that

2710
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:19,640
have never been tested

2711
01:58:17,719 --> 01:58:21,770
usually product that would never as

2712
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:23,810
people would know would never even go to

2713
01:58:21,770 --> 01:58:27,520
testing so they even send it to that so

2714
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:30,140
they backward backyard blast it and or

2715
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:32,860
very professionally blasted there's very

2716
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:35,930
professional illegal setups nowadays

2717
01:58:32,859 --> 01:58:37,729
that's really the shadows it's causing

2718
01:58:35,930 --> 01:58:40,250
breathing problems to where people can't

2719
01:58:37,729 --> 01:58:41,779
you know basic oxygen transformation is

2720
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:45,079
a [ __ ] problem right now that's a

2721
01:58:41,779 --> 01:58:46,670
problem people this is a gun right and

2722
01:58:45,079 --> 01:58:48,019
the whole thing you know all these comas

2723
01:58:46,670 --> 01:58:49,670
everything like it's really fascinating

2724
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:52,790
time that this is always break out of

2725
01:58:49,670 --> 01:58:54,140
vape related issues are popping up and I

2726
01:58:52,789 --> 01:58:56,689
mean what is it coming from is it coming

2727
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:58,130
from a Eve apes or you juices is it

2728
01:58:56,689 --> 01:58:59,750
coming partially from cannabis and the

2729
01:58:58,130 --> 01:59:02,539
contaminants that are in it it's

2730
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:04,010
probably a combination of mission its

2731
01:59:02,539 --> 01:59:05,899
causal prohibition I couldn't agree more

2732
01:59:04,010 --> 01:59:07,880
and that's what's so awesome about this

2733
01:59:05,899 --> 01:59:11,059
whole story and I think it really that

2734
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:13,730
much more you know kind of I guess

2735
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:15,080
intensifies the the need for analytical

2736
01:59:13,729 --> 01:59:17,599
testing and these minimum quality

2737
01:59:15,079 --> 01:59:19,430
standards to hit for public health and

2738
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:22,400
safety concerns because whenever you

2739
01:59:19,430 --> 01:59:25,070
have all the legacy toxic material from

2740
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:26,809
California that is and and other states

2741
01:59:25,069 --> 01:59:28,698
that are then you know being filled in

2742
01:59:26,810 --> 01:59:30,350
cards and sent to the East Coast without

2743
01:59:28,698 --> 01:59:31,939
any regard to people sell their safety

2744
01:59:30,350 --> 01:59:33,949
and they're literally getting the

2745
01:59:31,939 --> 01:59:35,779
dirtiest stuff that's there that can't

2746
01:59:33,948 --> 01:59:40,189
hit the market and probably many others

2747
01:59:35,779 --> 01:59:42,880
regulate spaces you know this is it's a

2748
01:59:40,189 --> 01:59:46,099
there's people who are pirating

2749
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:49,369
packaging of like the more successful

2750
01:59:46,100 --> 01:59:52,070
legitimate brands in established markets

2751
01:59:49,369 --> 01:59:57,019
like Colorado in California and now that

2752
01:59:52,069 --> 01:59:59,000
people doesn't people unsporting people

2753
01:59:57,020 --> 02:00:01,430
can buy this packaging now they can

2754
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:03,979
basically rip that packaging off and put

2755
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:06,320
some some quality product into what a

2756
02:00:03,979 --> 02:00:09,079
consumer might think is oh that's coming

2757
02:00:06,319 --> 02:00:11,299
from that vape company and powerful and

2758
02:00:09,079 --> 02:00:14,090
when actually it's not it's just coming

2759
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:16,640
from someone who bought the packaging

2760
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:19,250
that from the company who's ripping off

2761
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:22,070
that company and hey just well I have

2762
02:00:19,250 --> 02:00:23,689
the floor just for clarification issues

2763
02:00:22,069 --> 02:00:25,849
because I saw this come up in the chat

2764
02:00:23,689 --> 02:00:29,658
yes arsenic is not

2765
02:00:25,849 --> 02:00:33,078
metal right but arsenate is a component

2766
02:00:29,658 --> 02:00:35,538
that's been used for for many years in

2767
02:00:33,078 --> 02:00:37,219
pressure-treated lumber and a lot of

2768
02:00:35,538 --> 02:00:40,069
that pressure-treated lumber that was

2769
02:00:37,219 --> 02:00:43,998
made like in the 50s 60s and 70s you

2770
02:00:40,069 --> 02:00:46,038
know that green lumber for picnic tables

2771
02:00:43,998 --> 02:00:48,559
and swing sets and stuff like that

2772
02:00:46,038 --> 02:00:50,748
a lot of that lumber is now coming out

2773
02:00:48,559 --> 02:00:53,599
of service coming out of useful service

2774
02:00:50,748 --> 02:00:57,228
that's ending up in landfills and and

2775
02:00:53,599 --> 02:00:58,159
when that yeah when that well wherever

2776
02:00:57,229 --> 02:01:01,878
it goes

2777
02:00:58,158 --> 02:01:04,158
our arsenate itself so it's not arsenic

2778
02:01:01,878 --> 02:01:07,729
the material arsenic it's actually

2779
02:01:04,158 --> 02:01:10,158
arsenate which is a s I think oh five or

2780
02:01:07,729 --> 02:01:13,729
something like that highly mobile in

2781
02:01:10,158 --> 02:01:16,969
ground water and so that just again

2782
02:01:13,729 --> 02:01:20,570
points to again human impact that a lot

2783
02:01:16,969 --> 02:01:22,998
of places like Florida for example where

2784
02:01:20,569 --> 02:01:24,679
there's been a lot of development on the

2785
02:01:22,998 --> 02:01:28,728
coast I don't believe that there's a

2786
02:01:24,679 --> 02:01:33,679
natural source for arsenic in Florida

2787
02:01:28,729 --> 02:01:36,439
but over the last several years and all

2788
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:39,189
the development that goes on on the

2789
02:01:36,439 --> 02:01:42,459
coastline and marshy areas require what

2790
02:01:39,189 --> 02:01:42,459
pressure-treated lumber

2791
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:48,750
to go into those you know sensitive

2792
02:01:46,050 --> 02:01:51,420
wetland areas where you know like what

2793
02:01:48,750 --> 02:01:55,140
would typically be put into a up here or

2794
02:01:51,420 --> 02:01:58,260
you know any wood that has to go into a

2795
02:01:55,140 --> 02:02:00,570
saltwater exposure has to be super super

2796
02:01:58,260 --> 02:02:02,699
loaded with all kinds of chemicals you

2797
02:02:00,569 --> 02:02:04,529
can see kinda like the green salts that

2798
02:02:02,698 --> 02:02:07,349
come spewing out of these well for a

2799
02:02:04,529 --> 02:02:11,279
long time that was something called CCA

2800
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:14,880
which is chrome aided copper arsenate

2801
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:17,488
CCA right and so this complex was used

2802
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:19,529
to make you know telephone poles and

2803
02:02:17,488 --> 02:02:22,468
railroad ties and you've seen that

2804
02:02:19,529 --> 02:02:25,710
pressure-treated lumber right so that

2805
02:02:22,469 --> 02:02:27,359
lumber which again is part of like you

2806
02:02:25,710 --> 02:02:30,000
know coastal development say around

2807
02:02:27,359 --> 02:02:33,479
state like Florida which is about to get

2808
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:36,738
hit by a huge [ __ ] hurricane has

2809
02:02:33,479 --> 02:02:41,789
basically imported all of this arsenic

2810
02:02:36,738 --> 02:02:43,379
into their water system and and and so

2811
02:02:41,789 --> 02:02:45,448
again there is no natural source of

2812
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:48,150
arsenic in Florida and all the

2813
02:02:45,448 --> 02:02:50,428
development that's gone on over the last

2814
02:02:48,149 --> 02:02:53,129
70 years or so around the Florida

2815
02:02:50,429 --> 02:02:56,969
coastline has imported all this arsenic

2816
02:02:53,130 --> 02:03:01,739
so so as this lumber comes out of use it

2817
02:02:56,969 --> 02:03:03,869
definitely puts arsenic arsenate in the

2818
02:03:01,738 --> 02:03:05,879
soil it's kind of nothing we could do

2819
02:03:03,869 --> 02:03:09,238
about it it's kind of like this is just

2820
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:13,170
the the price that we pay for using

2821
02:03:09,238 --> 02:03:15,658
chrome aided copper arsenic from I think

2822
02:03:13,170 --> 02:03:18,810
I was discovered by some Indian dude in

2823
02:03:15,658 --> 02:03:21,000
like the 30s and an AT&amp;T bought the

2824
02:03:18,810 --> 02:03:22,110
patent and that green lumber was

2825
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,090
everywhere

2826
02:03:22,109 --> 02:03:27,179
well that green lumber actually replaced

2827
02:03:24,090 --> 02:03:29,579
in some cases creosote which was used to

2828
02:03:27,179 --> 02:03:32,100
treat railroad ties and telephone poles

2829
02:03:29,579 --> 02:03:34,948
that's that black tar II [ __ ] that's

2830
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:36,870
cancerous as well but you know you're

2831
02:03:34,948 --> 02:03:37,979
trading one poison for another but

2832
02:03:36,869 --> 02:03:41,579
that's just I just wanted to mention

2833
02:03:37,979 --> 02:03:44,399
that about arsenic so in in areas like

2834
02:03:41,579 --> 02:03:46,979
California or other areas where wood

2835
02:03:44,399 --> 02:03:48,809
treatment was used and and arsenic was

2836
02:03:46,979 --> 02:03:52,259
used as part of that wood treatment as

2837
02:03:48,810 --> 02:03:55,170
that wood comes out of useful service

2838
02:03:52,260 --> 02:03:57,300
yeah it ends up getting leached into the

2839
02:03:55,170 --> 02:03:59,880
into the water system you can't help it

2840
02:03:57,300 --> 02:04:02,159
I would just remind the panel that I

2841
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:04,770
have been posting questions from the

2842
02:04:02,159 --> 02:04:09,599
chat room into our own private chat room

2843
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:13,260
here on Zoom so if you open it you'll

2844
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:15,150
see there's some question just some

2845
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:16,680
people are a little bit more intense

2846
02:04:15,149 --> 02:04:17,429
about getting their questions answered

2847
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:19,409
than others

2848
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:23,310
hey Mark what was that question about

2849
02:04:19,409 --> 02:04:28,289
CBD a couple couple questions ago what

2850
02:04:23,310 --> 02:04:30,870
was the I seem to have lost it now multi

2851
02:04:28,289 --> 02:04:34,560
soil zone I don't know it was before

2852
02:04:30,869 --> 02:04:36,809
that it was the first one was CBD

2853
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:38,490
production Kent I heard CBD production

2854
02:04:36,810 --> 02:04:41,250
can be altered and distillate by

2855
02:04:38,489 --> 02:04:43,800
lengthening the carbon times and THC can

2856
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:45,720
be converted to CBD in this process how

2857
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:48,260
true is this that was the first question

2858
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:51,630
now I posted that about an hour ago and

2859
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:55,050
THC can be converted into CBD is that

2860
02:04:51,630 --> 02:04:57,869
what they said yes versa but that's what

2861
02:04:55,050 --> 02:05:01,430
he's won the question mark is what about

2862
02:04:57,869 --> 02:05:04,970
a version of CBD into THC via

2863
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:09,270
isomerization during distillation

2864
02:05:04,970 --> 02:05:12,030
yeah that's contra thermodynamic right

2865
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:12,870
so its THC is lower energy if given the

2866
02:05:12,029 --> 02:05:16,800
opportunity

2867
02:05:12,869 --> 02:05:19,050
CBD will will convert over to THC and

2868
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:21,690
that's a that's a well-documented fact

2869
02:05:19,050 --> 02:05:24,690
by Rafael Michelin themselves yeah the

2870
02:05:21,689 --> 02:05:27,869
other way around he was asking if THC

2871
02:05:24,689 --> 02:05:31,500
can be converted to CBD so I suspect you

2872
02:05:27,869 --> 02:05:35,189
know I mean not not I think some people

2873
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:39,600
are trying that there was a a guy who

2874
02:05:35,189 --> 02:05:42,750
had that idea who posted for some input

2875
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:44,789
on one of the Facebook cannabis chat

2876
02:05:42,750 --> 02:05:46,859
rooms we're not chat rooms what groups

2877
02:05:44,789 --> 02:05:49,550
were we sometimes talk about these

2878
02:05:46,859 --> 02:05:54,059
things but yeah I mean it's it's going

2879
02:05:49,550 --> 02:05:56,100
you have to figure out a way to put it's

2880
02:05:54,060 --> 02:05:58,560
gonna take energy to do that but it's

2881
02:05:56,100 --> 02:06:02,430
gonna take a particular catalyst to do

2882
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:03,930
that I mean believe me if you could

2883
02:06:02,430 --> 02:06:05,579
figure out a way to do that that's very

2884
02:06:03,930 --> 02:06:09,690
very valuable because certainly people

2885
02:06:05,579 --> 02:06:14,039
want to take hot CBD and turn it into

2886
02:06:09,689 --> 02:06:15,539
all CBD and take away that THC I think

2887
02:06:14,039 --> 02:06:18,300
what a lot of people are doing with

2888
02:06:15,539 --> 02:06:21,630
their so when you're doing hemp

2889
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:24,449
extraction and you're getting a CBD

2890
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:27,600
isolate from it the isolate comes from

2891
02:06:24,448 --> 02:06:30,659
the crystallization from a mother liquor

2892
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:32,910
and that mother liquor still is enriched

2893
02:06:30,659 --> 02:06:36,510
with cannabinoids and in most cases

2894
02:06:32,909 --> 02:06:39,539
depending on what you're extracting you

2895
02:06:36,510 --> 02:06:42,659
can get multiple crops of CBD crystal

2896
02:06:39,539 --> 02:06:45,029
from a single mother liquor but one is

2897
02:06:42,659 --> 02:06:48,329
no longer when you've robbed it of all

2898
02:06:45,029 --> 02:06:50,189
the CBD that they can basically you can

2899
02:06:48,329 --> 02:06:53,029
get like that now the mother liquor is

2900
02:06:50,189 --> 02:06:53,029
beyond the SAP

2901
02:06:55,460 --> 02:07:00,439
or no more CBD of THC and other minor

2902
02:06:58,460 --> 02:07:02,149
cannabinoid enriched mixture that I

2903
02:07:00,439 --> 02:07:05,479
believe a lot of people are converting

2904
02:07:02,149 --> 02:07:08,149
over to CBN the cbn has incredible

2905
02:07:05,479 --> 02:07:12,189
market value right now and you're making

2906
02:07:08,149 --> 02:07:14,479
it into something that's not THC and

2907
02:07:12,189 --> 02:07:16,519
cool right so you're basically

2908
02:07:14,479 --> 02:07:17,959
destroying it but you're destroying it

2909
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:20,030
into something that you can actually

2910
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:22,010
sell and actually if you think about it

2911
02:07:20,029 --> 02:07:24,559
if you look at the economics it's

2912
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:26,690
actually a production process to make

2913
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:29,539
cbn that by the way makes a little bit

2914
02:07:26,689 --> 02:07:37,339
of CBD along the way because you'll make

2915
02:07:29,539 --> 02:07:44,630
a lot more money on your seen cannabis

2916
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:51,920
pick up gold mill near the Sacramento

2917
02:07:44,630 --> 02:07:54,170
area pick up gold it's an interesting

2918
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:57,469
experiment that it's gonna cost a lot of

2919
02:07:54,170 --> 02:08:06,920
money to figure out yeah so what you

2920
02:07:57,469 --> 02:08:08,840
need it has been shown to pick up the

2921
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:12,380
heavier metals but I don't know if the

2922
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:17,600
if gold would because you'd have to have

2923
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:19,489
some it I I would come back on a soluble

2924
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:22,450
version of it I mean and to solubilize

2925
02:08:19,488 --> 02:08:24,259
gold to size go on you're taking nice

2926
02:08:22,449 --> 02:08:26,899
expensive gold and you're dissolving

2927
02:08:24,260 --> 02:08:30,590
with hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid

2928
02:08:26,899 --> 02:08:32,599
to make some gold solution guy that

2929
02:08:30,590 --> 02:08:37,069
exudates something that can solubilize

2930
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:40,250
the gold in raw and then form have that

2931
02:08:37,069 --> 02:08:42,699
fungi then absorb it and translocated

2932
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:44,600
into the plant but that's gonna be

2933
02:08:42,699 --> 02:08:46,488
that's gonna be a little bit of work

2934
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:47,750
I'll say that's gonna be a project that

2935
02:08:46,488 --> 02:08:49,339
I don't think it's gonna be well

2936
02:08:47,750 --> 02:08:52,609
accepted because of the genetic

2937
02:08:49,340 --> 02:08:54,529
engineering involved hey mark I'd love

2938
02:08:52,609 --> 02:08:56,089
to kind of jump in on a part of that

2939
02:08:54,529 --> 02:08:58,069
thought of the pressure-treated wood you

2940
02:08:56,090 --> 02:09:00,140
know one of the another really really

2941
02:08:58,069 --> 02:09:02,960
fascinating trends that we've kind of

2942
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:04,550
seen since the beginning last year with

2943
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:06,710
regard to a couple different pesticides

2944
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:08,909
is you know one of them's called

2945
02:09:06,710 --> 02:09:11,489
chlorine chlorine is a

2946
02:09:08,909 --> 02:09:14,760
an old kind of DDT like compound that

2947
02:09:11,489 --> 02:09:18,179
has been banned for use on I mean yeah

2948
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:20,030
they used to spray that around they used

2949
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:22,710
to spray that in the trench around

2950
02:09:20,029 --> 02:09:23,219
foundations when they built homes it's

2951
02:09:22,710 --> 02:09:25,350
okay

2952
02:09:23,220 --> 02:09:27,360
and the has [ __ ] insecticide that

2953
02:09:25,350 --> 02:09:28,620
lasts for hundreds of years

2954
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:30,449
exactly it's got like hundred your

2955
02:09:28,619 --> 02:09:32,099
half-life and so so they also used to

2956
02:09:30,449 --> 02:09:35,340
pressure treated wood with it and so we

2957
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:37,740
see in instant driving spaces if you're

2958
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:41,159
drawing and kind of like say a barn or

2959
02:09:37,739 --> 02:09:43,380
some space where there's open on stomach

2960
02:09:41,159 --> 02:09:45,899
the wood where it was frustrated we're

2961
02:09:43,380 --> 02:09:48,869
seeing the off gassing of that pesticide

2962
02:09:45,899 --> 02:09:53,129
happened yeah - where was levels are you

2963
02:09:48,869 --> 02:09:55,529
seeing like ppm or ppb or what ppb

2964
02:09:53,130 --> 02:09:57,300
mainly but you know with with chlorine

2965
02:09:55,529 --> 02:09:59,219
since it's also category one pesticide

2966
02:09:57,300 --> 02:10:01,380
anything at or above the detection limit

2967
02:09:59,220 --> 02:10:03,210
of about thirty point handling well but

2968
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:04,890
so we're seeing kind of right around

2969
02:10:03,210 --> 02:10:06,510
there showing up in flower that's

2970
02:10:04,890 --> 02:10:09,450
basically being dried in these spaces

2971
02:10:06,510 --> 02:10:11,039
and then and then in extract we're

2972
02:10:09,449 --> 02:10:12,809
seeing it kind of showing up in failing

2973
02:10:11,039 --> 02:10:15,090
amounts you know kind of at you know

2974
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:18,000
maybe a couple few hundred part per

2975
02:10:15,090 --> 02:10:20,130
billion but but it's a trend that we've

2976
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:21,569
seen and and and we've begin to also you

2977
02:10:20,130 --> 02:10:23,909
know kind of with I mean whether it's

2978
02:10:21,569 --> 02:10:26,219
just a certain trend but we see we've

2979
02:10:23,909 --> 02:10:27,869
you know a lot of these chlorine fails

2980
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:31,680
we're seeing very kind of regionally

2981
02:10:27,869 --> 02:10:33,359
happen also areas like Watsonville and

2982
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:35,250
you know berries and strawberries all

2983
02:10:33,359 --> 02:10:37,529
the things that you know and in you know

2984
02:10:35,250 --> 02:10:40,229
so there's a line you know whether it is

2985
02:10:37,529 --> 02:10:42,029
the foundational wood in greenhouses you

2986
02:10:40,229 --> 02:10:43,769
know that are kind of open and exposed

2987
02:10:42,029 --> 02:10:45,479
in the space that are off gassing when

2988
02:10:43,770 --> 02:10:47,040
temperature humidity kind of

2989
02:10:45,479 --> 02:10:49,259
differentials are happening or whether

2990
02:10:47,039 --> 02:10:51,210
it's in drying spaces cuz then on the on

2991
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:53,789
the other side with drying spaces you

2992
02:10:51,210 --> 02:10:55,470
know one of the biggest fails trends

2993
02:10:53,789 --> 02:10:57,899
that we've seen with indoor cultivation

2994
02:10:55,470 --> 02:10:58,920
is around basically the use of air

2995
02:10:57,899 --> 02:11:00,750
assault bug bombs

2996
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:03,119
you know because historically people

2997
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:05,460
were taking these total release bombs

2998
02:11:03,119 --> 02:11:09,300
like attain which is bifenthrin and

2999
02:11:05,460 --> 02:11:13,770
Piper no peach oxide pylon TR which is

3000
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:15,980
chlorophyll appear particulate I think

3001
02:11:13,770 --> 02:11:17,370
it's under Plex which is chlorophyll

3002
02:11:15,979 --> 02:11:20,549
chlorpyrifos

3003
02:11:17,369 --> 02:11:22,309
which is an organophosphate and then you

3004
02:11:20,550 --> 02:11:24,710
know pyrethrin bombs there's

3005
02:11:22,309 --> 02:11:26,809
but essentially you know people would

3006
02:11:24,710 --> 02:11:29,059
take these bombs that are meant intended

3007
02:11:26,809 --> 02:11:31,279
for 10,000 square foot greenhouse spaces

3008
02:11:29,059 --> 02:11:32,809
and and they wouldn't you know even

3009
02:11:31,279 --> 02:11:34,219
organic people because I you know before

3010
02:11:32,809 --> 02:11:36,260
we open it Bessie labs I was working

3011
02:11:34,219 --> 02:11:37,639
many years not japonic industry and you

3012
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:39,289
know kind of century selling bombs and

3013
02:11:37,639 --> 02:11:40,520
pesticide options to people and you're

3014
02:11:39,288 --> 02:11:42,109
trying to train people to be on him

3015
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:44,630
organic integrated pest management

3016
02:11:42,109 --> 02:11:46,308
prevention approach but but you know

3017
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:47,868
kind of the others at may you know

3018
02:11:46,309 --> 02:11:49,820
everybody use these bombs and so even

3019
02:11:47,868 --> 02:11:52,460
organic people there don't claim never

3020
02:11:49,819 --> 02:11:54,259
spray pesticides or do anything negative

3021
02:11:52,460 --> 02:11:56,270
to the plant they would still in between

3022
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:58,309
harvesting and indoor room they would

3023
02:11:56,270 --> 02:12:01,250
take a thousand square foot room they'd

3024
02:11:58,309 --> 02:12:03,050
light off a 10,000 square foot bomb you

3025
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:04,819
know for one of these pesticide bombs

3026
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:06,500
and essentially they're lighting off in

3027
02:12:04,819 --> 02:12:08,328
this indoor environment where it then

3028
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:10,250
coats every surface area inside the

3029
02:12:08,328 --> 02:12:12,500
space whether it's drywall sheetrock and

3030
02:12:10,250 --> 02:12:14,448
just sucks in like pour like a sponge

3031
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:17,090
and so essentially whenever you do that

3032
02:12:14,448 --> 02:12:18,888
harvest after harvest after harvest year

3033
02:12:17,090 --> 02:12:20,900
after year after year you know there

3034
02:12:18,889 --> 02:12:22,840
becomes this persistence build-up of

3035
02:12:20,899 --> 02:12:25,670
these compounds that are then

3036
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:27,949
unavoidable and we're seeing years after

3037
02:12:25,670 --> 02:12:30,139
their last use we'd like particularly

3038
02:12:27,948 --> 02:12:31,759
for the CH compounds like chlorophyll

3039
02:12:30,139 --> 02:12:34,190
appearing for power flows both category

3040
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:36,380
one you know pile on most particularly

3041
02:12:34,189 --> 02:12:38,658
because it was so ubiquitous and

3042
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:40,639
available just over the counter in hydro

3043
02:12:38,658 --> 02:12:43,009
stores that people like and so so we

3044
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:44,630
will be failing like years after it's

3045
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:46,039
and and then we're helping in all this

3046
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:47,929
environmental assessment work further

3047
02:12:46,038 --> 02:12:49,429
like how the f is this here I haven't

3048
02:12:47,929 --> 02:12:51,679
used this in two and a half year or year

3049
02:12:49,429 --> 02:12:54,199
and a half whatever and so so will then

3050
02:12:51,679 --> 02:12:56,630
send out like swabs and will take chunks

3051
02:12:54,198 --> 02:12:59,029
of drywall that will then run testing on

3052
02:12:56,630 --> 02:13:01,340
and we've seen like ten part per million

3053
02:12:59,029 --> 02:13:03,319
built up in drywall in the you know

3054
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:06,260
certain really worst-case scenarios and

3055
02:13:03,319 --> 02:13:08,179
in those cases we're seeing the flowers

3056
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:10,099
you know that like even whenever they're

3057
02:13:08,179 --> 02:13:11,270
grown fully organic you know and this

3058
02:13:10,099 --> 02:13:13,819
has happened when people have even just

3059
02:13:11,270 --> 02:13:16,670
purchased and end up like an existing la

3060
02:13:13,819 --> 02:13:17,988
and or you know warehouse and you know

3061
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:20,719
where it was previously bombed on

3062
02:13:17,988 --> 02:13:21,979
forever you know now kind of even though

3063
02:13:20,719 --> 02:13:25,038
they're going all organic you know all

3064
02:13:21,979 --> 02:13:27,189
the new soil of predatory bugs you know

3065
02:13:25,038 --> 02:13:30,050
the first harvest out of this facility

3066
02:13:27,189 --> 02:13:32,448
we're saying like 700 parts per billion

3067
02:13:30,050 --> 02:13:33,800
point seven of in the flower and then

3068
02:13:32,448 --> 02:13:35,239
whenever it is turned into extract we're

3069
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:37,520
saying over you know two

3070
02:13:35,239 --> 02:13:39,649
last part per million in it you know and

3071
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:42,230
this is again like it's his build up

3072
02:13:39,649 --> 02:13:44,359
company place from these part per

3073
02:13:42,229 --> 02:13:47,000
billion determinations you're doing on

3074
02:13:44,359 --> 02:13:49,279
the on the mass spec right on the mass

3075
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:54,380
spectrometer I would take it right Jesus

3076
02:13:49,279 --> 02:13:57,739
master OMS GCMs NL CMS both you know so

3077
02:13:54,380 --> 02:14:00,949
you need you need the sensitivity of the

3078
02:13:57,739 --> 02:14:02,329
mass spectrometer to be able to do yeah

3079
02:14:00,949 --> 02:14:04,579
I think this is just before you joined

3080
02:14:02,329 --> 02:14:08,239
today Alec we were talking about that

3081
02:14:04,579 --> 02:14:11,479
you know there's this n I st library of

3082
02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:13,340
all right different kinds of compounds

3083
02:14:11,479 --> 02:14:15,379
and you can basically match the mass

3084
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:17,930
spectrum of what you think is

3085
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:20,900
chlorpyrifos to know that that is

3086
02:14:17,930 --> 02:14:23,360
chlorpyrifos and is no question about it

3087
02:14:20,899 --> 02:14:27,170
that that peak in that material at that

3088
02:14:23,359 --> 02:14:29,359
ppm ppb level but again the sensitivity

3089
02:14:27,170 --> 02:14:33,649
of the mass spectrometer is such that

3090
02:14:29,359 --> 02:14:36,619
you know you are down at the at the ppb

3091
02:14:33,649 --> 02:14:40,099
level and I on news for you folks we

3092
02:14:36,619 --> 02:14:43,069
live in a [ __ ] contaminated world if

3093
02:14:40,100 --> 02:14:45,770
you start looking at everything that

3094
02:14:43,069 --> 02:14:48,559
humans come in contact with at the part

3095
02:14:45,770 --> 02:14:50,390
per billion level you'll be amazed I

3096
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:52,430
always used to say it's like taking a

3097
02:14:50,390 --> 02:14:55,250
little rush to a New York City sidewalk

3098
02:14:52,430 --> 02:14:57,530
you're gonna find everything you're

3099
02:14:55,250 --> 02:15:00,979
gonna find all kinds of [ __ ] that you

3100
02:14:57,529 --> 02:15:02,569
never knew on food on your clothing and

3101
02:15:00,979 --> 02:15:04,519
then when you look at the part per

3102
02:15:02,569 --> 02:15:07,039
billion level think about it just for a

3103
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:09,680
second what so you have percentage right

3104
02:15:07,039 --> 02:15:12,260
then you have pretends and then for

3105
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:15,680
hundreds per thousand this is billion

3106
02:15:12,260 --> 02:15:19,250
okay part one part per billion so

3107
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:22,880
imagine a whole railcar full of vodka

3108
02:15:19,250 --> 02:15:25,880
and one little shot of vermouth that's

3109
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:29,829
like a part [ __ ] four billion it's

3110
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:31,970
it's an incredible you know again

3111
02:15:29,829 --> 02:15:35,840
opportunity that we have to use

3112
02:15:31,970 --> 02:15:39,650
analytical chemistry to look at such

3113
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:41,750
levels at cannabis but really I mean if

3114
02:15:39,649 --> 02:15:46,670
you were looking to go look at some

3115
02:15:41,750 --> 02:15:47,510
backwoods smokes or just get go buy some

3116
02:15:46,670 --> 02:15:50,929
produce for

3117
02:15:47,510 --> 02:15:54,079
Whole Foods would they hold up to this

3118
02:15:50,929 --> 02:15:57,340
part per billion scrutiny that you're

3119
02:15:54,078 --> 02:16:00,078
looking at I mean will we see any

3120
02:15:57,340 --> 02:16:02,480
residuals at the part per billion level

3121
02:16:00,078 --> 02:16:05,029
of stuff that's you know in current

3122
02:16:02,479 --> 02:16:08,049
commerce so are they artificially

3123
02:16:05,029 --> 02:16:11,029
holding cannabis to a new level of

3124
02:16:08,050 --> 02:16:14,000
purity when we live in a [ __ ]

3125
02:16:11,029 --> 02:16:17,809
contaminated world and the plant we love

3126
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:24,349
sucks up everything from the from the

3127
02:16:17,809 --> 02:16:28,610
soil the poisoning of this supply chain

3128
02:16:24,349 --> 02:16:30,619
to Alec I know this is gonna be a big

3129
02:16:28,609 --> 02:16:33,500
case for you guys when you know edible

3130
02:16:30,618 --> 02:16:35,049
producers down in California they have

3131
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:39,170
to make sure that all of their

3132
02:16:35,049 --> 02:16:43,218
ingredients of my chain are going to

3133
02:16:39,170 --> 02:16:47,388
pass the certified test so in a way the

3134
02:16:43,218 --> 02:16:49,579
plant rolls the industry again all of

3135
02:16:47,388 --> 02:16:53,839
our ingredients better for our consumers

3136
02:16:49,579 --> 02:16:56,239
nobody hold on but it actually adds a

3137
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:58,670
caveat because you saw probably this

3138
02:16:56,239 --> 02:17:00,829
week to Alec of the study regarding how

3139
02:16:58,670 --> 02:17:05,000
chocolate actually affects the potent

3140
02:17:00,829 --> 02:17:08,269
testing regarding cannabis so we're

3141
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:11,450
finding even food products actually can

3142
02:17:08,269 --> 02:17:13,609
throw off testing altogether so another

3143
02:17:11,450 --> 02:17:16,550
fact that we're learning as we're

3144
02:17:13,609 --> 02:17:19,519
dealing with more normalized products in

3145
02:17:16,549 --> 02:17:23,028
from the food chain coming into the ring

3146
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:23,870
of our testing requirements well two

3147
02:17:23,029 --> 02:17:26,689
points on that one

3148
02:17:23,870 --> 02:17:28,099
so SEM on yours which is one percent

3149
02:17:26,689 --> 02:17:30,170
valid you know I mean we've been doing

3150
02:17:28,099 --> 02:17:33,290
analytical chemistry on cannabis now for

3151
02:17:30,170 --> 02:17:35,210
10 years and it has taken us about that

3152
02:17:33,290 --> 02:17:37,519
long to figure this plan out and all the

3153
02:17:35,209 --> 02:17:40,699
different matrices that are presented

3154
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:42,500
with infused cannabis in it so chocolate

3155
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:44,750
gummy bears gummy bears are like the

3156
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:47,000
bane of my existence you know to resolve

3157
02:17:44,750 --> 02:17:48,799
a gummy bear matrix and then pull the

3158
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,959
two and a half milligrams and accurately

3159
02:17:48,799 --> 02:17:53,329
repeatedly be able to test over time

3160
02:17:50,959 --> 02:17:55,068
kind of that those those are that you

3161
02:17:53,329 --> 02:17:57,109
know dentures you guys use catchers done

3162
02:17:55,068 --> 02:17:58,808
[ __ ] well well just different for

3163
02:17:57,109 --> 02:18:00,069
different steps I mean

3164
02:17:58,808 --> 02:18:01,569
I mean catchers we used to use on our

3165
02:18:00,069 --> 02:18:03,159
pesticide prep I don't know if we use it

3166
02:18:01,569 --> 02:18:05,709
on our gummy crab mm-hmm

3167
02:18:03,159 --> 02:18:07,209
but that's if that if you're

3168
02:18:05,709 --> 02:18:09,279
recommending that I'm definitely gonna

3169
02:18:07,209 --> 02:18:11,379
forget to me well are you so are you

3170
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:16,269
doing like are you are you freezing the

3171
02:18:11,379 --> 02:18:19,329
the gummy with liquid nitrogen well what

3172
02:18:16,269 --> 02:18:22,450
are you doing am a serrated to or that

3173
02:18:19,329 --> 02:18:24,459
might be three constants I were these I

3174
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:26,559
mean it where it's the whole because if

3175
02:18:24,459 --> 02:18:27,609
you if you blend I mean this is a bit of

3176
02:18:26,558 --> 02:18:31,359
a tension because I wanted to kind of

3177
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:33,429
hit back on the this other side with

3178
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:36,309
kind of is testing kind of a cannabis

3179
02:18:33,429 --> 02:18:38,170
too much to Mark's point but but yeah I

3180
02:18:36,308 --> 02:18:39,459
mean you know the truck we've we've

3181
02:18:38,170 --> 02:18:42,250
worked through all these different

3182
02:18:39,459 --> 02:18:43,479
matrices you know kind of end and and a

3183
02:18:42,250 --> 02:18:45,190
lot of that you know whenever you start

3184
02:18:43,479 --> 02:18:47,229
working with the manufacturer that's you

3185
02:18:45,190 --> 02:18:49,030
know kind of making infused products you

3186
02:18:47,229 --> 02:18:51,308
know such a big part of the job of a lab

3187
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:53,829
that we bring to the table is to do a

3188
02:18:51,308 --> 02:18:56,439
bunch of upfront testing for one to be

3189
02:18:53,829 --> 02:18:57,968
able to you know demonstrate and prove

3190
02:18:56,440 --> 02:19:00,969
our worth and being able to accurately

3191
02:18:57,968 --> 02:19:02,649
and repeatedly test this particular type

3192
02:19:00,968 --> 02:19:04,959
of product whether it's chocolate or

3193
02:19:02,649 --> 02:19:07,718
gummy you know but then beyond that it's

3194
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:09,968
us helping to identify all these pain

3195
02:19:07,718 --> 02:19:11,829
points in the other ingredients supply

3196
02:19:09,968 --> 02:19:13,869
chain that are going into this cannabis

3197
02:19:11,829 --> 02:19:15,789
formulation because we're seeing all

3198
02:19:13,870 --> 02:19:18,700
kinds of trends you know with like

3199
02:19:15,790 --> 02:19:19,900
people making orange mints you know

3200
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:22,420
where they're taking orange essential

3201
02:19:19,899 --> 02:19:25,000
oil and then making a cannabis infused

3202
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:27,280
mint with it you know we're finding the

3203
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:29,079
claw repair dose is you know I mean one

3204
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:32,980
of the most common organophosphate

3205
02:19:29,079 --> 02:19:35,229
sprayed on citrus so of course those

3206
02:19:32,979 --> 02:19:36,939
essential oil that is gonna have alter

3207
02:19:35,229 --> 02:19:38,558
concentration and then you take the

3208
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:41,170
tiniest amount of that ingredient and

3209
02:19:38,558 --> 02:19:43,449
flavor your mints and you just failed

3210
02:19:41,170 --> 02:19:45,849
the entire batch you know and and this

3211
02:19:43,450 --> 02:19:49,810
goes to chocolate also chocolate is a

3212
02:19:45,849 --> 02:19:53,440
known bio accumulator of a vital you

3213
02:19:49,809 --> 02:19:55,510
mediator of Miam and and since we've

3214
02:19:53,440 --> 02:19:57,579
engaged so in with like many experts in

3215
02:19:55,510 --> 02:19:59,110
the cacao industry since we've seen this

3216
02:19:57,579 --> 02:20:01,059
issue because we know with a percentage

3217
02:19:59,110 --> 02:20:05,079
of cacao 35 percent forty seven percent

3218
02:20:01,059 --> 02:20:07,869
75 plus percent cacao will see a linear

3219
02:20:05,079 --> 02:20:10,209
increase in cadmium like up to multiple

3220
02:20:07,870 --> 02:20:12,579
part per million in various sources of

3221
02:20:10,209 --> 02:20:15,759
cacao with the percentage increase in

3222
02:20:12,579 --> 02:20:17,950
and so come to find out whenever

3223
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:20,829
whenever cacao is grown in mountainous

3224
02:20:17,950 --> 02:20:23,399
regions of the world like the Andes it's

3225
02:20:20,829 --> 02:20:26,950
always going to have this known issue of

3226
02:20:23,398 --> 02:20:29,529
cadmium bioaccumulation and so so Kay

3227
02:20:26,950 --> 02:20:31,270
the cacao industry had to pivot whenever

3228
02:20:29,530 --> 02:20:33,220
they're trying to meet these European

3229
02:20:31,270 --> 02:20:36,819
Union standards that are really really

3230
02:20:33,219 --> 02:20:38,108
strict on metals in the product and the

3231
02:20:36,818 --> 02:20:40,568
final form product that are being sold

3232
02:20:38,109 --> 02:20:42,818
to the European Union markets and so

3233
02:20:40,568 --> 02:20:45,309
they've had to identify this whole kind

3234
02:20:42,818 --> 02:20:47,109
of issue and as an industry they came to

3235
02:20:45,309 --> 02:20:49,209
find out that it's whenever you're going

3236
02:20:47,109 --> 02:20:51,280
to count mountainous regions like Andes

3237
02:20:49,209 --> 02:20:53,169
this is it cadmium is always an issue

3238
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:55,659
but whenever you're being just sourcing

3239
02:20:53,170 --> 02:20:57,728
it from other areas like Africa and kind

3240
02:20:55,659 --> 02:21:00,250
of the you know central Central America

3241
02:20:57,728 --> 02:21:02,139
and such then you know the cadmium is no

3242
02:21:00,250 --> 02:21:03,790
longer an issue but it's it's you know

3243
02:21:02,139 --> 02:21:05,529
this cannabis regulation in these ways

3244
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:08,290
it's it's putting people up to the

3245
02:21:05,530 --> 02:21:09,729
highest kind of you know robust quality

3246
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:11,920
standards that anything's ever had to be

3247
02:21:09,728 --> 02:21:14,438
applied to and ends and there's land

3248
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:16,270
mines every which direction around us

3249
02:21:14,439 --> 02:21:18,489
mark because of what your point is

3250
02:21:16,270 --> 02:21:20,200
because we toxify the environment the

3251
02:21:18,489 --> 02:21:21,340
legacy of the Green Revolution has

3252
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:23,530
destroyed the soil

3253
02:21:21,340 --> 02:21:25,540
it's like contaminated everything but is

3254
02:21:23,530 --> 02:21:28,149
that the answer we just you know kind of

3255
02:21:25,540 --> 02:21:30,069
just sink to that low or we set the new

3256
02:21:28,148 --> 02:21:32,289
the new high standard that that

3257
02:21:30,068 --> 02:21:34,329
eventually anything else that we are

3258
02:21:32,290 --> 02:21:35,740
gonna be consuming shouldn't meet you

3259
02:21:34,329 --> 02:21:37,898
know because it's like I mean are these

3260
02:21:35,739 --> 02:21:39,219
you know let me just with like diamonds

3261
02:21:37,898 --> 02:21:41,289
I don't know I could just go off from

3262
02:21:39,219 --> 02:21:43,209
the glyphosate thing but it's like I've

3263
02:21:41,290 --> 02:21:44,740
say kills the microbiome you know it

3264
02:21:43,209 --> 02:21:46,269
gives the you know curious leaky gut

3265
02:21:44,739 --> 02:21:47,739
which then creates all the food

3266
02:21:46,270 --> 02:21:49,540
allergies which they could solve the

3267
02:21:47,739 --> 02:21:52,119
autoimmune reactions that you know kind

3268
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:54,399
of then create autoimmune conditions all

3269
02:21:52,120 --> 02:21:56,380
the cancer there's so much of all the

3270
02:21:54,398 --> 02:21:58,299
illness and suffering that humans are

3271
02:21:56,379 --> 02:22:00,059
now suffering from you know in so many

3272
02:21:58,299 --> 02:22:03,568
ways stems from this chemical revolution

3273
02:22:00,059 --> 02:22:06,039
that has now created this completely

3274
02:22:03,568 --> 02:22:08,680
ubiquitous part per billion part per

3275
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:10,780
trillion level every contaminant pfl AAP

3276
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:13,510
fos in the environment now in our bodies

3277
02:22:10,780 --> 02:22:15,130
but but you know from what we're seeing

3278
02:22:13,510 --> 02:22:17,318
in california one of the largest

3279
02:22:15,129 --> 02:22:20,139
agricultural states in the united states

3280
02:22:17,318 --> 02:22:23,760
you know kind of even with the most

3281
02:22:20,139 --> 02:22:25,779
robust pesticide heavy metal mycotoxin

3282
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:26,521
Aspergillus standards that have ever

3283
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:28,200
been a

3284
02:22:26,521 --> 02:22:30,989
you know across each of these categories

3285
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:33,870
we don't see that I mean so pesticides

3286
02:22:30,989 --> 02:22:36,840
we see about 2 to 3% salary metals we

3287
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:38,311
see about 3 percent fail rate microbial

3288
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:41,040
impurities now that yeast and mold in

3289
02:22:38,310 --> 02:22:43,770
toll aerobic bacteria aren't the the

3290
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:46,021
focus of regulations and it's just the

3291
02:22:43,771 --> 02:22:48,840
pathogenic Aspergillus Salmonella e.coli

3292
02:22:46,021 --> 02:22:50,940
species we see about 2% or less fail

3293
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:53,340
rate across all products you know and so

3294
02:22:50,940 --> 02:22:54,601
and and and and I'll wrap the point with

3295
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:57,601
this I don't mean just be all

3296
02:22:54,601 --> 02:22:59,971
sesquipedalian with it but essentially

3297
02:22:57,601 --> 02:23:03,511
whenever went you know back it back in

3298
02:22:59,970 --> 02:23:06,029
2015 to 2017 we weren't testing 466 of

3299
02:23:03,511 --> 02:23:08,040
the most common agricultural pesticides

3300
02:23:06,030 --> 02:23:10,500
that are in California we're testing for

3301
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:12,750
12 of the most common pesticides things

3302
02:23:10,500 --> 02:23:15,390
like Eagle 20 or Michael beaten all by

3303
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:17,819
feni's eight album album actin pack low

3304
02:23:15,390 --> 02:23:19,681
diamond azide you know a spear Memphis

3305
02:23:17,819 --> 02:23:21,119
and imidacloprid so we're testing for

3306
02:23:19,681 --> 02:23:25,230
these really common ones that were using

3307
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:27,271
cannabis and in Flour 2015 to seven 2017

3308
02:23:25,229 --> 02:23:29,189
for these 12 pesticides and when we're

3309
02:23:27,271 --> 02:23:30,840
testing them we're seeing them way

3310
02:23:29,190 --> 02:23:32,790
higher part per billion if not part four

3311
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:34,771
millionaire levels you know with our old

3312
02:23:32,790 --> 02:23:37,110
kind of mass effect systems they weren't

3313
02:23:34,771 --> 02:23:39,391
nearly as sensitive as our new and and

3314
02:23:37,110 --> 02:23:40,980
so even then whenever there's no

3315
02:23:39,390 --> 02:23:42,931
regulations and people were just doing

3316
02:23:40,979 --> 02:23:45,300
the damn thing you know we saw in flour

3317
02:23:42,931 --> 02:23:47,101
about 30 percent fail rate for one of

3318
02:23:45,300 --> 02:23:49,470
these 12 pesticides and then when it

3319
02:23:47,101 --> 02:23:52,230
came to extracts we saw anywhere from 50

3320
02:23:49,470 --> 02:23:55,590
to 75 percent fail rate and 50 percent

3321
02:23:52,229 --> 02:23:56,939
was more like butane extracts and co2

3322
02:23:55,590 --> 02:23:58,890
stuff like that but then when you've got

3323
02:23:56,940 --> 02:24:01,920
more refined distillate you went up to

3324
02:23:58,890 --> 02:24:04,050
75 percent fail rate now across now that

3325
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:05,370
California put this minimum level of

3326
02:24:04,050 --> 02:24:07,170
quality standards in place that

3327
02:24:05,370 --> 02:24:09,090
everybody whether David or Goliath have

3328
02:24:07,170 --> 02:24:12,629
to hit just to get product and market

3329
02:24:09,090 --> 02:24:14,670
we've seen pretty much most compliance

3330
02:24:12,629 --> 02:24:17,699
testing we've seen all these failures go

3331
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:19,620
down to less than 2% less than 3% you

3332
02:24:17,700 --> 02:24:21,840
know for pesticides you know and that's

3333
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:23,971
across pepino concentrates and flowers

3334
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:26,011
you know we seem obviously a much higher

3335
02:24:23,970 --> 02:24:27,899
failure rate on the R&amp;D and process

3336
02:24:26,011 --> 02:24:29,130
testing and as people are screening

3337
02:24:27,899 --> 02:24:31,350
their supply chain and ingredients

3338
02:24:29,129 --> 02:24:34,079
before they get their product for market

3339
02:24:31,351 --> 02:24:37,650
and what but but that's like Meg that's

3340
02:24:34,079 --> 02:24:39,689
that's mind blowing that yeah Alan can I

3341
02:24:37,649 --> 02:24:42,449
ask like can you tell

3342
02:24:39,689 --> 02:24:44,879
baitball obviously if the levels I'm

3343
02:24:42,449 --> 02:24:48,479
sure would make sense but can you

3344
02:24:44,879 --> 02:24:52,489
distinguish someone who is directly

3345
02:24:48,478 --> 02:24:55,828
applying these pesticides versus adrift

3346
02:24:52,488 --> 02:24:58,198
you know resolved that would so you

3347
02:24:55,828 --> 02:25:00,238
could come you basically see the people

3348
02:24:58,199 --> 02:25:02,729
who fail up here and then the people who

3349
02:25:00,238 --> 02:25:04,168
fail down here and this is drift and

3350
02:25:02,728 --> 02:25:06,688
these are the people who are applying

3351
02:25:04,168 --> 02:25:09,209
well because I mean with with simplicity

3352
02:25:06,689 --> 02:25:11,879
certain trends were across every batch

3353
02:25:09,209 --> 02:25:13,739
in there huh in the in you know of you

3354
02:25:11,879 --> 02:25:15,749
know in a greenhouse everything will

3355
02:25:13,738 --> 02:25:17,908
fail you know that we can trace back to

3356
02:25:15,748 --> 02:25:19,289
a clone that was dipped or maybe in the

3357
02:25:17,908 --> 02:25:20,818
early spray where they thought they'd be

3358
02:25:19,289 --> 02:25:23,009
able to kind of get away with it and the

3359
02:25:20,818 --> 02:25:25,350
residual isn't gonna be as long versus

3360
02:25:23,009 --> 02:25:27,718
you know in a lot of cases when we're

3361
02:25:25,350 --> 02:25:29,998
testing you know kind of these major

3362
02:25:27,718 --> 02:25:31,858
greenhouses and different AG areas you

3363
02:25:29,998 --> 02:25:34,529
know we're seeing kind of more regional

3364
02:25:31,859 --> 02:25:36,449
pesticide kind of exposure you know that

3365
02:25:34,529 --> 02:25:37,979
are real close to vents that you know

3366
02:25:36,449 --> 02:25:40,350
that were Aires being pulled in from

3367
02:25:37,978 --> 02:25:42,898
outside you know where happen we're

3368
02:25:40,350 --> 02:25:45,539
seeing kind of more you know kind of you

3369
02:25:42,898 --> 02:25:47,309
know kind of less systemic or I guess

3370
02:25:45,539 --> 02:25:49,979
across the entirety of the harvest and

3371
02:25:47,309 --> 02:25:52,198
more regionally kind of located and so

3372
02:25:49,978 --> 02:25:54,658
then we'll go in and send out swabs and

3373
02:25:52,199 --> 02:25:56,338
we'll swab de interiors exteriors of the

3374
02:25:54,658 --> 02:25:57,988
greenhouse you know in different

3375
02:25:56,338 --> 02:26:00,179
perimeters of the greenhouse so that we

3376
02:25:57,988 --> 02:26:01,679
can help to further narrow down because

3377
02:26:00,179 --> 02:26:04,078
the pesticide thing is a huge issue you

3378
02:26:01,679 --> 02:26:05,809
know because the you know the FIFRA you

3379
02:26:04,078 --> 02:26:08,788
know the federal insecticide fungicide

3380
02:26:05,809 --> 02:26:10,618
and rodenticide act you know it's you

3381
02:26:08,789 --> 02:26:12,719
know it's it's the foundation at which

3382
02:26:10,619 --> 02:26:14,310
you know we are in the in the world are

3383
02:26:12,718 --> 02:26:16,019
protected from the exposure of a lot of

3384
02:26:14,309 --> 02:26:18,179
these pesticides and it's really

3385
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:19,738
stipulated and strongly on when you can

3386
02:26:18,179 --> 02:26:21,449
spray what can spray how you can spray

3387
02:26:19,738 --> 02:26:23,038
you know under what conditions wind

3388
02:26:21,449 --> 02:26:25,229
conditions but those things aren't

3389
02:26:23,039 --> 02:26:26,939
followed you know and so therefore kind

3390
02:26:25,228 --> 02:26:28,408
of you know when you see you when you

3391
02:26:26,939 --> 02:26:31,379
drive down california you see people

3392
02:26:28,408 --> 02:26:33,600
just midday bombing kind of carpet

3393
02:26:31,379 --> 02:26:34,919
dusting out of planes or helicopters you

3394
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:38,059
know they're doing so in full willful

3395
02:26:34,918 --> 02:26:41,218
disregard to these regulations you know

3396
02:26:38,059 --> 02:26:42,988
this right there are no guidelines for

3397
02:26:41,218 --> 02:26:44,818
cannabis not talking about them spraying

3398
02:26:42,988 --> 02:26:46,918
AG crops though because now there's

3399
02:26:44,818 --> 02:26:49,019
there AG sprays are gonna drift and

3400
02:26:46,918 --> 02:26:51,179
affect a cannabis farm and so now that

3401
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:53,030
the cannabis farm gets hit and fails a

3402
02:26:51,179 --> 02:26:55,610
batch of this really high price

3403
02:26:53,030 --> 02:26:57,230
modernity crop that's now legal now they

3404
02:26:55,610 --> 02:26:59,511
have a president for holding a count

3405
02:26:57,229 --> 02:27:01,699
holding accountable the farms because

3406
02:26:59,511 --> 02:27:03,290
farmers have crop insurance not if

3407
02:27:01,700 --> 02:27:05,450
they're they lose their crop do they

3408
02:27:03,290 --> 02:27:07,971
[ __ ] up it's a in case their their

3409
02:27:05,450 --> 02:27:09,891
practices overspray and drift and now

3410
02:27:07,970 --> 02:27:12,170
they get held liable and have to

3411
02:27:09,890 --> 02:27:14,750
basically get sued and money basically

3412
02:27:12,170 --> 02:27:17,000
is there from crop insurance to you know

3413
02:27:14,750 --> 02:27:18,799
so it's you know I don't know gonna

3414
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:21,579
prevent overspray though from being

3415
02:27:18,799 --> 02:27:23,989
causing a lot of liability especially in

3416
02:27:21,579 --> 02:27:26,030
agricultural areas where it's it's a

3417
02:27:23,989 --> 02:27:31,459
tradition where agricultural spraying

3418
02:27:26,030 --> 02:27:34,239
predates cannabis that's unfortunate but

3419
02:27:31,459 --> 02:27:37,609
what we're gonna see is in the cannabis

3420
02:27:34,239 --> 02:27:39,649
in those areas that unfortunately have

3421
02:27:37,610 --> 02:27:42,471
that overspray we're just gonna have to

3422
02:27:39,649 --> 02:27:46,909
develop SOPs in the extraction lab to

3423
02:27:42,470 --> 02:27:49,039
scavenge no but but just one just and

3424
02:27:46,909 --> 02:27:50,181
I'm sorry I keep talking have you all

3425
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:52,580
been following the crop protection

3426
02:27:50,181 --> 02:27:57,140
services issue in Carpinteria with the

3427
02:27:52,579 --> 02:27:58,789
avocado farmers yeah yes so so this is

3428
02:27:57,140 --> 02:28:01,789
revolutionary and this I think proves

3429
02:27:58,790 --> 02:28:04,550
the point to Mike with kind of just

3430
02:28:01,790 --> 02:28:06,471
cannabis changing AG because you know

3431
02:28:04,549 --> 02:28:08,510
now that you're so in awe in avocado

3432
02:28:06,470 --> 02:28:10,489
country most avocado farmers don't spray

3433
02:28:08,511 --> 02:28:12,170
their own pesticides they hired crop

3434
02:28:10,489 --> 02:28:14,449
protection services the biggest retailer

3435
02:28:12,170 --> 02:28:16,280
wholesaler of fuggin AG chemicals who

3436
02:28:14,450 --> 02:28:18,440
also has a department division that goes

3437
02:28:16,280 --> 02:28:21,290
out and sprays the pesticides for a

3438
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:23,690
yearly fee they also crop protection

3439
02:28:21,290 --> 02:28:26,391
services as a result of cannabis now

3440
02:28:23,690 --> 02:28:27,980
being planted all around Carpinteria

3441
02:28:26,390 --> 02:28:29,629
where the you know in somebody are

3442
02:28:27,979 --> 02:28:32,899
December Academy where the avocados are

3443
02:28:29,629 --> 02:28:35,180
they now are scared shitless of getting

3444
02:28:32,899 --> 02:28:37,761
sued and held liable for further

3445
02:28:35,181 --> 02:28:40,579
spraying practices so they just they

3446
02:28:37,761 --> 02:28:43,220
just pulled out of every contract with

3447
02:28:40,579 --> 02:28:45,590
every avocado farm to not spray

3448
02:28:43,220 --> 02:28:47,750
pesticides this year as a result of like

3449
02:28:45,590 --> 02:28:49,940
you know the potential of being held

3450
02:28:47,750 --> 02:28:52,761
liable so now instead of them just

3451
02:28:49,940 --> 02:28:54,980
pulling up there like blasters within

3452
02:28:52,761 --> 02:28:56,870
midday without care of who's living in

3453
02:28:54,979 --> 02:28:58,369
their environment or what it helped

3454
02:28:56,870 --> 02:29:00,590
their overspray is gonna affect people

3455
02:28:58,370 --> 02:29:02,840
the way used to go blast in the drive

3456
02:29:00,590 --> 02:29:04,460
home you know now their pull not doing

3457
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:04,771
it so now if the avocado farmers want to

3458
02:29:04,459 --> 02:29:07,140
spray

3459
02:29:04,771 --> 02:29:08,190
pesticides they spray them and now

3460
02:29:07,140 --> 02:29:10,229
they're the ones are gonna be held

3461
02:29:08,190 --> 02:29:12,899
liable so now I feel like this plant is

3462
02:29:10,229 --> 02:29:15,029
this you know beacon of progress being

3463
02:29:12,899 --> 02:29:17,100
planted it's yeah rather than spraying

3464
02:29:15,030 --> 02:29:18,360
the dangerous pesticides that aren't

3465
02:29:17,101 --> 02:29:20,909
approved for cannabis they're gonna

3466
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:23,971
start spraying avocado plants with more

3467
02:29:20,909 --> 02:29:25,470
beneficial insects beneficial microbes

3468
02:29:23,970 --> 02:29:29,039
actually have a lot of those are gonna

3469
02:29:25,470 --> 02:29:32,159
be able to treat the same symptoms just

3470
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:33,780
have less latency time and less hazard

3471
02:29:32,159 --> 02:29:37,260
in the community and then that's

3472
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:40,170
cannabis forcing progress yeah totally

3473
02:29:37,260 --> 02:29:42,479
so and that's great right the same same

3474
02:29:40,170 --> 02:29:44,729
same on what I've seen a lot of wheat

3475
02:29:42,479 --> 02:29:47,699
farmers corn farmers and soybean farmers

3476
02:29:44,729 --> 02:29:49,500
are now rotating hemp in a because they

3477
02:29:47,700 --> 02:29:51,360
think they're gonna get that extra bonus

3478
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:53,610
yeah a little little bit more growing

3479
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:55,500
hemp than wheat or corn or soybeans

3480
02:29:53,610 --> 02:29:58,079
especially with this trade war going on

3481
02:29:55,500 --> 02:30:00,569
but that you know I think the bigger

3482
02:29:58,079 --> 02:30:02,489
benefit is growing growing polycultures

3483
02:30:00,569 --> 02:30:05,190
and then you know being able to you

3484
02:30:02,489 --> 02:30:08,521
rotate your paddocks rotate your fields

3485
02:30:05,190 --> 02:30:09,090
with multiple crops and incorporate you

3486
02:30:08,521 --> 02:30:11,311
know hemp

3487
02:30:09,090 --> 02:30:17,549
benefit for its herbicide so you don't

3488
02:30:11,310 --> 02:30:24,000
have to use those criticized or no

3489
02:30:17,549 --> 02:30:27,060
pressed no oh yeah

3490
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:28,829
oh no we've we've seen people fail for

3491
02:30:27,060 --> 02:30:31,770
putting up the dichlorvos

3492
02:30:28,829 --> 02:30:32,789
like little insecticide traps because

3493
02:30:31,771 --> 02:30:34,771
you know you can get the sticky traps

3494
02:30:32,790 --> 02:30:36,931
which are chill or you could get the

3495
02:30:34,771 --> 02:30:40,710
ones that actually off-gas pesticide and

3496
02:30:36,931 --> 02:30:42,721
that and dichlorvos is is a DB I'm sorry

3497
02:30:40,709 --> 02:30:45,329
DD BP dichlorvos as a category one pest

3498
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:48,090
site and and also dichlorvos breaks down

3499
02:30:45,329 --> 02:30:49,739
into naled or I'm sorry maybe nail it

3500
02:30:48,090 --> 02:30:53,549
nail it breaks down nailer which is an

3501
02:30:49,739 --> 02:30:55,409
organophosphate because I don't know

3502
02:30:53,549 --> 02:31:05,039
that many people that used to borrow

3503
02:30:55,409 --> 02:31:06,959
poison bombs nope it's the same thing

3504
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:09,090
yeah it's the same things it's basically

3505
02:31:06,959 --> 02:31:11,609
you know cuz in areas where we see those

3506
02:31:09,090 --> 02:31:12,810
no pest rips with that are basically

3507
02:31:11,610 --> 02:31:14,521
gassing dichlorvos

3508
02:31:12,810 --> 02:31:15,409
I mean it's more or less the same thing

3509
02:31:14,521 --> 02:31:17,540
just different

3510
02:31:15,409 --> 02:31:21,590
of bombing right because they'll spread

3511
02:31:17,540 --> 02:31:25,610
our pyrethrum aren't pyrethrum bombs

3512
02:31:21,590 --> 02:31:27,648
used to like deal with sick infested

3513
02:31:25,610 --> 02:31:29,870
rooms oh yeah

3514
02:31:27,648 --> 02:31:31,849
yeah i bombs the bifenthrin bombs

3515
02:31:29,870 --> 02:31:33,590
chlorophyta pure bombs core you know

3516
02:31:31,850 --> 02:31:36,290
core Pyro's bombs we see all of them

3517
02:31:33,590 --> 02:31:37,728
used you know and it's been really big

3518
02:31:36,290 --> 02:31:39,800
cal products in california you know

3519
02:31:37,728 --> 02:31:42,619
before the testing rigs were in place

3520
02:31:39,799 --> 02:31:45,438
for what it's worth though pyrethrin and

3521
02:31:42,620 --> 02:31:47,780
bifenthrin we see kind of i guess let

3522
02:31:45,439 --> 02:31:50,659
you know they seem to break down quicker

3523
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:52,520
over time but but a lot of these other

3524
02:31:50,659 --> 02:31:55,639
compounds like the piper no beach oxide

3525
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:58,040
which is you know company depends on

3526
02:31:55,639 --> 02:32:01,010
that that's similar to the chlorpyrifos

3527
02:31:58,040 --> 02:32:02,689
em chlorophyll appear is seems to stay

3528
02:32:01,010 --> 02:32:04,329
persistent and you know some of the only

3529
02:32:02,689 --> 02:32:07,069
ways to get it out once you've been just

3530
02:32:04,329 --> 02:32:09,228
historically bombing is to rip down your

3531
02:32:07,069 --> 02:32:11,148
drywall to rebuild the whole room he

3532
02:32:09,228 --> 02:32:13,609
said like your kids because what happens

3533
02:32:11,148 --> 02:32:15,500
is the lights turn off the humidity

3534
02:32:13,610 --> 02:32:16,550
spikes in the time where the demon if i

3535
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:18,319
was trying to catch up and bring the

3536
02:32:16,549 --> 02:32:21,319
humidity down and essentially it just

3537
02:32:18,319 --> 02:32:22,789
sweats from the walls and from the

3538
02:32:21,319 --> 02:32:24,920
environment there's the ceilings these

3539
02:32:22,790 --> 02:32:26,930
pesticides out in the in the humid air

3540
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:29,569
and then just gets circulated and blown

3541
02:32:26,930 --> 02:32:32,329
around through the humidity ventilation

3542
02:32:29,569 --> 02:32:34,489
systems in the HVAC and to you and then

3543
02:32:32,329 --> 02:32:36,110
you got essentially sticky residue of

3544
02:32:34,489 --> 02:32:38,539
these pesticides spread through every

3545
02:32:36,110 --> 02:32:40,010
area of the space and you know and the

3546
02:32:38,540 --> 02:32:42,920
thing is it happens the same at those no

3547
02:32:40,010 --> 02:32:45,020
strip the little I mean no pest strips

3548
02:32:42,920 --> 02:32:46,610
with nail it depending on how many of

3549
02:32:45,020 --> 02:32:48,890
them you have spread across your room

3550
02:32:46,610 --> 02:32:51,920
you know you you it just this slow

3551
02:32:48,889 --> 02:32:54,129
gassing or this one-time bombing it just

3552
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:56,540
starts to build persistence in the space

3553
02:32:54,129 --> 02:32:58,670
well the whole notion about using

3554
02:32:56,540 --> 02:33:01,729
pyrethrum though is that pyrethrum

3555
02:32:58,670 --> 02:33:04,760
actually is not stable and will break

3556
02:33:01,728 --> 02:33:07,219
down with time so pyrethrum itself is an

3557
02:33:04,760 --> 02:33:10,520
extract from a chrysanthemum daisy right

3558
02:33:07,219 --> 02:33:13,659
that is actually a natural insecticide

3559
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:17,780
now you have to distinguish that from

3560
02:33:13,659 --> 02:33:20,930
pyrethroids which are kinda like there's

3561
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:23,870
opiate and opioids so that pyrethroids

3562
02:33:20,930 --> 02:33:25,309
are all synthetic analogues and those

3563
02:33:23,870 --> 02:33:27,230
are all the active ingredients that

3564
02:33:25,309 --> 02:33:29,720
you're talking about which ya are

3565
02:33:27,229 --> 02:33:32,390
regulated for use in Paris well hi

3566
02:33:29,720 --> 02:33:35,329
wreath room itself is a naturally

3567
02:33:32,390 --> 02:33:38,029
occurring you know basically extract

3568
02:33:35,329 --> 02:33:39,921
that has what insect mostly insecticidal

3569
02:33:38,030 --> 02:33:42,079
activity right yeah when you give you a

3570
02:33:39,921 --> 02:33:43,610
pie Ganic and like an organic evergreen

3571
02:33:42,079 --> 02:33:47,171
version which are just chrysanthemum

3572
02:33:43,610 --> 02:33:50,891
extracts extracts but you know paper

3573
02:33:47,171 --> 02:33:54,649
which shows that cannabis can produce

3574
02:33:50,890 --> 02:33:56,210
Arabians no you know what that's that I

3575
02:33:54,649 --> 02:33:57,560
have to call I have to say you know

3576
02:33:56,210 --> 02:34:00,439
there was there I think there was a very

3577
02:33:57,560 --> 02:34:02,960
premature bad leave you know the

3578
02:34:00,440 --> 02:34:04,761
whenever so that there was a paper that

3579
02:34:02,960 --> 02:34:06,619
kind of put out about pyrethrins it was

3580
02:34:04,761 --> 02:34:08,329
and and correct me if I'm wrong Sam but

3581
02:34:06,620 --> 02:34:10,790
there was a pretty recent paper over the

3582
02:34:08,329 --> 02:34:12,921
last few years but there was there's

3583
02:34:10,790 --> 02:34:15,351
there was some faulty information that

3584
02:34:12,921 --> 02:34:17,931
was generated by a lab or two around

3585
02:34:15,351 --> 02:34:20,301
these because PI you know in in the mass

3586
02:34:17,931 --> 02:34:22,461
spectrum you know like you can you can

3587
02:34:20,300 --> 02:34:25,609
pretty easily if you don't validate your

3588
02:34:22,460 --> 02:34:29,000
run you can miss identify pyrethrin or

3589
02:34:25,610 --> 02:34:31,370
piracy of these pyrethrin Peaks or or

3590
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:33,380
irritate me or molecular kind of weights

3591
02:34:31,370 --> 02:34:35,480
or whatever we know what I'm unless kind

3592
02:34:33,380 --> 02:34:37,100
of scientist more kind of on the you

3593
02:34:35,479 --> 02:34:38,329
know kind of front-end so I am NOT

3594
02:34:37,101 --> 02:34:45,730
foundational a lot of science but

3595
02:34:38,329 --> 02:34:51,351
essentially have the materials Jews

3596
02:34:45,729 --> 02:34:52,729
Caribbean yeah I so I I do I hear you on

3597
02:34:51,351 --> 02:34:54,290
that I do know that you cuz I know that

3598
02:34:52,729 --> 02:34:55,671
the lab was publishing data around it

3599
02:34:54,290 --> 02:34:57,440
and I know as a result there was this to

3600
02:34:55,671 --> 02:34:59,421
genetic testing company that published

3601
02:34:57,440 --> 02:35:01,700
it I would just I would personally want

3602
02:34:59,421 --> 02:35:03,021
to see a lot more reproducible data to

3603
02:35:01,700 --> 02:35:05,211
demonstrate that because from what I

3604
02:35:03,021 --> 02:35:07,971
know so much of that was some who has

3605
02:35:05,210 --> 02:35:13,039
false positives and from the lab one

3606
02:35:07,970 --> 02:35:15,140
variety of will that be interesting if

3607
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:17,870
there was a certain specific plant or

3608
02:35:15,140 --> 02:35:23,511
chemo bar that had that property that

3609
02:35:17,870 --> 02:35:31,160
seems very interesting everybody will

3610
02:35:23,511 --> 02:35:35,860
immediately get it now and you've

3611
02:35:31,159 --> 02:35:38,690
already patented that right did hey Alec

3612
02:35:35,860 --> 02:35:43,159
Sam's Bram

3613
02:35:38,690 --> 02:35:46,399
I am definitely no longer going to be

3614
02:35:43,159 --> 02:35:48,590
hitting my Andean Cusco chocolate that

3615
02:35:46,399 --> 02:35:51,440
was left on my pillow in Colombia when I

3616
02:35:48,590 --> 02:35:55,100
was there recently well do test it send

3617
02:35:51,440 --> 02:35:55,730
it cadmium dude let me test it I'll send

3618
02:35:55,100 --> 02:36:03,800
it your way

3619
02:35:55,729 --> 02:36:06,139
yeah well that's Cusco chocolate well

3620
02:36:03,799 --> 02:36:08,869
and it's not to down to denigrate kind

3621
02:36:06,139 --> 02:36:11,689
of you know then I I love a lot of nd

3622
02:36:08,870 --> 02:36:13,579
and medicines you know but but to

3623
02:36:11,690 --> 02:36:16,399
understand this topic of cacao and this

3624
02:36:13,579 --> 02:36:17,810
whole phytoremediation of cadmium it's

3625
02:36:16,399 --> 02:36:19,969
really blowing my mind around these

3626
02:36:17,810 --> 02:36:21,440
various aspects and you know just like

3627
02:36:19,969 --> 02:36:23,090
the whole thing with jewel and testing

3628
02:36:21,440 --> 02:36:25,190
diamond nose I when I was puffing you

3629
02:36:23,090 --> 02:36:26,870
know once you know and you see the see

3630
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:29,120
the results in front of you you then

3631
02:36:26,870 --> 02:36:31,940
have a choice you know to keep puffing

3632
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:33,800
it or to keep eating that cacao or you

3633
02:36:31,940 --> 02:36:34,730
know to find a cleaner source and I

3634
02:36:33,799 --> 02:36:36,439
think that's one of the most magical

3635
02:36:34,729 --> 02:36:38,029
things about kind of you know what

3636
02:36:36,440 --> 02:36:40,040
analytical chemistry is bringing to the

3637
02:36:38,030 --> 02:36:41,600
you know science of cannabis it's really

3638
02:36:40,040 --> 02:36:44,000
helping to kind of bring these things to

3639
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:45,771
the surface that are unknown Invisibles

3640
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:49,639
and then giving us the opportunity to

3641
02:36:45,771 --> 02:36:51,409
choose quite a percent now it's it's a

3642
02:36:49,639 --> 02:36:54,859
wonderful thing I'm glad you were able

3643
02:36:51,409 --> 02:36:58,399
to make it in because it sure was a lot

3644
02:36:54,860 --> 02:37:00,440
of analytical and lab talk before you

3645
02:36:58,399 --> 02:37:02,869
came in and of course since you've come

3646
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:05,750
as well it's been the real and oh and I

3647
02:37:02,870 --> 02:37:08,360
wanted to mention to you guys I am now I

3648
02:37:05,750 --> 02:37:13,010
through zoom I can record this so I

3649
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:14,870
record it like in a video format it also

3650
02:37:13,010 --> 02:37:17,569
streams to YouTube and get saved but

3651
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:21,460
then it also creates a audio file so

3652
02:37:17,569 --> 02:37:24,379
I've started to post at buzzsprout and

3653
02:37:21,459 --> 02:37:27,679
I'll post the link in hash Church it's

3654
02:37:24,379 --> 02:37:29,839
basically buzzsprout comm backslash and

3655
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:33,290
then the code for all the hash church

3656
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:36,319
will be five five two one nine six and

3657
02:37:33,290 --> 02:37:38,090
I'll post that in I'll post it in the

3658
02:37:36,319 --> 02:37:40,180
comments section of all the hash

3659
02:37:38,090 --> 02:37:42,771
churches from now on that are zoom and

3660
02:37:40,180 --> 02:37:45,260
I'll also post it in the hash Church

3661
02:37:42,771 --> 02:37:46,850
forum on Facebook just so people you

3662
02:37:45,260 --> 02:37:50,600
know some people have been asking me for

3663
02:37:46,850 --> 02:37:51,940
years to make hash church into a

3664
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:54,739
podcasts

3665
02:37:51,940 --> 02:37:56,960
there you have it he did the podcast and

conversation yeah I haven't been seen

3671
02:38:11,059 --> 02:38:14,329
too many people hitting bond rows I feel

3672
02:38:12,978 --> 02:38:17,750
like I've been hit in mind pretty tough

3673

02:38:40,579 --> 02:38:44,329
last like three months

3682
02:38:42,049 --> 02:38:46,849

you and Diana and the picture I can't

3703
02:39:41,389 --> 02:39:45,170
remember exactly it looks like an album

3704
02:39:42,978 --> 02:39:48,279
cover or something that's definitely the

3705
02:39:45,170 --> 02:39:51,290
front page of your book because that is

3706
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:53,150
the most unbelievable it looks like it's

3707
02:39:51,290 --> 02:39:55,220
like a Hollywood thing like it doesn't

3708
02:39:53,149 --> 02:39:58,959
even look real good a much cuter one

3709
02:39:55,219 --> 02:40:01,369
when I was about nine months old naked

3710
02:39:58,959 --> 02:40:03,049
no you got to bury that in the book deep

3711
02:40:01,370 --> 02:40:05,360
you can't you can't be putting that on

3712
02:40:03,049 --> 02:40:08,879
the front cover Sam come on

3713
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:10,140
you get hey Mark you want to answer this

3714
02:40:08,879 --> 02:40:12,898
last question here

3715
02:40:10,139 --> 02:40:16,469
what's one that is it possible to

3716
02:40:12,898 --> 02:40:18,989
carboxylate TT dislike converting it

3717
02:40:16,469 --> 02:40:21,478
back into th CA Yeah right he would very

3718
02:40:18,989 --> 02:40:24,809
much like you to ask that question okay

3719
02:40:21,478 --> 02:40:28,559
so who asked that question well that

3720
02:40:24,809 --> 02:40:32,609
question you know they probably tell me

3721
02:40:28,559 --> 02:40:36,569
if I asked tell us who as bet yeah so

3722
02:40:32,610 --> 02:40:39,840
it's it's possible but it takes a whole

3723
02:40:36,569 --> 02:40:43,439
lot of energy because you've you've

3724
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:46,590
basically THCA again has got higher

3725
02:40:43,439 --> 02:40:49,290
energy than THC and so one of the

3726
02:40:46,590 --> 02:40:51,898
carboxylates it goes downhill kind of

3727
02:40:49,290 --> 02:40:54,840
like a roller coaster and so you need to

3728
02:40:51,898 --> 02:40:58,409
put a lot of energy back in and can you

3729
02:40:54,840 --> 02:41:01,620
so when you lose the carboxylic acid in

3730
02:40:58,409 --> 02:41:04,889
th CA that's a decarboxylation to

3731
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:07,399
carboxylate it it's a very old chemical

3732
02:41:04,889 --> 02:41:10,139
reaction called the Kobe Schmitt

3733
02:41:07,398 --> 02:41:13,409
reaction and the Colby Schmitt reaction

3734
02:41:10,139 --> 02:41:16,469
is a it's a way to make salicylic acid

3735
02:41:13,409 --> 02:41:18,689
from phenol so it's a way of carboxyl

3736
02:41:16,469 --> 02:41:21,659
eating phenol to make salicylic acid and

3737
02:41:18,689 --> 02:41:23,250
you can apply that to mate th CA but it

3738
02:41:21,659 --> 02:41:25,799
would probably tear up the rest of the

3739
02:41:23,250 --> 02:41:29,250
molecule because that reaction has done

3740
02:41:25,799 --> 02:41:31,889
it ungodly high-pressure I think in

3741
02:41:29,250 --> 02:41:35,639
molten sodium or some [ __ ] like that so

3742
02:41:31,889 --> 02:41:38,369
middle of the Sun kind of chemistry it's

3743
02:41:35,639 --> 02:41:40,260
gonna destroy the Terps it's gonna

3744
02:41:38,370 --> 02:41:43,770
destroy everything including probably

3745
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:46,228
the person doing it you know someone

3746
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:49,680
reporting the person doing it yeah

3747
02:41:46,228 --> 02:41:54,619
someone reported the use of a reagent

3748
02:41:49,680 --> 02:42:00,210
called MN n P which is magnesium mono

3749
02:41:54,620 --> 02:42:02,729
terephthalate to do the oxidation of THC

3750
02:42:00,209 --> 02:42:04,679
to make THC a they only did a few

3751
02:42:02,728 --> 02:42:05,760
milligrams in the paper they just showed

3752
02:42:04,680 --> 02:42:08,520
that it could be done

3753
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:11,159
I think isolated to peak in the PC and

3754
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:12,930
said look we can do this well thank you

3755
02:42:11,159 --> 02:42:15,329
for the focus who asked that question

3756
02:42:12,930 --> 02:42:16,120
and he just said this is so much better

3757
02:42:15,329 --> 02:42:21,399
than as

3758
02:42:16,120 --> 02:42:24,400
hang on reddit so yeah probably not

3759
02:42:21,399 --> 02:42:28,270
once you decarboxylate you know it's a

3760
02:42:24,399 --> 02:42:32,020
it's a downhill thermodynamic reaction

3761
02:42:28,271 --> 02:42:35,561
you lose co2 and that co2 needs a whole

3762
02:42:32,021 --> 02:42:41,610
lot of energy to go back and be the

3763
02:42:35,560 --> 02:42:43,860
cannabinoid acid again and it just would

3764
02:42:41,610 --> 02:42:46,329
again someone they used to make

3765
02:42:43,860 --> 02:42:49,771
industrially salicylic acid salicylic

3766
02:42:46,329 --> 02:42:53,260
acid you could actually isolate from

3767
02:42:49,771 --> 02:42:55,570
from the bark of willow tree I think is

3768
02:42:53,260 --> 02:42:58,300
where they used to get it from but you

3769
02:42:55,569 --> 02:43:05,310
can make it industrially in a Colby

3770
02:42:58,299 --> 02:43:08,259
Schmidt reaction Colby is spell k o lb e

3771
02:43:05,310 --> 02:43:11,409
Colby Schmidt man these are some badass

3772
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:13,120
German chemists for you know a little

3773
02:43:11,409 --> 02:43:17,110
after turn of the century that were

3774
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:18,880
[ __ ] taking molten sodium and doing

3775
02:43:17,110 --> 02:43:22,540
all kinds of synthesis with it these

3776
02:43:18,879 --> 02:43:24,100
[ __ ] man it just you know this

3777
02:43:22,540 --> 02:43:26,351
is the foundation the chemistry that

3778
02:43:24,101 --> 02:43:29,980
exists out there there's there are ways

3779
02:43:26,351 --> 02:43:32,590
so to answer the question yes you can do

3780
02:43:29,979 --> 02:43:34,810
it I think it would tear up the rest of

3781
02:43:32,590 --> 02:43:39,940
the molecule and I think would never be

3782
02:43:34,810 --> 02:43:42,310
economically viable to do so so but

3783
02:43:39,940 --> 02:43:44,079
interesting question nonetheless it's

3784
02:43:42,310 --> 02:43:45,879
inspired me actually and I just

3785
02:43:44,079 --> 02:43:48,430
mentioned it to the YouTube chat room

3786
02:43:45,879 --> 02:43:51,339
that I think a really good episode would

3787
02:43:48,430 --> 02:43:52,750
be you know a question and answer like

3788
02:43:51,340 --> 02:43:55,000
listen listen this is going to be the

3789
02:43:52,750 --> 02:43:56,649
panel this week we're specifically only

3790
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:58,569
going to be answering your questions

3791
02:43:56,649 --> 02:44:01,719
maybe even over the course of a week or

3792
02:43:58,569 --> 02:44:04,869
two you know bring in 500 different

3793
02:44:01,719 --> 02:44:06,429
questions and pick like 20 or 30 or 40

3794
02:44:04,870 --> 02:44:10,480
or whatever it is we have time to answer

3795
02:44:06,430 --> 02:44:12,601
I think that would be pretty killer you

3796
02:44:10,479 --> 02:44:16,539
know we could answer five questions

3797
02:44:12,601 --> 02:44:18,400
every time we do a a hash search there

3798
02:44:16,540 --> 02:44:20,620
you go yeah exactly and I you know just

3799
02:44:18,399 --> 02:44:22,149
today being the last half an hour it

3800
02:44:20,620 --> 02:44:24,370
made sense to just be like they've got

3801
02:44:22,149 --> 02:44:29,049
lots of questions one thing I will say

3802
02:44:24,370 --> 02:44:29,770
about the chat the hash room hash search

3803
02:44:29,049 --> 02:44:33,219
chat

3804
02:44:29,770 --> 02:44:35,800
is that they're very engaged with what's

3805
02:44:33,219 --> 02:44:37,689
going on for the most part the odd time

3806
02:44:35,799 --> 02:44:39,340
someone gets to stick up their ass and

3807
02:44:37,690 --> 02:44:41,590
they try to like hijack the entire

3808
02:44:39,340 --> 02:44:43,450
conversation but they are pretty damn

3809
02:44:41,590 --> 02:44:46,389
engaged in the conversation which I

3810
02:44:43,450 --> 02:44:48,670
guess is part of the little bit of magic

3811
02:44:46,389 --> 02:44:51,519
why would they be watching if they

3812
02:44:48,670 --> 02:44:53,440
weren't yeah well you surprised man I go

3813
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:55,090
into like like you know okay for a

3814
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:57,760
perfect example couch to her

3815
02:44:55,090 --> 02:44:59,350
holy smokes have you ever you get to go

3816
02:44:57,760 --> 02:45:02,139
to the real show so you probably don't

3817
02:44:59,350 --> 02:45:04,360
have to do couch tour mark on my couch

3818
02:45:02,139 --> 02:45:06,849
tour now because Fischer's out in Denver

3819
02:45:04,360 --> 02:45:11,440
caliber of people in the chat room let's

3820
02:45:06,850 --> 02:45:13,180
just say are not ninety micron for the

3821
02:45:11,440 --> 02:45:17,620
rest of us laymen what are you talking

3822
02:45:13,180 --> 02:45:20,739
about I'm talking about fish does alive

3823
02:45:17,620 --> 02:45:22,900
they do their tour video live streamed

3824
02:45:20,739 --> 02:45:24,459
and so they have a video stream

3825
02:45:22,899 --> 02:45:26,529
sometimes it's on Ustream or whatever

3826
02:45:24,459 --> 02:45:29,199
and then they have a chatroom just like

3827
02:45:26,530 --> 02:45:30,700
us just like here and so I'll go into

3828
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:32,079
the chatroom thinking man I bet there's

3829
02:45:30,700 --> 02:45:34,630
some good people in there and I'm just

3830
02:45:32,079 --> 02:45:36,039
like holy [ __ ] like it's like troll

3831
02:45:34,629 --> 02:45:39,119
central in there like you don't even

3832
02:45:36,040 --> 02:45:39,120
want to go in there for half a

3833
02:45:39,478 --> 02:45:44,170
maintainer everything here is really

3834
02:45:42,219 --> 02:45:45,879
engaged and really thoughtful there's a

3835
02:45:44,170 --> 02:45:47,170
lot of crazy questions in here I'm just

3836
02:45:45,879 --> 02:45:48,519
going through trying to find there's a

3837
02:45:47,170 --> 02:45:49,870
few that are really fascinating around

3838
02:45:48,520 --> 02:45:51,909
testing you know one of the ones

3839
02:45:49,870 --> 02:45:53,790
actually I see on your real quick I

3840
02:45:51,909 --> 02:45:56,590
think would be great to hit is uh

3841
02:45:53,790 --> 02:45:58,660
pesticides through white whitey

3842
02:45:56,590 --> 02:46:00,280
pesticides kind of concentrate more with

3843
02:45:58,659 --> 02:46:02,049
the essential oils and the red and the

3844
02:46:00,280 --> 02:46:04,360
resin glands than kind of on the biomass

3845
02:46:02,049 --> 02:46:06,909
or plant material because we see that

3846
02:46:04,360 --> 02:46:09,100
trend very specifically like if you if

3847
02:46:06,909 --> 02:46:11,200
you have pesticides fungicides anything

3848
02:46:09,100 --> 02:46:13,030
like that on the plant and if you do

3849
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:15,670
fresh frozen extraction live resin

3850
02:46:13,030 --> 02:46:18,280
extraction on it and then in the process

3851
02:46:15,670 --> 02:46:21,010
of further kind of purifying and kind of

3852
02:46:18,280 --> 02:46:23,320
mining the diamonds whether the terpenes

3853
02:46:21,010 --> 02:46:25,478
separate up to the top you know in the

3854
02:46:23,319 --> 02:46:28,029
terpene layer like if you test the

3855
02:46:25,478 --> 02:46:30,639
crystalline THC a that's created from

3856
02:46:28,030 --> 02:46:34,600
that process you know it's 96 97 plus

3857
02:46:30,639 --> 02:46:36,219
percent THC a the remaining bits are you

3858
02:46:34,600 --> 02:46:38,020
know presence of kind of terpenes

3859
02:46:36,219 --> 02:46:41,199
what-have-you but you see in the

3860
02:46:38,020 --> 02:46:42,921
terpenes the terpene layers were what

3861
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:46,011
fractions the pesticides were those

3862
02:46:42,921 --> 02:46:47,931
we see most all the pesticides or

3863
02:46:46,011 --> 02:46:49,791
whatever that whatever fungicide

3864
02:46:47,931 --> 02:46:53,471
contamination that's in the material we

3865
02:46:49,790 --> 02:46:53,470
see all that migrate with the terpenes

3866
02:46:54,820 --> 02:46:59,601
very good yeah that that's kind of yeah

3867
02:46:57,979 --> 02:47:02,001
that was got your father solvent and

3868
02:46:59,601 --> 02:47:05,211
most of those are hydrophobic molecules

3869
02:47:02,001 --> 02:47:07,490
a lot of them delivered by suspension in

3870
02:47:05,210 --> 02:47:09,680
water they're not very water soluble so

3871
02:47:07,490 --> 02:47:11,630
they want to be in a hydrophobic

3872
02:47:09,681 --> 02:47:20,661
environment so yeah it totally makes

3873
02:47:11,630 --> 02:47:23,421
sense sorry I'm bombs right would it be

3874
02:47:20,661 --> 02:47:24,979
great if the if the pest of all you know

3875
02:47:23,421 --> 02:47:26,990
that said there are water-soluble

3876
02:47:24,979 --> 02:47:29,720
pesticides that will stay in the water

3877
02:47:26,990 --> 02:47:31,781
and not go into the oil but

3878
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:34,671
unfortunately most of these you know

3879
02:47:31,781 --> 02:47:36,980
insecticides of Michael butanone a lot

3880
02:47:34,671 --> 02:47:41,031
of these things are very hydrophobic and

3881
02:47:36,979 --> 02:47:42,921
we'll concentrate any well you guys

3882
02:47:41,031 --> 02:47:45,321
missed it the second I mentioned that we

3883
02:47:42,921 --> 02:47:46,611
had a good chat room a troll came in it

3884
02:47:45,320 --> 02:47:48,380
was like you guys need to stop smoking

3885
02:47:46,611 --> 02:47:52,251
weed and get your get your lives

3886
02:47:48,380 --> 02:47:58,161
together oh that's what I was missing my

3887
02:47:52,251 --> 02:48:00,681
life oh gosh yeah what the heck well if

3888

3891
02:48:13,281 --> 02:48:17,301
minutes left before it's noon

3892
02:48:14,990 --> 02:48:20,001
I got all these tasty bootlegs in my dat

3893
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:24,530
recorder from like I bought this in 1995

3894
02:48:20,001 --> 02:48:26,511
in Missoula Montana and I just decided

3895
02:48:24,531 --> 02:48:29,661
you know what I'm gonna become a tapir I

3896
02:48:26,511 --> 02:48:32,031
should be a [ __ ] tapir 95 I've been to

3897
02:48:29,661 --> 02:48:34,431
quite a few shows already and I had a

3898
02:48:32,031 --> 02:48:37,221
hard time acquiring them and I wasn't

3899
02:48:34,431 --> 02:48:40,611
sure fish shows how did I find that in

3900
02:48:37,220 --> 02:48:43,400
Missoula how did I I know right how did

3901
02:48:40,611 --> 02:48:44,931
I what mark well I was just you said he

3902
02:48:43,400 --> 02:48:47,450
had been to a bunch of shows dad shows

3903
02:48:44,931 --> 02:48:50,331
or fish shows no it was fish shows it

3904
02:48:47,450 --> 02:48:52,760
was it was nice and I think to be honest

3905
02:48:50,331 --> 02:48:56,200
Jerry had been had passed already by

3906
02:48:52,761 --> 02:48:58,870
this point yeah okay or I was soft

3907
02:48:56,200 --> 02:49:01,720
for the first time in 93 but yeah I just

3908
02:48:58,870 --> 02:49:03,790
have all these old shows from like you

3909
02:49:01,719 --> 02:49:08,129
know here's a David Grisman that I tape

3910
02:49:03,790 --> 02:49:11,681
know like all the ones I have Marcus or

3911
02:49:08,129 --> 02:49:13,779
the Milky Way or the parodies oh oh I

3912
02:49:11,681 --> 02:49:16,110
know Sam years are amazing this is the

3913
02:49:13,780 --> 02:49:20,470
Missoula Montana show this was the first

3914
02:49:16,110 --> 02:49:23,800
recording I ever did on this dad ha ha

3915
02:49:20,469 --> 02:49:25,899
that's an incredible show oh yeah right

3916
02:49:23,799 --> 02:49:28,899
there was a there's tracks from that

3917
02:49:25,899 --> 02:49:29,920
show that are on the alive one their

3918
02:49:28,899 --> 02:49:32,459
live release

3919
02:49:29,920 --> 02:49:36,190
I think the tweezer from that night

3920
02:49:32,459 --> 02:49:38,289
might be the tweezer no that was from

3921
02:49:36,190 --> 02:49:40,149
Bangor Maine I was at that show you know

3922
02:49:38,290 --> 02:49:43,450
that see you look at that so yeah I knew

3923
02:49:40,149 --> 02:49:46,000
that was in 94 in Bangor Maine and I

3924
02:49:43,450 --> 02:49:48,460
took too many psychedelics at that show

3925
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:49,719
in fact I thought it was just like okay

3926
02:49:48,459 --> 02:49:51,250
the guys like you want to eat some

3927
02:49:49,719 --> 02:49:52,539
mushrooms I'm like I would love to eat

3928
02:49:51,250 --> 02:49:54,101
some mushrooms he's like it's they're

3929
02:49:52,540 --> 02:49:56,500
pretty strong I'm like well just give me

3930
02:49:54,101 --> 02:49:57,159
a gram so I eat a gram of these

3931
02:49:56,500 --> 02:49:59,829
mushrooms

3932
02:49:57,159 --> 02:50:01,750
well apparently pretty strong okay so

3933
02:49:59,829 --> 02:50:04,870
I'm standing in line to get into this

3934
02:50:01,750 --> 02:50:08,021
concert and the sound of everyone

3935
02:50:04,870 --> 02:50:11,230
talking slowly morphs into mechanical

3936
02:50:08,021 --> 02:50:13,870
like crazy like spaceship sounds of like

3937
02:50:11,229 --> 02:50:15,670
a giant spaceship gearing up to take off

3938
02:50:13,870 --> 02:50:18,010
it was totally blowing my mind at that

3939
02:50:15,670 --> 02:50:20,140
point I thought this [ __ ] must have been

3940
02:50:18,010 --> 02:50:22,300
dipped in a much stronger psychedelic

3941
02:50:20,140 --> 02:50:24,670
because like no gram of mushrooms could

3942
02:50:22,299 --> 02:50:27,629
get me this high I've eaten enough five

3943
02:50:24,670 --> 02:50:30,579
gram doses to know this is gonna be envy

3944
02:50:27,629 --> 02:50:32,890
so I'm getting high the lineups getting

3945
02:50:30,579 --> 02:50:36,149
closer and closer as we get to the door

3946
02:50:32,890 --> 02:50:37,449
I realize they are searching people

3947
02:50:36,149 --> 02:50:40,029
harshly

3948
02:50:37,450 --> 02:50:42,370
okay there's like all these cops lined

3949
02:50:40,030 --> 02:50:44,110
up against the wall and there's patting

3950
02:50:42,370 --> 02:50:46,240
people down and I'm like holy [ __ ] like

3951
02:50:44,110 --> 02:50:49,360
I have a lot of stuff so I started

3952
02:50:46,239 --> 02:50:52,000
stuffing everything into my socks and I

3953
02:50:49,360 --> 02:50:54,521
don't really realize it but I basically

3954
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:56,590
stuffed my bag of weed into my sock and

3955
02:50:54,521 --> 02:50:58,570
it gets caught up on my pant leg so it's

3956
02:50:56,590 --> 02:51:01,810
really just sticking out of my pant leg

3957
02:50:58,569 --> 02:51:03,909
and I'm super high I go up there they

3958
02:51:01,810 --> 02:51:05,590
Pat me down and don't see this plastic

3959
02:51:03,909 --> 02:51:07,750
bag apparently sticking out of my my

3960
02:51:05,590 --> 02:51:08,351
pant leg and then I walk by this like

3961
02:51:07,750 --> 02:51:11,200
long

3962
02:51:08,351 --> 02:51:13,001
long row at this point I'm like I'm I'm

3963
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:15,490
in a psychedelic State

3964
02:51:13,001 --> 02:51:17,261
I can't even exactly tell like

3965
02:51:15,489 --> 02:51:18,940
everything's different than it should be

3966
02:51:17,261 --> 02:51:20,771
and these cops are all just looking at

3967
02:51:18,940 --> 02:51:22,751
me with the most serious look and man I

3968
02:51:20,771 --> 02:51:24,489
walked past them about 20 feet and

3969
02:51:22,751 --> 02:51:26,681
looked down and realized the bag was

3970
02:51:24,489 --> 02:51:30,790
hanging out and it was the beginning of

3971
02:51:26,681 --> 02:51:34,091
a very intense show and that's 29 or 30

3972
02:51:30,790 --> 02:51:40,050
one minute long tweezer yeah

3973
02:51:34,091 --> 02:51:43,899
mind numbing let me tell you yeah why I

3974
02:51:40,050 --> 02:51:46,119
was hassled going into the Palace

3975
02:51:43,899 --> 02:51:50,081
Theatre on my birthday this would have

3976
02:51:46,120 --> 02:51:53,801
been December 29th 1992 and I just got

3977
02:51:50,081 --> 02:51:56,370
back from Colorado and I had I we were

3978
02:51:53,800 --> 02:52:00,430
growing skunk number one so I had a nice

3979
02:51:56,370 --> 02:52:04,030
fresh bag of skunk number one in my

3980
02:52:00,431 --> 02:52:06,131
pocket and gotta take it away going in

3981
02:52:04,030 --> 02:52:10,989
to the show that night and really just

3982
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:16,479
bummed me out because we on the way out

3983
02:52:10,989 --> 02:52:18,699
of the show we grabbed the bag out of

3984
02:52:16,479 --> 02:52:20,770
the garbage can where they made me

3985
02:52:18,700 --> 02:52:23,021
through the weed and we got a bunch of

3986
02:52:20,771 --> 02:52:26,351
[ __ ] that was confiscated at the tour

3987
02:52:23,021 --> 02:52:28,659
that night and ran around the back of

3988
02:52:26,351 --> 02:52:31,601
the theater and we're back there Marcus

3989

3990
02:52:31,601 --> 02:52:36,251

3991

02:58:00,588 --> 02:58:04,639
fairly special thing it's a it's a

4102
02:58:03,350 --> 02:58:08,209
pretty special thing like it's

4106
02:58:13,418 --> 02:58:17,959
R&amp;D at this point yeah Andrew will be

4107
02:58:16,668 --> 02:58:20,748
back on again I'm sure

4108
02:58:17,959 --> 02:58:23,449
and what about Tony what's the latest on

4109
02:58:20,748 --> 02:58:25,818
him do you know I still am in a company

4110
02:58:23,449 --> 02:58:27,799
with him but as far as I've heard I

4111
02:58:25,818 --> 02:58:30,918
really don't know like I heard he won a

4112
02:58:27,799 --> 02:58:34,039
cannabis cup recently I know that you

4113
02:58:30,918 --> 02:58:36,139
can still rocking and rolling I'm sure

4114
02:58:34,039 --> 02:58:39,829
he's probably down in California running

4115
02:58:36,139 --> 02:58:42,288
his labs well if you go to you can cite

4116
02:58:39,828 --> 02:58:44,119
that I don't think he's he's he's part

4117
02:58:42,289 --> 02:58:46,609
of the team anymore it sounds like he's

4118
02:58:44,119 --> 02:58:50,509
no longer with you can is that right oh

4119
02:58:46,609 --> 02:58:52,158
[ __ ] I don't know yeah I just I was

4120
02:58:50,509 --> 02:58:54,498
wondering about Tony the other day and I

4121
02:58:52,158 --> 02:58:57,199
just I went to you can cite and I see it

4122
02:58:54,498 --> 02:58:58,939
talks about Ernie and you know some of

4123
02:58:57,199 --> 02:59:05,449
the other folks but it doesn't I don't

4124
02:58:58,939 --> 02:59:09,199
think Tony's mentioning it's not but

4125
02:59:05,449 --> 02:59:11,689
what he is is he still has some shares

4126
02:59:09,199 --> 02:59:15,430
and some of the companies but he needs

4127
02:59:11,689 --> 02:59:18,738
to he's promised he was gonna sell back

4128
02:59:15,430 --> 02:59:20,930
right well shares we all know how that

4129
02:59:18,738 --> 02:59:23,689
plays out I remember at one point you

4130
02:59:20,930 --> 02:59:27,139
can had $11 shares and I checked the

4131
02:59:23,689 --> 02:59:32,389
other day it was 49 cents that's gotta

4132
02:59:27,139 --> 02:59:34,698
be a wicked yeah it's just tough to play

4133
02:59:32,389 --> 02:59:35,988
that game I mean and I don't know like

4134
02:59:34,699 --> 02:59:38,658
if you look at some of these other

4135
02:59:35,988 --> 02:59:41,118
bigger players like the multinationals

4136
02:59:38,658 --> 02:59:43,748
now in the canopies and and whatnot I

4137
02:59:41,119 --> 02:59:47,600
mean what's gonna ultimately happen in

4138
02:59:43,748 --> 02:59:52,969
that you know especially with the FDA's

4139
02:59:47,600 --> 02:59:55,899
position now on on CBD you know so a lot

4140
02:59:52,969 --> 02:59:58,668
of Canadian huge Canadian companies are

4141
02:59:55,898 --> 03:00:01,148
scooping up licenses left and right here

4142
02:59:58,668 --> 03:00:01,148
in the States

4143
03:00:01,478 --> 03:00:07,568
it'll be interesting to see where this

4144
03:00:03,939 --> 03:00:15,029
goes more people make more money selling

4145
03:00:07,568 --> 03:00:20,528
shares of their companies then it's true

4146
03:00:15,029 --> 03:00:25,119
massive massive insane amounts of wealth

4147
03:00:20,529 --> 03:00:30,640
have been produced in that very fraud I

4148
03:00:25,119 --> 03:00:33,340
guess you could call it kind of to me

4149
03:00:30,639 --> 03:00:34,988
because you know there's so many I mean

4150
03:00:33,340 --> 03:00:36,728
there's still I feel like just in the

4151
03:00:34,988 --> 03:00:38,559
candidate in there like the the

4152
03:00:36,728 --> 03:00:40,179
leadership of the cannabis community in

4153
03:00:38,559 --> 03:00:41,769
each of the spaces each of the state's

4154
03:00:40,180 --> 03:00:43,658
you know they're they're lies this kind

4155
03:00:41,770 --> 03:00:44,078
of you know this two degree of Kevin

4156
03:00:43,658 --> 03:00:46,270
Bacon

4157
03:00:44,078 --> 03:00:48,038
kind of you know of the connection and

4158
03:00:46,270 --> 03:00:49,539
interconnection I think of a lot of the

4159
03:00:48,039 --> 03:00:51,909
the leaders in the community you know

4160
03:00:49,539 --> 03:00:54,129
and and I think there's massive strength

4161
03:00:51,908 --> 03:00:56,408
and kind of the the Solidarity among

4162
03:00:54,129 --> 03:00:59,140
that community you know their cannabis

4163
03:00:56,408 --> 03:01:01,449
is so long then based on trust and and

4164
03:00:59,139 --> 03:01:04,658
respect and kind of integrity in your

4165
03:01:01,449 --> 03:01:06,489
word you know like you can you know

4166
03:01:04,658 --> 03:01:08,260
hustling weed kind of somebody can rip

4167
03:01:06,488 --> 03:01:09,728
you off to rob you it's there's this

4168
03:01:08,260 --> 03:01:11,918
code of conduct I think that's really

4169
03:01:09,728 --> 03:01:14,590
kind of fallen off you know in this

4170
03:01:11,918 --> 03:01:17,049
invasion effort of capitalism into

4171
03:01:14,590 --> 03:01:19,478
cannabis and you know I really pray and

4172
03:01:17,049 --> 03:01:22,028
hope you know on this task church today

4173
03:01:19,478 --> 03:01:24,309
that you know we as a community can kind

4174
03:01:22,029 --> 03:01:26,260
of come together more and less see you

4175
03:01:24,309 --> 03:01:28,748
know each other in ways as competition

4176
03:01:26,260 --> 03:01:30,219
and kind of more you know really because

4177
03:01:28,748 --> 03:01:32,109
I think the real competitors haven't

4178
03:01:30,219 --> 03:01:34,090
came in yet you know obviously and and

4179
03:01:32,109 --> 03:01:37,029
they're waiting for the infighting and

4180
03:01:34,090 --> 03:01:39,279
all the failures you know because the

4181
03:01:37,029 --> 03:01:42,399
lack of capital or the you know kind of

4182
03:01:39,279 --> 03:01:44,260
the the vulture fund kind effort to come

4183
03:01:42,398 --> 03:01:45,818
just take over and kind of you know

4184
03:01:44,260 --> 03:01:47,648
transform these good ideas and good

4185
03:01:45,818 --> 03:01:49,418
people's business and to you know he's

4186
03:01:47,648 --> 03:01:51,398
pumpin up [ __ ] efforts to kind of just

4187
03:01:49,418 --> 03:01:53,949
raise money and capital with quick exit

4188
03:01:51,398 --> 03:01:55,628
strategies but you know I feel like you

4189
03:01:53,949 --> 03:01:58,328
know lost us understanding that there's

4190
03:01:55,629 --> 03:02:00,729
there's more kind of culture and

4191
03:01:58,328 --> 03:02:02,288
richness and in our community than we

4192
03:02:00,728 --> 03:02:04,510
could ever then they could ever bring

4193
03:02:02,289 --> 03:02:07,720
money into to take over and as long as

4194
03:02:04,510 --> 03:02:09,129
we can you gather and and and organize

4195
03:02:07,719 --> 03:02:11,438
in that way and you know kind of keep

4196
03:02:09,129 --> 03:02:13,540
that code of conduct on that high level

4197
03:02:11,439 --> 03:02:16,569
of integrity then I think we can also

4198
03:02:13,540 --> 03:02:18,400
you know in a way all kind of all boats

4199
03:02:16,569 --> 03:02:20,079
rise with the hot with the tide you know

4200
03:02:18,399 --> 03:02:21,399
and and we can come up Walt

4201
03:02:20,079 --> 03:02:22,539
you know they make their efforts but I

4202
03:02:21,399 --> 03:02:24,010
think a lot of those efforts are gonna

4203
03:02:22,540 --> 03:02:26,050
fall short and gonna fail

4204
03:02:24,010 --> 03:02:29,170
you know deploying that much capital to

4205
03:02:26,049 --> 03:02:31,629
scale cannabis businesses across so many

4206
03:02:29,170 --> 03:02:35,559
states and so many places I mean it's so

4207
03:02:31,629 --> 03:02:37,029
hard to grow fire herb and and subdue so

4208
03:02:35,559 --> 03:02:38,379
it's hubris thinking you're just gonna

4209
03:02:37,030 --> 03:02:41,890
mono crop it bigger than you've ever

4210
03:02:38,379 --> 03:02:43,239
gone without even ever having to go

4211
03:02:41,889 --> 03:02:45,039
through the understanding and issues of

4212
03:02:43,239 --> 03:02:47,559
all the pests and although you know it's

4213
03:02:45,040 --> 03:02:50,350
it's a futile effort and I think again

4214
03:02:47,559 --> 03:02:51,520
ultimately the plants control us and you

4215
03:02:50,350 --> 03:02:53,200
know the people with integrity that have

4216
03:02:51,521 --> 03:02:54,909
taken care of it Altima to come up as

4217
03:02:53,200 --> 03:02:59,550
long as we you know or they'll do stay

4218
03:02:54,909 --> 03:03:04,149
resilient and that said I wanna offer

4219
03:02:59,549 --> 03:03:16,679
universal shares in my company Universal

4220
03:03:04,149 --> 03:03:24,369
cannabis you just sold 8 billion shares

4221
03:03:16,680 --> 03:03:30,729
I got a quarter right here and that's 25

4222
03:03:24,370 --> 03:03:33,430
mil mark I got an eighth oh wait no I

4223
03:03:30,729 --> 03:03:33,939
mean history doesn't not only repeat

4224
03:03:33,430 --> 03:03:36,550
itself

4225
03:03:33,940 --> 03:03:40,210
history rhymes right we're think about

4226
03:03:36,549 --> 03:03:43,779
the end of alcohol prohibition the eve

4227
03:03:40,209 --> 03:03:46,449
of the end of alcohol prohibition in in

4228
03:03:43,780 --> 03:03:48,400
the US right and when they realized that

4229
03:03:46,450 --> 03:03:51,460
prohibition wasn't going to work anymore

4230
03:03:48,399 --> 03:03:53,529
and yeah I became a regulated distal and

4231
03:03:51,459 --> 03:03:55,719
all that [ __ ] but ultimately look

4232
03:03:53,530 --> 03:03:58,170
what it washed up to now you know yeah

4233
03:03:55,719 --> 03:04:01,659
there's Budweiser and there's these huge

4234
03:03:58,170 --> 03:04:03,899
manufacturers of all this swill crappy

4235
03:04:01,659 --> 03:04:08,200
product but there's this great

4236
03:04:03,899 --> 03:04:11,829
incredible craft beer industry and craft

4237
03:04:08,200 --> 03:04:14,350
distiller industry that will come along

4238
03:04:11,829 --> 03:04:17,440
with cannabis I think as long as there's

4239
03:04:14,350 --> 03:04:19,540
a consumer for it and as long as there's

4240
03:04:17,440 --> 03:04:22,180
enthusiasts like us and the people who

4241
03:04:19,540 --> 03:04:23,290
watch has Church I mean certainly like

4242
03:04:22,180 --> 03:04:25,540
yeah

4243
03:04:23,290 --> 03:04:26,739
just think of it like tomatoes right you

4244
03:04:25,540 --> 03:04:28,479
can grow your own to me

4245
03:04:26,738 --> 03:04:31,118
but you can go to the place and buy

4246
03:04:28,478 --> 03:04:32,679
tomatoes and that place is regulated by

4247
03:04:31,119 --> 03:04:35,020
the Department of Health and there's got

4248
03:04:32,680 --> 03:04:37,509
to be ISO certified blah blah blah

4249
03:04:35,020 --> 03:04:39,850
whatever ultimately that's where we're

4250
03:04:37,509 --> 03:04:42,430
gone it's going to be unregulated

4251
03:04:39,850 --> 03:04:44,918
completely it's gonna be like a craft

4252
03:04:42,430 --> 03:04:47,129
beer industry for the connoisseurs

4253
03:04:44,918 --> 03:04:50,378
there'll always be good high-quality

4254
03:04:47,129 --> 03:04:52,810
artisan cannabis and cannabis products

4255
03:04:50,379 --> 03:04:55,539
available just like there are really

4256
03:04:52,809 --> 03:04:59,259
heavy beers when it'll be good to beat

4257
03:04:55,539 --> 03:05:01,720
like sort of geographically specific to

4258
03:04:59,259 --> 03:05:05,199
those areas just like the heady beers

4259
03:05:01,719 --> 03:05:08,048
from Pacific Northwest and Colorado and

4260
03:05:05,199 --> 03:05:11,588
the ones in Virginia and elsewhere I

4261
03:05:08,049 --> 03:05:13,180
mean it's just it's a great analogy and

4262
03:05:11,588 --> 03:05:13,658
I think that's how things are gonna roll

4263
03:05:13,180 --> 03:05:15,908
out

4264
03:05:13,658 --> 03:05:17,949
well I want to understand degree there

4265
03:05:15,908 --> 03:05:20,588
mark and I really appreciate I

4266
03:05:17,949 --> 03:05:22,930
appreciate the I'm so much am grateful

4267
03:05:20,588 --> 03:05:25,418
to be part of this and just the level of

4268
03:05:22,930 --> 03:05:28,209
thought and understanding among all all

4269
03:05:25,418 --> 03:05:29,350
the hash church elders I'm really

4270
03:05:28,209 --> 03:05:31,329
grateful to even be part of this

4271
03:05:29,350 --> 03:05:32,379
conversation but you know did one one

4272
03:05:31,328 --> 03:05:33,728
thought on that you know I've been

4273
03:05:32,379 --> 03:05:35,319
wrestling with this quite a bit you know

4274
03:05:33,728 --> 03:05:37,448
with especially this whole hemp movement

4275
03:05:35,318 --> 03:05:39,158
and the conversation of make him again

4276
03:05:37,449 --> 03:05:41,379
you know in the conversion of all these

4277
03:05:39,158 --> 03:05:44,048
mono crop kind of it you know cottage

4278
03:05:41,379 --> 03:05:45,879
super contaminated spaces you know now

4279
03:05:44,049 --> 03:05:47,770
growing kind of CBD for human

4280
03:05:45,879 --> 03:05:49,869
consumption ultimately that could it be

4281
03:05:47,770 --> 03:05:52,119
bombed over the counter it's you know

4282
03:05:49,869 --> 03:05:54,789
buy a new kind of EP outfit P DEP

4283
03:05:52,119 --> 03:05:56,770
pediatric epilepsy patient you know it's

4284
03:05:54,789 --> 03:05:58,748
like there's you know and and obviously

4285
03:05:56,770 --> 03:06:01,119
I said what I'm about to say - I say so

4286
03:05:58,748 --> 03:06:03,668
fully mindful that I have a vested

4287
03:06:01,119 --> 03:06:05,259
interest in a testing laboratory but but

4288
03:06:03,668 --> 03:06:07,568
where I'm coming from and speaking from

4289
03:06:05,259 --> 03:06:09,430
is you know passionate servant to this

4290
03:06:07,568 --> 03:06:11,318
plant and seeing you know the botany of

4291
03:06:09,430 --> 03:06:13,720
desire the whole this whole you know

4292
03:06:11,318 --> 03:06:15,368
coevolution that's taking place you know

4293
03:06:13,719 --> 03:06:17,708
from us cultivating this plant and this

4294
03:06:15,369 --> 03:06:19,270
plant ultimately cultivating us you know

4295
03:06:17,709 --> 03:06:20,560
I think a great purpose of this plant is

4296
03:06:19,270 --> 03:06:22,959
really you know again this

4297
03:06:20,559 --> 03:06:24,458
bioaccumulation story it's to help bring

4298
03:06:22,959 --> 03:06:26,350
to the surface you know these are

4299
03:06:24,459 --> 03:06:27,999
invisible unknowns that you know are

4300
03:06:26,350 --> 03:06:30,039
important for us to restore human health

4301
03:06:27,998 --> 03:06:32,228
and and wellness you know which kind of

4302
03:06:30,039 --> 03:06:36,039
is such a parrot of but food is even

4303
03:06:32,228 --> 03:06:37,868
bigger a part of you know it's a food

4304
03:06:36,039 --> 03:06:40,100
grown in America

4305
03:06:37,869 --> 03:06:43,310
what percentage

4306
03:06:40,100 --> 03:06:47,390
the people that eat the food eat organic

4307
03:06:43,309 --> 03:06:49,488
food sure I wonder what I understand

4308
03:06:47,389 --> 03:06:51,889
that and and I won't understand degree

4309
03:06:49,488 --> 03:06:54,559
but does that mean that those people

4310
03:06:51,889 --> 03:06:57,198
aren't being poisoned you know when I

4311
03:06:54,559 --> 03:07:01,309
think they are being poisoned but my

4312
03:06:57,199 --> 03:07:04,550
question is I think that we are a small

4313
03:07:01,309 --> 03:07:06,738
market yeah well okay yeah no I agree

4314
03:07:04,549 --> 03:07:09,858
but we have the chance with this plant

4315
03:07:06,738 --> 03:07:11,779
coevolving us to radically affect and

4316
03:07:09,859 --> 03:07:14,209
disrupt agriculture to begin a process

4317
03:07:11,779 --> 03:07:19,879
to make food medicine again even though

4318
03:07:14,209 --> 03:07:23,140
whereas medicine is lead me to organic

4319
03:07:19,879 --> 03:07:26,419
living living soil and biodynamic

4320
03:07:23,139 --> 03:07:30,288
organic growing I was a farmer like that

4321
03:07:26,418 --> 03:07:31,578
before a group sure but my just just

4322
03:07:30,289 --> 03:07:33,109
follow me though on this thought you

4323
03:07:31,578 --> 03:07:34,939
know because this is the big a big kind

4324
03:07:33,109 --> 03:07:37,309
of you know thought I've been working on

4325
03:07:34,939 --> 03:07:39,168
and in my mind and reconciling just you

4326
03:07:37,309 --> 03:07:41,510
know in the service I'm I'm working on

4327
03:07:39,168 --> 03:07:43,039
on behalf of this plant now yeah I feel

4328
03:07:41,510 --> 03:07:45,408
like this plants a storyteller you know

4329
03:07:43,039 --> 03:07:47,270
through these regulations you we've put

4330
03:07:45,408 --> 03:07:48,859
on it it's telling the story just a

4331
03:07:47,270 --> 03:07:50,300
great story about what's happens to

4332
03:07:48,859 --> 03:07:51,738
legacy what's happened to land legacy

4333
03:07:50,299 --> 03:07:53,358
what's happened to our food system you

4334
03:07:51,738 --> 03:07:55,338
know the legacy of like helping to you

4335
03:07:53,359 --> 03:07:57,640
know deal with all these lawsuits in

4336
03:07:55,338 --> 03:07:59,988
effect right now around Monsanto like

4337
03:07:57,639 --> 03:08:02,118
12,000 lawsuits or empire state creating

4338
03:07:59,988 --> 03:08:03,859
cancer in people's life you know there's

4339
03:08:02,119 --> 03:08:06,039
this moment of awakening that's taking

4340
03:08:03,859 --> 03:08:09,168
place and cannabis can help with it yeah

4341
03:08:06,039 --> 03:08:10,279
this is Ayurvedic quickly when when diet

4342
03:08:09,168 --> 03:08:12,978
is in order

4343
03:08:10,279 --> 03:08:13,789
medicine is not of no need when diet is

4344
03:08:12,978 --> 03:08:16,398
out of order

4345
03:08:13,789 --> 03:08:19,010
medicine is of no use so you no matter

4346
03:08:16,398 --> 03:08:21,078
how much this medicine of cannabis can

4347
03:08:19,010 --> 03:08:23,629
help heal our body in our life and

4348
03:08:21,078 --> 03:08:25,878
repent we don't first change our diet

4349
03:08:23,629 --> 03:08:27,949
and radically remove the chemicals and

4350
03:08:25,879 --> 03:08:29,629
the poisons that are destroying our

4351
03:08:27,949 --> 03:08:31,430
microbiome that are creating the

4352
03:08:29,629 --> 03:08:33,499
systemic inflammation that's creating

4353
03:08:31,430 --> 03:08:35,088
the all the illness you know then you

4354
03:08:33,498 --> 03:08:36,588
know we're you what are we doing on

4355
03:08:35,088 --> 03:08:40,068
behalf of this plant there's all this

4356
03:08:36,588 --> 03:08:41,779
place to innovate make money and and and

4357
03:08:40,068 --> 03:08:44,118
you know what else is it's it's to help

4358
03:08:41,779 --> 03:08:46,850
change the world you know and and part

4359
03:08:44,119 --> 03:08:48,409
of that is to through the transparency

4360
03:08:46,850 --> 03:08:49,908
of what now you know because the

4361
03:08:48,408 --> 03:08:51,439
cannabis is the first crop that's ever

4362
03:08:49,908 --> 03:08:53,909
been regulated on this level every other

4363
03:08:51,439 --> 03:08:55,950
AG crop has been fully deer

4364
03:08:53,909 --> 03:08:57,360
everything has been so deregulated to

4365
03:08:55,950 --> 03:08:59,130
the point where our entire food system

4366
03:08:57,360 --> 03:09:01,079
is compromised and is poisoning us

4367
03:08:59,129 --> 03:09:03,449
pointing our children is poisoning lives

4368
03:09:01,079 --> 03:09:05,250
and and and and then the people that are

4369
03:09:03,450 --> 03:09:06,870
making the pesticides are the same

4370
03:09:05,250 --> 03:09:07,530
people selling the medicines through the

4371
03:09:06,870 --> 03:09:09,930
pharmacy

4372
03:09:07,530 --> 03:09:12,210
Bayer you know that are then kind of

4373
03:09:09,930 --> 03:09:15,000
like healing the ill which is just this

4374
03:09:12,209 --> 03:09:16,648
like the aren't people being farmed you

4375
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:18,930
know like from the poisons in the food

4376
03:09:16,648 --> 03:09:20,459
so the by going to the doctor taking the

4377
03:09:18,930 --> 03:09:22,829
pharmacy that's then making him sicker

4378
03:09:20,459 --> 03:09:24,509
and and it says it's an endless cycle

4379
03:09:22,829 --> 03:09:25,920
and I feel like with cannabis we're

4380
03:09:24,510 --> 03:09:27,659
disrupting that you know we bring this

4381
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:29,460
to the service it's helping to set an

4382
03:09:27,659 --> 03:09:31,260
example of food and change but and and

4383
03:09:29,459 --> 03:09:32,459
here's my last chlorine then this is the

4384
03:09:31,260 --> 03:09:35,130
biggest thing I was actually just trying

4385
03:09:32,459 --> 03:09:37,349
to say it's like I think we we have to

4386
03:09:35,129 --> 03:09:39,059
have this eternal vigilance you know as

4387
03:09:37,350 --> 03:09:42,180
leadership and elders in the cannabis

4388
03:09:39,059 --> 03:09:44,369
community to uphold this minimum quality

4389
03:09:42,180 --> 03:09:46,139
standard that have been put in place so

4390
03:09:44,370 --> 03:09:48,329
that we can kind of not only have a

4391
03:09:46,139 --> 03:09:50,430
barrier of entry for like you know the

4392
03:09:48,329 --> 03:09:52,680
thousand million acres in the Midwest

4393
03:09:50,430 --> 03:09:54,689
that you know the mega farms with the

4394
03:09:52,680 --> 03:09:56,639
super tractors or harvesting all the GMO

4395
03:09:54,689 --> 03:09:58,770
wheat it's like for them to just be able

4396
03:09:56,639 --> 03:10:00,478
to shift and grow CBD but then

4397
03:09:58,770 --> 03:10:03,000
ultimately is gonna go to children or

4398
03:10:00,478 --> 03:10:04,920
autistic people and patients or any

4399
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:06,659
other person that's looking for cannabis

4400
03:10:04,920 --> 03:10:08,670
to help them it's like if we don't

4401
03:10:06,659 --> 03:10:11,100
uphold this minimum level of quality and

4402
03:10:08,670 --> 03:10:12,870
set the example for national

4403
03:10:11,100 --> 03:10:15,059
conversations around legalization and

4404
03:10:12,870 --> 03:10:16,680
what anybody has to meet if they want to

4405
03:10:15,059 --> 03:10:18,898
participate in the drug market of

4406
03:10:16,680 --> 03:10:21,450
selling medicine all cannabis to people

4407
03:10:18,898 --> 03:10:23,549
and patients through you know over big

4408
03:10:21,450 --> 03:10:26,130
box stores and Whole Foods it's like if

4409
03:10:23,549 --> 03:10:27,509
we don't uphold and set the example you

4410
03:10:26,129 --> 03:10:29,339
know like I mean Canada went even

4411
03:10:27,510 --> 03:10:31,439
stricter than California but there's

4412
03:10:29,340 --> 03:10:34,260
this there's this integrity I think with

4413
03:10:31,439 --> 03:10:37,800
the testing model that's helping to not

4414
03:10:34,260 --> 03:10:38,939
only hold any and everybody accountable

4415
03:10:37,799 --> 03:10:40,949
that wants to come in and take their

4416
03:10:38,939 --> 03:10:44,100
piece of cannabis but it's also helping

4417
03:10:40,950 --> 03:10:46,829
to create the path for this radical

4418
03:10:44,100 --> 03:10:49,229
revolution of Agriculture and Riaan

4419
03:10:46,829 --> 03:10:50,520
small farming kind of you know back to

4420
03:10:49,228 --> 03:10:52,319
you know and then and that's the rant

4421
03:10:50,520 --> 03:10:54,810
and I apologize but I just wanted to

4422
03:10:52,319 --> 03:10:58,110
have a lot more faith in common sense

4423
03:10:54,809 --> 03:11:00,989
and people's goodness than I do I think

4424
03:10:58,110 --> 03:11:04,460
people are incredibly clumsy and stupid

4425
03:11:00,989 --> 03:11:04,459
don't lose the hope broke

4426
03:11:07,250 --> 03:11:12,719
now I appreciate the perspective for

4427
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:14,850
sure I need to do a few things quick

4428
03:11:12,719 --> 03:11:16,648
because we're over the 12 o'clock thing

4429
03:11:14,850 --> 03:11:21,029
and I gotta go here soon but I needed to

4430
03:11:16,648 --> 03:11:23,549
ask Sam in regards to purchasing stream

4431
03:11:21,029 --> 03:11:28,790
out of the UK do you remember which one

4432
03:11:23,549 --> 03:11:33,269
the 43 T was in micron yeah

4433
03:11:28,790 --> 03:11:36,120
43 s were very small like a full size

4434
03:11:33,270 --> 03:11:39,720
like 40 50 micron or something or more

4435
03:11:36,120 --> 03:11:42,510
like 70 I don't remember if it was the

4436
03:11:39,719 --> 03:11:47,818
thread measurement per centimeter or

4437
03:11:42,510 --> 03:11:51,029
inch or person ask is wrong cuz we did

4438
03:11:47,818 --> 03:11:51,689
not she he wrote all that [ __ ] down and

4439
03:11:51,029 --> 03:11:55,700
me

4440
03:11:51,689 --> 03:11:59,189
all's I did I remembered that you know a

4441
03:11:55,700 --> 03:12:03,930
77 is what you wanted for collected

4442
03:11:59,189 --> 03:12:05,880
resin and a 43 is what you put on top on

4443
03:12:03,930 --> 03:12:07,648
top of when you learn to get rid of

4444
03:12:05,879 --> 03:12:10,679
everything that's too small to be good

4445
03:12:07,648 --> 03:12:16,579
right so it was probably a 70 micron 43

4446
03:12:10,680 --> 03:12:16,579
is 70 and then the 77 is like 150 or 160

4447
03:12:16,850 --> 03:12:21,540
microti or whatever that has to do with

4448
03:12:19,469 --> 03:12:23,340
the thickness of the thread yeah the

4449
03:12:21,540 --> 03:12:26,040
thread diameter exactly and that

4450
03:12:23,340 --> 03:12:29,460
determines the ratio of hole versus the

4451
03:12:26,040 --> 03:12:32,279
ratio of screen on the surface area mark

4452
03:12:29,459 --> 03:12:34,108
I believe it's lines LPI lines per inch

4453
03:12:32,279 --> 03:12:41,700
so the greater number the greater

4454
03:12:34,109 --> 03:12:43,859
threads per we have lines per inch and

4455
03:12:41,700 --> 03:12:47,430
mesh are the same LPI and mesh are the

4456
03:12:43,859 --> 03:12:49,939
same but the T's and the S is the 43 s

4457
03:12:47,430 --> 03:12:54,229
and the 77s from the UK is some other

4458
03:12:49,939 --> 03:12:54,229
Rando super like huh

4459
03:12:57,209 --> 03:13:12,709
I used to buy a twist 9 bolt and twist

4460
03:13:00,689 --> 03:13:15,090
poly Mon 77 either an S or a tea trees

4461
03:13:12,709 --> 03:13:16,919
okay well I just wanted to get that off

4462
03:13:15,090 --> 03:13:19,409
then I also wanted to say a shout out

4463
03:13:16,920 --> 03:13:21,420
and maybe a bong rip because this

4464
03:13:19,409 --> 03:13:24,180
probably be the last thing I say today

4465
03:13:21,420 --> 03:13:26,129
to one of our longtime like since the

4466
03:13:24,180 --> 03:13:29,280
beginning of hash Church she was there

4467
03:13:26,129 --> 03:13:32,609
in the chat room he went by a pot smoker

4468
03:13:29,280 --> 03:13:35,340
and I guess he pet he passed away

4469
03:13:32,610 --> 03:13:37,500
recently so he's we thought we would

4470
03:13:35,340 --> 03:13:38,940
give him a nice little send-off thanks

4471
03:13:37,500 --> 03:13:43,440
for being a part of the hash church

4472
03:13:38,940 --> 03:13:45,510
community bro sorry to see you go but I

4473
03:13:43,440 --> 03:13:48,810
guess we all have an expiry date so

03:13:45,510 --> 03:13:49,500
let's puff a little bowl for a pot

4475
03:13:48,810 --> 03:14:00,000
smoker
