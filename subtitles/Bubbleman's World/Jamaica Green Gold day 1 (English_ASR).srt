patient that was about 8 months old who

31
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:26,359

32
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,320
splitting the hemispheres of her brain

33
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,920
and they used uh cannabis oil and

34
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,798
juicing to literally shrink the tumor

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,799
out of existence and uh and save her

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,600

I have that toque in my suitcase he

56
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,519
forgot it in Barcelona I'm bringing it

57
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,800
back don't you want to hear where the

58
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:44,280
story

59
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,280
is

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,280
I

61
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,959
[Music]

62
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,759
smell it's not can't give any bad

63
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,598
effects it's just flow

64
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:04,798
smells I

65
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,839
right it's deliming so we we eat a lot

66
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,439
of citrus we eat a lot of fruit so

67
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,239
that's a turkey lot of oranges in

68
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,799
Jamaica a lot of oranges here so that

69
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,799
vitamin C is carrying a modulator which

70
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,799
is called a turpine and that turpine

71
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,319
that's present in fruit helps as a

72
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,640
catalyst or push that vitamin C into

73
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:25,119
your body so cannabis has all of the

74
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:29,839
world's fruits and vegetables

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,920
tury smell broccoli cauliflower citrus

76
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,719
wood sandal fuel all those things are

77
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,719
found in cannabis because cannabis is

78
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,680
older than most of the fruits so you

79
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,000
look back 30 million years it survived

80
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,640
catastrophic events it's migrated All

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,840
Around the World in different elevations

82
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,479
and different temperatures and it

83
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,598
created 88 different land races it's one

84
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,878
of the only four plants on Earth that

85
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:52,798
can self-generate pollinate through air

86
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,719
as well so that means if you went into

87
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,159
survival mode it can actually produce

88
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,840
its own seeds and and reproduce said

89
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:02,798
self preservation self preservation so

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,560
even the ocean went down to 96%

91
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,000
catastrophic events before when we've

92
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,039
had meters and different things hit our

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,519
planet cannabis hemp has survived that

94
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:14,560
self-preservation so there is a self bu

95
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,040
man here I am now in the main conference

96

evening good

195
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:21,958
[Music]

196
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:25,639
evening I I I thought about

197
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:27,039
the the hand clap just now and I I

198
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,958
thought I would be a little bit more

199
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:33,599
popular

200
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:35,719
than than that especially

201
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,320
because and I know the foreigners who

202
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:44,360
are with us won't appreciate this but I

203
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:46,200
did give asent to the use of the term

204
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,399
green

205
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,120
C

206
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,120
green all right

207
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,399
okay it's been a long day

208
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,639
I I thought that you know I could have

209
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,640
put

210
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:12,958
orange um so so I am color blind in

211
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,959
relation to the topic and I'm sure you

212
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,599
will all forgive me because I just

213
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:21,759
stepped out of cabinet and will return

214
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:27,920
in a moment to continue the business of

215
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:30,838
this state but of course this is such a

216
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:34,519
tremendous program that we are embarked

217
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,279
on not for the first time but certainly

218
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,519
as we celebrate Science and Technology

219
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,879
Innovation

220
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,320
months I think it is very significant

221
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,399
that the

222
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,760
government the

223
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:51,958
SRC is

224
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,958
sponsoring this

225
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,839
discussion it is true

226
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,240
that the word

227
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,720
ganam used to one that the government

228
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,720
would stay very far

229
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:12,559
from but the time has come in fact many

230
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:15,479
of you will agree with me that the time

231
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,278
has come long ago and we are really

232
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,519
catching

233
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,519
up the energy inside is very very

234
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:32,519
low you know um there's a person outside

235
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,519
who are a little

236
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,319
higher and I'm not sure if it's

237
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:44,399
the outside that is not filtering I know

238
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,399
the words I'm using

239
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,319
filtering they're not catching on

240
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,519
all this is truly

241
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:59,560
historic and the month has started with

242
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,600
our prime minister reconstituted in the

243
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:03,359
National Commission of Science and

244
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,560
Technology and I think that is very

245
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,200
significant

246
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,679
[Applause]

247
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
because for a number of years the

248
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:15,759
commission

249
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:21,160
was in the do jum wasn't meeting and we

250
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:24,399
have now enabled a fine grouping of

251
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:26,958
stakeholders representing government

252
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,559
Academia the private sector coming

253
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:33,278
together to recognize that with without

254
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:37,278
science and technology and the big eye

255
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:39,600
what is the big eye Innovation then all

256
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:44,159
the talk about

257
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,839
growth about come 2017 to be able to

258
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,078
walk away from the

259
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,600
IMF because we are growing because jobs

260
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,198
are being created then all of that will

261
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,440
come to

262
00:12:53,198 --> 00:13:00,120
not and that we now need to become

263
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,199
totally preoccupied

264
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,078
with

265
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:08,479
growth and I'm so pleased that in

266
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:13,479
her first statement to the

267
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:17,440
council she presented on neut

268
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:21,159
neutral or cultural

269
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,800
Industries and the Jamaican

270
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,799
brand the Jamaican

271
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:33,519
brand many of us are still unclear

272
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,399
but we

273
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,919
accept as gospel because it has been

274
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:46,000
proven there is something in our

275
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:46,000
flavors there is something about our

276
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:54,120
herbs you prefer herbs

277
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:56,919
herbs there is something about where we

278
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,679
are located perhaps something in the

279
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:02,000
soil so regardless of the L

280
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:06,838
opportunities we've had with

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,759
ganja Jamaica has a famous

282
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,880
brand and that brand will

283
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,278
outstrip and forgive me the foreigners

284
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,480
who are here but it will outstrip

285
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:21,000
Colorado can't come near our

286
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,680
brand and all those other

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,198
states

288
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:29,719
that are now through their internal

289
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:32,399
democracy recognizing the

290
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:38,440
value of this

291
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,440
crop and we will not be left behind

292
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,120
anymore I'm very glad that I'm the

293
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,040
minister of

294
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,759
science technology and

295
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:56,559
Innovation because I think the time has

296
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,639
come and you know I take risks I not the

297
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,278
way we're going to get this country to

298
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:03,440
go you win some you lose some but you

299
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,439
have to do things you have to do

300
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:11,359
things there is no way we are going to

301
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,839
be able to move

302
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,120
quicker quickly as a country to secure

303
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:22,519
this growth that we are aiming at if we

304
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,839
don't go out and play some Strokes those

305
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,720
of you are foreigners you don't

306
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,680
understand Cricket but we love to hit

307
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,959
sixes when

308
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:35,120
because it

309
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,838
represents scoring you can be in the

310
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,198
Wicket and be

311
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:44,040
safe and be comfortable when you go out

312
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:45,719
there to play the runs you're likely to

313
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:50,198
lose your Wicket

314
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:54,120
butt sometimes luck prayers but the

315
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:57,318
courage to go forward and to take the

316
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,000
risk and this I think is a risk the

317
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:04,318
staging of this discussion but more

318
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,759
importantly moving rapidly now to ensure

319
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:09,958
that the regulatory

320
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,159
framework is in place and we no longer

321
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:15,198
need to

322
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:17,559
be looking for Perfection let not

323
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,599
Perfection be the enemy of the good let

324
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:22,719
us start something and we can build on

325
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,959
it and already we're seeing many models

326
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,920
that we can look at but there is going

327
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,879
to be an inherent Jamaican model that we

328
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:34,360
we could export to the world I'm talk

329
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,360
about the model

330
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:41,600
um all right

331
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,040
um on Wednesday we are going to be

332
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,600
celebrating we are going to be

333
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,958
celebrating those members of our

334
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,800
scientific

335
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:52,518
Community who have

336
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,159
excelled you

337
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:58,440
know there's nothing wrong with having

338
00:16:55,159 --> 00:17:02,078
Awards function for the artists and the

339
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,519
sports people they deserve it but why

340
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:09,078
should we not be celebrating similarly

341
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:09,078
the achievements of our scientists our

342
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,679
technology and and so people ask so

343
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,480
Minister why you spend this money to

344
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,720
celebrate why you dressing up in Black

345
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:25,519
Tie to come and to proclaim the success

346
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:28,318
of our people I have no apology for that

347
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:32,240
I think it's going to be those people

348
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:36,918
and those of us who understand that

349
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:39,679
until we start to add value to what we

350
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:40,720
produce at a basic level until we become

351
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,880
totally

352
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,279
consumed about

353
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,320
outperforming the people in

354
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:51,879
Colorado in this

355
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,200
area until we recognize that it's a

356
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,600
global

357
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,558
village and we can't exist in the

358
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:02,719
comfort of a local market but but to

359
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:04,599
understand that everything is everything

360
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,798
and that we now have to compete with the

361
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:09,240
world and

362
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:13,679
Jamaicans can when we are ready I'm so

469
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,519

the agency's mandate to popularize

474
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,679

478
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,159
the March towards the modernization of

479
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:43,759
our S&amp;T forums and based on this

480
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:47,679
conference theme Splendid prospects lie

481
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:50,919
before us we must on a national level

482
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,679
avidly pursue Agricultural Development

483
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:57,080
as a multidisciplinary concept that

484
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,519
encompasses the economic social

485
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:00,960
institutional and phys physical elements

486
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,119
of

487
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,000
development this exciting for forum is

488
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:08,319
entirely dedicated to recent

489
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,839
developments in medicinal marijuana and

490
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,960
related natural products

491
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:16,759
Technologies it is amazing to think of

492
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,038
all the work that have been done and

493
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:22,519
that of and also of all the work that's

494
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:26,440
left ahead of us in terms of mining our

495
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:29,119
green gold institutions can participate

496
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,080
companies and of course individual

497
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,759
entrepreneurs but the thrust that has

498
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:36,798
been put in over the last few years

499
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:39,558
stands as a testimony that these groups

500
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:41,879
are prepared for the Long Haul for

501
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:44,359
success for our country and also for

502
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,720
their own business enterprises and that

503
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,158
is going to seed development for this

504
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,919
country and

505
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,120
others the conference committee has put

506
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:54,600
together a truly unique program that

507
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,959
addresses the Innovations being

508
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:58,480
undertaken in the industry for example

509
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,278
when you look at the program you're

510
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,038
looking at multiple eras in medicinal

511
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:07,519
marijuana which will be discussed uses

512
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:10,038
of raw cannabis the cosmical industry

513
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,200
and by extension how to create wealth

514
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:14,278
from all this

515
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,360
research we're going to cover a number

516
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:18,880
of areas and questions are encouraged

517
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:21,398
during the next two

518
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,399
days over the few days the lineup of

519
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:25,719
plary presentations will be delivered by

520
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:28,038
locally and internationally renowned

521
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,159
experts in their areas of specialities

522
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:32,038
and it is anticipated that this

523
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,880
conference will be a platform for

524
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:37,720
sharing and discussing not only their

525
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,679
ideas but your own research with these

526
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,038
key persons many of these topics are at

527
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,519
the top of the Innovation list and we

528
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:47,839
cannot stress that Innovation must be

529
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,558
seen as one of the main solutions for

530
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,398
overcoming

531
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:54,639
poverty it is my Earnest request that

532
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:57,719
you make use of this time to explore

533
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,480
ideas and Concepts listen with an air

534
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,919
tuned to seeing how you too can partake

535
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,319
in this industry and create those

536
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,840
networking linkages that lead to the

537
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:10,480
creative development of ideas beyond the

538
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,798
phase of just discussion but instead

539
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,480
translating those into working

540
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:18,079
prototypes to take to

541
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,798
market last but not least as I offer you

542
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,319
greetings I would like to thank our main

543
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,398
sponsor there are a number of sponsors

544
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,918
but this particular sponsor Jamaica

545
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:30,239
broilers without them we could not have

546
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,240
had this conference and they

547
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:39,240
graciously in addition a special mention

548
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,079
must be made of all the organizing and

549
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,200
scientific committee members for their

550
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:45,240
contribution to the organizing of this

551
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,440
conference I hope the next few days

552
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,759
we'll be filled and filled with

553
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,759
information and in fact prove inspiring

554
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,879
and transformative to you all and I hope

555
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:57,000
that he will impart your knowledge and

556
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,240
on that note I thank you and wish you a

557
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,240
very good evening

558
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:07,600
[Applause]

559
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,599
thank you so much Miss Miss Mage

560
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,720
and coming on the heels of that we say

561
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,918
we bid ad do to our

562
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,919
Minister all

563
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:23,759
right remember you're on the orange side

564
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,759
when you go back to

565
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,360
Parliament all right at this time we're

566
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,440
going to get the overview of the

567
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:34,879
conference and Exposition for this year

568
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,038
now just so that we don't confuse it and

569
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,039
for those of you who may not know it's

570
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:44,200
said to be the third banal but it what

571
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:46,798
it actually means is that since 2008 it

572
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,319
has become a banal event but the

573
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,720
conference has actually been going on

574
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,839
since

575
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,360
1987 so when we say third it don't mean

576
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:56,720
that it's in its infancy and it's just

577
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:59,000
starting it means that they just changed

578
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,600
the rotation a little bit so that they

579
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,119
do it every two years so they have more

580
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,798
money to spend and give us food when we

581
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:07,798
come like you know sit down at the

582
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:09,398
Pegasus and eat but it is it has been

583
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:11,798
going on for quite some time and it

584
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:14,319
shows its strength in the fact that it

585
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:16,440
continues to grow so we're looking

586
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:18,960
forward to more things and just so that

587
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,840
we understand what's happening for this

588
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,399
conference the overview will be

589
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:29,678
delivered by Mr Hawthorne Watson the

590
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:29,678
acting executive director of the SRC

591
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,960
in the interest of

592
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:47,000
time may I say all

593
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,640
protocols

594
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,880
observed first I think I would want to

595
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:56,080
put the theme of the conference in some

596
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,760
sort of

597
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:02,519
context and in that regard

598
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:04,720
I'm very proud to note that this Little

599
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,159
Rock of fors called

600
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,360
Jamaica ranks

601
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,278
fifth imp plant

602
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:19,439
biodiversity among Island States through

603
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:19,440
the world I think Jamaica deserves a own

604
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:32,720
for and in furtherance of that you'll

605
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:36,440
find that it is three of some 160 plants

606
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,919
identified with medicinal properties are

607
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,720
actually found in this island I think

608
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:42,720
Jamaica needs to be big up

609
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:49,519
again many of these we know about you

610
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,158
know

611
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,519
folklore and our Bush

612
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,440
medicine but we

613
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:01,640
scientists like to look upon the plants

614
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:06,000
and the extracts As Natural Products

615
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,000
because they grow naturally they grow in

616
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:16,839
nature as a lecturer and

617
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:19,079
examiner I am known to be very miserly

618
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:19,079
with

619
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,200
marks

620
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:25,798
however there's a

621
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,960
certain

622
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:31,278
special Jamaican natural products

623
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,240
product

624
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:37,410
rather that I would not hesitate to give

625
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:47,000
a high

626
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:49,038
[Applause]

627
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,839
grade and

628
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:54,599
especially when you consider the ground

629
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:59,359
swell of

630
00:30:54,599 --> 00:31:01,599
Interest by several nations in varieties

631
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,119
which are not nearly as

632
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:07,199
good and take into

633
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:11,638
account sandre

634
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:14,480
gupta's experience on his own road to

635
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:17,359
Damascus where he was converted to

636
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,360
radical

637
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:24,679
ganism hence the theme green gold

638
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:28,558
medicinal ganja and other natural

639
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:30,480
products a potential source of wealth we

640
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,558
didn't add for Jamaican but you really

641
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,399
mean for Jamaican and in fact wider

642
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:40,769

00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:22,639
2014 when both sides of the houses of

974

changes in the ganja law ganja has

975
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:31,719
become a UNIF by en forceing the land

976
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:35,679
where political tribalism thrives it is

977
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:38,039
important to also pay tribute to The

978
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:41,078

979

new regime for ganja in

981
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:51,880
Jamaica however the minister is not here

982
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:55,838
but he needs to look at the Jamaica

983
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:58,680
constabulary Act and the excessive power

984
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:02,159
the police force hold in the war against

985
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:04,919
ganja and this more brutal application

986
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:08,598
against lass people in

987
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:12,480
Jamaica I would also like to pay tribute

988
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:14,880
to the thousands of Jamaica Jamaicans

989
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,039
mainly from the lower class and the

990
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,358
rastafarai community who suffered the

991
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:22,679
brunt of the

992
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:26,880
Injustice I personally know many young

friends were turned into criminals

995
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,559
because they were found with a single

996
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,960
ganja

state to legalize ganja Washington DC

1019
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:53,160
also voted in support of

1020
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:56,000
legalization in addition less well known

1021
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:59,199
is that several cities and towns across

1022
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,838
the unit United States also backed moves

1023
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:05,879
to allow ganja smoking within their own

1024
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:09,759
bound boundaries voters in two

1025
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:13,119
major conurbations in New Mexico

1026
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,400
Albuquerque and Santa Fe also

1027
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:19,280
overwhelmingly back to changing the law

1028
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:22,639
in doing so the towns have set local

1029
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,720
police the local police in a quandre

1030
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:27,920
with officers having to choose whether

1031
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:31,318
to continue to enforce state laws

1032
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:35,240
Banning marijuana are local statutes

1033
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:37,199
which allow it the result is a patchwork

1034
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:40,239
situation with police in some areas

1035
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:42,199
enforcing local ordinances and not

1036
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:45,078
arresting people with small amounts of

1037
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:48,558
ganja and others are still applying

1038
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:50,839
State bands meanwhile in

1039
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:54,200
California possession of up to an ounce

1040
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:56,798
of ganja is treated in the same way as a

1041
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:59,519
speeding ticket with a fine but but no

1042
00:53:56,798 --> 00:54:02,759
criminal criminal record and this is

1043
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:05,798
important because even a minor criminal

1044
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:09,640
um conviction can lead to problems like

1045
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:11,039
getting a job a loan a home and can even

1046
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:14,159
lead to

1047
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:16,679
deportation in 2016 the following states

1048
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:19,118
will put legalization on the TW on the

1049
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:23,519
ballot

1050
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:26,720
Massachusetts California Hawaii Missouri

1051
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:30,880
Maine Nevada and arizota

1052
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:33,919
and I don't need to tell you what the

1053
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,160
results will be the medical marijuana

1054
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,119
community in the United States has shown

1055
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:42,000
immense benefits have have shown the

1056
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:45,119
immense benefits of cannabis for helping

1057
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,838
the sick they have also shown the

1058
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:51,880
possibility of increased earning through

1059
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:54,119
taxation from legal marijuana the

1060
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:57,240
returns in these states have been

1061
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:59,838
impressive it is important to note also

1062
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:02,598
that there is legal medical marijuana in

1063
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:05,519
23 states in the United States of

1064
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:09,318
America there is decriminalization in

1065
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:12,838
about 14 States the figures in America

1066
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:15,119
are constantly changing what is

1067
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:17,558
noticeable in the United States is the

1068
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:19,920
campaign on the ground the professionals

1069
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:23,079
and the grassroot movements it is really

1070
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:26,519
a people's movement that is using ganja

1071
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:29,280
to transform us politics

1072
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:31,759
in Canada in some areas the struggle for

1073
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,119
change is led by the people in other

1074
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,480
areas Believe It or Not by the

1075
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:39,280
government police and prosecution

1076
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:42,000
services in Canadian jurisdictions are

1077
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,039
capable of pursuing criminal charges for

1078
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,079
cannabis possession despite this the

1079
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:52,000
legal status of cannabis in Canada is

1080
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:55,240
under dispute Superior and appet courts

1081
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,239
in Ontario have repeatedly declared

1082
00:55:55,239 --> 00:56:00,759
Canada's cannabis laws to be no force

1083
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:03,838
and or effect if a prescription is

1084
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:06,400
obtained however challenges to cannabis

1085
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:08,719
laws at the federal level have not

1086
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,680
resulted in the deletion of the

1087
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:13,639
appropriate articles from the criminal

1088

the

1095
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:37,679
licenses issued by Health Canada I have

1096
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:39,960
been informed that hemp uh or it is

1097
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:43,038
questionable whether hemp is legal in

1098
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:45,480
Jamaica several polls since 2003 have

1099
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:48,160
found that the majority of Canadians

1100
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,798
agree with the statement the use of

1101
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:54,078
marijuana should be

1102
00:56:49,798 --> 00:56:58,280
decriminalized a 2014 poll conducted by

1103
00:56:54,079 --> 00:57:02,359
Angus Reed global shows that 59% of

1104
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:04,760
Canadians support marijuana legalization

1105
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:08,519
with the strongest support in British

1106
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,520
Colombia and among

1107
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:13,720
men Canada has produced two useful

1108
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:17,038
studies and provided instructive

1109
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:19,639
approach and guide to prepare papers

1110
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:22,760
calling for changes in the international

1111
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:24,639
treaties concerning cannabis Canada like

1112
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:27,960
the USA and the Netherlands are the main

1113
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:30,920
countries in the North plan in

1114
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:33,760
cannabis in Latin America important

1115
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:38,200
changes have taken place in countries

1116
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:41,440
like Argentina Brazil Colombia Honduras

1117
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:44,439
Mexico and Uruguay in many of these

1118
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:47,599
countries their main concern is curbing

1119
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:51,760
crime through legalization of ganja in

1120
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:54,480
ug in Uruguay ganja is a legal

1121
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,960
substance there is evidence changes in

1122
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:00,199
some major European countries

1123
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,920
is take are taking place countries such

1124
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:04,919
as Italy Spain

1125
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:07,200
Portugal Luxembourg Germany France

1126
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:10,440
Austria Ireland the Netherlands the

1127
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:13,439
United Kingdom and Greece there is not

1128
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:16,679
much information on Africa but there are

1129
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:20,200
calls for changes in the marijuana law

1130
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:23,838
law laws in West Africa Zimbabwe and

1131
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:26,639
South Africa globally cannabis is still

1132
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:29,119
illegal in the majority of countries

1133
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,558
however many countries have

1134
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:35,240
decriminalized allowing the possession

1135
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:38,839
of or growing of small quantities of

1136
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:42,159
ganja even more countries allow the use

1137
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:46,798
of ganja for medicinal purposes the

1138
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:50,078
number of these country is is rapidly

1139
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:52,559
increasing the global picture just

1140
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,880
described tells us that there are major

1141
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,319
changes in the world and the time is

1142
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,920
right to cause for changes in the

1143
00:58:57,318 --> 00:59:03,759
international treaties governing

1144
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:06,318
marijuana I was given a lecture by the

1145
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:10,039
minister uh in one of my discussions

1146
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:13,599
with him um pushing for the legalization

1147
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:19,640
of dja and he brought to my attention

1148
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:24,318
the fact that um Jamaica is a signatory

1149
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:27,440
on these treaties and had to and had to

1150
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:30,880
honor um the treaties

1151
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:34,798
I I I understand that

1152
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:37,798
fully um but it also is important that

1153
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:42,079
we reexamine these treaties now um

1154
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:44,639
because it has a it it it is impeding

1155
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:47,160
the trade across

1156
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:50,719
borders on the basis of research I think

1157
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:54,480
it is time for the Ministers of Foreign

1158
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:56,798
Affairs including our own Minister here

1159
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,960
and the ministers in car

1160
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:01,599
the Ministers of foreign trade and

1161
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,199
international trade the Foreign Affairs

1162
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:07,039
and international trade to be contacted

1163
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:10,439
with a position paper for and about

1164
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:12,960
changes in the international um

1165
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,358
treaties let me share with you some

1166
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:20,119
notes from the Canadian special senate

1167
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:20,119
committee which was established in

1168
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:25,358
2002 the committee makes a charge for

1169
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,119
profound changes in the international

1170
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:29,719
legal envirment ironment the political

1171
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:32,760
justification of the position is

1172
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:34,358
preceded by three important observations

1173
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:37,640
of the international

1174
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:39,358
treaties firstly there is a major

1175
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:43,279
problem regarding

1176
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:44,480
definitions the terms drugs narcotics

1177
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,480
and

1178
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:52,318
psychotropics are not defined in any way

1179
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:55,119
except as a list of products included in

1180
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:57,038
the schedule the arbitrary and

1181
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:59,400
inconsistent nature of the

1182
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:03,760
classification is another point of

1183
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:07,079
concern cannabis is included with along

1184
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:11,000
with heroine and cocaine in schedules 1

1185
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:14,240
and four of the 1961 convention which

1186
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,199
carries the most stringent controls it

1187
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:21,159
is not even mentioned by name in the

1188
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:24,078
1971 protocols though THC is listed as a

1189
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:26,798
scheduled one psychotropic drug with

1190
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:29,000
mescaline and LSD

1191
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:31,639
the concerns about the dangers of drugs

1192
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,639
and public health are not consistent

1193
01:01:31,639 --> 01:01:36,879
regarding to the use of alcohol and

1194
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:39,440
tobacco these are not controlled

1195
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:42,440
substances according to the 2002

1196
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:45,159
Canadian Senate report we conclude and

1197
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,200
I'm quoting we conclude from these

1198
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:49,639
observations that the international

1199
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:53,719
regime for the control and prohibition

1200
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:58,440
of psychoactive substances Beyond any

1201
01:01:53,719 --> 01:02:01,278
moral or even racist Roots it may

1202
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:03,960
initially had is first and foremost A

1203
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:07,159
system that reflects the geopolitics of

1204
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:10,199
north south relations in the 20th

1205
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:12,480
century indeed the strictest controls

1206
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:15,480
were placed on organic substances such

1207
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:19,278
as the Coca Bush the poppy and the

1208
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:20,880
cannabis plant which often form part of

1209
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:23,199
the ancestral traditions of the

1210
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,000
countries where these plants originate

1211
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:29,318
whereas the North's cultural products

1212
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,358
alcohol and tobacco were ignored and the

1213
01:02:29,318 --> 01:02:35,480
synthetic substances produced by the n's

1214
01:02:32,358 --> 01:02:37,920
pharmaceutical industries were subject

1215
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:41,400
to regulation not

1216
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,960
prohibition the 1988 convention forced

1217
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:46,838
countries in the South to apply the

1218
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:50,440
force of that convention on their own

1219
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:53,558
people and it is still being applied

1220
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:55,599
today several International commissions

1221
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:58,760
have conducted research and concluded

1222
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:02,960
with scientific findings the mystifying

1223
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:06,240
the myths and an and anecdotal

1224
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,079
evidence those findings received renewed

1225
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:11,399
attention during the

1226
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:14,160
1990s but in the facts of facts myths

1227
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:17,278
rule it is important to look at some of

1228
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:19,440
these works and their contribution to

1229
01:03:17,278 --> 01:03:21,920
the debate let us look at the work of

1230
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:25,079
the Indian hem Commission in

1231
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:28,119
1894 a most detailed and systematic

1232
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:30,680
study of marijuana the commission took

1233
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:32,480
place in India from

1234
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:36,118
1993 to

1235
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:39,199
1994 looking at every aspect of cannabis

1236
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:42,680
use about the history of the plant the

1237
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:45,679
history of spiritual and medical uses

1238
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:48,960
and a view of how the elite view the

1239
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:51,199
lower class citizens who smoke cannabis

1240
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:55,039
the commission did not link cannabis

1241
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:58,679
smoking to any evil whatsoever the

1242
01:03:55,039 --> 01:04:01,920
report shows that the Indian Elites view

1243
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:05,960
ganja as a drug for lower class Indian

1244
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:07,680
laborers ganja smoking was associated

1245
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,960
with

1246
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,159
work then there is the LaGuardia

1247
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,838
committee

1248
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:17,719
report uh 1939 to

1249
01:04:14,838 --> 01:04:20,358
1944 uh the New York Academy of Medicine

1250
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:23,519
established a committee composed of

1251
01:04:20,358 --> 01:04:26,159
eight Physicians a psychologist and four

1252
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:30,199
New York City officials

1253
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:33,159
the commission did not establish any

1254
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:35,118
relationship um between marijuana

1255
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:38,639
smoking and crime and

1256
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:42,400
violence it concluded that marijuana has

1257
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:44,239
no specific stimulant effect in regard

1258
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,559
to sexual

1259
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:50,558
desires and that Mar and that marijuana

1260
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:53,400
does not lead to the use of other

1261
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:56,359
drugs many smokers having a long history

1262
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:58,720
of cannabis use was examined by the

1263
01:04:56,358 --> 01:05:02,199
researchers who found interestingly

1264
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:04,399
enough that marijuana users were not

1265
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:06,919
inferior were not of inferior

1266
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,639
intelligence to the general

1267
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:13,039
population they and that they suffered

1268
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:16,400
no mental or physical deterioration as a

1269
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:19,720
result of the use of the drug and let me

1270
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:23,960
repeat um these findings are scientific

1271
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:26,959
findings they don't represent even even

1272
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:30,278
they are not my opinion although I I

1273
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:32,480
agree um with with with with them let me

1274
01:05:30,278 --> 01:05:34,798
declare that these are scientific

1275
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:38,760
findings so let us look at the national

1276
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:42,679
Commission on marijuana and drug abuse

1277
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:45,839
this commission was established by the

1278
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:49,199
United States Congress and President

1279
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:53,199
Nixon under the chairmanship of Raymond

1280
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:55,118
schaer a former governor of Pennsylvania

1281
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,318
and its initial findings were published

1282
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,920
in 19

1283
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:02,400
1972 according to this

1284
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:05,278
commission there is little proven danger

1285
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:08,838
of the physical or psychological harm

1286
01:06:05,278 --> 01:06:11,440
from the use of cannabis and they also

1287
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:15,679
concluded that the existing social and

1288
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:19,720
legal policy is out of proportion to the

1289
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:23,719
individual and social harm engendered by

1290
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:26,519
the drug and I repeat that is that study

1291
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:28,278
was commissioned by the United St Senate

1292
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:32,358
and sanctioned by the pres by the

1293
01:06:28,278 --> 01:06:33,920
president um Mixon at the time but let

1294
01:06:32,358 --> 01:06:38,078
me tell you about what is probably

1295
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:41,880
regarded by Scholars as maybe the most

1296
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:46,039
important study on ganja This research

1297
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:48,640
is a big secret I don't know how many

1298
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:52,640
people um know about it the publication

1299
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:55,838
from this project is located right here

1300
01:06:52,639 --> 01:07:00,078
at the UWI library and we found it a few

1301
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:02,960
weeks ago and it was really in very poor

1302
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:05,839
condition and we have restored it um

1303
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:08,960
this study was conducted by lambros

1304
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:11,318
kitas and Viva Rubin of the research

1305
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,119
institute for the study of man out of

1306
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:17,159
New York the research was conducted in

1307
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:20,559
19 between 1970 to

1308
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:23,278
1972 the era of Nixon's war against

1309
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:25,880
drugs there was a Thrust to conduct

1310
01:07:23,278 --> 01:07:28,838
research in countries where there is

1311
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:31,798
chronic gandja smoking and therefore no

1312
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:35,838
surprise Jamaica was selected it was

1313
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:39,239
sponsored by the National Institute for

1314
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:44,038
mental health out of the USA this was a

1315
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:45,759
multicenter study and included such

1316
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:48,839
included reputable universities from

1317
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:51,559
across the United States such as the

1318
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:54,838
prestigious I University Columbia

1319
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:57,000
University and from the UK Birmingham

1320
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:59,519
University they collaborated with the

1321
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,119
University of the West Indies and let me

1322
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:05,159
remind you we are talking about 1970 to

1323
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:08,440
1972 to examine the anthropological

1324
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:11,798
medical and psychologic effects of users

1325
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:16,319
and non users of cannabis the subjects

1326
01:08:11,798 --> 01:08:20,119
in the study ranged from age 23 to 53

1327
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:23,719
years and were drawn from all sections

1328
01:08:20,119 --> 01:08:27,079
of our society Farmers fishermen

1329
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:29,719
Artisans and the trade people the report

1330
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:33,719
provides an extensive account of the

1331
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:36,319
Indian hemp commission it refused refuse

1332
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:39,000
the charges of the so-called

1333
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:42,920
demotivation syndrome and low

1334
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:46,198
productivity among among ganja users and

1335
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:49,319
also found no evidence of cognitive

1336
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:51,919
impairment in users of cannabis the

1337
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:54,520
researchers found no evidence that heavy

1338
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,560
use of cannabis results in permanent

1339
01:08:54,520 --> 01:09:00,359
cognitive impairment

1340
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,239
report was handed over to our own

01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:15,960
1982 this commission came at a time that

1346
01:09:14,198 --> 01:09:16,838
and may have been the turning point in

1347
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:19,439
the

1348
01:09:16,838 --> 01:09:21,960
1990s leading to the renewal of pot

1349
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:25,198
politics in the United States over the

1350
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:28,480
past 40 years marijuana has been accused

1351
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:31,798
of of an array of antisocial effects

1352
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:34,838
including increasing crime and violence

1353
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:37,079
leading to hering ad addiction and

1354
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:39,079
destroying the work ethic of young

1355
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:41,198
people this

1356
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:42,759
commission the National Academy of

1357
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:46,238
Science

1358
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:48,560
report concluded these charges that

1359
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:51,639
these charges have not been

1360
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:54,039
substantiated by the scientific

1361
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:57,679
evidence the opponents of changes in

1362
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:58,920
marijuana laws are convincing in the

1363
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:02,239
spread of

1364
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:04,719
rumors however it is critical that the

1365
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:06,639
social concerns are addressed through an

1366
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:09,000
aggressive public

1367
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:13,640
education program there are a number of

1368
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:17,158
questions which are ask the what is the

1369
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:18,640
risk of ganja smoking to public order

1370
01:10:17,158 --> 01:10:22,879
health and

1371
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:25,800
safety if ganja is legalized will ganja

1372
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:29,319
use increase

1373
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:32,480
I dare I pause to say that anybody who

1374
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:36,279
truly believes that um knows very little

1375
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:40,000
about Jamaica I know Jamaica I know

1376
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:44,039
every part of Jamaica um so let me leave

1377
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,880
it I won't bother to to answer it and

1378
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:51,560
that ganja is a gateway drug it is said

1379
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:55,760
that ganja is a gateway drug and it's

1380
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:59,039
also said that um smoking ganja leads to

1381
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:01,320
deviant behavior and increasing crime

1382
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:04,000
and violence the fact is that the

1383
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:06,599
experience in places like Colorado is

1384
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,319
exactly the opposite what are the

1385
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:13,120
effects on mental health and does it

1386
01:11:09,319 --> 01:11:15,559
lead to Insanity what are the effects on

1387
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:17,439
memory and cognition and what are the

1388
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,600
effects on sexual

1389
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:22,399
reproduction what are the effects and

1390
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:26,280
motivation and academic work and

1391
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:29,719
academic and work performance are

1392
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:33,279
smokers Underachievers and The Lost

1393
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:35,520
Generation all these concerns ladies and

1394
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:37,920
gentlemen have been

1395
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,199
demystified by the above mentioned and

1396
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,679
these are only their few studies and

1397
01:11:40,198 --> 01:11:45,198
commissions and especially let me draw

1398
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:48,719
your attention again to the report from

1399
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:52,519
kamasan Rubin which was conducted right

1400
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:55,439
here um in Jamaica this report uses

1401
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:58,000
extensively the voices of the subjects

1402
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:59,839
and all of the above all of the above

1403
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,399
concerns have been

1404
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,600
demystified it is interesting that both

1405
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:08,079
overseas and local research and ganja

1406
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:10,760
smoking and academic work and

1407
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:13,800
performance all the

1408
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:16,480
research done locally and

1409
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:18,920
internationally on the effects on

1410
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:22,479
academic work and performance showed

1411
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:24,800
High academic performance amongst ganja

1412
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:27,359
smokers it is frightening in a positive

1413
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,639
way to here that examining students in

1414
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:32,198
the United States of America and the

1415
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:35,639
results from the commit and ren study in

1416
01:12:32,198 --> 01:12:39,960
Jamaica illustrate believe it or not

1417
01:12:35,639 --> 01:12:42,239
that ganja smokers do better do in fact

1418
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,039
they do exceptionally well and these are

1419
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:47,359
not my words

1420
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:50,760
academically that is what the science

1421
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:55,238
shows but let me

1422
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:58,520
caution that it is not desirable for on

1423
01:12:55,238 --> 01:13:02,399
AED young people to think that it is

1424
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:02,400
good for them and their school

1425
01:13:04,119 --> 01:13:12,519
work that is what the science

1426
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:16,319
shows as I said before um let us

1427
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:17,360
replace rumors with the scientific facts

1428
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:19,679
I'm a

1429
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:22,719
scientist the Canadians have done a lot

1430
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:25,399
of work in the area of medical marijuana

1431
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:30,239
the the Senate special committee was a

1432
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:33,238
established 30 years after the leine

1433
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:36,678
commission and is the Senate committee

1434
01:13:33,238 --> 01:13:40,039
in 2002 and the lean Commission in

1435
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:42,520
1972 on the non-medical use of drugs

1436
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:45,119
studying some of the same issues from

1437
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:47,120
the early inquiry the commission

1438
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:49,920
suggests that the new policy and

1439
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:53,840
psychoactive substances must be

1440
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:55,800
structured around principles respecting

1441
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:59,560
the Life Health

1442
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:02,440
security and the rights and freedoms of

1443
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:06,039
individuals the major theme of the study

1444
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:09,119
are use of marijuana for therapeutic

1445
01:14:06,039 --> 01:14:11,920
purposes the national legislative

1446
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:15,439
context and regulating the therapeutic

1447
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:19,639
use of cannabis this report is a

1448
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:22,919
Hallmark study in the call for medical

1449
01:14:19,639 --> 01:14:26,079
marijuana in the mid 19th century the

1450
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:29,239
Western World accustom some to hemp rope

1451
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:32,319
and carded discovered that the plant

1452
01:14:29,238 --> 01:14:35,638
that produces hemp affords potential

1453
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:38,319
therapeutic and psychoactive properties

1454
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:40,159
it was introduced by a British physician

1455
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:42,599
who had been working in India where

1456
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:45,359
cannabis has been used in that country

1457
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,679
for thousands of years it was not used

1458
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:50,158
in Western medicine until the third of

1459
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,158
the 20th century for the treatment of

1460
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:56,158
both organic complaints and mental

1461
01:14:53,158 --> 01:15:00,839
illness the medical use of cannabis was

1462
01:14:56,158 --> 01:15:03,879
discouraged by the marijuana Tax Act of

1463
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:04,880
1937 the therapeutic uses of cannabis is

1464
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,319
well

1465
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,840
documented with scientific evidence

1466
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:12,399
however it is the politicians or the

1467
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:15,400
barriers through approval of legislation

1468
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:19,079
and I'm glad my friend is not here to

1469
01:15:15,399 --> 01:15:23,960
the approval of legislation to transform

1470
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:26,559
and reform gandja law as early as 1982

1471
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:30,279
congressman Believe It or Not

1472
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:32,280
conservative new new Gish wrote in the

1473

Association federal laws and medical

1475
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:41,198

thousands of glaucoma and cancer

patients Medical Care he continued to

1478
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:50,800
state that this theory about drug abuse

1479
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:53,119
has prevented a rational assessment of

1480
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,400
the therapeutic use of

1481
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:56,960
marijuana in recent years has been

1482
01:15:55,399 --> 01:15:59,039
renewed interest in the medical

1483
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,359
marijuana in the United States and

1484
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:04,600
Canada both countries have important

1485
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:07,920
lessons to offer firstly the role of

1486
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:10,719
public education lobbying and people on

1487
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:13,039
the ground moving the politics towards a

1488
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:15,639
favorable Direction in support of

1489
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:19,039
medical marijuana and also for the

1490
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:22,279
non-medical use of marijuana as we saw

1491
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:25,800
in Colorado the Canadian Senate special

1492
01:16:22,279 --> 01:16:28,319
Committee of 2002 provides important

1493
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:31,239
lessons towards a campaign for the use

1494
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:33,119
of marijuana for therapeutic purposes

1495
01:16:31,238 --> 01:16:36,198
some of their views and medical

1496
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:38,519
marijuana are marijuana as a long

1497
01:16:36,198 --> 01:16:41,198
established has long been established as

1498
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:43,719
a non-dangerous drug and that there are

1499
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:46,000
clear indications that marijuana has

1500
01:16:43,719 --> 01:16:48,880
therapeutic uses and this now is well

having produced canol the study argues

1509
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:18,000

1543
01:18:56,198 --> 01:19:03,359
that that is well known also um

1544

01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:23,279
strongest scientific evidence on ganja

1550

use dispelling the myths and the

1551
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:28,000
anecdotal evidence as as I said before

1552
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,760
I'm a scientist there is a

1553
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,279
discriminatory view there is a

1554
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:35,679
discriminatory view of ganja and ganja

1555
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:38,479
smokers by the upper and middle classes

1556
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:41,600
and some Christians from the religious

1557
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:44,399
right they hold on to the view that

1558
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:46,920
ganja smoking is psychologically and

1559
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:49,279
physically damaging that it is a

1560
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:52,920
precipitant for violence and antisocial

1561
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:55,000
Behavior as well as revolutionary acts

1562
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:58,399
while the society have to be concerned

1563
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:01,520
about this and develop effective public

1564
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:04,839
education program that will help to

1565
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:07,800
alleviate these fairs we have to seize

1566
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:11,199
the opportunity and use the popularity

1567
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:13,760
of this ganja issue to deal with matters

1568
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:16,559
concerning the wider Jamaican society

1569
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:23,159
and let me tell you that as chairman of

1570
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:25,639
the task force the had long name um as

1571
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:27,479
chairman I am amazed

1572
01:20:25,639 --> 01:20:32,359
by the broad Coalition which we have

1573
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:35,718
managed to put together and as as the

1574
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:38,238
minister um is is quite is quite

1575
01:20:35,719 --> 01:20:41,319
appropriate how the director uh and he

1576
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:45,718
has to approve it I know that the green

1577
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:49,039
is is in it's it's green is is used um

1578
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:53,000
in the theme because I tell you that

1579
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:55,359
both parties are represented on the task

1580
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,560
force against his back back we may need

1581
01:20:55,359 --> 01:21:01,359
a Jamal styled scientific literacy

1582
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:04,920
program for the formal and informal

1583
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:08,279
spheres of Education in Jamaica a basic

1584
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:10,079
understanding of science helps in two

1585
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:12,840
ways it

1586
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:16,079
increases appreciation for scientific

1587
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:19,400
research results and secondly to

1588
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:22,639
encourage Innovation at the point of use

1589
01:21:19,399 --> 01:21:25,479
in the everyday lived experience for

1590
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:28,359
Farmers the food and plant processes in

1591
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:29,879
the areas of engineering and in animal

1592
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:32,119
and plant

1593
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:34,800
Sciences this matter concerning

1594
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:37,960
legalization of ganja and wealth

1595
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:41,000
creation has indeed attracted a lot of

1596
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:43,800
interest during the 1960s the

1597
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,399
Rastafarians created a lot of interest

1598
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:49,679
and the principal of the University of

1599
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:51,759
the West Indies was requested by Mr mle

1600
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:54,039
to go on a fact finding mission to

1601
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,480
illiminate this important social

1602
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:56,519
phenomenon

1603
01:21:55,479 --> 01:22:01,959
in

1604
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:04,840
2014 let me reclaim my principal's hat

1605
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:07,279
this principles this principle aims to

1606
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:10,400
play a pivotal role in the development

1607
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:13,840
of a new ganja regime especially in the

1608
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:16,519
area of medical marijuana as well as

1609
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:19,440
calling for reforms in the global

1610
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:22,679
treaties not all person can ganja

1611
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:25,599
farmers are processors of the product

1612
01:22:22,679 --> 01:22:27,960
what I have observed is enthusiasm

1613
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:31,239
regarding the application of science to

1614
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:34,279
the plant to the ganja plant for medical

1615
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:36,919
and Industrial purposes we must seize

1616
01:22:34,279 --> 01:22:39,559
this moment we must use this moment to

1617
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:42,000
inspire greater interest in the

1618
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:44,920
scientific exploitation of other

1619
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,520
medicinal plants and agriculture in

1620
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:49,920
general students including mature

1621
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,600
students do better when they are able to

1622
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:55,158
apply scientific principles to Everyday

1623
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:57,639
Life

1624
01:22:55,158 --> 01:22:59,960
they do better and I pause to tell you

1625
01:22:57,639 --> 01:23:01,520
the story of my son I won't tell you

1626
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:05,560
which high school but was been very

1627
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:08,639
badly in the sciences and Mathematics

1628
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:12,360
and I had to go home I saw him going

1629
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:15,520
down and I had to to to just before his

1630
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:18,920
his his his CC exams I had to study

1631
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:21,520
again and took him through it and he had

1632
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:25,158
a particular difficulty with

1633
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:28,000
chemistry and I started teaching te him

1634
01:23:25,158 --> 01:23:30,000
chemistry and then I discovered that he

1635
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,039
could not connect with it there was a

1636
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,359
certain disconnection he said Daddy but

1637
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:36,760
this is nonsense what what is the

1638
01:23:34,359 --> 01:23:39,319
importance of this thing and when I

1639
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:42,079
started to show him the Practical

1640
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:45,559
applications even around the house

1641
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:49,760
suddenly he woke up and he said Daddy

1642
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:49,760
this is a beautiful subject and he got a

1643
01:23:52,639 --> 01:24:00,359
distinction let me tell you that um we

1644
01:23:58,198 --> 01:24:02,759
need to plan we must think about wider

1645
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:05,479
Society with a view to encourage what

1646
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:08,400
may evolve into a long awaited

1647
01:24:05,479 --> 01:24:12,718
scientific revolution in Jamaica it is

1648
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:14,559
science and not politics or n economics

1649
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,840
that develop countries and you can

1650
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,760
research that for yourselves this is the

1651
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:21,880
first time that I have witnessed

1652
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:25,239
discussions with such figure looking at

1653
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:28,239
the scientific application of a plan

1654
01:24:25,238 --> 01:24:31,638
for this to be successful there has to

1655
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:34,879
be a science reform curriculum in both

1656
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:37,279
academic and Vocational institutions we

1657
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:41,560
also need to take sides to the everyday

1658
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:45,238
lived experience encouraging change from

1659
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:47,119
the ground up as we proceed as we

1660
01:24:45,238 --> 01:24:51,799
develop businesses to create wealth from

1661
01:24:47,118 --> 01:24:55,359
this billion dollar industry we must

1662
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:59,360
remember and we must remember

1663
01:24:55,359 --> 01:25:02,599
and pardon me for referring to this so

1664
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:07,158
frequently we must remember that ganja

1665
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:10,679
is linked to the lives of lower and

1666
01:25:07,158 --> 01:25:13,439
lower class and working people let us

1667
01:25:10,679 --> 01:25:14,359
not forget that they bore the brunt of

1668
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:17,678
the

1669
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:19,519
Justice ganja plays an important role in

1670
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:23,279
their lives from

1671
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:26,920
cultivation marketing as cash crops as

1672
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:31,759
Folk medicine and for some religious

1673
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:34,920
purposes no ganja industry Will Survive

1675
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:40,399
aspects these are some sensitive issues

1676
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:43,158
that will not be solved overnight as the

1677
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:45,920
laws are changed as we prepare to do

1678
01:25:43,158 --> 01:25:49,839
business we must think not just the

1679
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:52,800
future girls but existing grows and how

1680
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:55,440
we make the transition smooth it is

1681
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:58,920
important for the new public policy to

1682
01:25:55,439 --> 01:26:02,799
be accompanied by a public education

1683

01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:23,839
clinical trials gja must be regarded as

1690
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:27,840
a medicine and not as a dangerous drug

1691
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:29,560
let us replace myths and anecdotes with

1692
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,800
