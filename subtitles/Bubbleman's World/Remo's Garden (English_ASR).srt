that it was uh created at UBC for uh

241

people that are fighting cancer on

242
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,078
chemotherapy and this was supposed to

243
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,198
relieve their symptoms uh whether that's

244
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,879
true or not I have no idea but it has

245
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:40,240
