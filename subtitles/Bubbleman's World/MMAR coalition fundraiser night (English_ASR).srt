baby cake here I don't have any water

27
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:20,719
but we can hit it dry although there is

28
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,680
an ocean behind what's that should that

29
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:26,158
ah you know what it'll this thing hits

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,960
like champ uh wet or dry so just make

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,118
sure the torch is good got a little bit

32
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,118
of tor

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,360
that's weird EXC so that

34
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,840
works and then it's just a matter maybe

35
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:43,680
you hold that

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,640
good excellent we're in a very busy area

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,880
of Vancouver so some people might be

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,519
slightly concerned with what we're doing

39
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,959
but I'm not too worried about it I do it

40
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,319
pretty much everywhere I go and I try to

41
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,319
keep it on the down low I'm not blowing

42
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,038
it in little kids faces or anything but

43
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,038
for the most part it's educational yeah

44
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,079
exactly you know when people are like

45
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,560
hey what is it you're doing there and

46
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,798
it's like actually medic and feeding my

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,560
endoc canabo system it sounds a lot

48
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
different than we're getting high we're

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,159
not getting high we're feeding our endoc

50
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,118
canabo

51
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,799
systems it's something that more people

52
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,080
should do you want to torch that up just

53
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,400
click that and lock the or hold the

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,080
torch either way then I'll get one of

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,640
these little ready albe it I will admit

56
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,440
that the torch is a little bit more

57
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,238
hardcore than your usual thing to see on

58
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:30,878
the side of the road in Vancouver

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,159
yeah but you know what not so bad

60
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:33,280
when you got to hit a rip you got to hit

61
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,560
a rip so we're going to head over to the

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,479
concert in a little bit I'm actually

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,120
meeting higher end I'm meeting Flav 421

64
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,679
I'm meeting John Bell and I'm meeting

65
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,360
d42 uh 20K right here at cardos that's

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,840
one of my favorite Vancouver restaurants

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,239
here so we're going to go have a nice

68
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,560
meal before we head off got lots of cars

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,519
around us that's probably really good

70
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,519
right there we hit it

71
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:00,158
first there

72
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,759
the dry SI

73
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:09,039
Ripper yeah you know what no it's so

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,560
small it still feels pretty proper to

75
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,479
hit this without have it's definitely

76
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,719
not like

77
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,598
over that is so little Vaper R to let

78
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,400
you heat it up again just focus on the

79
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,079
one side there until it goes orange

80
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,439
we'll get Elijah wrapped up with one so

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm going to bring the camera tonight

82
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,318
I'm going to bring in I think red one's

83
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,720
playing from the Rascals I'll interview

84
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:35,318
Maybe Mo and Jason Willcox we talk to

85
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:38,318
d420 K and Flav higher end we talk to

86
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:39,438
Jason Willcox and an and a whole bunch

87
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,000
of other people there we're just trying

88
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:43,239
to do some quick little interviews and

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,239
dabs with as many people as we can bump

90
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,519
into all right well I guess I'm going to

91
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,519
hit this

92
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,719
[Music]

93
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,078
one that was a good one I think you got

94
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,120
him with corn hot

95
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,760
thing all right so we're hitting dry

96
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,200
sift that d420 K brought me from good

97
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,798
buddy Jake and Jake made some nice sift

98
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:17,120
and uh I just cleaned it up and so I

99
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,040
believe it's OG Kush oh nice very tast

100
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,319
anything OG well that's you know what

101
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,439
dude you pretty much said the most

102
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,439
truthful statement you could say like

103
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,319
really anything OG is good you could

104
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,879
take almost any swag and cross it with

105
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:31,199
OG and come up with something pretty

106
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,639
props all right so we give you a little

107
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,639
dropper

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,520
there the tiny little 8 mil nail is

109
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,680
definitely sometimes hard to work with

110
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,599
with the flat Dabber but uh I think

111
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,160
we're making it work pretty good here

112
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,320
yeah gaving away the day as they

113
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,199
say dude I'm stoked that I bumped into

114
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,199
you guys and got to take a dab like that

115
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,360
really nice too very cool you got to

116
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,879
love it you know it's always the um

117
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,400
something like the Mark Emory image on a

118
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,439
shirt that's you know for me I can't let

119
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,799
someone walk by without saying and

120
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,279
coincidentally enough Mark did used to

121
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,400
live right there that was his building

122
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,198
literally maybe a year before he went to

123
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,638
prison he lived right across from cardos

124
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,199
and so that's kind of trippy that we

125
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,960
would meet right up in front of that

126
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,840
place yeah that's awesome probably less

127
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,359
than two or 3 weeks from when Mark

128
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,519
himself will return to Vancouver oh wow

129
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,280
yeah we're looking pretty forward to

130
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:29,879
that it's going to be uh it's going to

131
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:32,478
be amazing to have him back man can't

132
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,959
believe they got him for 5 years but

133
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,839
somehow ingesting Mark Emory um

134
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,719
convinced them to like change their laws

135
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,758
on Canabis cuz it all started when he

136
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,800
went into prison oh literally it was his

137
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,840
prosecutor I didn't that yeah the same

138
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,000
guy that prosecuted Mark um is the guy

139
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:53,000
who fought for um the legalization or

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,720
the DCM in in Washington so everything

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,439
that's happening Washington is the same

142
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,919
guy that prosecuted Mark if you can

143
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,319
imagine so Mark has an effect on people

144
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,318
even his PR

145
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,240
computers so uh I see higher end just

146
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,000
rolled up he's probably got some sick

147
