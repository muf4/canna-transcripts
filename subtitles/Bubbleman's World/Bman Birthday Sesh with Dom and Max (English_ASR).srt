that it's getting ni ni out I was a

44

big jacket on get the hemp on there now

46
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:10,080
it's getting warmer and I'm maybe be

47
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:13,318
taking it off in the near

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,959
future in the near future I'm going to

49
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:19,318
start this party off with a little TP

50
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,680
dip as well call yeah so we're kind of

51
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,878
just sitting around talking about hash

52
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,920
getting lit and uh talking about

53
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,560
potentially a turpine party actually

54
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,119
something that I've been thinking about

55
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,319
for last little while threw one with

56
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,560
Tony in Barcelona I guess a year and a

57
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:40,359
bit ago now the first tarpine party that

58
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,239
we threw so the karma [ __ ] is what's

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,959
going down for me all this glass to move

60
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,959
move this over here that over here

61
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,759
exactly take that there yeah nice size

62
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,800
dab of the pinear Kush and yeah Karma's

63
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,239
[ __ ] so it'll really change the effects

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:01,080
of this sort of narcotic and heavy uh

65
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,080
strong I guess what you'd call the Inda

66
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,679
oh yeah it's hard not to make that sound

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,080
after a

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,480
turp it's very tasty how tasty was

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,400
that

70
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,158
well it's like what we were talking

71
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,920
about earlier the potential Gathering

72
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:31,039
the Blue River

73
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,679
Gathering it tpin really can change the

74
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,438
way you gather and puff and you know I

75
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,760
like the micro doing I like the many

76
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:40,000
different colors uh flavors vibrant

77
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,000
flavors coming off of the different tpin

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,680
and um it produces a different vibe

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,400
throughout the night you know I felt

80
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,920
like in Barcelona anyway that I went for

81
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,920
four hours

82
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,238
straight had a great time that was last

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,400
year yeah well yeah exactly not just

84
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,759
this not this you didn't make it out

85
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,438
there this year no exactly yeah so that

86
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,239
was last year it was at lalada We just

87
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,719
cleaned this up for you there

88
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,200
D okay you one of these is is there TS

89
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,079
on this one already it's already way

90
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:11,119
dirtier ready to go Ted up Ted up T

91
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,760
dipped up you just do like a little dip

92
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,759
too I find cuz if you do too big of one

93
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,120
it ends up kind of overpowering it and

94
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,160
you don't really get the the best the

95
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,360
best of the effect I think I think it's

96
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,520
better just to kind of do a moderate one

97
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,680
you really get like more than enough

98
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:31,000
flavoring just with that absolutely yeah

99
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,038
oh yeah well I even you know went as far

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,478
as saying that it also felt more

101
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:38,879
enjoyable often when I took much smaller

102
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,000
dabs yeah you know and then I you know I

103
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,519
could also almost like the way I saw

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,600
people drinking wine throughout an

105
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,000
evening I could just go and go and go

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,919
and more importantly the people I was

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,120
puffing with could go and go and go

108
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,198
exactly you know I I can go and go and

109
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,240
go regardless of what's being puffed but

110
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,360
it's the rest of the people that tend to

111
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,280
um hit a wall just get burned out hit a

112
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,479
wall get tired and that's not really

113
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,239
cond to hanging out with people in the

114
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:05,359
evening you know in the city yeah

115
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,240
exactly the way you would for a a

116
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,879
concert or any other type of gathering

117
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,840
reach no problem look at all this stuff

118
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:15,959
moving around on the table I know it's

119
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,758
like musical crash that was a delicious

120
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,519
dab though yeah see what me with a

121
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,199

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,000
Dipper so yeah potentially we were

133
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,918
talking about well you guys have two

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
locations for Sunrise you got one on

Broadway yeah and then we got our newer

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,478
one which we've had open for a couple

137
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,519
years now and that's over on Kingsway

138
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,918
Kings Way and rert nice well apparently

139
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:13,799
it's a good siiz space I haven't been

140
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,038
there yet but we were talking about the

141
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,520
potential on throwing uh you know a

142
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,240
gathering

143
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:24,439
of of chesy people a Blue River Event

144
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,038
sort of speak a private party where we

145
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,399
really promote the use of the Tarpin

146
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,199
people can come in with their different

147
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,038
products maybe we'll have

148
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,598
distillate companies maybe we'll have

149
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,159
hash companies and uh just to be able to

150
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:38,598
try the different Tarpin with the

151
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,360
different products you know in a setting

152
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,478
that's sort of a little bit different

153
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,960
from your

154
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:47,038
average average Gathering that's exactly

155
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,279
most people for instance have not tried

156
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,519
15 different cultivars of tarpine

157
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,198
profiles throughout an evening you know

158
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,000
that might seem to be uh well yeah like

159
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,840
I mean we have a shop that carries all

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,918
the different flavors and it's like even

161
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,638
we like I personally haven't even tried

162
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:05,399
as many as I do when you know when we

163
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,280
actually get more of a chance sit down

164
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,839
sit down and do it cuz it's just like

165
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,399
it's not it's not something that um that

166
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,478
you can necessarily go oh hey I'm going

167
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,079
to buy at you know at that of yeah 10 of

168
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,159
them at that retail and be able to

169
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,120
afford to just try them all so I think

170
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,120
this gives people a huge opportunity to

171
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,240
really get like a a taste of the flavors

172
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,598
that they maybe wondering what they're

173
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,319
like or you know would like to kind of

174
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,240
get into but wouldn't normally be able

175
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,680
to yeah and for you know for a gathering

176
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,519
like that I like the idea of having

177
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,000
really good food and really nice cut up

178
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,758
fruit and juices you know being able to

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,199
give them a nice t-shirt at the end of

180
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,840
the night so they have something to take

181
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,400
home with them to be able to try a dozen

182
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:46,560
plus tpine absolutely maybe some live

183
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:49,000
music exactly sounds like a good time if

184
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,000
you guys are in BC yeah come check it

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,158
out Vancouver in particular write in the

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,120
comment section what you would think of

187
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:57,598
uh a little tarpine event at the Sunrise

188
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,120
Wellness Foundation I think it would be

189
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,918
great yeah I'm definitely

190
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,639
uh I love the idea oh Jack Frost so that

191
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:06,598
was a that was a car [ __ ] that we just

192
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,280
did there exactly and when you pull out

193
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:11,360
Jack Frost you just don't put it back

194
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,719
without that's that's hard to keep that

195
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,960
one uh in my stash what do we got over

196
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,440
there let me try some of that like Jack

197
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,239
so the Jac cluso from West Coast let's

198
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:24,199
try a little Jac cluso yeah that's a

199
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,439
pink cush cross pink kush yeah yeah

200
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,038
Jesus Louise cold out I'm so lucky I

201
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,560
didn't get that in the eye we're s I'm

202
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:33,278
so lucky that's stayed in there jeez

203
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,440
we're sitting at about minus one so all

204
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,158
the hash is really real explosive right

205
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,880
now well I was expecting it to do that

206
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:44,120
but not with such ferocity yeah TP dip

207
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,919
oh Jack Frost was my original first

208
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:51,519
favorite the Jack Frost that we hit with

209
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:53,679
the master Scout rosin was like

210
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,720
psychotic I I I remember it was the

211
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,519
first real synergistic hit that I had of

212
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,360
tpin that was next level that it was not

213
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,560
just dipping some hash in a little

214
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,159
liquid it was ever changing I can tell

215
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,439
this one's well used because the colors

216
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,319
changed on right exactly yeah i' dipping

217
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,480
in that hard well it's probably that

218
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,920
color because of this if you hold it up

219
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,600
with a different background it might be

220
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,360
more yellow I don't know no no you've

221
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,159
been dipping a lot no it looks like the

222
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,159
color of this for

223
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,278
sure

224
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,360
wow the

225
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,480
yeah definitely pulls the color from the

226
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,039
seats though as well oh for sure it does

227

00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,320
the best way is you almost have to that

245
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,159
was the best RP I've had in a long time

preserver I'll take that D oh yeah just

280
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,000
leave it on there actually you need it

281
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,000
you need

282
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,800
it yeah that's it's insane that's off

283
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,039
the charts it's off the charts bro it's

284
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:58,039
like a flavor explosion just happened in

285
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,879
your mouth and what I would like to say

286
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:04,480
that is important is that that it's so

287
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,559
on point there's nothing fake or weird

288
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,720
about it there's nothing overwhelming

289
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:13,638
about it it's just super on point

290
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,040
there's levels to it too oh god dude

291
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,680
it's been like 3 minutes since I been

292
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,759
line and I can still taste it on my lips

293
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,838
and my throat yeah that's

294
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,799
ridiculous when I exhaled it I was in

295
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,880
shock I didn't

296
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:29,240
realized how ridiculously awesome Jack

297
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,639
Frost is some of these are yeah I really

298
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,240
truly didn't like you know I I didn't

299
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,000
have it in my personal St it's almost

300
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,560
easier not to when you don't have it in

301
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,320
your personal stash it's like you can't

302
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:42,078
be knowing how awesome that is and then

303
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,240
go to work and be like [ __ ] I need to

304
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,000
buy this yeah to tell you the truth I I

305
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,278
don't think I ever really was using it

306
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
properly it's all about little dabs with

307
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:55,000
a little bit of of the Tarpin that's it

308
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,720
and then it's to to me it's the

309
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,240
equivalent of you just got turned on to

310
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,759
putting pasta sauce on your pasta yeah

311
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,759
and it's like it doesn't mean you won't

312
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,879
go back and have some pasta sauce or

313
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,240
pasta without pasta sauce I'm telling

314
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,198
you when people say do you put it on

315
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,320
every dab no I don't put it on every dab

316
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,799
but when I remember I have it and it's

317
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,160
right there yeah does it go on a dab

318
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,719
absolutely oh for sure it changes the

319
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,759
experience too like you can just

320
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,278
noticeably feel the different effect

321
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,439
coming from it yeah but pure it doesn't

322
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,078
have a weird like something different

323
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,079
vibe to no like you can you you feel

324
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,759
that it's coming from can Canabis yeah

325
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:36,078

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,839
to go in and talk to people and maybe I

349
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,440
don't know you guys probably aren't

350
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,959
opening them and letting people smell

351
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,839
each flavor but we like to leave them

352
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:44,439
sealed for people they're paying premium

353
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,839
for them but you do get to you got the

354
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,399
service when you come down right

355
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,959
absolutely the face to face you get to

356
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,078
pick the one you want not subject to UPS

357
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:54,359
or Canada Post or they actually have so

358
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,399
much smell too that you can kind of

359
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,079
smell just by cracking the bag without

360
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,039
even opening the I'll tell you smelling

361
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,000
too is not to tell test these by any

362
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,599
means because the smell and the flavor

363
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,078
although they do sometimes line up

364
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,399
totally different they do not always

365
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,599
line up like Jack Frost is a really good

366
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,078
example of that because it's completely

367
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,120
different when you from when you smell

368
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,479
it to when you taste it true on the rig

369
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,440
it's prettyy drippy actually which one

370
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,800
should we dip into next fellas well

371
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,040
let's try God was that good you know

372
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,838
what was good when you're thinking about

373
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,319
doing it Jama they play like a song on

374
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,079
the radio that they really like and at

375
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,319
the end of the song The DJ will just cut

376
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:32,758
it and turn that song on again yeah

377
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:35,360
I think for this next one I mean lemon

378
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,278
tree also has wild Factor lemon tree has

379
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,919
wild Factor um Tangi cherry pie I was

380
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,240
thinking of Clementine

381
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,838
Tang not a bad idea I can't go wrong

382
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,240
little bit there Clen is serious fire

383
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,680
that'll be like a little bit of a cherry

384
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,399
Clem Tony's been going been cleaning up

385
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,519
with that Clementine They just won

386
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:59,078
another gold drop Clementine vape pen

387
00:15:54,519 --> 00:16:00,839
first first prize at hempcon or whatever

388
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:02,719
yeah it's definitely some uh some good

389
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:07,839
flavors wouldn't mind getting that

390
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:11,800
strain yeah absolutely

391
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,800
DNA DNA

392
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,399
genetics I'm excited to have another rip

393
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
what are we doing next so it's Teflon

394
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,720
and then Clementine and the Teflon was

395
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,078
the sift was the sift that I cleaned up

396
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,839
just using plain old static Tech um got

397
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,638
it to about like maybe like a 95 90 cuz

398
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,880
we're going to press into some rosin and

399
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,039
uh we had the West Coast guys how did it

400
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,039
puff as just a pure dry SI it was pretty

401
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,879
good it was like maybe like a it wasn't

402
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:45,719
like super melty it could have been

403
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:47,759
meler um we like like a 12 full melt it

404
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,560
was very close that's the thing when you

405
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,120
unveil things sometimes they they're not

406
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,919
there exactly it's like maybe a little

407
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,639
bit more carbon in the trione than than

408
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:58,120
what's necessary

409
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,639
but you know I'd rather press it into a

410
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,120
rosin have it melt really nicely get all

411
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,880
that flavor and no Char I tried to do

412
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,078
that for sure but even more than that

413
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,480
I'd rather the grower be aware that they

414
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,959
didn't grow six-star and that we made

415
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,240
the dry sift show them and say listen if

416
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,360
you did this properly it would be like

417
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,919
this over here because that's like the

418
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,038
often the path that people don't want to

419
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,319
take that path of being like what do you

420
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:27,078
mean it wasn't like super super great

421
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:29,319
well I just it wasn't there might be a

422
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:32,480
few things you want to pay attention to

423
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:35,759
you know maybe a cult of our change for

424
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,519
some yeah exactly it's not always looks

425
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,798
you know and you know things can always

426
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,480
be dialed in and it's always been open

427
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:43,200
to suggestions because everyone's a

428
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,558
everyone's a student everyone's still

429
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,480
learning no matter how many cups you

430
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:51,480

431
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:56,759

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,480
circles before you get

449
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,000
home

450
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,640
sasquash I should give a couple of these

451
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,960
away I don't know how or why or what

452
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,720
what what could we come up with like a

453
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,079
good question that if someone answers in

454
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,079
the uh comment box guess how many grams

455
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,079
sift is in that that jar all right guess

456
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:13,319
how many grams of sift is in this jar if

457
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:17,000
you can guess put your number in the

458
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:18,798
comment section and I will mail you um

459
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,839
one of these now I don't know if it'll

460
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:24,200
be this one exactly CU I'm going to give

461
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:28,240
one each to Dom and Max but there'll be

462
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:32,679
four left so that really leaves four

463
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:35,759
chances to win so maybe I'll take uh the

464
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,038
two closest I'll take the four the three

465
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,000
closest and the number that gets it or

466
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:41,240
just the four closest if nobody gets it

467
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,519
that was

468
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,480
good if someone gets it right on guess

469
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,519
the amount of hash in this uh in this

470
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,440
jar guys and put it in the comment
