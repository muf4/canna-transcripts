44
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:02,819
bit Evan I've played around a little bit

45
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:05,399
I've I've tried a few different things

46
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:08,878
with the static tech from the paint

47
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,219
roller to the glove to the DVD to the

48
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,090
fat book you know I'm they all work

49
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:12,629
pretty good

50
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,620
I'm not going

51
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:19,319
say that they don't but at the same time

52
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,659
I have some other techniques available

53
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,060
to me that work a little bit better like

54
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:26,879
substantially better and so I mostly use

55
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:31,259
those techniques but why don't we have a

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:38,609
really really quick rip here looks like

57
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:39,509

58
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,200

innocent and sweet at that age the

82

things that come out of your mouth just

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,530

little bits of you know you help me with

89
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:40,329
the quality of the feed and I do

90
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,789
appreciate that the microphone may have

91
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:46,930
been turned down I can turn it up even a

92
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:48,969
little bit more ah yes well I've got the

93
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,079
16 year old the 14 year old and the 3

94
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:54,970
year old I'm not too sure if team Japan

95
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,668
pops and here's what I would say about

96
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,740
that Japan is a very harsh place when it

97
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:01,240
comes to cannabis smoking smoking in

98
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,220
public would not be the smartest idea

99
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,069
smoking on videos would not be the

100
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,990
smartest idea and I would not share even

101
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:11,680
if they did because they still live in a

102
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,538
very prohibition based place and I think

103
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,400
it's best for us to just respect they

104
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:17,319
did not puff the entire time I was there

105
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,779
so I'm not lying when I say I did not

106
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,689
see them puff and I respect their

107
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:24,459
privacy if they do want a puff that's

108
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,918
fine Jon that's great that you know that

109
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:28,839
but let's just sort of leak you know

110
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:35,709
allow it maybe not be the best

111
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:37,509
conversation for this particular sorry

112
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:39,469
about that guys that was my mentor Ron

113
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:41,719
Hickey middle of

114
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,070
and then phones showed that he was funny

115
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,110
knowing money he'll probably call back

116
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:47,480
three more times so definitely expect at

117
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,910
least one or two more interruptions and

118
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,680
in the meantime that Suites kind of

119
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,689
tasted so damn good I think it's I think

120
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,560
we're gonna have another one I think

121
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:59,689
we're gonna have another one there is a

122
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,120
very big cannabis culture growing in

123
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:03,110
Japan it is absolutely the truth there's

124
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,449
no doubt about it

125
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sure that's why John Green has

126
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,979
decided to live there and sell Japanese

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,660
glass you know that they're blowing a

128
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:16,100
lot of glass makes sense that there is a

129
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:21,890
marketplace for that glass I won the pin

130
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:23,330
giveaway over yes hey man I love the

131
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:26,149
wake and bakes haven't missed any you're

132
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:30,310
my mentor and you never call bubble man

133
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:33,679
sorry drew I the thing about a mentor is

134
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:36,439
it's it's easy to sort of pick who you

135
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,110
want to mentor you but it's not until

136
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,969
the mentor picks that he's going to

137
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,220
mentor you that really the relationship

138
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,200
begins at least for me I mean I'm not

139
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,590
talking about that you can't be inspired

140
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,569
by different people online but for me

141
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:52,250
like my mentors have been friends in my

142
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,949
life they have been people who have been

143
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,589
present in my life throughout my days I

144
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:59,629
would see them in times and it was

145
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:04,250
really their decision that allowed for

146
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:05,750
me to kind of study under them it's I

147
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,939
have lots of people call me a mentor all

148
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,728
the time that say that I'm their mentor

149
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:13,279
and it's it's an honor to know that I'm

150
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:15,319
inspiring some people but it really is

151
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,509
this relationship that it's when the

152
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,939
mentor decides to see something in you

153
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:22,219
that reminds him of something he once

154
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,529
had or something that is you know

155
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,840
similar to his core foundation and his

156
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:29,750
belief systems that's when you get

157
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:31,399
picked and that's how it just yeah

158
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,550
that's just how it happens it's trippy

159
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:37,839
but it is what it is Japan grow cannabis

160
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:40,329
would be cool hey thanks Elliot

161
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,560
well they do they do but it's definitely

162
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:46,399
symbiotic in the sense you know like you

163
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,848
definitely it's it's usually the student

164
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,620
who wants the mentor but when the mentor

165
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:54,740
chooses the student that's why

166
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:57,319
you're like yes like I can't believe you

167
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,060
know for for me I felt honored when Ron

168
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,069
decided that I was kind of a similar

169
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,509
character to him and that he would bring

170
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,699
me under his wing and he would show me

171
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:08,149
things and put trust in me that was very

172
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,770
very like let's just say out there for

173
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:11,810
the time being it was a huge

174
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:14,719
responsibility and level of trust

175
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,459
pharmacy bros what Ron put into me when

176
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,850
I was very young just just out of my

177
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:23,448
teenage years really and so not quite

178
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:26,180
the same but similar with skunkman Sam

179
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:29,090
who you know put a huge trust and faith

180
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,740
in me by showing me his technique you

181
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:33,559
know something that I could have easily

182
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,690
blown up and shown the entire world and

183
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,598
just been a liar and and my word not

184
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:41,719
been worth [ __ ] but he he put his his

185
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,550
faith and his trust in me and generally

186
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,980
when one of my elders puts their faith

187
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:50,509
and their trust in me I will go to great

188
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:53,690
lengths great lengths to maintain that

189
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:55,250
integrity well you know I met Ron by

190
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,100
going into his hydroponics store

191
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,870
I met skunkman Sam by having a booth at

192
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,060
the Cannabis Cup and doing bubble bag

193
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,549
utter hash and popularizing full melt

194
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:08,528
resins which he had been living for 20

195
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:11,299
years already and yeah that's sort of uh

196
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:13,458
yeah there are a couple of Ron Hickey

197
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:15,649
videos up the grand chiming to his house

198
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:17,088
in the Kootenays and there's one called

199
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,879
feeding your endocannabinoids system

200
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,830
where we do lunch breakfast together we

201
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:25,700
make bubble together out on his deck I

202
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,900
think we do a tour of his grow but I'm

203
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,430
trying to get him out here I'm trying to

204
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,679
get him to move out from the Kootenays

205
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:33,579
get him back here out on the west coast

206
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:38,208
and try to do this greenhouse project so

207
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:40,550
Sam is a a man of many many things I

208
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:43,099
could not just call Sam ass if man of

209
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:45,289
course as a smoker he loves smoking sift

210
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,580
but he's much more than that he's a

211
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:52,490
master breeder he is he is like cannabis

212
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,770
incarnate he is just like he is he is

213
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,970
kept cannabis sorry I got a little bit

214
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:57,350
of the hiccups here maybe we should have

215
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,410
a bong rip maybe that'll get rid of my

216
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:03,028
hiccups what do you guys think

217
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:04,708
the reason I didn't take my bond rip

218
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:06,480
right away there was because a friend of

219
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:10,229
mine told me when you first fill the

220
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,240
torch that it's best to not turn it on

221
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,089
right away I guess there's a seal inside

222
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,310
the torch that gets cold when you put

223
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:20,010
the gas in because it's quite cold and

224
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:22,439
that seal can blow and the torch will

225
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:24,389
start leaking gas even when it's not on

226
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,420
and it won't hold gas anymore and I was

227
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:29,370
like what a great tip for torch culture

228
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,319
I was thinking that I messed mine up and

229
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,970
I wasn't turning it off enough but I

230
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,940
guess I had just pooched the previous

231
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,100
one by putting in fuel and then lighting

232
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,310
it up literally like a minute later so

233
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:45,050
might be something you wanted wha

234
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:47,039

235

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:08,639
we gotta celebrate not just the

273
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,879
birthdays Tommy but we got to celebrate

274
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,629
the deaths as well I they're sad and it

275
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:15,838
sounds weird

276
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:17,399
but do you want to celebrate your loved

277
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,220
ones or do you want to mourn them and

278
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,629
that's you know mourning is natural I

279
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,610
don't think it's a choice that we we

280
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:24,299
choose it just happens and everyone does

281
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,089
it differently

282
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:29,159
but if we could choose what we want to

283
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:31,829
do is we want to celebrate our loved

284
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,269
ones our friends and our family those

285
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:35,939
that's that's what we want to do we want

286
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:43,379
to celebrate them so that's what we

287
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:45,540
shall do yeah man I lost my father

288
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:47,458
suddenly very different from it sounds

289
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:49,289
like the way you're going through it my

290
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,969
father was taken from me very suddenly

291
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:53,818
in a motorcycle accident along with his

292
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,149
wife and it was shocking and it affected

293
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:59,139
me in a way that I had

294
00:13:55,149 --> 00:14:01,929
no idea could affect me so I have you

295
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:06,269
know empathy for people who are going

296
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:07,769
through losing their parents or any

297
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:12,220
[Music]

298
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:14,500
loved one for that matter well that's

299
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,210
still pretty fresh and II for me it was

300
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,480
ten years plus and I was still feeling

301
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:22,480
it very very very very strongly

302
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,490
yeah well water it's a crazy thing right

303
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,620
it can create some serious anxiety it

304
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,500
can create some intensity we we in our

305
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,960
culture have not really prepared

306
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,730
ourselves properly I mean you see how we

307
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,440
go to school they don't prepare us for

308
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,960
anything they don't teach us about banks

309
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,600
and loans and paying taxes and

310
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,040
businesses and equity and purchasing and

311
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,120
like all of the important things that

312
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,559
you would think that you should be

313
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,110
getting ready for in life they don't

314
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,289
teach you about so why would they teach

315
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,899
you about death why would they have any

316
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:54,610
inkling to want to share knowledge why

317
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:57,009
would we want to celebrate it right we

318
00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:00,310
just mourn it in our culture and because

319
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:02,950
we mourn it it's um it's not celebrated

320
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:04,179
it's not discussed too much and even

321
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,430
when people are going through it it's

322
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:07,959
uncomfortable for other people you know

323
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:09,159
it's almost like they don't want to hear

324
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,500
it even though they're there it's like

325
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,209
I'm there for you but it's like I don't

326
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,610
want to hear about death it's like I

327
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:18,550
don't want to die it's like well guess

328
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,080
what we all get to go there together it

329
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:22,509
seems like a pretty crazy thing that

330
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,129
we're all like one of the one things

331
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:27,399
we're all gonna share in common is that

332
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:29,259
we're all going to die that's a pretty

333
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,949
heavy conversation that I can't believe

334
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:35,049
more people aren't having but I guess it

335
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:38,290
is what it is people are freaked out

336
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:40,209
it's yeah take some psychedelics and

337
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:42,789
you'll see it's not quite as scary there

338
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:44,860
are different levels to this [ __ ] and

339
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:46,240
this is just one of the current levels

340
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,149
that we're experiencing now I don't just

341
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,950
call it just one because personally I

342
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:54,149
think it's probably one of the most

343
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:57,070
valuable and one of the most precious

344
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:59,470
experiences to have in the grand scheme

345
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:03,490
of things when you think of the concept

346
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:06,730
of all life you know soul energy coming

347
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:09,009
from a single source a whole a one

348
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:11,589
and then fractioning off into what we

349
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:14,439
know as this experience and then going

350
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,149
back into that hole well it seems like

351
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,639
if we came from there and we're going

352
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:21,159
from there this right here is the

353
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,269
experience take the third hit all right

354
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:27,039
I'll take the third hit let's do it

355
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:33,839
yeah we all came from the same place too

356
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:38,069
which is pretty trippy I'm down I'm down

357
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,019
all right he's ready for a third rib

358
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,240
three is a charm

359
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:45,759
three is a cosmic number and if you

360
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,620
haven't checked out cosmic trigger by

361
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,088
Robert Anton Wilson well that was one of

362
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:55,889
the first books that got me into all

363
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:55,889
sorts of crazy volume one two and three

364
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:07,120
oh it's no burden let me tell ya hey

365
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,620
Harry Dolan welcome welcome you haven't

366
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,009
missed much we've just been hanging out

367
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:14,318
talking about you know [ __ ] like death

368
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:16,449
losing our loved ones fairly intense

369
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:20,289
conversations for a wake-and-bake but

370
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:23,620
you know what it's all it all needs to

371
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:26,438
be covered and I think that you know

372
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:28,149
much like our perspectives they're all

373
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,210
they all come from this one source

374
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,920
whatever perspective you want to look at

375
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,960
it through it's all sort of the same

376
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,320
thing and that's sort of sometimes hard

377
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,210
to understand but eat about six grams

378
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,099
and mushrooms in a dark room like

379
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:55,450
Terence said and you will understand

380
00:17:42,099 --> 00:18:03,939
quickly welcome Rob rosin glad you made

381
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:07,870
it - glad you made it - it's one of my

382
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,250
favorite songs standing on the moon such

383
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:13,299
a beautiful song if you can catch the

384
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:15,609
right live version of it Jerry just

385
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:18,720
baring his soul if you don't know

386
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:20,399
Grateful Dead standing on the moon

387
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,390
google it

388
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:29,190
YouTube it go listen to it listen him to

389
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,190
sing listen to him sing those lyrics

390
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:43,689
mushrooms in the dark room yeah Terence

391
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,579
Mckenna would say years ago that if you

392
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,289
want to crush your ego cuz for Terence

393
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:48,939
he what he saw in the psychedelic

394
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:51,190
experience was that a lot of people were

395
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,370
holding on to their egos they weren't

396
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,470
quite dissolving their egos fully they

397
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:58,599
were doing these one and two kind of you

398
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,100
know lighter trips and he kind of came

399
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:02,139
along and just said look if you just eat

400
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:05,349
like five and a half grams five to six

401
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,450
grams dried and then go into a dark room

402
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:10,730
not a pitch-black room but a dark room

403
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:13,100
that has shadow there it's it's

404
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,500
I can't even explain it it is more like

405
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:17,899
a DMT experience than a mushroom

406
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:22,970
experience it's definitely something

407
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:24,320
very very very very intense and we did

408
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,120
it in a room that had the smallest

409
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,250
amount of light and the light was

410
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:30,949
shining on a mandala that was hanging on

411
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,900
the full size of the wall and we laid

412
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,548
there with our heads to it and it was

413
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,960
one of the most experiences of my life

414
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:40,490
it was definitely one of the experiences

415
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,558
where I learned that the soul the

416
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,410
experience the you whoever that

417
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:47,178
experience is and - the ego because I'm

418
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:50,298
pretty sure the ego stays behind with

419
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:52,009
the body can leave it just can leave and

420
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:53,839
it's like it's not until you let go of

421
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:55,789
the ego that you can actually it's

422
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,619
almost like the ego is what traps the

423
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:59,629
soul in the body and through

424
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:02,029
psychedelics if you can crush the ego

425
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,160
enough blow it out of the room for four

426
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:05,990
or five hours you can really release the

427
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,100
soul and you can have these sort of

428
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:14,929
cosmic experiences that are above and

429
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:16,339
beyond most everyday experience so yeah

430
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:18,380
and you're looking down at yourself

431
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:23,289
exactly so when you can leave your body

432
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:25,580
but but without your ego pretty crazy I

433
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:28,480
don't know about that I definitely

434
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:31,220
didn't hear that Sven that's crazy

435
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,558
insane experience I hope that that's not

436
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:40,279
the truth and let's just hope that

437
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:41,750
that's not the truth yeah yeah I bet

438
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,428
there is something going on there well

439
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,740
it makes sense right because the ego is

440
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:48,890
what convinces you that you're you that

441
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,419
you is it when really it is not and it's

442
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,250
not until you blow the ego out that you

443
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:55,309
really experience that and it's very

444
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,929
sort of like you know it's an extremely

445
00:20:55,308 --> 00:21:00,019
psychedelic experience but it's very

446
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:01,700
touching soul searching experience that

447
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:04,039
can bring you to tears that can just

448
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,009
make you feel the most intense aw and

449
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:09,829
beauty and inspiration that you could

450
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:12,079
ever imagine I think that society should

451
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:13,668
have things set up for safe consumption

452
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,889
of these substances for places where

453
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:17,900
people can go much like the way you can

454
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,330
take your dog to a park or your kid to a

455
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,700
park there should be areas in nature

456
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:23,928
around cities that you can go to to

457
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,278
experience psychic

458
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:29,778
experiences you know amongst comforting

459
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:31,909
environments with with people who are

460
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:33,288
aware and with just like the whole

461
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:36,889
experience right you wouldn't want to

462
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:39,679
have like a big cat what do they call it

463
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:42,378
[ __ ] cotton candy machine or something

464
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,210
just at the psychedelic park that would

465
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:47,269
be no thanks we're not having any

466
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,379
soft-serve ice cream or cotton candy but

467
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:50,419
if you want to cut us up some fresh

468
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:52,730
slices of fruit and some ice waters

469
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:58,369
maybe some bowls of hashish that would

470
00:21:52,730 --> 00:22:00,759
be on point for certain yeah that's what

471
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:00,759
I'm saying

472
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:09,859
yep great idea right I mean it's

473
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:11,569
important why are we forced to go do

474
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:12,829
this in a place first of all like we're

475
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:15,918
not supposed to be doing what we're

476
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:17,898
doing that creates right off the bat you

477
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,879
know there's intention that's not your

478
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:21,618
intention that becomes a part of your

479
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:24,319
experience and this is of course where

480
00:22:21,618 --> 00:22:26,509
the smaller doses and the ego holding on

481
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,638
and fear falling into place that can

482
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:29,868
really throw people off and they'll say

483
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,368
how I had a bad experience on that

484
00:22:29,868 --> 00:22:32,449
substance it's like are you sure you

485
00:22:31,368 --> 00:22:34,788
didn't have a bad experience on that

486
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,350
substance because you know people say

487
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:37,609
that substance is illegal and you're not

488
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:39,829
supposed to do it so you have this

489
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:41,628
underlining feeling of like oh I'm doing

490
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:43,908
something wrong or I don't want to

491
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:45,558
interact with the within authority or

492
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:48,980
law enforcement right now any of those

493
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:51,740
energies and thoughts while tripping can

494
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:57,009
direct you in ways of places that you

495
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:59,599
would not want to go in my opinion oh

496
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:02,149
I'm getting excited I'm getting calls

497
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,980
for for this video I'm gonna be filming

498
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:05,689
another video in a couple hours here and

499
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,839
that's going to be the JEP the team

500
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:10,700
Japan with dosa Cup I believe doses in

501
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:12,678
the cup as well like he was there I know

502
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,690
that they made some pendants him and

503
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,778
Yoshinori but I'm pretty sure he'll be

504
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:21,230
in the cup as well so we'll check it out

505
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:23,240
I'll go we'll go see what's going on

506
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:26,349
I'll bring the 4k camera take it out

507
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,929
onto the the deck and film it in the Sun

508
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:31,908
super super stoked to see this it's too

509
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:33,649
bad almost that I posted the video but

510
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:35,778
whatever this can be the second part

511
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:37,908
it's going to be very short I

512
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:39,769
not sure if the artists themselves will

513
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:41,778
be there if they are I'll try to get a

514

00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:26,929
hitting his dab and walking away What

530
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,210
did he say he said I want to see it come

531
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:32,028
on we know someone's gonna post it in

532
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:38,058
the chat room we got a city we got to

533
00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:41,118
see it respect to the dabbas respect to

534
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:44,450
the dabbas yeah dude you got a go bro

535
00:24:41,118 --> 00:24:47,988
you gotta go it's kind of intense to

536
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:51,739
have that kind of like intense just like

537
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:53,119
horrible horrible hatred and it's just

538
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:56,538
quite the opposite of what we're all

539
00:24:53,118 --> 00:25:00,648
about isn't it trying to create division

540
00:24:56,538 --> 00:25:03,278
you know by whatever it can be to divide

541
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:07,128
men and women it can be to divide

542
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:09,798
straight and gays it can be divide white

543
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:11,959
and and colored it can be anything that

544
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:14,628
they can get their hands on to create

545
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:19,308
division and of course we all know it's

546
00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:21,348
to divide and conquer so this is silly

547
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:23,418
these are like some socially sociopathic

548
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:25,788
maniacs that came up with these concepts

549
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:29,269
so if you find yourself thinking in

550
00:25:25,788 --> 00:25:31,729
these ways you know I would say start

551
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:33,888
consuming cannabis in a big way you

552
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:35,619
definitely hey take it easy Indra thanks

553
00:25:33,888 --> 00:25:38,778
for coming in brother have a great day

554
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:40,398
we'll see you when we see you probably

555
00:25:38,778 --> 00:25:43,429
on tomorrow's wake-and-bake

556
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:45,228
I would suspect hopefully yes we are

557
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:47,629
less powerful divided that is a very

558
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:48,980
true story there's a crazy like cartoon

559
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:51,349
called ants

560
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:54,079
that they did in like the late 90s maybe

561
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:57,019
98 or something and it's one of these

562
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,849
kids cartoons but you know the wasps all

563
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:00,589
have the ants working for them and

564
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:02,629
making their food and it's like there's

565
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:04,278
not that many wasps and they're they

566
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:07,130
kind of talk about man if these ants

567
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:09,859
ever figured out how easily they could

568
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,330
control us it's really heavy-duty if you

569
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,949
haven't seen that movie you should check

570
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:14,928
it out because there is a whole lot of

571
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,130
[ __ ] going on in there and a bug's life

572
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:19,370
right

573
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:22,250
they are definitely dealing with some

574
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:25,599
heavy stories underlining of a simple

575
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:29,659
cartoon that I'm almost blown away that

576
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:32,658
that it was able to get produced and

577
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:34,490
made into a movie I do need like a troll

578
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:36,740
Bell exactly all someone would have to

579
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:38,720
do was hit the troll Bell and I'd be

580
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,220
like oh looks like the hammer needs to

581
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,259
be dropped then again I could just make

582
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,240
a bunch of you guys moderators in the

583
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:45,888
room and you guys could be hammering

584
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,099
people but the funny thing is when you

585
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:51,740
do that sometimes people get out of hand

586
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:52,939
it's like yeah and then the next thing

587
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,548
you know I'm getting emails saying hey

588
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,288
that guy banned me by accident it's also

589
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:59,058
hard sometimes to ban people because as

590
00:26:57,288 --> 00:27:00,710
you guys are chatting I'm trying to

591
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:02,690
catch his name and push the thing next

592
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,009
to his name if I go to push it and it

593
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,350
moves up one well then I've just

594
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:09,230
accidentally banned someone who didn't

595
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:11,418
deserve to be banned and we still have

596
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:16,460
to listen to the hateful spewing z' of a

597
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:20,778
[ __ ] seriously insecure possibly just

598
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:22,579
upset dude or woman I don't know I think

599
00:27:20,778 --> 00:27:25,429
people are upset I think people are

600
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:27,648
stressed out and I think people are you

601
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:29,840
know whacked out on bad diets and

602
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:32,329
alcohol and tobacco and caffeine and

603
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,158
Pharma these are all things that are

604
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:37,428
gonna be hectic on your nervous system I

605
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,309
can't even imagine all of them holy [ __ ]

606
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:43,759
I mean recently I saw that the actor who

607
00:27:40,308 --> 00:27:46,398
played Lafayette on True Blood just died

608
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,839
at 39 I was like how the [ __ ] did he die

609
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,028
and then they're like oh he stopped

610
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,849
drinking alcohol he was a heavy

611
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:55,398
alcoholic he was he stopped drinking

612
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:57,819
alcohol and his body went into full

613
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:02,219
failure his heart just couldn't keep up

614
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:04,259
how hard core of a drug is alcohol

615
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,298
that it can stop your heart if you drink

616
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:09,359
too much of it and then stop drinking it

617
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:12,990
that to me is demonic that is like a

618
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:15,000
demonic possession that got so deep into

619
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,500
him that he could not get it out it's

620
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,048
like where they tell you oh no we can't

621
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:22,109
get the demon out they'll die it's like

622
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:24,629
whoa alcohol is not a drug it is a

623
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:27,839
spirit they call that sit that shit's

624
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:29,760
spirits for many many years and it

625
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,949
freaks me out I definitely am NOT like

626
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,408
inspired to try and prohibit anything

627
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:36,390
but it would be nice if humanity came to

628
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:39,780
the conclusion that alcohol is a [ __ ]

629
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:42,480
Conn much like what John Mayer just said

630
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:45,779
recently in a rolling stone interview

631
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,220
saying alcohol is a [ __ ] con I never

632
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:49,710
felt like I could get enough it's the

633
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,140
ultimate chasing of the Dragon and more

634
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,730
worse than that you know the chasing of

635
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,280
the Dragon just leads you into deep

636
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:59,250
opioid addiction and usually it's not a

637
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:01,048
pretty sight alcohol addiction seems to

638
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,880
be more socially acceptable and you can

639
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:04,440
just operate it throughout your whole

640
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,510
life people that are just hardcore

641
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,340
alcoholics waking up and strapping on a

642
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:11,179
gun and going and being a cop or

643
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:13,619
whatever it's pretty [ __ ] up

644
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:15,179
everything in moderation I'm down with a

645
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,250
little moderation myself

646
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:19,200
I personally don't enjoy alcohol because

647
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,359
I grew up for what I consider Winnipeg

648
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,308
was like an incubator of alcoholics it

649
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,709
was a lot of people drinking alcohol on

650
00:29:23,308 --> 00:29:28,048
an abusive level and it freaked me out

651
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,659
to be honest the energy freaked me out

652
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:32,250
completely I didn't like it I just sort

653
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:34,650
of tried to stay away from it I don't

654
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,390
really like bars you know I don't like

655
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,880
concerts where they're serving alcohol

656
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:42,419
because there's just gonna be people who

657
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,120
are completely unpredictable that will

658
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:50,159
be there you know abusing alcohol to the

659
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:52,139
most insane level yes a lot do leather a

660
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,520
lot do I mean if you're drinking a lot

661
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:59,520
of booze you're probably smoking a lot

662
00:29:53,519 --> 00:30:00,900
of cigs you know yeah it's true well

663
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,730
let's talk about something a little more

664
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,288
happy Brett Armstrong like feeding our

665
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,058
endocannabinoids systems the polar

666
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:08,990
opposites of all the drugs that says

667
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:12,148
they want you on Alcohol Tobacco

668
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:14,000
caffeine sugar and a shitty shitty

669
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:15,559
shitty shitty diet if

670
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,539
they can have you on all those things

671
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:19,639
and not using cannabis they've

672
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:21,829
definitely won the game that is their

673
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,780
most profitable agenda so what are we

674
00:30:21,829 --> 00:30:25,429
going to do we're going to try and cut

675
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:27,410
down on our sugar and our caffeine

676
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:29,450
intake we're gonna try and stop smoking

677
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:31,970
radioactive cigarettes completely and

678
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,160
maybe alcohol completely just for a

679
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,750
while to get it out of the brain to get

680
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,050
it out of the system so you can feel

681
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:41,690
what you feel like being it's good to

682
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:43,789
know what you feel like being and you

683
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,830
know if you are drinking for reasons

684
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:47,899
that you're trying to numb and uncover

685
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:50,569
potentially not drinking and using

686
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,300
cannabis instead will stimulate thoughts

687
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:55,220
about those different issues and instead

688
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:58,220
of burying them you can dig them up and

689
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:00,289
maybe plant a seed of positivity in

690
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,960
there and then start feeding that every

691
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:05,899
day because you know the old story the

692
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,690
native story of the grandfather telling

693
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,210
his grandson that there is a battle

694
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:13,730
going on in each of us with two wolves

695
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:15,710
and you know there's the good side the

696
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:18,410
white wolf and the black wolf as he says

697
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:20,480
and the the little grandsons like which

698
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,759
which wolf is gonna win and he says well

699
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,170
that depends on which one you feed are

700
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:25,369
you gonna feed your light or are you

701
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,680
gonna feed your darkness

702
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:29,959
maybe moderation maybe a little bit of

703
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:36,019
both but I prefer to feed as much light

704
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:38,720
as possible yeah do you enjoy eating

705
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:40,250
root vegetables like cassava yeah I like

706
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,900
some root vegetables absolutely I mean

707
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:45,049
when I'm in Jamaica I'm actually getting

708
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:48,080
a lot more access to that than I am of

709
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:50,539
course Irish I have the Irish blood in

710
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,259
me so I do love me a good potato I'm not

711
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:54,920
gonna lie

712
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:57,109
I'm actually like a potato fiend I could

713
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,310
eat potatoes for it with every meal a

714
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:00,649
hundred different ways

715
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:01,819
I [ __ ] love potatoes maybe that's

716
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,430
something you didn't know about me guys

717
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:06,200
but I'm sharing it right now

718
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:09,470
guilty food pleasure oh I don't know

719
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,690
maybe Pizza I love pizza I've had it all

720
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:15,799
different ways from raw pizza to vegan

721
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:17,000
pizza you know full meat pizza I was not

722
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:21,230
always a vegetarian

723
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:32,900
oh this banger is rather large it's not

724
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:36,430
just you medicated pizza you've been

725
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,430
watching Samuel you've been watching

726
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:44,389
there you go Devil's harvest although I

727
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:46,699
will tell people who are trying to feed

728
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:48,170
their endocannabinoids systems that

729
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,940
smoking joints although will be a great

730
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:54,769
way to stimulate appetites and induce

731
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:57,710
sleep and reduce ocular pressure but and

732
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:59,210
do a whole variety of other things oral

733
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,829
consumption of it on the daily is

734
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,809
something I would definitely say is a

735
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:05,149
good idea as a preventative whether you

736
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:06,950
eat a little bit when you wake up or eat

737
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,570
a little bit when you go to bed or both

738
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:12,710
and some in the middle of the day I

739
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:15,079
don't know but you should definitely be

740
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,400
doing it because it's a it's a good

741
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:18,799
thing to do feeding your

742
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,690
endocannabinoids system through oral

743
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,319
consumption not just the smoking of

744
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:26,630
cannabis so try to do that on the daily

745
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:31,009
anyway I think that we are good to go

746
