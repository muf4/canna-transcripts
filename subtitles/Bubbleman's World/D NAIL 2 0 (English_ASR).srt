19
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:08,239
like that there's a lot of stuff so turn

20
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:10,438
it around too well first off first out

21
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,438
the

22
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:16,599
box we have the

23
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,719
whips so this

24
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:22,959
is uh titanium nail post whip same as

25
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:27,519
the original one that I have cool that

26
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,839
one very cool very cool um oh here's the

27
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,640
quartz

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,560
one

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,159
this one is the quartz whip same thing

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,320
right there um these were actually all

31
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,840
packaged up obviously when John walked

32
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,000
in it wasn't the first time he walked in

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,240
we just wanted to let you know we wanted

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,799
to show everyone Us opening the box we

35
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,158
opened it real quick and then we put it

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,960
back in here so when you see us pulling

37
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,320
things out that aren't wrapped up don't

38
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,039
think the guys at denail aren't

39
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,199
packaging this impeccably they are they

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
did and we were stoked but we're sharing

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,680
it with you new now as if we're opening

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,280
it for the first time which really about

43
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,320
20 minutes ago we opened it for the

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,399
first time so here's a new product um

45
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,798
this is the

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,479
new post heater you can see the old one

47
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,599
here little bit of a different product

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,360
it's got the nail already screwed in

49
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:18,479
there which I did just a few minutes

50
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:22,080
ago get that out oh it's spinning up top

51
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,479
that might H so that's the new post

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,519
heater a little bit different I'll be

53
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,399
taking good photos of all these products

54
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,280
as well so we can get a good idea

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,120
uh it's always nice to see them up you

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,919
know really close that's the titanium

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,640
now that was pretty cool when I saw the

58
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,679
post um okay let's pull the well this

59
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,518
these are the two power

60
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,959
cords um I'm going to plug it in the two

61
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,280
sections one thing we haven't done was

62
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,840
we have not plugged in we have no idea

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,680
what the part's going to look yes and

64
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,759
this secondary power cord it came and I

65
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,400
looked at it I thought it was a little

66
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,560
bit strange and lo and behold it comes

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,560
with a remote control that allows you to

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,640
turn the unit on from a distance so I

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,400
thought thought that was a really pretty

70
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,559
cool little I mean not that I mind

71
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,879
leaning over and clicking my denail on

72
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,400
but I have to admit I thought that was

73
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,518
pretty cool of them all right so you

74
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,719
want to get that on there do you well I

75
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,519
was thinking maybe seemed like you were

76
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,759
having a bit of a difficulty well no I

77
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,840
was deciding if I was going to tear into

78
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:21,399
it got to do it if I was going to cut it

79
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,959
got to tear tear

80
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,560
tear so like when I got the call I was

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,199
uh I was actually at um canas culture

82
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,479
chq and talking with the the people

83
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,518
there

84
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,199
and all right you want to plug that into

85
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,319
the wall around the corner there I'd go

86
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:41,639
the other side go all right so here hold

87
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:45,719
this we'll get rid of this

88
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,919
box now here's the new 2.0 denail custom

89
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,759
Bubble Man Edition sweet I thought that

90
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,039
was really really cool let we put that

91
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,039
little was really awesome they've got

92
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:57,560
dry sip gland heads which is probably

93
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:59,359
your dry sift cuz I sent them photos I

94
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,438
can't remember if it was yours or Sam's

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,400
or mine or but it's it's very likely it

96
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,959
could be yours and then they did my logo

97
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,120
in there really did a great job on that

98
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,280
the unit is quite a bit smaller than the

99
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,319
last denail I'm uh I have one here it's

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,879
unfortunately not a plastic uh just a

101
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,918
plastic bodied one just give it a little

102
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:23,360
unplug so I can show you guys the wood

103
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:27,198
box version is right here and here's the

104
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,319
2.0 next to it so obviously the wooden

105
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,520
box is um addition

106
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,599
size added there's a smaller unit inside

107
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,839
there but it gives you a pretty good

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,919
idea that you know I'd say they cut this

109
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:43,079
denail down by about at least one3 and

110
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:43,079
close to half it's pretty good

111
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:50,038
eh I'm like I love it oh I'm going to

112
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:51,879
hit you're getting the first hit out of

113
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:53,279
it how about that oh wow look at the

114
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,759
colors in that oh can I have that of the

115
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,239
box I wanted to actually open those all

116
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:00,439
out if that's

117
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,918
possible thanks brother

118
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,038
so this was typed and it says oh bubble

119
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:07,959
man bub man all right so this should

120
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,599
also have yes that little guy goes there

121
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:14,279
so these

122
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:17,120
three three new quartz pieces that they

123
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,478
sent these are a long time coming cuz

124
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,720
they've watched me use everything from a

125
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:24,519
rure bowl to a can9 pipe and these are

126
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,199
quartz I believe they're quartz um carb

127
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:28,680
caps and so there's the quartz bowl and

128
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,280
you can see instead of going around the

129
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,720
outside of the bowl it actually fits

130
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,758
around the inside and makes it a lot

131
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,160
more

132
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:43,439
stable check that guy out there's the

133
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:47,120
bowl and I think they sent a couple more

134
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:50,160
versions let's see what we got

135
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,560
here oh wow fancy how about that one how

136
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,520
about that one it's like a little

137
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,959
mushroom top with a little head on it

138
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:01,680
there cool cool that would that would

139
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,519
snug in is it yeah oh nice I like The

140
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,079
Snug that one snug well the other one

141
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,198
wasn't as snug as you already felt it

142
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:10,800
right yeah that is nice snug I like very

143
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:15,759
nice so we got that one we got that one

144
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,160
we got this last one before we can hey

145
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,479
we've got to try this remote control

146
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,039
thing too probably

147
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:26,038
uh so what do you do you just turn it on

148
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:29,839
oh wait we got to put the whip in first

149
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:32,918
so there's the other uh uh carb cap

150
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,679
quite nice it's got slits on the inside

151
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:36,399
that go on the outside oh yeah those are

152
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,360
slits that's an outside one that's an

153
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:42,399
outside one for sure no and it's also a

154
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,199
Dabber will that be for the titanium

155
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:47,439
this one's also a Dabber I'm not too

156
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,560
sure see you could carve with that

157
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,399
that's how my carbs would fit but I'd

158
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,199
say that's just as good I I'm pretty

159
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,519
sure he knows I hit only with quartz but

160
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,160
we'll ask Brian should we be using these

161
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,120
with the quartz or the tie or can we use

162
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,240
them with both probably doesn't matter I

163
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,720
think we're about to use them allall

164
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,598
right now we're

165
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,599
going we are why you think I'm here look

166
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,319
at me I know you're you're ready

167
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,319
actually John off camera already took

168
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:16,960
the most gigantic of rips so he's

169
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:19,280
completely I well rounded right now oh I

170
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,159
would say just uh functioning a lot

171
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,598
better yeah that was some of d420 K's

172
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
dry sift that you hit there out of the

173
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,120
Swiss perk that's a nice thing all right

174
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,359
so there's our little remote control

175
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,800
here's our whip cuz we're going to go

176
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,840
quartz we are going to go quartz John

177
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,079
and of course we're going to hit that

178
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,918
mother ship yes we'll pull out the

179
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,680
mothership for this this is uh the

180
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:46,079
cleaner of the two bongs that I have so

181
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:49,360
probably course got yes me as well I

182
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,359
have some very nice full melt dry sift

183
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,560
but uh if you want to fill yourself up a

184
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,000
bowl of your own first I totally

185
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,639
understand I'm going to smoke the dryft

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,360
which dryft well we're going to have the

187
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,720
dryft that we have from DK I yes I have

188
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,400
some dry sift from d420 K and then I

189
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,080
also have some dry sift that I

190
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:11,038
made from from their resin I actually

191
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:13,158
have that here too Yesa that's what you

192
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:17,959
made you're on

193
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:20,759
it okay so shall we plug this whip in

194
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,758
and see

195
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,519
uh all right let's try this unit out and

196
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,918
see see what she's

197
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:37,360
saying got this part in between that I

198
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:39,120
don't quite understand it is plugged in

199
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,000
see if we got to turn this

200
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,799
on I suspect this has no batteries no

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,759
that has no batteries so here let's take

202
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:49,039
this and plug it in direct without the

203
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,360
remote

204
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,120
control and that

205
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,000
way I think we'll get our

206
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,799
temperature yeah it's turning on it's on

207
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,120
at 72 right now

208
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:03,120
there's a battery oh you got a little

209
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,159
battery in

210
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,360
there and the battery is not F so let's

211
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,360
see what temperature we're going

212
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,399
to all right she's

213
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,240
climbing I love getting new toys you

214
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,480
never know you know you never know I

215
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,680
remember the first time I got my first

216
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,560
denail it has two switches at the back

217
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,679
of it and I had only hit the one and I

218
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,239
completely thought that it was not

219
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:35,120
working and in the end it was working

220
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,560
Beyond perfectly I just had to sort of

221
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,799
get on my own uh uh inability to use it

222
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,518
so we're climbing up 294

223
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:45,919
312

224
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,519
332 wow it's a nice little small unit

225
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,399
I'll tell you excellent well we'll plug

226
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,639
that in in a bit and we'll try it out

227
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,559
cuz that's pretty cool I know I just

228
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,278
like had a you know it wasn't working I

229
00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:00,278
was like check it out it's got a button

230
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,879
yeah lights up it's it will work but

231
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:04,799
we'd have to plug it back into uh this

232
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,958
little piece right here that came with

233
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:10,599
it and I guess got sound it does but it

234
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,599
doesn't really

235
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,078
explain I guess it just has this little

236
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,440
button you push the button and this

237
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:21,759
little button goes on

238
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,120
guaranteed well should we try

239
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,519
it we'll let this let's we got to let

240
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,480
this get up what are we at 6:30 I know

241
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,679
we just got to plug that in and plug Ang

242
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,039
controls that WR oh I like how it's

243
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:36,599
lowered my bowl on my last um denail I

244
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:40,278
they sent me an 18 by mistake and I all

245
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,720
my bongs are 14 so I have this piece

246
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:44,439
between my denail and the and the pipe

247
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,480
and it was it was putting the nail right

248
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,320
here so this is going to be oh wow yeah

249
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,560
I just noticed that right now quite a

250
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,760
nice treat to smoke like that last time

251
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,078
we were doing it and that thing was

252
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,919
getting a little close yeah even now

253
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:57,000
when I was carving you on this one it

254
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:59,199
was touching your hat I know so we do

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,720
what we have to do we're not too fussy

256
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,680
but it is nice when things can work out

257
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,278
a little better than uh than

258
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,120
that I think they did a really nice job

259
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,360
like that's just like you know what the

260

00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,600
gives me this quality of life you know

326
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,198
what that's important for people to see

327
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,759
you know in the world of the internet I

328
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:40,838
know that it's great that people love to

329
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:43,000
assume large big you show only pictures

330
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,519
of colas for the longest time and you

331
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,519
know for me as a photographer I've gone

332
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,879
into many many many Gardens and I've

333
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:51,198
actually had gardeners ask me like not

334
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,958
to shoot their distance shots they want

335
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,639
macro shots but they don't want me

336
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,039
shooting their Garden from the door you

337
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,198
know they're like oh it's not that great

everything have to be a multi-million

342
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,560
dollar grow room you can grow this plant

the wall so I knew right away that it

401
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,639
went on just again a really cool little

402
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:53,120
thing obviously you could probably buy

403
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,839
this component yourself but it's they're

404
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,839
adding it it's important to support the

405
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,560
people that are pioneering the ideas who

406
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,920
are making these things work it's it's

407
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,799
not always the most important thing to

408
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,719
try and oh I could probably go buy one

409
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,279
of these from it's like support these

410
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,400
guys they're doing good things and I I'm

411
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:10,279
just really stoked to be uh to have

412
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,959
gotten turned on to the electronic mail

413
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:16,318
we got to bypass the torch thing we

414
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,919
never torched I torched really remember

415
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,038
got little bit all these little videos

416
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,559
that I've done I torched and I would

417
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:24,078
torch I was I was dabbing dry sifts I

418
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,038
was doing that on all of these dab bars

419
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,558
that going I start dabbing dry with a

420
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:30,960
torch and people were like no way and

421
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,519
like the flavor was awesome so I was the

422
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,600
guy dab Dr so I was torching but I was D

423
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:39,720
Dr I totally bypass torching yeah I did

424
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,519
I never I don't I've never owned one you

425
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,200
puffed and then you went right into a

426
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,759
sublimator and then you went right into

427
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,798
the D had the Ember yeah I you know the

428
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,519
ember's great very very tasty flavor

429
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,038
saver I sometimes Miss putting the

430
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:56,960
screen on there of with the full melt

431
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:58,640
and bubble hash or it just looks proper

432
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,079
you know yeah this here you don't really

433
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,679
get to see it as much but you can but um

434
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,199
like when I'm at home on my bong is nice

435
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,400
to see that he's like it's true I'm

436
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,440
going to put like a little what is that

437
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:14,000
so this is the the final thing and I

438
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:17,000
believe I believe this is a a ceramic

439
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,119
insert that will fit

440
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,640
inside oh they sealed it off for

441
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:27,038
sure we put dry on there all it's the

442
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,600
it's the the flavor saver apparently so

443
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,640
oh that one okay you would know you know

444
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:34,678
this is ceramic instead of titanium so

445
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:38,919
little white disc tie nail

446
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:41,120
fits right in there and it actually sits

447
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:44,000
right on top I thought it actually

448
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:47,439
settled down into it no wej from that we

449
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,240
have to we have to do some uh I wonder

450
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,840
if it fits on the quartz as well

451
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,839
wouldn't that be wonderful just I bet

452
00:18:52,839 --> 00:19:00,319
you it does throw it

453
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:00,319
on at like just throw it on know

454
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:05,319
wow

455
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:12,798
interesting little ceramic

456
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:14,519
insert I guess we got to have a hit of

457
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,679
that I

458
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:21,839
guess it definitely makes it to me

459
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,840
seem like the way it fits anyway first

460
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,879
bounce beautiful the way it fits is not

461
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,158
something you'd want to pass around I

462
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,600
think the way this is sit there you'd

463
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,240
want to put the pipe where you need it

464
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:36,319
and then take the hit right off of it do

465
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,359
you want me to load it up for

466
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:43,599
you what do you want what would you like

467
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:46,199
John you want your first bounce yeah

468
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,918
this is this oh it's so tasty you're

469
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,519
you're the one hitting it first so you

470
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,480
can tell me on the way

471
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:55,319
out cool first one to hit the ceramic

472
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,000
flavor saver

473
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:01,359
disc you think it's hot um

474
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,240
well I don't think ceramic is going to

475
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,599
take very long to max out on its

476
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,000
temperature but we could give it a few

477
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,158
more minutes cuz I can honestly be

478
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,960
honest I don't know yeah I'm no expert

479
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,520
on Titanium or quartz or ceramic I

480
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,679
listen to a lot of you guys argue on the

481
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,240
internet and I find it somewhat

482
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,360
laughable particularly when people say

483
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,120
that the titanium is medical grade I I

484
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,279
hope you guys understand that means that

485
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,479
it's uh graded to be put inside

486
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:29,158
someone's body not to heat up red hot

487
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,240
and smoke resin off of I got some

488
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,360
medical titani of course you do but it's

489
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,000
medical grade why I know because it's in

490
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,719
my neck but they're arguing that it's

491
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,279
medical grade and that's why it's better

492
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,720
to smoke off of yeah I'm going to take

493
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,158
them the tiny amount of my neck and

494
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,360
smoke on it do neck

495
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,919
dabs maybe you could just bend a piece

496
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:49,959
out put the little hole there you could

497
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:52,038
dab come on anyway we're just be

498
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,120
babbling but honestly I don't pretend to

499
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:56,119
know the most about this I'm bioassaying

500
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:59,558
it all I don't like the idea of the

501
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:01,359
metal as much as quartz ceramic seems

502
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,399
pretty cool but from what I've read

503
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,119
there's qualities of ceramic so I guess

504
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,360
that's another thing to do research on

505
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,399
it's important for you guys to do your

506
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:11,319
own research John can let us know about

507
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,320
taste right in a minute

508
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,480
here how was

509
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,360
that tell us John tell

510
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,640
us as you can see the size of that

511
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,639
hoop and the

512
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,120
flavors I mean some was left on the

513
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:52,319
Dabber oh I know it was melting on but

514
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:55,759
wow it looked killer I think it might be

515
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,759
a better one to dab with

516
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,519
snakes snake wow I got a nice little rip

517
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,400
from that that was like a thing this is

518
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,480
just literally the tiny little bit that

519
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,480
you didn't

520
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,519
finish probably be a better idea with

521
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,839
the with this particular stuff to to dab

522
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,839
it's

523
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:28,519
good oh look at that D that was

524
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,558
beautiful

525
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,519
that was two great big clear domes like

526
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,720
you would believe yeah see that that

527
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,240
that's what I we just talked about what

528
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,159
I was missing and then you pull that out

529
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,558
and then it's right

530
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,919
there so that would be your first bounce

531
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:44,918
so it's probably about

532
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,919
98%

533
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,000
97%

534
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,919
wow that's

535
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,839
interesting I like that I do

536
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:59,240
too we needed more than

537
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:01,480
one break that one

538
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,558
no I mean CU there's see what a cool

539
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,960
concept yeah we were just talking about

540
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:06,599
having to put a screen on there what I

541
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,440
was yeah literally and and kind of I

542
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:10,678
thought these inserted into the bowl I

543
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,120
really did I never thought they would

544
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,320
sit on top but I love the idea for

545
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,558
photography for the visual that the

546
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:18,278
thing we were missing that we were

547
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,480
literally just talking about I know

548
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:24,000
that's what was so cool about that was n

549
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,000
it doubled up like wow yeah oh huge

550
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,798
domes those would have made a great

551
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,759
video with the clean white ceramic in

552
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,119
the bubbling Dome that was beautiful

553
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:34,519
we'll try to get one it's dirty now I

554
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,798
don't know how clean I'm going to be

555
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:39,119
able to get the ceramic how porous it is

556
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,319
but maybe if I flame it I'll get it

557
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,278
white hot oh if you flame it that's

558
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,519
where you get like kind of anything I

559
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,240
don't have a flame though isn't that

560
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,798
ridiculous it's why this quartz nail has

561
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:53,880
never been cleaned I need to torch that

562
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:55,558
thing anyway thanks for joining us we

563
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,720
babbled on for longer than we need to

564
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:00,158
but really the bottom line is the denail

565
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,640
is is a killer product when combined

566
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,400
with a pipe like the mothership and a

567
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,559
quality resin like what John myself and

568
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,038
D4

569
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:12,639
20K have been sharing with you all to

570
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:15,240
make wet wash uh water hash and dry

571
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,759
sifted just give some education on clean

572
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,880
sift yeah when those three are combined

573
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,119
wow they're just an

574
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,559
absolute P

575
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:26,879
