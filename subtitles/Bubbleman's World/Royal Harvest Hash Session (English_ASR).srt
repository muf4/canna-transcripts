[Music]

3
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,239
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

4
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,419
literally we're sitting on my deck here

5
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:30,538
in beautiful Lions Bay BC and I'm here

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,279
with Kevin from Royal Harvest and uh

7
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,920
first of all good to see you dude as

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,719
always brother he drove up from the

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,160
Okanagan so it was a good four or five

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,780
hour drive for you that's about a five

11
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,058
hour drive this morning but a beautiful

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,600
drive and worth it every time so Kevin

13
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:47,339
and I linked up through book club he had

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,600
an event at book club where he brought a

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,820
bunch of his flavors will you tell them

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,800
about it yeah I ended up getting

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,780
introduced to aldolfo there at book club

18
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,718
and we started talking about bringing

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,539
some flour in as I got involved with the

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,160
book book club chat I noticed that uh

21
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,899
Marcus had reached out with some

22
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,298
interest of uh looking in to see what my

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,519
flower could do so we ended up uh

24
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,979
coordinating a Time came down here uh

25
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,719
had a lot of fun he taught me

26
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:15,179
um I've always been about the flower I

27
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,459
started this at a very young age 12. um

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,900
in a necessity to help family and I've

29
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,239
been focused on really trying to

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,159
generate and create the best flower I

31
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,899
can so it was very interesting when

32
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,240
Marcus reached out to me in regards to

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,580
making some half so I was more than

34
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,039
excited to come down bring him some of

35
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,019
my flour and he uh showed me the process

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,280
a little bit of making some hash and I

37
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,438
think we actually came up with some

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,118
absolutely uh nice product would you

39
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,938
think well we have many many jars

40
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,719
sitting over here I'd say about 30 or 28

41
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:48,899
yeah at least 25 to 30 jars of product

42
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:51,000
we ran three different varieties 100

43
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,978
grams of each so

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,438
well below the threshold of the five

45
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,658
gallon bubble now and five gallon bubble

46
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,879
bag kit we ran it through the eight bags

47
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,159
through the labs we did it here at my

48
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,719
house and unfortunately we didn't film

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,700
that video there was a lot of work to be

50
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,798
done I'm just noticing as well I didn't

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,080
wipe the table but you know what that's

52
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,140
okay the table isn't the focus today the

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,340
hashish is the focus so this hash is the

54
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,899
first time we're going to be smoking

55
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,239
this we're going to check melt tests

56
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,379
we've got our puffco and our Focus car

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,219
to two

58
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:24,840
uh you are on and I am on so it's just a

59
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,520
matter of lighting them up oh one thing

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,439
I will go get which will be very

61
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,360
important and shout out to Bowie from

62
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,259

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,319
um

64
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:35,878
some Q-tips I'm learning I'm new to the

65
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,560
extracts and doing it this way but

66
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:39,239
they're necessity to clean every time

67
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,340
yeah you don't want to be not cleaning

68
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,340
and then shove it to Apex ancillary as

69
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,120
well they sent me uh this cool little

70
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,519
kit I will be using this one today for

71
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,280
you amazing and shout out to Mystic

72
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,379
timber for the little scoop for me we'll

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,659
be using that one for me and I'm gonna

74
00:02:55,378 --> 00:03:01,439
go get the Q-tips I will be right back

75
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:04,818
all right got the XL glob mops I find

76
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,818
these ones with the wood

77
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:13,140
so look at that this Perfection shout

78
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,598

79
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:18,738
you want to pull in some flavors here we

80
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:22,318
can start loading up some

81
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:25,200
doubles iron where is it I've been

82
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,000
eyeing that 90 Micron I have shout out

83
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,079
to calyx too for hooking me up with the

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,300
jars

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,540
go to some great jars there we go you

86
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:37,260
can do this this is the 90 Micron red

87
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:39,000
velvet runs oh my God oh my God I know

88
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:42,539
absolutely insane dude it looks like

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,719
diamonds yeah it's insane

90
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:47,878
very very nice all right well

91
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:52,019
I'll load up a little

92
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:55,759
oh my God it's melting in the Sand Dude

93
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,760
I guess what I'm gonna do is just

94
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:07,679
to dab out on oh man look how sticky

95
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:10,318
yeah that is insane yeah you definitely

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,019
uh look at that I can't even get it off

97
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,298
my stick yeah that's a good uh size dab

98
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,819
too I didn't have to take it off very

99
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,978
good sized step

100
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:21,659
we have not allowed these to grease out

101
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,758
at all they've been in the freezer since

102
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,580
production well they wait they dried at

103
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,100
a cold ambient temperature out of the

104
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:31,139
Sun out of the light and then right into

105
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,379
jars right into the freezer at you know

106
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,360
minus 21 degrees Celsius so

107
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,040
um I guess what we do is you'll hit this

108
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,780
top button twice

109
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,759
and then you can just look and we'll

110
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,559
watch for the Melt Factor we'll share

111
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,419
this with you on a different video we'll

112
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,459
so you guys can see the Melt factor of

113
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:50,399
it oh look at that go excuse mountain

114
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:53,399
look at that thing boil up oh yeah oh

115
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,539
yeah oh yeah that's that's full melt

116
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,539
that's full Mountain

117
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,279
yeah mine's boiling up too very nicely

118
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,899
wow

119
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,740
what a flavor

120
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,739
oh my God

121
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,589
[Laughter]

122
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:30,959
holy [ __ ]

123
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,440
got a little sweat but beating on my

124
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,439
forehead there

125
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:41,538
I only had mine on the second heat seat

126
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:41,538
setting as well it was Green

127
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,279
all right now a little check on the Chas

128
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,639
always going to be something left I

129
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:59,339
don't know why someone turned it into

130
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,038
full melt is when it leaves nothing on

131
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,659
the nail that really wasn't a part of

132
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:05,099
the definition of full mouth in the

133
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,320
beginning but certainly if it leaves

134
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,180
nothing on the nail that is the highest

135
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,459
caliber of full mount

136
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,280
it says a tiny little bit of Chas

137
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:16,799
probably in the like one to two percent

138
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,439
range of what got put in

139
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,020
so not too bad at all

140
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,538
that was nice that was the 90 Micron red

141
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:26,339
velvet runs

142
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:28,318
dude the first one we tried now we did

143
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,739
go with the 90 too though

144
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,660
upping our our potential possibility

145
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,879
I couldn't help it though it looked so

146
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,160
nice in the jar that it was calling my

147
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,839
name it really did look nice in the jar

148
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,460
it looked great in the pipe too yeah

149
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,638
absolutely

150
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:47,519
uh we both hit very different size uh

151
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,918
rips you hit quite a big one I hit a

152
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,198
much smaller one probably half size but

153
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,899
still got the full melt effect sometimes

154
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,699
with melt the more you put in the more

155
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,978
it will appear to melt whereas if you

156
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,500
put a smaller amount in you won't see

157
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:05,038
quite a violent Mount I had a still a

158
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,019
very nice Violet Mountain we'll uh make

159
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,699
some videos for you guys to see that uh

160
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,918
here in a little bit you want me to

161
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,900
clean you out oh you did it yeah I did

162
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:14,818
it you got it already

163
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,399
I'm learning I'm learning it's all

164
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,259
processed the only thing is is I try to

165
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,000
do these holes at the top they have the

166
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,560
tricks oh yeah so I've watched you slain

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,060
your bubble bag so I know how adamant

168
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,680
you are to make sure things are done

169
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,660
properly you learn that when you use

170
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,360
your bubble bags make sure in between

171
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,720
you're taking the time to clean those

172
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,120
bags perfectly every time otherwise it

173
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,819
reduce it reduces the the

174
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,439
the effectiveness of

175
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,539
the banks you know they'll start

176
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,939
plugging with resin as you leave that

177
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:47,459
resin behind and don't clean it and it

178
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:50,160
just ends up being a bummer uh

179
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:51,359
that's unnecessary an unnecessary bummer

180
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,819
there you go

181
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,900
uh wow that was really nice beautiful I

182
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,360
mean my goodness tell us a little bit

183
00:07:54,899 --> 00:08:00,659
about your red velvet runs uh red velvet

184
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,220
runs it's um I got the cut actually from

185
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,699
a buddy of mine

186
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,960
um I don't know too much about it I just

187
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,759
started running and playing with it

188
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,560
we're getting great yields and very good

189
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,259
returns off it nice nice looking flowers

190
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,439
yeah it's absolutely a stunner it's just

191
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:19,139
completely caked it doesn't miss every

192
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,879
time beautiful smoke beautiful flavor

193
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,978
and you know it brings that Quality

194
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,599
Clean Smoke every time is it one of the

195
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:25,500
pictures that you had sent and shared

196
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:26,639
with me

197
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,560
um

198
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,560
because I remember like one in

199
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,360
particular that was very like light it

200
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,538
was a lavender-ish color almost the

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,519
entire Bud it may have oh no that is the

202
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:40,319
Fritter mints oh the Fritter mints yes

203
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,598
interesting yes I haven't seen that one

204
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,039
yet not yet not yet actually it's just

205
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,259
getting ready to head to processing

206
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:47,819
right now very cool yeah well right

207
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,980
before we sat down for this we got a

208
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,440
shot we got a message from Adolfo saying

209
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,000
that he's having a special hash night on

210
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,040
the 28th of this month absolutely

211
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,559
couldn't be a better time for that now

212
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,719
that uh we have some hash to bring no

213
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,819
but think about the timeline of making

214
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,620
like you know it's probably take a

215
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,778
couple weeks or a week to plan such an

216
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,179
event but imagine you had to grow an

217
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:10,919
entire crop yep we had to turn it into

218
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:12,899
hash yeah we had to dry the hash

219
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,360
properly then jar it up and only after

220
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,980
all of that we'll be prepared to get

221
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,320
that message and when did we get that

222
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,959
message about like 20 seconds after we

223
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,080
sat down and I put these jars in French

224
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:27,778
you were scraping pretty much the last

225
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,700
Slimer hash off the box and you got that

226
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:32,159
message right like how does it work yeah

227
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,240
crazy I want to put my macro camera out

228
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,399
I did

229
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,019
um microplane these so the heads are

230
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,120
going to be pretty shredded in that

231
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,940
sense they won't be the same beautiful

232
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,740
round heads that you usually see but

233
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,740
I'll try to do some macro photography on

234
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,560
these to show a that you can dry bubble

235
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,659
on a pizza box and not get fibers in the

236
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,819
hash I mean you did not see a single

237
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:55,500
fiber with the naked eye clean as can be

238
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,760
wouldn't you sort of see that if you

239
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,799
think you would you would notice those

240
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,620
Little Fibers but if not I'll go in with

241
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:04,199
my extremely extremely powerful macro

242
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,080
lens and show you guys one more time

243
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,778
that if done properly there's no reason

244
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,420
you should be pulling any fibers off of

245
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:14,939
the cardboard this is also specifically

246
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,559
for people in tropical countries or in

247
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,800
the Pacific Northwest in Washington

248
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:22,139
Oregon British Columbia we have very

249
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,659
high humidities not now I'll admit no

250
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:26,819
not now no no but it is extremely hot

251
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:28,439
out right now

252
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,879
um we have very high humidity for about

253
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,700
eight months of the year nine months of

254
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:36,360
the year so to try and dry hash without

255
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:39,839
a freeze dryer in an air drying method

256
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,240
it becomes very very very difficult to

257
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,860
do so we learned this over the years

258
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,240
when I was telling people you need to

259
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,860
use a desiccant you need to use

260
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,139
something to pull the moisture out of a

261
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,459
hash and nicotine was being like you

262
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,500
don't need to do that at all you just

263
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:55,439
put it on parchment and it'll it'll work

264
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,578
fine which it you know to me I was like

265
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,040
he doesn't know what he's talking about

266
00:10:56,578 --> 00:11:00,899
to him he was like he doesn't know what

267
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,179
I'm talking about and then eventually we

268
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,240
put it together that you know our

269
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:07,799
terroirs we're affecting our ability to

270
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,360
dry hash and remember when you're making

271
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,278
hash as long as you follow the

272
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,860
directions quite simply

273
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,419
this is all very simple when you get to

274
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,879
the hard part is when you have the wet

275
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:20,338
bubble and now it's the part that

276
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:22,620
involves removing as much moisture or

277
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,079
water content from that hash as possible

278
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,940
and then getting it broken up into a way

279
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:29,159
where you can actually properly dry it

280
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,440
and not everyone has freeze dryers so

281
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:34,019
this video isn't particularly right now

282
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,480
talking to those of you who are home

283
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,339
hashmakers home Growers who don't have

284
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,600
freeze dryers who don't have a budget

285
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,720
for a three to five thousand dollar

286
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,120
freeze dryer there are ways to safely

287
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,339
dry your hash depending on where you're

288
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,220
at and how long does it take them to dry

289
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:52,260
their house that way compared to

290
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,420
well you can always test it and I

291
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:56,700
suggest that you do test it by putting

292
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:58,019
it in the environment that you feel is

293
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,420
the correct environment to do the

294
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,000
drawing and then accessing it after a

295
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:05,219
couple days or three days or four days

296
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,440
or five days

297
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,379
um because it's really like an intuition

298
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,200
to know and if you take the hash and you

299
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:15,958
put it away with any moisture in it that

300
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,079
moisture is going to cause problems down

301
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:20,518
the line especially or really only if

302
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:22,679
you're not putting it in a freezer

303
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,480
absolutely

304
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,099
absolutely if you're going to expose it

305
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,720
to uh you know

306
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,480
room temperatures

307
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,519
especially in the hot summer

308
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,200
if there's any moisture in there it's

309
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,419
and and you'll learn it very quickly

310
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,278
it's a funky smell you know I have

311
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:39,958
people sometimes are convinced no that's

312
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:42,000
just the smell of my genetics and I'm

313
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:45,059
like it's not it's the same with the

314
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,839
same Funk smell right in all hash that's

315
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:47,939
been

316
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,860
um not dried you get the same thing with

317
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,320
flour when it's you know they're almost

318
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,539
there but they go to cure before you get

319
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,300
that smell that it's like it was just

320
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,679
too much was left there's a fine line

321
00:12:56,299 --> 00:13:00,958
yes there's a fine line and it's almost

322
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,879
an instinct that you develop over time

323
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,399
to know where that fine line is right to

324
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,939
really get that difference of that high

325
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,399
quality product yeah no totally

326
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,380
well I guess uh we're gonna have another

327
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,299
sip of water and uh try another

328
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,578
absolutely another flavor this one's

329
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:20,599
your pet 73. okay that's what I just had

330
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:20,599
her hand on perfect

331
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,720
all right by now you've probably noticed

332
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,180
things have shifted I pushed pause on

333
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,980
the video that was a phenomenal dab we

334
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,958
just enjoyed a really nice off-camera

335
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,259
conversation pretty big too yeah

336
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:43,259
absolutely absolutely uh but we're ready

337
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:45,539
for another variety which is the Slimer

338
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:49,078
so what can you tell us about the Slimer

339
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:50,939
the uh the Slimer is uh said tiva

340
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,799
dominant hybrid

341
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,260
um definitely can smell the turpinoline

342
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,859
in there you betcha it's about a 60 40.

343
00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:02,639
very nice buzz it has that very nice as

344
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,379
you said that terpa just hit you when we

345
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,060
were making it you could just smell it

346
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,399
coming out of the washer yeah it really

347
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:10,679
was it was uh I hate that though as well

348
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,019
as love it I love it because it smells

349
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:15,719
amazing I hate it because I want it to

350
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:18,299
stay in the resin I don't uh it's funny

351
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,220
how you know sometimes I had something

352
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:23,099
in Germany some honey bananas really

353
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,200
nice rosin and it was amazing it was so

354
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,278
loud but it was so loud that I just kept

355
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,560
opening the jar and letting everyone

356
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:30,419
smell it like a hundred times more than

357
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,338
I would do to any normal jar of anything

358
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,860
and

359
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:37,980
it it started to dissipate a little and

360
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,440
I remember a friend opening it and going

361
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,600
oh my God and closing it and opening it

362
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,160
and going and then doing it three or

363
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,079
four times in a row and feeling like

364
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,360
stop doing that

365
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,379
you're taking my turps out of there I

366
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,019
mean I didn't because there was another

367
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:54,480
side of me that I would was more focused

368
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:56,399
on which was like enjoying what he was

369
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,379
enjoying exactly through him I was like

370
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,240
and that's a great feeling to be loving

371
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,039
it yeah it's about the experience it's

372
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,039
the same with my flower

373
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,659
what I do it for is the experience that

374
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,458
the person gets on the other end when

375
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:10,259
they open that bag and they smell it and

376
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,119
then they want to smell it again you

377
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,559
squish it and smell it you know it's all

378
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,778
about the experience and you know you

379
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,099
take that with flour with hash and it's

380
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:19,740
it's an amazing when you get to this

381
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,959
kind of caliber of your hash you get

382
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,100
that caliber of experience right true

383
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,479
yeah

384
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,360
true

385
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,879
that looks like a nice hash

386
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,459
I gotta hit this thing again on top

387
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:35,539
twice um yeah every time but not yet not

388
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,539
until you put the hash in okay

389
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,540
it's kind of a

390
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,539
funky mess

391
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,198
a little bit less sticky let me see how

392
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,199
she does

393
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:58,439
I think I hit it right did you hit it

394
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,078
twice look on the screen it'll show you

395
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,760
is it is the is the temperature rising

396
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:04,559
oh it's turned off so you got to hit it

397
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,819
five times

398
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:10,018
there you go

399
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:13,019
all right then twice and then twice

400
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:16,278
yeah all right now she blows

401
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,278
I'm smelting a little bit

402
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,019
late

403
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,019
my lid hit it

404
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:53,160
it smells and tastes so good way less

405
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:57,539
melty but really tasty I'm terpenaline

406
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:59,519
like um that's one of my favorites so

407
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:02,399
the Slimer

408
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,778
I think the Slimer would be better as a

409
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,699
pressed hash

410
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:07,380
I think if this was pressed into hash

411
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,600
and let cure for a while that it would

412
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,819
be we should do it actually with a bit

413
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:15,980
absolutely we could also press rosin out

414
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:15,980
of it to gain a melt Factor

415
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,939
which we also have the ability to do

416
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,039
so much you can do with ashay oh yeah

417
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,740
it's interesting there's a small

418
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,220
percentage of it that is just meant for

419
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,220
melt

420
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,919
and make some shade for that hash

421
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,900
yeah so also a very nice flavor like

422
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,000
beautiful completely different from the

423
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,038
first one much lighter because I didn't

424
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,200
put as much in mine as I put in yours

425
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:54,960
and it didn't have quite the Melt effect

426
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,620
I think it would still be probably a 50

427
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,480
to 60 percent return on rosin yep which

428
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:03,479
isn't terrible I think that full melt

429
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,440
that we hit would probably be like a 85

430
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,419
Plus amazing amazing which at that point

431
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,160
once you're getting into the 85 Plus 90

432
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,980
it's kind of like

433
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,080
is there any necessity to that yeah when

434
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,360
it's melting like the way it was in your

435
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,220
bowl so yeah really nice flavors I

436
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:21,599
suspect we're going to end up doing a

437
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,798
lot more

438
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,538
um myself and uh Kevin yeah

439
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:29,579
collaborations so we'll end up running

440
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:31,259
some more of his genetics he has so many

441
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:33,599
genetics it's ridiculous and like he

442
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:35,519
mentioned earlier he never came from

443
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,558
this from a hash perspective it's always

444
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,779
been a grower perspective yeah which is

445
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,940
awesome yeah so I mean it's great to

446
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:44,879
learn that what I'm putting into my

447
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,019
program and what I do reflects into the

448
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,940
hash

449
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,679
um you know another person that

450
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,000
approached and you and everybody seems

451
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,340
to be getting great results so that

452
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,740
means a lot to me because not just my

453
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:57,599
flower I wanted to be able to resonate

454
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,099
through the whole industry through every

455
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,959
aspect so you know what like I said

456
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:02,519
better flower better product on a deal

457
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,980
right yeah that's exactly how it works

458
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,200
for sure and uh yeah I look forward to

459
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,019
running some other cultivars he had some

460
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,240
really nice uh jars today here that

461
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,700
we'll show you in a bit uh what was it

462
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,620
it was Frost and fruitcake and sure and

463
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,640
sure bow yeah both beautiful both very

464
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:22,798
different in looks and structure and

465
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,320
profiles entering into the Unicorn cup

466
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,918
yes yes yes they are so I wanted to

467
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:31,439
bring two completely different flowers

468
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,720
again this is what was ready but

469
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,400
out of my rooms I'm trying to bring a

470
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,220
completely different look to the

471
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,340
consumer so when they go into a store

472
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:43,440
they have varieties of multiple you know

473
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:44,519
great flavors you offer that for certain

474
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,080
in fact

475
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,700
as much as I want to show you those

476
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,859
flowers we're going to show those

477
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,259
flowers we'll we'll we'll make a part

478
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:54,058
two to this video with those flowers all

479
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:56,339
nice and close up in the sun which I'll

480
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:58,918
do the video for today because they're

481
00:19:56,339 --> 00:20:01,079
so very specific looking buds

482
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,960
and the Unicorn cup is an anonymous

483
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:05,759
entry correct uh they don't know who you

484
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,880
are as yeah when you enter yeah oh yeah

485
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,259
we are Anonymous or not no no not not

486
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,240
okay well then we can show the flowers

487
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:14,359
yes if it was Anonymous I wouldn't feel

488
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,919
good about it no Royal Harvesters

489
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:19,619
when but okay you're entering but when

490
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:22,020
he gives out the samples oh I don't know

491
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:23,519
there so we'll find that out yes and I'm

492
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:25,558
