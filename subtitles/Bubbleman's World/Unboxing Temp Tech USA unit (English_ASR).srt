00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,969
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,160
it has been a while since I've posted a

4
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:16,769
video let me tell you I have been busy I

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,320
have videos compiled from the Caribbean

6
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:22,350
in Jamaica and I have a bunch of videos

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,879
from my recent trip to Colombia that I'm

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,278
going to be sharing with you today but I

9
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,768
was so excited I like to keep my videos

10
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:29,960
in order but today I got a package so

11
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,579
that I've been waiting for for a while

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,390
thanks to high integrity glass art for

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,100
turning me on to the wonderful people at

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,859
high-temp Tech USA so you can follow

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,079
them at instagram at temp tech USA i'll

16
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,469
put it over the screen here and this is

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,200
a really cool little unit in regards to

18
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:50,879
in dabbing and temperature so obviously

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,679
we've had these electric nails for quite

20
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,808
some time now which is great it creates

21
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,519
perfect temperature but it's not quite

22
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:58,709
convenient for traveling so there's all

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,870
sorts of little different pipes out on

24
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,058
the market from the puff Co where you

25
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:04,768
can do your your your dabbing you know

26
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,438
while you kind of go and it's convenient

27
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:11,159
I still love my puff Co and my other

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,408
convenient dabbing tools but I love my

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,280
banger and my glass pipe the most so

30
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,780
this is kind of gonna be a multi-part

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,420
walkthrough it's an open box of a temp

32
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,609
tack of course we'll be promoting a DC

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,400
glass cleaner and I'm also going to be

34
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:30,420
promoting on this particular go one of

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,359
the XL Grail banners from JP as well as

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,460
his incredible see if I can get that up

37
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,640
to you guys a little bit look at this

38
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,798
how great this stuff is beautiful carb

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,239
cap fits right in there this is not the

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,280
core reactor it doesn't have the big

41
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,530
piece of quartz in the bottom but it is

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,359
an excel Grail there is the Holy Grail

43
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,868
right there can see your right through

44
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:54,299
it blink blink anyway I've had this for

45
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:55,859
I bet you over a year since JP and Wendy

46
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,399
sent me the Terps slurper the core

47
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,688
reactor and this XL Grail huge apologies

48
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,359
to you guys we're not putting this video

49
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:05,368
sooner you can check them out at Toro

50
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,520
glass on Instagram and I will put that

51
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:09,770
up on the screen as well and I'm finally

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,719
able to get to this

53
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,540
one of the main reasons I haven't wanted

54
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:17,030
to do this is because I've been on the

55
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:18,620
timing game I've been timing the banger

56
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,349
which works great when you're by

57
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:24,140
yourself obviously most of you are aware

58
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:25,819
of you know heating up your banger with

59
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:28,609
your torch or a certain amount of time

60
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:31,189
usually 10 to 20 seconds letting it cool

61
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,110
for 40 to 55 seconds some of you guys

62
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:36,650
are now onto the cold starts which is

63
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,330
much how the puffs cope uh pipe hits you

64
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,360
can do cold starts with this as well but

65
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,210
this unit this unit right here which I

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,150
say we open right away I'm very excited

67
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:49,790
about I've only used it once I used it

68
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,370
over with with high integrity and was

69
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:54,560
just completely impressed yet with

70
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,450
everything about the unit reached out to

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,939
the company and said how do I get my

72
00:02:56,449 --> 00:03:01,939
hands on one and they were like we'll

73
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:03,319
send you one so huge shout out to temp

74
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:05,539
tech USA I know you probably have

75
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,269
companies all the time trying to get

76
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:10,009
units out of you and whatnot but I'm

77
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,650
very happy that you managed to send me

78
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:15,259
one I'm very excited about the prospect

79
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,210
of using it right now you know this unit

80
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:19,669
measures the temperature of your banger

81
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,950
it's a very cool laser thermometer built

82
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:24,469
into this little stylee box that they've

83
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:27,649
produced not this particular one but the

84
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:30,080
box inside the box and will show you

85
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,620
very simply how it works temp tech USA

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,210
there we go there's the picture and I'll

87
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:41,539
show you what this little guy does

88
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:42,530
because it is very very cool see ah

89
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:46,400
there we go

90
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:48,409
there we go no need to rip I when they

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,879
sent me a blue one how beautiful is that

92
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:52,400
my son's favorite color they'll be very

93
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:57,789
excited not that he'll be using the temp

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:00,680
tech but he just loves all things blue

95
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:02,120
so nice packaging put away nice and

96
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,599
secure definitely doesn't feel like

97
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,099
there's any problems with this unit

98
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:08,870
often when you open a box on something

99
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,449
sometimes you feel it and it's shaking

100
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,000
and it's made

101
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:15,299
sounds it's not supposed to to make this

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,769
thing feels very solid so let's see if

103
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,540
they hooked me up with a battery they

104
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,189
did they did hook me up with a little

105
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,240
9-volt battery that goes right in the

106
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:27,120
back door right there and this it's the

107
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,000
unit there's the tech temp USA so you've

108
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
got your switch on the back you switch

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,540
that you can set your temperatures right

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,459
here I guess I'm not sure exactly

111
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,080
because I haven't looked at the guy why

112
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,599
don't we read the guide and find out

113
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,430
exactly what these buttons do this is

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,050
what an open box is all about I want it

115
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,120
to be the experience that you yourself

116
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,689
would have if you bought one of these

117
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,550
so the specs our temperature range is

118
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:52,110
between minus 50 to a thousand and

119
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,069
twenty degrees Fahrenheit so between

120
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,569
minus 10 and 549 sell Celsius we're

121
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:00,329
never gonna go that high let's be honest

122
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:02,339
accuracy is between plus and minus two

123
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:05,359
percent that's great I can handle that

124
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:08,939
response time is about 0.8 seconds

125
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,350
emissivity emissivity it says see the

126
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:12,389
table on the back page for emissivity

127
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,360
values of some common materials a more

128
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,340
comprehensive emissivity towel table can

129
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,919
be found at temp tech org pages

130
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,659
emissivity emissivity table I'm not sure

131
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,538
what that means but I'm interested to

132
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,520
learn about it distance the spot ratio

133
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:28,500
twelve to one operating temperature

134
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,930
between 32 and 122 degrees Fahrenheit

135
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,600
storage temperature between minus 4 to

136
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,840
122 and of course required battery is

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,990
nine volt now it says the further the

138
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,299
target the larger the test area is as

139
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,370
the distance between the tenth the test

140
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,990
object and the temp tech increases the

141
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,910
size of the area being measured also

142
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,590
increases below is a sample ratio using

143
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,979
the formula used to calculate the

144
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:54,719
distance to spot ratio interesting so

145
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,000
it's got distance the spot ratio times

146
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,950
test object size and inches maximum

147
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,610
measures distance in inches

148
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:05,399
eg 12 to 1 times 2 equals mass maximum

149
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,020
measure distance of 24 so that just

150
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,299
shows you how far away you need to have

151
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:11,359
it so

152
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,060
let's go with our setup here install the

153
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,598
battery and move the power switch to on

154
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,598
all right we'll do that

155
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:25,490
to set emissivity move the power switch

156
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:28,519
this one's not actually turning on move

157
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,960
the power switch seven to the off so let

158
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:36,490
me see what we got here well if the

159
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:38,839
power switch seven to the off well I

160
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,269
think what happened is is they put a

161
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:44,839
battery in but they turned it on and

162
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:48,258
shift it on so the battery is actually

163
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:50,089
completely dead so what I will do is I

164
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,560
will go find a battery and I will be

165
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:54,500
right back this is all about the open

166
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,839
box experience right you got to figure

167
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,848
it out it says to possession the sensor

168
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,109
under the target object when temperature

169
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:01,759
readings are complete with the power

170
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,379
switch the opposition of the scanning

171
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,788
will stop additionally the data holder

172
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:07,430
indicator and last temperature reading

173
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:09,379
will be displayed to decibel additional

174
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,699
adjustments while the temp tech is

175
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:12,800
peridot and press the Fahrenheit Celsius

176
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,389
button to toggle between Celsius and

177
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,718
Fahrenheit or press the backlight button

178
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:19,329
to toggle the backlight on or off it

179
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:21,379
should be protected from thermal shock

180
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:23,959
allow 30 minutes for it to stabilize

181
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:26,209
before use induction heaters arc welders

182
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,560
an electromagnetic fields objects of

183
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:29,089
higher temperature so I'm gonna go find

184
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,089
a battery we're gonna get this thing

185
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:34,369
operational and I'll be right back my

186
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:36,468
apologies to the company they actually

187
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,718
put a brand new battery in here but they

188
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:40,339
said it just on top so the battery

189
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:43,218
wasn't wasn't actually plugged in the

190
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:46,369
battery is sealed and will require

191
00:07:43,218 --> 00:07:48,019
opening so good on the company for not

192
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,680
doing what I thought they might have

193
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:53,240
done which was potentially shipped me a

194
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,829
dead battery it's often the way you

195
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,379
think when you open these products you

196
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:58,519
kind of constantly I know what happened

197
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:01,310
what happened it's not working and it's

198
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,538
it's a true open box experience I didn't

199
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,699
want to give you one of those you know

200
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:06,949
polished up everything's working

201
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:08,780
perfectly I want you to see exactly the

202
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,939
experience that I had which I have to

203
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,469
say was certainly not too bad so we're

204
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:18,540
gonna go

205
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:23,380
this put that little battery in there

206
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:29,170
thumbs up nice and easy close the door

207
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:31,209
and now we're gonna turn this on so hold

208
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,710
all right install the battery remove the

209
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35,860
power to set emissivity move the power

210
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,780
switch seven to be off position then

211
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,430
press the function buttons three to get

212
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,360
to the emissivity adjustment screen I

213
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:48,609
don't think I'm gonna be messing with

214
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:50,560
that screen at all I will use there we

215
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,279
go let's see I want to go b2 I'm once

216
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,109
Celsius but I want to go to Fahrenheit

217
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:57,819
so there we go said Fahrenheit we're at

218
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,860
seventy two point three percent it's

219
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,350
funny because I'm Canadian and obviously

220
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,970
we use Celsius up in Canada but when it

221
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,649
comes to dabbing it's very much been an

222
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,660
American thing that has inspired us with

223
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:11,429
the electric nails and so on so we've

224
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:14,019
gotten very used to operating with a

225
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:15,969
under Fahrenheit rather than Celsius so

226
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:18,159
I know Fahrenheit I like to hit around

227
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,639
550 to 575

228
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,919
I've got my excel Grail in the bong I

229
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:27,840
haven't talked too much about this but I

230
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:30,699
have some absolutely beautiful beautiful

231
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,950
bubble hash from concentrated X this is

232
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,570
120 micron wedding cake trying to take

233
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,850
some macro photographs for you so you

234
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,820
can see that up close and then we also

235
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:45,340
have some really lovely strawberry

236
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:47,379
banana look at that quality this is the

237
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,240
sixth star when you're hitting the six

238
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:52,500
star the last thing you want to do is

239
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,730
hit it in a way that it's too hot I'm

240
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,600
loving the idea of being able to use

241
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:00,009
this thing and not have to you know it's

242
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,330
as simple as this right here actually

243
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:02,740
that's how we're gonna use it we're

244
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,310
gonna just put it right like that

245
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,839
and first we'll heat up the Banger

246
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:09,309
probably only for about 10 seconds I

247
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,010
used to heat it up for 20 but there's no

248
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:13,809
real reason to go much past if I can get

249
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:16,269
it up to 700 degrees and then let it

250
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:19,838
drop 50 to 100 degrees

251
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:22,600
or you know 150 degrees I'm sitting

252
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,449
right at my perfect temperature so we're

253
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:29,110
gonna simultaneously try out the temp

254
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:32,349
tech the excel Grail from JP the

255
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:34,360
concentrated X full melt then we're

256
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,769
gonna clean with the DC glass cleaner I

257
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,209
wish I had some glob mops because I

258
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,879
could promote that company too and of

259
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:42,278
course shout out to oil slick for our

260
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,289
oil slick silicon that the pipe is

261
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:46,088
sitting on and I guess shut up too big

262
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:47,860
shot from blazer as well so quite a few

263
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:51,420
different tools that are required for

264
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:54,699
this particular methodology of dabbing

265
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:56,799
whatever you've got use it maybe join me

266
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:58,828
I will say that one of the main reasons

267
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,719
I haven't used this is if you see my DC

268
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:03,969
banger that I've used see how cloudy

269
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,860
it's gotten from not being able to clean

270
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:09,610
it properly now that's not necessarily

271
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,409
Chazz as much as it's just not being

272
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,259
able to clean running out of DC glass

273
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:16,629
cleaner not having q-tips and not always

274
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:18,519
knowing the right temperature you know

275
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:19,928
these banners change you get used to one

276
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,999
banger you end up with a different

277
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:24,308
banger while I traveled I had the hotbox

278
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:25,869
mister hotbox banner which was double

279
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:28,178
the depth of this and half the thickness

280
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:29,980
well because if you had held heat very

281
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:32,289
differently and I found that it was at

282
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,688
30 seconds or less I could be hitting it

283
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:36,698
without having to let it cool for for 40

284
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:38,230
or 50 seconds so these are all different

285
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:42,099
things that you have to worry about when

286
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:45,399
you don't have a temp Tech USA we've got

287
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:49,499
one here today so why don't we get on it

288
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,499
I'm excited here we go

289
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,629
oh I don't have a damper on the table

290
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:07,369
let me go get a dabbler real quick

291
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:09,949
actually after those few seconds let's

292
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:11,778
see what our so that's six hundred and

293
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:13,698
thirty degrees six hundred twenty six

294
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:16,039
degrees how much I heated that up was

295
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:17,778
almost perfect so we're gonna have to

296
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:20,419
redo that a little bit I'm gonna go grab

297
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:22,818
a dabber because I think getting some of

298
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:24,678
this wonderful hash out of the jar and

299
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:29,229
into the banger is going to be pretty

300
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:29,230
essential so once again bear with me

301
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:39,079
alright and one more company to shout

302
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:41,208
out D nail for the dabber here so this

303
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:44,058
is a nice little dabber that fits right

304
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:48,368
on their halo dish and actually fits

305
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:51,799
perfectly on my DC XL banger as well

306
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:55,459
we're gonna be using the JP Grail and I

307
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:56,990
think very hard hash to get out I often

308
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,998
find that you want to cover the top of

309
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,970
the rim as you're digging around because

310
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:03,350
it can fly out and end up everywhere

311
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,720
worst case scenario in your eye I have

312
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:10,610
on the other hand broken off a nice

313
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:13,100
little piece so we can get a nice little

314
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,629
dab nothing too big often I get asked

315
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,879
hey why are you taking such small dabs

316
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:19,639
why are you why don't you hold it in

317
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,188
long enough why don't you listen I damn

318
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,528
how I doubt I can hit 50 dabs in a day

319
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:26,298
if I want I can hit five and you have

320
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:27,409
the same freedom as well so hit the dabs

321
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:29,149
that make you the most comfortable

322
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:31,368
whether those are micro Deb's cuz you're

323
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:32,600
new at this or whether they're half gram

324
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:34,428
dabs because you've been doing it

325
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,409
forever this is the spice of life that

326
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:38,539
cannabis offers us so just do what you

327
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:41,058
like I'm gonna take a nice decent dab

328
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:44,269
out of a brand new banger so I'm very

329
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:46,818
excited the mothership Kline is as clean

330
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:48,539
as a whistle so let's try this again

331
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:53,399
shall we

332
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:53,399
keep that banger up for about 10 seconds

333
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:08,149
all right drop that right over there

334
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:18,629
700 800 degrees I got that up too it's

335
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:21,480
now at 766 750 748 734 so you can see it

336
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:24,000
going down so pretty fast so probably

337
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,470
around 650 I'm gonna hit it this is

338
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,070
gonna cool it down substantially and

339
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:35,000
I'll probably get that 550 575 hit so we

340
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:35,000
are at 650 let's do this

341
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:15,339
absolutely perfect temp and now my

342
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:17,629
banger is at 463 degrees Fahrenheit Wow

343
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:20,300
incredible flavor on that strawberry

344
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:21,919
banana 120 micron bubble hash shout out

345
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:24,109
to you concentrator decks for finding

346
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:27,379
that phyno shout out to DNA for putting

347
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,820
it out there and just shut up for me for

348
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:35,899
puffing it right now and in being in

349
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:39,769
full enjoyment level level 10 so we got

350
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:42,379
a nice perfect perfect temperate the

351
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:47,060
banger will be very easy to clean thanks

352
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:49,009
to the no Chas aspect of hitting the

353
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:50,719
temp tech hitting it at that perfect

354
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:52,519
temperature we're really gonna be able

355
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,410
to experiment and find out what is the

356
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,379
temperature where Chas occurs is it in

357
00:15:54,409 --> 00:16:00,350
the 700 is it in the 800 degree is it a

358
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:03,559
particular quality of oil this is just

359
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:06,278
cleaning perfectly which is you know how

360
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:08,389
you want to see a brand new banger clean

361
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:11,480
when you've just hit it for the first

362
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:14,419
time well I just it's cringe worthy when

363
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,699
we make the bangers you know get jazzed

364
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:21,559
and get that foggy kind of look to them

365
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:27,019
so I will be a little bit insane about

366
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:28,219
cleaning this just because cleanliness

367
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,850
is next to godliness

368
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,709
let's commence Sam has always said and

369
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,839
yeah eventually your cleaning and you'll

370
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:43,759
see your your q-tips are no longer

371
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:47,160
getting dirty beautiful

372
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,189
so there's a nice clean banger you ready

373
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:52,980
for another rip and the temp tech USA is

374
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,990
is a great success I mean how sweet is

375
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,170
that just to have something that's this

376
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:59,340
light and portable uses a battery

377
00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:01,289
obviously I'm probably gonna want to

378
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,670
carry it in its box and make sure that

379
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:04,440
it's secured I don't want it banging

380
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:05,879
around and put the back of my bag I

381
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,289
could probably break this thing pretty

382
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,560
easily and it seems a little bit

383
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:12,450
delicate but in regards to a tool that

384
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,159
is available that's not a big

385
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,930
thermometer that you have to hold a

386
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,730
laser thermometer in your hole I think

387
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,430
this company has done a really cool job

388
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,079
fitting a niche that no other company

389
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:25,410
has fit and of course we've seen the

390
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,659
Tochi which is the big heat gun inside

391
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,240
the unit that heats up the banger more

392
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,310
like the beam but quite different from

393
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,990
this I think this particular product is

394
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:35,849
going to have great success in the

395
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,609
cannabis industry I have been super

396
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:41,159
excited to use it when I first saw it I

397
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:42,750
just thought what is this high integrity

398
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,670
glass art being the connoisseur that he

399
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,210
is I left an open mind and I thought

400
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,860
after one sink single-use that this was

401
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,410
a tool that I absolutely would require

402
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:55,409
and need to have so I guess turning it

403
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:59,160
off after use is not a bad idea it says

404
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:01,680
once you're done on the instructions to

405
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,570
to turn this the power switch off once

406
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,370
once it's done scanning so maybe it's

407
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:08,639
simple to turn on and off each time I'll

408
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:10,829
learn more of these simple nuances of

409
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,410
the unit as I use it over time but I

410
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:15,809
just absolutely wanted to share how cool

411
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,720
it was with you and in the meantime do

412
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:21,539
long you know a video long in waiting

413
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,360
and long and coming for the Jaypee Toro

414
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:26,399
Grail I do still have the core reactor

415
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,079
and I still have the Terp slurper that

416
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,790
you're gonna be seeing videos from and

417
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,279
then I'll probably do a video maybe with

418
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:33,899
flab and some super sick glass where we

419
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,599
have all three of them and both of us

420
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,690
hit each one and kind of give our sort

421
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:42,480
of what we think of that of the hit this

422
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,759
core reactor hit beautifully it's very

423
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,269
big I personally love a large surface

424
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:50,339
area it's got the ground glass on the

425
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:51,548
bottom with the Grail into it which

426
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:53,980
gives it more of his

427
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:55,749
when the oils on there which also

428
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:59,440
seemingly made it a little easier to

429
00:18:55,749 --> 00:19:01,210
clean and what a beautiful carb cap this

430
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,369
is one of the nicest I've personally had

431
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,048
a nice big hole on the top that you can

432
00:19:03,368 --> 00:19:08,168
seal right out and then it's got that

433
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:10,839
little you know bent nozzle at the end

434
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:13,239
that is going to give you your full

435
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:15,220
spinning and ratio I think this would

436
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:17,048
work quite well with the Sapphire

437
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,629
comments that I got from v-mail

438
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:22,118
haven't tried yet but I'll throw in a

439
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:25,148
couple in the meantime I'm probably

440
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:26,678
gonna continue to puff here and enjoy

441
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:29,408
some of these vibes but thank you guys

442
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:31,389
for watching and thanks for supporting

443
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:34,419
companies that I believe in temp tech

444
00:19:31,388 --> 00:19:36,128
USA is one to watch for DC glass cleaner

445
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:39,220
obviously most of you will already know

446
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:43,898
about that concentrated X bubble hash

447
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:45,999
maker and JP from the for the toro grail

448
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:48,878
thank you all for making this video

449
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:50,858
possible and I guess I'll finish it with

450
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:53,539
my most classic may the foam L to bless

451
00:19:50,858 --> 00:20:11,838
your bowl sooner than later

452
