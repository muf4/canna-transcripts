18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,878
boom TUS

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,000
so this is the one tell me about the

20
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:07,759
Taurus St de's version of the

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,920
recycler

22
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,599
okay Scott Dee's version of the recycler

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,519
but I've heard from quite a few people

24
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,798
that smoke a lot of mother ships I think

25
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,959
it was even both you and Flav who just

26
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,159
mentioned that the Taurus has a a

27
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,280
special hit for sure it's the recycler

28
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,439
you know what I mean yeah it's

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,560
the more

30
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:31,000
flavorful I'm not even sure I've ever

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,200
hit the Taurus

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,560
I know I've hit the ball and I know I've

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,399
hit about the ftk and the straight Fab

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,118
and the Egg Integrity glass

35
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,680
unfortunately uh unfortunately let go of

36
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:48,118
the our Taurus so that's probably why we

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,680
haven't let you oh right you used to

38
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:54,040

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,120

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,120

49
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,680

completely awesome it is man this is

51

exciting

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,599
oh sh nope we have to go do the third

53
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,639
layer yeah we going to do the third

54
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:40,839
layer they really wrap them

55
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,839
good who doesn't love opening

56
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:49,840
things but wing power GL

57
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:53,199
wow that's a beauty right

58
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,800
there look at that yeah I've definitely

59
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,799
never hit one of these before because

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,840
I've never seen

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,319
this sort of I guess that's how he's

62
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,158
created the recycler by the two of

63
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,119
posing holes that is

64
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:07,479
unbelievable and then the what is it

65
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,719
called seed of life

66
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:12,280
yep well that's pretty damn sweet dude

67
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,959
man

68
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,360
yeah hat off to the Mother Ship now I

69
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,199
say we might as well open up the egg

70
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,840
because it's going into the Pelican case

71
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,839
to go to its new

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,560
home probably the best way to ship an

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,280
egg wouldn't you say

74
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,878
let say so too any any real high-end

75
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,438
glass it just makes sense to get it in

76
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,239
that get it in that Pelican case or

77
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:43,400
Turtle case or whatever kind of case

78
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,120
that you uh you can find oh that's a

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,120
nice sweet little bowl really little

80
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,120
bowl

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,959
the eggs feel so

82
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,040
great such a big fan I only really got

83
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,239
into motherships in the last year

84
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:17,680
but I'm uh I'm

85
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,239
addicted this is how I got I got mine I

86
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,160
pulled this right off my egg when I got

87
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:25,560
it these are wrapped a little bit a

88
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,560
little bit better there we

89
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:34,638
go oh yeah

90
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:36,839
T man look at that

91
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,120

93
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:45,038
hitting and I

94
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,839

97
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,560
versa I think they're all tiny

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,720
interchangeable

99
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,439

right deep dish Banger Dabs out of the

169
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,120
Taurus you only get to hit your pipe for

170
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:55,120
the first time once so thank you once

171
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,120

173
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:25,439
Dam that's really nice with the carb cap

174
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:28,439
it just shuts it right down almost

175
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:31,519
completely it's got HS on the

176
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:34,320
bottom it has a hole right on the bottom

177
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,519
but I I don't there's a dish so I think

178
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,080
that hole has something to do with the

179
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,158
the way the cartz like right at the

180
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,560
bottom of the dish there's a hole and

181
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,000
then it's just like a little space that

182
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,039
goes up to the flat dish I figured it

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,919
was something to do to keep the glass

184
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,879
from exploding I mean or the the crystal

185
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,719
the quartz because I maybe if you seal

186
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,360
it

187
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,639
completely you can run into uh some

188
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,680
issues I figured everything about these

189
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:05,879
guys uh puking bee beagle and the denail

190
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:07,958
guys they don't do anything just because

191
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,559
every single thing they do is like

192
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:12,799
majorly been designed thought of

193
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,679
utilized and gone through like a long

194
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:18,919
process of actually getting to the point

195
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,919
where okay this is actually a working

196
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,240

a generous gift that was to kick down

205
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,479
that sort of amount of dry sift I've

206
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,278
been puffing it with everyone everyone I

207

212
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,919
about that d420 K diesel that's

213
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:10,399
reminiscent of of a jell Bean or an

214
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:13,120
agent orange or a Calo or a Tangi which

215
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,799
one orange velvet orange

216
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,320
velvet God I love the small compactness

217
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:22,639
of this piece it's uh it's it's

218
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,640
substantially smaller than the egg

219
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,639
you don't even get a drop of water in

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,720
your mouth on this

221
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,839
pipe I mean I probably sound like a

222
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,079
total Noob I'm not a big recycler guy

223
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,000
true um I have hit quite a few pipes

224
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,838
though and I just have to tell you

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,600
there's a I mean this pipe just gets to

226
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,440
a certain point and it's just the

227
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,480
water's spinning so hard at the top that

228
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,000
when you stop pulling it drops into this

229
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,879
perfect funnel and actually starts

230
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,799
dropping beadlets of water through the

231
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:06,679
tube I'll give you guys a macro uh show

232
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:08,919
of the nice clean pipe um but later when

233
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,479
I get time uh for now I'm going to

234
