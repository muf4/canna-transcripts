00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,000
welcome to Bubble man's world uh here we

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:09,160
are with part three of the tip

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,798
installment for water hash or ice water

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,160
extracted bubble hash tips with bubble

5
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:16,640
man call it what you want basically I'm

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,519
trying to give you guys some tips

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,199
for um getting through the process

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,399
without overthinking it it's quite a

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,160
simple process really one of the biggest

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,399
places people have problems is the place

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,960
that I'm going to be helping you with

12
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:34,000
today and that's in the property drying

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,558
of the water extracted hash that you've

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,039
extracted okay so there are two schools

15
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:41,159
of thought when it comes to the drying

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,799
um everyone agrees that we powderize

17
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,238
basically the people that are considered

18
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:48,238
the experts I guess which is somewhat

19
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,959
laughable if you just go out and do the

20
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,479
the experiments if you just go and make

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,198
the the water hash and you realize after

22
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,198
a while that if you're not using a

23
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:59,320
desicant if you're not wicking out the

24
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:01,238
moisture from the water hash you're

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,799
going to be left with a process where

26
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:04,000
your hash lookss really great for a

27
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,640
while and then it does this thing where

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,118
it Butters out and it no longer holds

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,960
its form it no longer is sticky it kind

30
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,840
of starts crumbling and falling apart

31
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,079
this is resin degradation it's the wax

32
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,359
membrane is being degradated by the

33
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,879
solvent use of the water because it's

34
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,759
hanging out for longer than it should

35
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,839
it's breaking that head down and

36
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,040
eventually you're left with this sort of

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,359
sort of a less than product you know you

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,159
hear people say all the time oh it used

39
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:33,719
to be so nice so how we can avoid this

40
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,880
is following one of the two schools of

41
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,478
thought you've got your stainless steel

42
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,039
strainer so you can take your fresh

43
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,879
Bubble Patty when it's right in the

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,359
pressing screen and depending on the

45
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,839
quality this is where it becomes a bit

46
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,200
tricky you want to gently dab some of

47
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,118
the water out of that bubble Patty some

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,560
of the water I say because leaving some

49
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,319
of the water present will allow you to

50
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,719
put it in the strainer and with the back

51
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,919
of a spoon you can gently push it

52
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,879
through the metal screen and what

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,478
happens is it it falls out as a powder

54
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,239
now don't make the mistake on allowing

55
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,360
this powder to pull up on the cardboard

56
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,639
what you want to do is as you're pushing

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,120
uh gently with the spoon the you know

58
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,279
rubbing on the inside of the screen

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,480
between the hash and the spoon and it's

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,439
falling you want to be moving it over

61
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:21,919
your thick cardboard I know a lot of you

62
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,878
are cringing out there right now and you

63
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,000
think it's uh old school method but the

64
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,439
cardboard is a desicant if you don't

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
want to use cardboard um my good buddy

66
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,800
Kake K uh he puts it on a screen and

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,800
then under the screen he packs paper

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,959
towels and those paper towels Wick the

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,560
moisture out of the bubble you cannot

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,439
just put the bubble okay the water hash

71
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,840
ice wax solventless whatever you want to

72
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,878
call it you can't just put this um on a

73
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,878
parchment paper or on a piece of glass

74
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,158
or on a plate because that will not Wick

75
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,518
the moisture out and air drying is not

76
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:57,399
going to be good

77
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,480
enough unless you're in an extremely dry

78
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,519
dry place and even still the resin will

79
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:05,479
bond itself so make sure you powder it

80
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,080
up the more exposure to surface area the

81
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,039
better the cardboard will Wick more

82
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,200
moisture out that way so this is one

83
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,359
school of thought our second school of

84
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,199
thought is a microplane now this is a V

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
Syndicate card it's not your average

86
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,878
micro microplane but I couldn't find

87
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,000
mine I think I might have left it at

88
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,959
Remos the last time I was there but so

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,239
this is a little card with holes in it

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,479
and you can literally freeze the bubble

91
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,039
patties uh you also want to allow some

92
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,280
of the moisture to come out before you

93
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,560
freeze it I like the idea of uh allowing

94
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,598
the the resin Patty to sit for a short

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,000
period of time on um some paper towel or

96
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,560
on towel below the screen that it's

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,080
sitting on so you're not getting fibers

98
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,319
in your in your hash and it can Wick

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
that moisture out and at that point when

100
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,839
it gets to a certain point you can

101
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,878
freeze it the freezing will remove more

102
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,799
moisture but it'll get it ready for

103
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:55,679
microplaning so you take those freeze

104
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:58,280
Frozen patties if it's a really high

105
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,000
quality resin I suggest breaking off

106
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,120
small pieces of the Frozen Pat Patty

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,639
like a gram at a time and microplaning

108
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,400
them and allowing as it falls out

109
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,518
allowing it to fall spread thin on the

110
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,079
cardboard always use plenty of cardboard

111
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,480
don't use little pieces that are this

112
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,560
big use giant pieces you can fit them

113
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,639
into trays if you don't want to use

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,439
cardboard you can use 4x4 screens like

115
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:26,478
these ones here you can use these metal

116
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:30,279
frame screens um that sit um you can

117
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:32,758
basically get them built into um

118
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,879
uh frames that they sit above one

119
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,439
another and you can basically put the

120
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,680
hash on the top and then underneath you

121
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,000
can put the paper towel as a moisture uh

122
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,079
as a desicant to Wick the moisture out

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,240
so those are our two schools of thought

124
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,680
um our microplane and our stainless

125
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,280
steel Seer whichever way you're going

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,079
about doing it you'll learn the way

127
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,638
that's best for you unfortunately by

128
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:56,800
making a mistake here and there but

129
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,000
hopefully these tips can help you get

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,280
your bubble broken into powder very F

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,918
powder spread very thin on a thick

132
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:08,319
cardboard or using a lot of good uh

133
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,240
desicant like paper towel that's stuffed

134
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,478
under the screen it has to be in direct

135
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,600
contact to really allow gravity to pull

136
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,599
that water out so we've gone to so much

137
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,960
trouble in the growing of this cannabis

138
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,639
plant all the variables to get it to the

139
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,879
point where the resin is mature and the

140
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,918
glandular triome head is thin and the

141
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,719
profile inside is

142
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:32,038
abundant then we've extracted the res

143
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,840
and we've done uh the right job on using

144
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:35,599
all the bags and isolating the heads

145
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,879
into their Micron size increments this

146
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,960
is the last most important thing and I

147
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:44,079
urge all of you to really learn how to

148
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,159
dry your water hash okay I hope that's

149
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,680
helpful um I'm going to finish it off

150
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,759
with a little dab of the fiveyear Cure

151
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,600
I've got right here do a quick little

152
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,479
dab a dooodle of that got the Dil right

153
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,479
here so all right here we

154
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,478
go

155
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:13,848
[Music]

156
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:29,999
[Music]

157
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,839
great taste on that 5year cure and you

158
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,080
can never keep hash for this long

159
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,679
without drying it first

160
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,959
properly it'll never last for 5 years

161
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,038
and taste this good so there's one more

162
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,198
reason to dry your hash properly I hope

163
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:53,240
the tips have helped we'll see you soon

164
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,240
on Bubble man's world
