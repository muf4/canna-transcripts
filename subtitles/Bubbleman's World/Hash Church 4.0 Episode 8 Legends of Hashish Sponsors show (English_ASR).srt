85
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,319
was such such a big deal to do that was

86
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,399
because um you know we're we're really

87

90
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,039

91
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,318
from the Cannabis community so being

94
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:14,840

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,079

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,919
whoa what's going on with Legends now

113
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,680
you got cameras and you're having

114
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:55,758
sponsors you know when Addison hit me up

115
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,879
a couple years ago and said hey you know

116
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,720
I think we should do Legends you know in

117
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,360
California I think I think you know

118
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,039
Kevin and I can pull it off and uh you

119
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,759
know one of the first things he said to

120
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:08,800
me was and I'm not sure how you've been

121
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,960
doing this out of pocket man but uh you

122
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,439
know we're not going to be able to do

123
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,279
that I'm not sure how you just been

124
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,319
paying for Legends out of pocket because

125
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,198
that's how I rolled with Legends for you

126
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:20,199
know the first almost 20 years I I there

127
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,600
were no there was no monetization there

128
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,680
was no sponsorships I paid for

129
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,120
everything out of my own pocket and uh

130
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,199
you know just kind of tried to make it

131
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,240
go that way and it was uh it got

132
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,600
expensive fast so I am definitely very

133
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,639
thankful uh to all of the sponsors and

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:43,039
also to you know the team uh at 800 that

135
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,000
we're also not just willing to we're not

136
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,918
just take willing to take anyone's money

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,839
for sponsorship like it's almost like

138
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,279
the same way you know you're curating

139
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,239
the products that you use on a daily

140
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,839
basis well you don't want to be curating

141
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,720
products that you don't use on a daily

142
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,318
basis and bring so we there were people

143
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,720
we said no to um there was there was a

144
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,120
substantial amount of people that we

145
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,680
said no to so you know you've been

146
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,519
curated you you know when you get

147
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,800
accepted to this sponsorship it's not

148
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,918
just by giving money it means that you

149
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,079
have the whole background the cool the

150
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:18,279
coolness Factor the factor that you have

151
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:20,279
integrity the factor that you know that

152
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,719
you've been curated by Legends of hash

153
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,038
and there's there's something to be said

154
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,360
by that as well because um you know I

155
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:28,918
just chose to have zero sponsors for

156
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,280
like 20 years because I thought the same

157
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:32,038
way with hash church this is the first

158
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,159
time I've ever had a kind of episode

159
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,360
like this where you know I've never

160
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,560
monetized hash church I've never taken

161
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,160
any sponsorship money I've never taken

162
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,560
anything for hash church because I was

163
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,639
worried that if I did that it would

164
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,720
affect the Integrity of hash church and

165
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,079
you know for me I was so stuck in hash

166
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
church not really realizing what it

167
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,120
meant to the community but after

168
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,079
listening to the community and realizing

169
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,840
like this is really important this is a

170
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,839
conversation that drives our industry

171
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:02,359
and our community uh it's very important

172
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,000
that we don't bastardize or or or [ __ ]

173
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:09,080
this up so uh it's been a bit of a nerve

174
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,279
wracker um you know having having the

175
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:14,758
monetization aspect for for um for

176
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:16,439
Legends and I told both Kevin and

177
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,759
Addison like all right let's try it out

178
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:22,598
but whatever you do don't [ __ ] it up

179
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,680
because this is uh this is a this is a

180
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:27,159
this is a this is a long time thing

181
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,639
going you know like I I sometimes can't

182
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,319
even believe that Legends has been

183
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,038
happening for you know for 20 plus years

184
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,879
but indeed it has it's happened in

185
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:38,959
Amsterdam God like 14 plus times it's

186
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,879
happened in Barcelona a few times it's

187
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,239
happened in Vancouver a few times it's

188
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,879

pleasure to have you JP all you guys

225
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:20,159
especially um but JP I think it's uh you

226
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,920
know I I love the idea and the whole

227
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,240
story behind how the slurper came to

228
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,759
life and how Marcus has something to do

229
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,120
with it and I kind of feel like now it's

230
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,439
sort of Full Circle and and just kind of

231
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
brings everybody closer together

232
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,920
together and uh I don't know if if

233
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,200
everyone knows that story but um you

234
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,039
know JP you could tell it Marcus you

235
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,720
could tell it I think it's uh an

236
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:41,319
interesting story that's kind of you

237
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,120
know when it comes to dabbing when it

238
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,879
comes to solventless especially I think

239
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,360
the slurpers kind of added this whole

240
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:50,240
different component you could take a guy

241
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,680
who could dab super hard on a 30 mil

242
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,959
Banger and and rip the [ __ ] out of that

243
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,599
thing and then you put a slurper in

244
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,799
front of them and it's a totally

245
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,680
different hit it you need a different

246
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,199
set of lungs to rip that thing get a

247
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,278
different flavor different taste you can

248
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,680
[ __ ] with the temp um you need a temp

249
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:07,159
temperature gauge you need all these

250
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,639
different things to do it you need some

251
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,399
pearls you need a [ __ ] assistant an

252
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,559
ISO dip you need all these different

253
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,200
things but the the you know the

254
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,159
development of the slurper I think has

255
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,640
changed the [ __ ] game so heavily uh

256
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,719
and and that's you know we wouldn't have

257
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,679
it if it weren't for you and Marcus

258
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,000
inspiring and uh so yeah it's it's a

259
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:29,479
huge pleasure to have you with us and uh

260
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,720

261
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,759

he like wrote he sent me one one day and

284
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,639
was like oh by the way here's article I

285
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,519
I I was interviewed in the Northeast

286
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,480
magazine and yeah I was I telling the

287
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,200
story about your part in the tur slurper

288
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,000
and I was like my part in the TP slur

289
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,839
what the [ __ ] did what did I do and then

290
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,159
he he told me this story and I was like

291
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:49,800
oh [ __ ] awesome I mean feel free I mean

292
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,278
feel free to tell the story I mean it's

293
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:57,120
I mean it's like folklore

294
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:59,278
here uh so so many people like you know

295
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,000
uh really you inspire a lot of people

296
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,879
people a lot of my homies and they check

297
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,278
you out and um you know they're always

298
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,679
like yo did you see that episode of blow

299
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:11,360
or did you see how he's like burping

300
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,719
turps did you see how like they're doing

301
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,399
all this stuff and like trying to like

302
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,879
and I was like oh no and then it was

303
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,360
like a thing where you know we were just

304
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:23,679
like I was like just trying to make a

305
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,680
nail that you could just burp turps with

306
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,958
but not for dabbing almost just for

307
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:33,319
flavor and then all sudden it turned

308
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:36,078
into oh let's let's let's make it let's

309
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,560
actually make it percolate let's

310
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:41,278
actually like make it so that it

311
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:45,239
percolates and then I don't know six

312
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:47,799
seven designs later here we are you know

313
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,839
the different tweaks of it all and then

314
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:53,479
uh you know the fog you know because you

315
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,399
have to test it then you got to go and

316
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,480
make another one and it's just like you

317
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,120
know before you know it you're

318
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,440
really really really high but you're

319
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,959
still like working with hydrogen and gas

320
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,760
and and and working on a la and you burn

321
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,679
yourself and you get injured and you

322
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,759
because you're just like how you know

323
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,120
you're still alive it I mean really I

324
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:17,319
mean that's just like I mean it's just

325
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,720
like you know talk about like

326
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,519
working while super you know messed up

327
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,199
it's you know now I can just you know

328
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,078
now I can do it it's like no no problem

329
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:28,679
you know I'm so used to testing out

330
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:31,278
prototypes and just going back to the

331
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:33,359
tourch I think a lot of us glass blowers

332
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,439
do do that like I think that's like our

333
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,000
thing you know what I mean um at least

334
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,360
in in in my world

335
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,879
anyway good to know that you were it's

336
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,480
good to know that you were sacrificing

337
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:48,399
turps to create the slurper it was like

338
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,800
a sacrifice you know like throwing a

339
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,440
virgin into a [ __ ] volcano or

340
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:58,078
something well I mean I mean that it was

341
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,120
so long ago that I mean you know things

342
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,879
sometimes take a little time to to pick

343
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,959
up and to like you know get out there

344
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:09,399
and and you

345
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:12,198
know uh but at the same time you know

346
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:15,278
there's technology that also helps other

347
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:17,439
things also Blossom so to speak you know

348
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:20,078
what I mean like if it wasn't for like

349
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:25,160
you know the the dab right the temptech

350
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:27,000
all those devices that people are using

351
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:30,879
to

352
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,440
to to you know figure out their their

353
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:36,278
flavor Zone their heat temp you know I

354
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,000
think that really helps and I think that

355
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:42,879
you know before that we were just timing

356
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,839
it out and sometimes you know uh certain

357
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,559
quartzes hit differently with different

358
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,199
you know it's it's a game you know what

359
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,119
I mean you got to figure it out and then

360
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:51,879
it's like oh well how do we clean it and

361
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,320
then it's like oh we can dunk tank it

362
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:55,720
you know and I think all these things

363
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,800
happen and then it makes a product not

364
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:02,839
seem so intimidating or so hard to

365
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,838
um you know

366
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,278
because the turf slurper took

367
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,198
off in in

368
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,720
Hawaii and you know I mean it happened

369
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:18,000
in the in the

370
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:20,560
states and I think that you know like I

371
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,320
had some fan base in the states people

372
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,159
that weren't afraid to like you know go

373
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,079
outside the box a little bit and try

374
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,719
something

375
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:32,479
new um and but in Hawai I mean such a

376
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,959
huge fan base in

377
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,600
Hawaii and I guess there was like a

378
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,559
couple that were like floating around

379
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,720
the island that actually spun the turps

380
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,439
or spun the Pearl when it was in there

381
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,399
and at the time people were just like

382
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,480
throwing like logs of like you know um

383
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,639
shatter in there and it was like

384
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,839
spinning and slowly evaporating as it

385
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,600
was spinning and then um before you knew

386
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,360
it

387
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,079
uh some of these Islanders reached out

388
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,120
and we're like yo did you know that some

389
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:08,239
of these nails some of these some of

390
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,039
these you know Spin and we were just

391
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,600
like No And so then we started like

392
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,838
developing more about that and almost

393
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,959
kind of like getting the The Vortex or

394
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:18,759
the spinning motion because anything

395
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,479
that spins is a longer distance than

396
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,800
straight

397
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,079
so that was that next thing you know

398
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,278
here we are I don't want to take up too

399
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:29,439
much time here dude people are loving

400
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:32,078
this conversation trust me it's uh what

401
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,880
do you think go ahead Addie oh go ahead

402
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,399
what do you think it was like where you

403
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:37,679
said that those guys were running around

404
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,360
the island kind of pushing it what was

405
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,439
that turning point that you think that

406
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,199
sort of blew it the [ __ ] up to where it

407
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,560
is now was it some sort of development

408
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,039
in the pipe or was it just the pearls

409
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:49,599
coming in what kind of blew it up

410
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,240
because now it's like you know to to to

411
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,480
give you the credit everyone in their

412
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,480
mom is putting out a slurper or slurp or

413
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,680
type column thing what do you think that

414
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,000
was uh

415
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,558
um I don't know I mean you know this

416
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,959
industry

417
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:09,599
is like just so like ancestral and we're

418
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,679
all just like feeding off each other

419
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,240
really it's like you know yeah the TP

420
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:16,400
serer is great but it wouldn't be there

421
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,798
if it wasn't for the dab r or dab Tech

422
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,439
it wouldn't be there if it wasn't for

423
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:21,279
people like actually like oh we're

424
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,959
actually G to start soaking

425
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,879
now um like or dunk tanking or what you

426
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,959
know there's so many different

427
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,760
terminologies that people have but you

428
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,120
get what I'm saying

429
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,759
and I think that when you can like look

430
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,879
outside the thing because back in the

431
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:38,279
day it was like oh let's just Q-tip it

432
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,600
out and keep going you know what I mean

433
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,079
I was like oh wait a minute if you put

434
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,959
fingerprints on it that's going to burn

435
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:48,000
into the quartz too oh okay so now we're

436
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,160
now we're taking care of it inside and

437
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
out you know what I mean okay now we're

438
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,480
having some interesting design some

439
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,440
interesting airf flow it's a little bit

440
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,960
unique there's an inside and outside

441
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,519
that's all weird that has to be clean so

442
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,000
now what is it you just dunk it in a

443
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,440
tank sometimes you have three tanks one

444
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,279
for dirty one you know like kind of like

445
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,798
um Camp back in the day when there

446
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,519
wasn't a lot of water you know what I

447
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,519
mean and you had like three or four tubs

448
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,158
one had soap and then you just rinse one

449
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,480
and you just kept on going and then at

450
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:22,440
the end that was clean you know I'm not

451
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,000
saying that's covid clean now or any

452
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:29,279
kind of like you know whatever but back

453
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,558
in my day uh that was Camp so

454
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,918
um I have a little dunk tank system like

455
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:36,240
that I also mess around with ultrasonic

456
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,520
cleaners just to figure out different

457
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,079
ways how to keep the quartz and the

458
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:44,240
product itself clean and does anyone

459
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,759
make like a Ultra like a mini Ultras

460
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,599
sunic cleaner yeah because that that's

461
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:51,158
the best way to clean ultrasound

462
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,759
cleaning when when we were um you know

463
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:54,880
not a lot of people know but we used to

464
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:57,519
make well we still make enails but we

465
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,440
used to like really be heavy in the enil

466
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,599
space and uh

467
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,759
yeah ultrasonic cleaning is the best for

468
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,199
Titanium or any type of surface really

469
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:09,798
so does anyone have like a little a

470
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,279
little like a ultrasonic bath kit yet

471
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:14,519
that's all I use I've been doing that

472
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,839
for like the last four weeks now five

473
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:20,759
weeks I I've been using it with my

474
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:25,079
actual glass work for years right um and

475
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:28,200
then I just recently switched over to um

476
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,639
doing it this way especially uh the ones

477
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,640
that actually actually have a heating

478
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,320
Source on them as well so that you're

479
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,840
also getting a little I mean you know

480
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,359
you do get a little

481
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,879
evaporation a little quicker but I think

482
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:41,678
it you know I feel like when you pull it

483
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,919
out it kind of dries quicker because

484
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,480
it's a little hot you know a little

485
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,799
warm

486
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,279
um my test is more to see the longevity

487
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:55,440
of the nail to see how long I can keep

488
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,678
it from clouding up or chazzing or you

489
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,480
know doing all

490
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,080
the things that sometimes courtz gets to

491
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,880
a certain point with if you're like

492
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:07,079
neglected with it um but I keep I keep

493
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,159
having people coming in here and say

494
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:14,199
like to mention that you know um another

495
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:16,400
thing with the the slurpers flavor that

496
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,919
was one of our biggest things and I

497
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,798
think that's where bubble man came in

498
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:25,919
was trying to capture that flavor that

499
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:28,279
like the actual flavor of the of that's

500
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,799
coming off of of of of the hash you know

501
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:33,158
what I'm saying say and that's like

502
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:37,918
where

503
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:39,600
um you know uh burping turps slurping

504
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,960
any kind of thing like that like sipping

505
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:46,158
wine you know the way you get the turps

506
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,159
is by all that Iration and all that um

507
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,480
sipping that's how you get you know it's

508
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:54,840
like the best way to get flavor and I

509
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:58,120
think that's where um that in between

510
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:01,839
getting it to spin and everyone coming

511
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:04,558
up with these really cool um units to to

512
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:08,599
to to to figure out heat zones and

513
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:10,278
cleaning and um all these like dunk

514
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:13,319
tanks and all this stuff I mean and the

515
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:15,880
Q-tips and everything it's just been all

516
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,558
just like one thing led to another to

517
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,240
get to this point

518
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:23,519
really I'll tell you the the flavor

519
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,400
aspect ties into anyone that's ever hit

520
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,319
one of these turp slurpers especially

521
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,519
the first time you hit it it's like

522
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,038
you're getting high for the first time

523
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,079
especially if you're ahead and you're

524
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,519
hardcore you're not hitting something

525
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:36,038
through your first tur slurper that

526
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:37,400
you've never hit before you're pulling

527
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:40,558
out one of your favorites that you've

528
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,320
hit like 10,000 times through 10,000

529
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,119
different ways at 10,000 different

530
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,119
temperatures and now you're hitting the

531
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:49,359
turp slurper with the pearls and you got

532
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:51,199
your temperature gauge and it was I mean

533
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,439
it was like uh you know you get high for

534
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,080
the first time and then you spend the

535
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,640
rest of your life sort of chasing that

536
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,119
Dragon well that like that caught the

537
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,440
dragon that was the dragon catcher that

538
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:05,319
turp slurper it was like Boop blew that

539
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,200
out and was like literally like it was

540
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:09,119
grade eight again and I was borderline

541
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,919
on the brink of being more High than I

542
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,359
wanted to be which I have to admit

543
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:17,200
nowadays is exactly where I want to be

544
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:19,158
um but um that was that was I won't I

545
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,840
will never forget that I mean I've I've

546
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,159
never gotten high like that off of it

547
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,199
again but I also just like got those

548
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:29,240
pearls spinning and created a crazy

549
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,440
suction and uh yeah the the the it's to

550
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,759
me it's all about the preservation of

551
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,679
the volatile organic compounds getting

552
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:39,640
them from your product into your lungs

553
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:42,000
as preserved as possible you know so the

554
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,278
more the more of these buffers that you

555
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,519
put in like not letting it sit in one

556
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:49,400
corner of a banger versus painting the

557
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:51,119
entire tube of the turp slurper like a

558
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,640
like a rising film

559
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,599
evaporator this is on a completely

560
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,640
different level and I've uh you

561
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:01,079
definitely are a massive influence in

562
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,759
this whole aspect and I got to give a

563
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,678
shout out and I I don't even know if you

564
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:06,879
guys uh get along or if he's like a

565
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,360
mortal enemy or whatnot but I I do got

566
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,640
to get G give a shout out to Brian from

567
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,519
denail as well because he's also really

568
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,840
just geeked out on focusing on these

569
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:20,918
shapes and the you know the way the

570
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,240
surface area preserves and releases heat

571
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,600
and so been doing quartz and been doing

572
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,640
silicon carbide and been doing Sapphire

573
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:31,359
and all these different surfaces which

574
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,480
uh I find subtle nuances for certain but

575
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,119
uh nothing like the difference between

576
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,120
hitting out of a banger and then hitting

577
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:43,079
out of of a tur slurper and dude thank

578
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:46,399
you so much for this because uh it's uh

579
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:48,079

00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:04,879
never seen a darker yellow solvent than

586
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:07,639

when he's dabbing in front of you you

591
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,038
are puffing more than you would be

592
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:21,798
puffing if you were inhaling your dabs

593

directly into uh your lungs so shout out

uh I think they're doing good things I

616
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:21,000
like the idea of people coming up with

617
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:23,359
ways to preserve our bodies you know in

618
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,440
this you know no one thinking that being

619
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,240
under those High Press sodium lights for

620
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,798
all those years was going to affect

621
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,480
their light uh their eyes but uh yeah it

622
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:36,599
does get those get those shades on you

623
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,919
and avoid the headache true human

624
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:41,879
optimization like it allows you to to

625
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,320
view something without you know with you

626
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,200
didn't have the ability before but you

627
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,319
can do your work better and it's more

628
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,399
healthy for you too in intake of light

629
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:51,599
is really important stuff so well I'll

630
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:53,959
tell you and I'll lead that right into

631
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,398
photography which is what photography is

632
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,319
the intake and manipulation of light so

633
00:25:56,398 --> 00:26:00,000
when I'm in a grow room and I'm taking

634
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,759
pictures with my phone and it's just

635
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,919
orange I don't even want to post those

636
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,558
pictures they just look terrible but to

637
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,360
have Shades that you can pull off your

638
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:09,158
head I mean I've got the little the

639
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,439
little clips now that Olo Clips or

640
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:13,039
whatever that go over my phone um but to

641
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,798
be able to take the shades off and take

642
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,599
a picture through the blue lens and just

643
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:19,519
turn actually I was wearing my blue

644
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,240
lenses yesterday I was in the forest up

645
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,480
north here in Squamish and I was picking

646
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,679
mushrooms edible mushrooms and it was

647

makes a um a stainless steel hash maker

661
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:05,519
uh called the hashtech and they have a

662
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,039
bunch of different sizes I'm sure he

663
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,000
could tell us about it in in a little

664
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,798
bit uh here for sure and uh yeah I mean

665
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,359
the world needs more hash so the more

666
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:17,038
hash the marrier needs more um companies

667
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,278
sort of pushing these boundaries you

668
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:23,278
know you get uh you get a Pioneer like

669
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:25,319
like JP who sort of pioneers a concept

670
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,359
but then you get all these other people

671
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:28,960
who come along and they're just they're

672
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,839
they want to they want fit in there

673
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,880
somehow and so they start playing around

674
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:35,599
and changing and you know so it's like

675
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,200
we stand on the shoulders of giants uh

676
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:40,158
when we're not insecure uh and worried

677
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,038
that people doing similar things than

678
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,559
what we're doing is taking away from our

679
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:48,119
pie last I heard John made enough for

680
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:51,079
everyone um whose music is on someone

681
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:52,879
playing [ __ ] theme music or what yeah

682
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:55,759
oh it was Alex that was awesome it was

683
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,960
while we were talking about him too that

684
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,398
was amazing that was

685
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,558
I thought that was Mark I thought you

686
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,479
were setting a setting a tone that

687
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,240
wasn't on purpose my my bad the ladies

688
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,759
are watching a movie here that's that's

689
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,120
not that good but the timing was so good

690
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,000
dude it was really just this like

691
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:15,719
Perfect theme

692
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,519
music someone playing them

693
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,839
music that was so good oh my god dude

694
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,359
that is

695
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:26,319
awesome I have a question about legends

696
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,918
about the first Legends um how did that

697
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,960
happen like how did that materialize was

698
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,240
that something that you sat down and

699
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,759
consciously created or or did it happen

700
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,640
more or less organically to a point

701
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,038
where you saw it happen and you were

702
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,559
like we need to we need to continue this

703
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:44,879
well like everything that's awesome in

704
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:47,119
our community it was created by skunkman

705
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,440
Sam you know I was a part of it we were

706
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,798
we were having that conversation I

707
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:54,159
couldn't say listen first of all this

708
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:56,278
guy's hash when he was like okay who the

709
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,120
[ __ ] lived in all the hash producing

710
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:59,640
countries collected all the cult of ours

711
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,678
brought them back to his Greenhouse with

712
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,559
Federal licensing and bred genetics for

713
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:09,038
15 years straight who who who is puffing

714
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,678
weed and saying that that is how they

715
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,679
got the weed like that is just like what

716
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,200
the [ __ ] so that's the start and so the

717
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:18,000
first time I ever went over to his place

718
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,919
and I remember Rob Clark kind of be like

719
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,079
oh I could barely walk home from Sam's

720
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,559
last night I was I was so [ __ ] stoned

721
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,879
and I would kind of be like well really

722
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:29,119
man like come on like I can drive on

723
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,000
four grams of mushrooms like how stoned

724
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,798
could you have possibly been you know I

725
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,278
was kind of young bucking it being all

726
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:38,720
[ __ ] confident and cocky and he was

727
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,558
like whatever dude you know whatever and

728
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,519
uh I ended up getting invited over there

729
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:45,839
one time finally and he you know he

730
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:48,480
pulled out this this skunk number one

731
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,558
full melt dry sift that he cleaned up to

732
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,839
Perfection and it was I'd never seen

733
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,480
hash melt like that not even 6star like

734
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:57,398
this was like another level it was just

735
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,720
like right through the screen H and he's

736
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:02,678
just like ALS also puffing like I I'd

737
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,399
say he puffed about 150 Bowls in the in

738
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,960
the three hours that I hung out there

739
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:10,479
for when I smoked this hash it was like

740
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,840
someone strapped me to a rocket and I

741
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:17,360
took off and I was so anxius I thought I

742
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:19,918
was gonna [ __ ] myself throw up piss

743
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,798
myself pass out unconscious all the big

744
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,840
four fears that you would have if you

745
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:26,759
got like I just I i' gotten people high

746
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:30,759
like that before but no one had ever

747
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:32,919
gotten me high like that before I was

748
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:36,398
humbled and so and that was the first

749
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:39,000
rip he gave me like oh I want to say 20

750
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:41,199
or 30 more when I left his house that

751
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,720
night the whole right side of my body

752
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,720
wasn't working and I was walking and I

753
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,679
was kind of lifting my right leg and

754
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,440
then walking normal with my left leg and

755
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,559
I'm I'm being very serious I'm not

756
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,399
exaggerating in any way shape or form I

757
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:55,720
was

758
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:58,038
destroyed and I finally understood what

759
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,960
Rob was saying like oh yeah I got really

760
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:02,000
really high at at Sam's really high at

761
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,480
Sam's could mean that he gave you a goo

762
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,599
ball with one gram of his dry sift in

763
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,599
the goo ball like he'd eat two of those

764
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,359
and go walk around for Queen's Day in

765
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,918
Amsterdam and it was just like dude like

766
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,719
two of those would knock any normal

767
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:20,038
human being out for about 48 hours it's

768
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,480
a lot and so that was the basis for the

769
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:23,839
conversation and I've talked a little

770
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,480
bit about this before when you know

771
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,439
alcohol went into bars and you had your

772
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,200
laborers going and drinking

773
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,360
and those conversations they had really

774
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,880
sort of shaped the future and that

775
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:36,879
turned into tea houses where now they

776
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,240
were more intellectual people getting

777
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,760
together not so much laborers and they

778
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,240
started having conversations that

779
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:45,240
started shaping the world and then

780
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,159
coffee came in and coffee was all about

781
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,960
productivity and efficiency and those

782
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,799
conversations shaped the world and made

783
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,159
us much more productive and much more

784
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:55,879
efficient and the conversation that

785
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,000
they're the most scared for us to have

786
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,080
which is why in all of these states and

787
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,240
countries where there's legal cannabis

788
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:04,918
there's very few places to actually

789
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,159
smoke it like actual lounges because

790
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,519
once we get that and that's what hash

791
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,039
church is and everyone's like oh hash

792
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,359
church is amazing it's like really hash

793
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:13,319
church is just a place where you let

794
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,319
people who use cannabis have

795
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:17,398
conversation and direct their

796
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:19,319
communities with that conversation and

797
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:22,199
we will have that when we eventually can

798
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:25,158
have these gatherings and so that's the

799
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,558
basis in the foundation and I think I

800
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,880
might have started it by saying to Sam

801
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:31,319
you know know the Cannabis Cup has so

802
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,000
there were a lot of people back then as

803
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:34,759
well that were just pissed off at High

804
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,720
Times and upset with high times and I

805
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:38,480
was always kind of like listen like I

806
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,880
think your expectations are too high the

807
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,200
fact that they're making this happen and

808
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,519
we can come here and we can all meet up

809
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,600
and filter out the people you don't want

810
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,319
to know but meet these amazing people

811
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,278
that were like otherwise were hiding

812
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,678
from the police in every state and

813
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:53,119
country that they lived in and now they

814
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,038
were just outing themselves at the

815
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,678
Cannabis Cup with video cameras and

816
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:58,960
cameras and it was just it was

817
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,960
absolutely mental but there was a lot of

818
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,679
people that I was like I don't a lot of

819
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,480
people just smoking cigarettes and just

820
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,480
kind of being like oh I wish I could run

821
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,798
all these heads through my bags and just

822
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,079
collect the 90 Micron heads and that

823
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:13,480
will be the the you know this Gathering

824
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:15,678
that we would have and that was what the

825
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,960
conversation started with me and Sam he

826
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,720
was probably 60 dabs in and I was

827
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,600
probably 15 or 20 dabs in absolutely

828
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,319
destroyed and now we're like uh oh if we

829
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,480
could just run everyone through the High

830
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:31,119
Times cup through our bags man and catch

831
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,960
them all in the 90 like just Bakery talk

832
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,879
but it turned into Legends of hash it

833
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,639
turned into um you know keep in mind

834
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,519
those guys at the time too were very um

835
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:44,158
removed from the community and the scene

836
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:46,519
like they were a part of it but they

837
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,240
were also like they knew the only way

838
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:50,839
they could get what they were wanting to

839
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,240
do done would be if they isolated

840
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:54,199
themselves and a lot of people that were

841
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,159
on the other side of things those guys

842
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,319
those guys meaning Sam and yourself of

843
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,880
farm ho of farm that would be Clark

844
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:04,278
David Pate Michael Rich um skunkman Sam

845
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,039
uh and you know a group Michael uh David

846
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:08,039
Pate was the chemist who who did all the

847
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:09,759
chemistry work but they they were doing

848
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:13,239
things that we started doing in like the

849
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,760
late 2000s like the 2010s and the 2015s

850
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:18,918
they were doing it in like the 80s and

851
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,480
so um and doing it right and so because

852
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:24,000
of that they were always you know there

853
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,960
was always oh those guys are like

854
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,280
they're the they're the DEA they're the

855
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:32,000
CIA there were all these rumors r that

856
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,760
Sam was a DEA agent and then a CIA agent

857
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,039
when I first went in '95 I remember

858
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,079
someone pointing him out across the

859
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,239
street and saying that guy's a CIA agent

860
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:41,359
and you know I was like oh my God like

861
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,279
whoa crazy and then as I got to know him

862
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:46,679
and invited into his Circle he's a very

863
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,000
private man and meeting his wife of like

864
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,639
I don't know 35 or 40 years or something

865
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,119
maybe 50 maybe they've been together for

866
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,320
50 years now very long time seeing all

867
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,519
the old photos hearing all the old

868
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:01,079
stories and seeing how the you know s

869
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:03,159
sedy uh was his was the name that he

870
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:05,440
original originally picked well that was

871
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,598
because he back in the 60s when he was a

872
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,440
big acid head and a big Tripper they all

873
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,920
called him jingles and Jingles backwards

874
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,920
is Cy so to think that all these other

875
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,920
people were like he's a CIA agent but

876
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,358
then to go to go to his house and hear

877
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,200
him and his wife chuckling about it like

878
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,759
they're just like oh my God like you

879
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:26,598
know and being able to meet and become

880
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,200
friends with his wife um and hearing the

881
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,320
stories from her perspective she's such

882
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:33,799
a sweet and honest and and really

883
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,400
wonderful woman um there's no fibery

884
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,640
there's no lies and there's still these

885
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,559
stories going around to this day that

886
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:41,358
this guy is in the DEA because what did

887
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:43,679
he do he did what no one else in

888
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,880
Amsterdam could do he got a license to

889
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:48,199
to to have and grow cannabis and then he

890
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,000
had a DEA export license so he could

891
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:52,000
send it to different labs in different

892
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,199
countries for them to do the redundancy

893
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,880
work to test against the work that they

894
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:58,318
were doing in their lab because back in

895
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,920
the day the the the the the standards

896
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:02,960
for THC and canono were super sketched

897
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,280
out and they weren't well done and he

898
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,240
they all he had to create his own

899
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,119
standards if you can imagine so

900
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,519
basically that was the conversation that

901
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,160
started hash church and we you know they

902
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,000
were very removed and he was kind of

903
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:16,039
like well do you think you could sell 50

904
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,599
tickets like you know and here I am

905
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:19,679
going dude I don't think you realize

906
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,280
what the community really like thinks of

907
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:22,719
you and Rob and the work that you've

908
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,079
done like you guys are [ __ ] rock

909
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:28,159
stars and so it was kind of up to me by

910
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,240
him allowing me in and to kind of come

911
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,078
under and and and be mentored by him he

912
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:35,639
also gave me permission in that sense to

913
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,920
shine a light on him and Rob and the

914
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:39,400
marijuana botney and the hashes and all

915
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,000
these I was just like these guys have

916
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,920
done it all and so they weren't sure

917
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,400
that we could sell the tickets but they

918
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,039
did have a restaurant a good friend of

919
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,240
of of both of robs and Sam's uh by the

920
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,599
name of Simone good friend of all of

921
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:55,799
ours now and he owned a restaurant

922
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,720
called the artiste in Amsterdam it was a

923
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,000
Lebanese restaurant and I remember being

924
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,559
there before

925
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,639
Legends and we would go there and Dave

926
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,639
would or Sam would bring his bong and we

927
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,279
would basically puff bowls in this guy's

928
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,879
restaurant and I was and people would

929
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,640
get there'd be Dutch people in the

930
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,318
restaurant kind of getting mad about it

931
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,639
uh and he would kick them out he'd be

932
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:18,159
like look if you don't like it you know

933
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:21,279
get the [ __ ] out which was just like

934
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:23,719
amazing to us we were just like listen

935
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,640
if we ever do throw a party it has to be

936
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:27,279
at Simone's restaurant so Simone's

937
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:29,358
restaurant was small and the ceiling was

938
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,680
low and it was very it got very smoky

939
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:34,039
very fast but that is part of the reason

940
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,639
why we always uh through the rest

941
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:37,559
through the party at Simone's through

942
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:39,559
that money in that business his way

943
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:41,639
because he was so righteous and he he

944
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:43,920
was a non-p puffer that stood behind

945
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:46,000
puffers in a way that very few non-p

946
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,838
puffers ever have you know putting his

947
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,559
license on the on the line putting his

948
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:52,199
whole restaurant like yeah you can smoke

949
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:54,719
bong rips after your meal come on so we

950
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:57,759
ended up uh you know creating the the

951
00:37:54,719 --> 00:38:00,279
first laminant we created uh we rented

952
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,040
the restaurant out and uh I basically

953
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:05,599
went out and basically tra sold Legends

954
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:07,279
of hash tickets to anyone that would

955
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,720
show me a beautiful piece of hash I

956
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,839
figured you know what this isn't about

957
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:13,039
status this isn't about who you are in

958
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:15,400
the industry this isn't about going and

959
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,679
promising DNA 12 tickets and then going

960
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,880
and giving s his 16 for his Entourage it

961
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:23,838
was about bringing in people who loved

962
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,599
hashish regardless of who they were so

963
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,400
the only real prejudism was that you had

964
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,800
to show me a beautiful piece of hash and

965
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,639
it was interesting back in the day

966
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,680
because people were like oh how much do

967
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:35,879
I give you and I was like you don't give

968
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,358
me any you know I thought like [ __ ] of

969
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,039
course I wanted the hash I would have

970
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,039
loved to have been like oh you know you

971
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,279
give me 10 grams and then then then then

972
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,800
then you can come to Legends so right

973
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,400
from the get-go there was this

974
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,760
temptation to bastardize the Integrity

975
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,920
of the of the whole thing right from the

976
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,040
start which i' I refused to do I'm like

977
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,760
plus I'm not hurting for hash like I've

978
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:59,719
got lots so I just I would smell the has

979
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,839
I wouldn't even often dab it but if I

980
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:03,759
looked at it and smelled it and felt it

981
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,039
I was like you know what that g that

982
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,800
will gain you entry to buy a ticket so

983
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:10,719
then you ended up with these there was

984
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,280
always one or two that snuck in and got

985
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,679
you know got in when they really

986
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,040
shouldn't have got in and those people

987
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,639
turned white very early on left the

988
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:20,679
building they were out of there within

989
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:22,639
an hour this is hashish abuse to the

990
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:25,399
greatest level I mean this is where you

991
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,239
take people like Jameson who like oh

992
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,000
yeah I abuse hash every day it's like oh

993
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,199
yeah well you'll be higher than you've

994
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,400
ever [ __ ] been after Legends of hash

995
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:36,118
I promise you that's just the facts it's

996
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,760
the highest I've ever been in my entire

997
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,880
life and that's kind of the the basis of

998
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,040
what I set up Legends for you know Sam

999
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,800
turned it into a contest and that's

1000
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,639
awesome I think that it was I think

1001
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,720
that's why it survived there's this sort

1002
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,639
of got to be this this level of

1003
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,959
self-preservation and self-promotion

1004
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,159
there has to be for people to really get

1005
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,440
into it even though I will say for a

1006
00:39:55,159 --> 00:40:00,838
long time you know Legends was just this

1007
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,000
elusive event we didn't try to make it a

1008
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:05,920
hard to get ticket the hash heads just

1009
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,679
grew in the early days there were less

1010
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,119
of them and of course there was no

1011
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:11,078
cameras allowed because some of the

1012
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,200
people at the first Legends were very

1013
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:17,200
very very very hardcore people uh doing

1014
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:20,598
the good work of getting the hash out

1015
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:23,118
all over Europe and uh North America and

1016
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:26,240
that was very illegal work back then you

1017
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,200
know dealing with uh with cartels

1018
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,118
basically to buy this hash in certain

1019
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:32,639
countries and then trying to move it

1020
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,358
around all around these guys were like

1021
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,879
this was one of the first times they got

1022
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:38,440
to have a party and enjoy hash because

1023
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,760
they had to be invisible in the real

1024
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,519
world and so to have like three or four

1025
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,520
of those guys at the first Legends I

1026
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:47,039
mean the nose from Amsterdam if any of

1027
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,280
you have been to Amsterdam you got to

1028
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:54,759
know the nose the nose nose that's uh

1029
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,800
Steve Hayes um he was out front at one

1030
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,680
point pale white big hashish guy in

1031
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,318
Amsterdam and he was pale and I was like

1032
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:01,559
wow did you smoke too much he's like no

1033
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:03,679
man I looked around the room and

1034
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,358
realized who was in there and so he was

1035
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,480
only one one of the only people who

1036
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:10,159
really understood who was at the first

1037
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,559
Legends of hashish and that came through

1038
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,480
one of our friends uh who's since passed

1039
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,759
away he just happen to know all these

1040
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,440
different guys because I guess he was

1041
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,480
you know kind of involved in those

1042
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,318
things for for for a very long time so

1043
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,000
for me there's no shame in that like I

1044
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:27,719
wanted to Legends to pay homage to that

1045
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,920
the same way I wanted to pay hom to the

1046
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:33,118
TP slurpers and the temp teex and the TP

1047
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,280
timers and all of these new things that

1048
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,599
we've done I also wanted to always hold

1049
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,960
a root or an anchor in the foundation of

1050
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,200
Legends and even going way far back

1051
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,599
before these guys were smuggling hash

1052
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:48,919
around the the world but going even

1053
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:51,480
hundreds of years further to the sufis

1054
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,838
and to these different Afghan Gardens

1055
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,800
and you know these storylines of

1056
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,119
different people that have been

1057
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,119
promoting and using Hashi for all of

1058
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,440
these centuries I also wanted to stay

1059
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,160
rooted in that and pay homage to that so

1060
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,838
when you become part of a Legends of

1061
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:11,118
hashish it's really where old meets new

1062
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:12,559
and you want to uh not necessarily in

1063
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,440
the Cannabis industry it's always

1064
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,000
division right and maybe that's just in

1065
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,000
life in general it's always like oh I

1066
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,039
only smoke BHO I only smoke full melt

1067
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,039
bubble and there's just every little

1068
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:25,239
piece is divided and and and divisive

1069
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,639
and at Legends you could be like yeah I

1070
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:29,679
smoke my dabs but I'm going to go hit

1071
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:32,000
that 110 year-old Hubbly Bubbly that

1072
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:36,639
Sam's dumping a gram and a half of his

1073
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,280
60 uh% gland heads into so it was pretty

1074
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,960
special the first one and everyone since

1075
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,880
then uh and I have zero doubts that Los

1076
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,159
Angeles will not be Beyond uh anything

1077
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,400
that we've ever done uh because there's

1078
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:51,358
a team there's Addison and Kevin and a

1079
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,200
whole team of people doing what I just

1080
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:57,719
couldn't do on my own and you guys the

1081
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:00,039
sponsors are a part of that team so I'm

1082
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:02,558
very glad to uh be sharing BS with you

1083
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:05,960
here on a Sunday uh on a Sunday morning

1084
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:09,040
on the west coast 100% 100% was it the

1085
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,960
first legends that Sam turned it into a

1086
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:14,159
competition or did that happen after you

1087
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,240
know I think it happened pretty much

1088
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,078
right there you know and and it was

1089
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:21,959
brilliant from Sam's perspective it was

1090
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,760
kind of like look I I I earned this and

1091
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,400
you know people and I think part of the

1092
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,760
first Legends no doubt part of the first

1093
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,559
many Legends

1094
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,000
was just being in a room with Sam he was

1095
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:35,519
that elusive to be able to just be in a

1096
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,679
room with Sam and SM and then see him as

1097
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:40,559
like a as a excited small child on

1098
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:43,358
Christmas morning like Sam was a very

1099
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:45,480
serious guy very much like that sort of

1100
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,880
like Beyond serious Professor that just

1101
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,639
knows everything that you can't ever get

1102
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,960
it right because he's already done it

1103
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:53,879
all and uh you know the way he used to

1104
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,679
call people out and the way he'd you

1105
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,680
know it was hard it was hard being under

1106
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:59,879
his wing those first years but as

1107
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:02,480
Legends progressed and as he started

1108
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,079
having fun and just really doing what he

1109
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,800
loved and trust me this guy loves

1110
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:09,480
puffing like the fact that people would

1111
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,839
call him a DEA agent or a CIA agent when

1112
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,880
really truly he was the the biggest

1113
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,440
cannabis Warrior I've ever I've never

1114
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,880
met a guy that is more excited about

1115
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,679
cannabis and more

1116
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,519
importantly um less excited about who

1117
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:24,279
makes the profit off of it he never

1118
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:25,838
cared from the day that I met him he's

1119
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,559
like I just want it to be legal and

1120
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,400
available to everyone

1121
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,680
everyone else can fight about who gets

1122
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,318
to make the money so when you know that

1123
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,558
about Sam and that's not something he

1124
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:37,960
posted a lot online but when you know

1125
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:40,000
that about him uh you know that it would

1126
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,599
make no sense for him to go around and

1127
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,119
and rat people out uh when he's truly I

1128
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,079
don't know anyone that loves cannabis

1129
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,280
more than this guy um and he doesn't

1130
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,960
love it in a way that's going to just

1131
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,480
pay him he just he's really like in the

1132
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,599
TR in the truest form I mean he's done a

1133
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,440
lot for our community a lot of us us are

1134
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,359
you know dabbing on these full melts

1135
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,440
thanks to some of the work that that guy

1136
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:06,318
did so I won't go on forever about Sam

1137
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,400
but uh he's a big part of Legends of

1138
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,639
Hashi she's one of the founders and uh

1139
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:15,440
yeah he's just

1140
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:20,000
done for all Sam yeah for sure hey I

1141
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,760
wanted to uh welcome Sam with h show and

1142
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,239
and Ros and Tech and dab Nation

1143
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:29,000
Anda and focus and all the stuff and Sam

1144
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:30,919
and uh there with him as well want to

1145
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,239
welcome those guys at Focus V is their

1146
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:36,559
label there but um definitely wouldn't

1147

be able to put uh a lot of the stuff we

1148
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:41,280
did for the gift bags and a lot of the

1149
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,960
judges kits and stuff without uh without

1150

1153
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,599
Marcus welcome man welcome it's a good

1154
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:58,318
morning getting baked with friends yeah

1155
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,200
what up Drew what's up

1156
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:03,199
Kev

1157
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:06,159
boys I I had to go and take a take a dab

1158
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:09,000
with the saber and the uh the ca too I

1159
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,598
had to show the people what was up man

1160
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,079
let's go that thing's awesome we love

1161
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:15,119
the saber

1162
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,800
man I told uh I told Addison to send me

1163
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,480
a cter because tasel doesn't like he

1164
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:23,240
drives like a maniac and he doesn't stop

1165
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,358
so like unless you have a rig to smoke

1166
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:27,799
in the car you're you're you're waiting

1167
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:29,759
they fit in a cup holder perfect

1168
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,400
yeah no I'm I'm I'm looking forward to

1169
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,640
having one for this

1170
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,280
trip yeah it's one of the benefits of

1171
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:38,719
using a uh a device like this that's

1172
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:43,119
designed by a company that actually

1173
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:46,039
makes s hatch so that's very grateful

1174
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:49,480
guys yeah exactly it's a little

1175
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:51,880
different you know no it's definitely uh

1176
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,750
very very pleased to have you blessed to

1177
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:58,369
have you guys Drew rips a slurper

1178
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,369
[Laughter]

1179
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:03,318
but you know what I love about you guys

1180
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,800
is that you're not against that you know

1181
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:09,039
you understand that the carda is a tool

1182
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,119
that's used you know within our day and

1183
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:12,558
and you know in between transitionally

1184
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,880
between

1185
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,839
things and it's not like you know you're

1186
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,519
all against you know using a slurp or

1187
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:21,759
using anything else it's it's like you

1188
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:25,559
guys are about to happen I use a lot of

1189
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:29,880
glass uh in my day-to- day honestly yeah

1190
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:32,040
all different sty check out all the ways

1191
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,200
that you know you can taste the

1192
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:38,400
your ab sizes

1193
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,960
it's yeah I'll smoke a hot knife right

1194
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,358
now you know I just I just like getting

1195
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,079
high

1196
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:47,960
know exactly I'm not I'm

1197
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:49,839
not I can tell you're telling the truth

1198
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,760
because I see that titanium

1199
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:57,000
nail yeah I saw that

1200
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:59,839
yeah ra you got a mini nail yeah that's

1201
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:04,400
an enail uh we used to well we still

1202
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:08,480
make them we we make enails um so yeah

1203
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,639
titanium since day one man you know [ __ ]

1204
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,679
it's always ready you know it's always

1205
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:16,558
on you know I I hear a lot about um like

1206
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:18,759
temperature regulation and stuff and one

1207
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,440
of the things that you know my thought

1208
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,760
process always was with the nail and I'm

1209
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:26,000
interested to ask some of you guys that

1210
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:28,359
are at the the very top end of this is

1211
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,559
you know the way the way this enil works

1212
00:48:28,358 --> 00:48:34,480
is it's constantly taking the

1213
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:36,880
temperature of um you know the nail and

1214
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,719
then it's constantly modulating how much

1215
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,599
power it's giving it so when the

1216
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:44,039
temperature drops the power goes up so

1217
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,160
right now it's staying at a perfect 500

1218
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:48,719
and even as like the air conditioning

1219
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:50,759
and stuff kicks on I can see it dropping

1220
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:53,719
and changing and it changes how much

1221
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,119
power so when I'm drawing on it when I'm

1222
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:58,399
you know ripping it um it it it

1223
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:01,358
throttles up the power and stuff so it

1224
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,480
really keeps it a consistent temperature

1225
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:06,920
the whole way through and I see like you

1226
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,639
know him with the Banger as soon as he

1227
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,760
starts drawing on it it's changing the

1228
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:13,679
temperature you know like from the start

1229
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,119
of the dab to the end of the dab so it's

1230
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:19,399
pretty it's pretty significant the when

1231
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:21,880
you start pulling the air cools it down

1232
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,119
pretty quickly right dab cools it down

1233
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,760
pretty quickly too before you even pull

1234
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:28,720
you drop that dab on there and you're

1235
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:31,280
you're cooling things down down

1236
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,639
substantially and every sub and every

1237
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,119
compound like releases and holds heat

1238
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:39,199
differently so you know the quartz

1239
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:41,519
ability for thermal shock is very unique

1240
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:43,879
Sapphire not so much there's you know

1241
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:46,318
you dip hot Sapphire into any liquid or

1242
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,280
even use like a a Q-tip with ISO and you

1243
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:51,279
can crack the sapphire it's super

1244
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,559
delicate but the way it releases heat is

1245
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,079
just a little more preservative than

1246
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:59,400
quartz not quite enough to warranty

1247
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:01,200
paying like $600 for a sapphire thing

1248
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,880
that's going to break almost uh every

1249
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:06,199
time you try to clean it but um I I do

1250
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,160
find it very interesting that uh there's

1251
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:12,279
a whole science you could get a a PhD on

1252
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:15,039
this of just how different substances

1253
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,359
release and retain heat and how that

1254
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:19,400
either preserves or destroys and I'll

1255
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:21,318
say volatile organic compounds because

1256
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,240
we're not just talking about tpin some

1257
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:26,039
of the flavor profiles that we love the

1258
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:29,118
most are thols and they're very very

1259
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:32,400
small percentages but they really do you

1260
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:35,119
know throw the smell and flavor profile

1261
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,039
to a great angle with a with a very very

1262
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,480
very small amount and I think that they

1263
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,119
have such small amounts we don't give

1264
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,679
them as much credit as where credit is

1265
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,519
due but I mean skunk for instant is

1266
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:47,558
definitely a combination of two or three

1267
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:50,239
THS and butane thle one I believe is one

1268
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:51,640
of them so uh let's not forget our thil

1269
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,759
when we're talking about our volatile

1270
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:55,960
organic

1271
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,359
compounds very good point I don't know

1272
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,599
if anyone else is trying to do this but

1273
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:03,159
I've been trying to keep up with JP it

1274
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:06,119
is not [ __ ] easy he's just I've been

1275
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:08,078
lit I literally he's ahead of me but

1276
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,358
I've been like trying to just because

1277
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,359
coming into this I was like all right

1278
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,039
I'm gonna pick somebody and I'm just

1279
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:16,000
gonna you know that's that's how take my

1280
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:19,000
dabs and that's who you pick JP I picked

1281
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,798
[ __ ] JP and for Christ's sake I'm two

1282
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,358
behind hey I got a funny story me and

1283
00:51:21,798 --> 00:51:26,639
Kevin went to dinner with deppy and we

1284
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:29,239
went over to was up Mikey's house and

1285
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:31,679
and uh uh we're all there I think it was

1286
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:34,199
Jay from Professor Sith a bunch of us

1287
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:37,719
all go to dinner and we get there and

1288
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:41,039
Mikey's got the table just laid out like

1289
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:43,480
an m on the table just splashed out with

1290
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:46,599
every you know the illis of the craziest

1291
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,079
[ __ ] and we all start dabbing and I

1292
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:50,559
didn't notice it till later Kevin

1293
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:53,599
noticed it but deppy was hitting every

1294
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,519
single rig and he went through while we

1295
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,280
were there and dabbed every single rig

1296
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:00,159
and then started going back through the

1297
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,160
rigs he Gauntlet he did The Gauntlet all

1298
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:05,399
the way through and was coming back 11

1299
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:09,719
rigs he did 11 and he went

1300
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:12,519
more yeah repeat the first time I the

1301
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:15,318
first time I met deppy was at mother

1302
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:18,920
ship two years ago and Addison took me

1303
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:20,838
there and deie ran the hash competition

1304
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:25,358
at the end of the night L like we

1305
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:28,078
started late we did 52 dabs he served

1306
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:30,440
them all he cleaned every Banger he

1307
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:33,039
heated every Banger and then when we

1308
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,318
finished he started up a pingpong

1309
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:37,079
tournament that went for no less than

1310
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:39,239
three hours like with all the people

1311
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:40,599
that were watching that weren't dabbing

1312
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,679
while the rest of the dabbers were just

1313
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:45,079
like sitting at that table recovering he

1314
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:46,440
was literally playing pingpong within a

1315
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:48,240
minute of finishing the comp and

1316
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,079
announcing and announcing the winners so

1317
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:54,279
like dude is he's a wizard he's the

1318
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:57,000
wizard he's a wizard he we had a video

1319
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:00,040
game system that had uh what was it

1320
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,519
Street Fighter 2 and he played as Chun

1321
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:05,119
Lee and wrecked every person in the room

1322
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:07,599
be the [ __ ] out of all the gauntlet on

1323
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,119
wrecking us all in Chun Lee and then

1324
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:13,160
went back and then I wound up beating

1325
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:15,680
him the second time by like a hair it

1326
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:17,798
was so funny it was insane that's that's

1327
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:21,399
that's some skunkman Sam [ __ ] right

1328
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:23,239
there for real oh yeah Legend some of

1329
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,519
the Legends some of the Legends were

1330
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:27,479
like 30 to 40 entries and we'd have to

1331
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:29,920
smoke them all in in a couple of hours

1332
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:33,039
you know and the this one in Barcelona

1333
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,119
which was at certified uh when flux was

1334
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:37,440
a part of it flux kind of got us in

1335
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:39,318
there and we were in this crazy back

1336
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,920
room that looked like Cambodia there was

1337
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:42,599
Holes in the Floor and the walls were

1338
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,400
all gnarly and it was just like I'll

1339
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:46,798
never forget that group of people flux

1340
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,639
was at the table and Rick delisi was at

1341
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:51,559
the table Flav was at the table uh and

1342
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:54,879
we just went through Ramone was at the

1343
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:58,760
table just went through like you know 40

1344
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:01,880
plus uh entries uh smoking one dab after

1345
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:04,280
another that is a gauntlet of gauntlets

1346
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,599
I used to love Tech at the time what was

1347
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:09,440
like the tech at the time what was it a

1348
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:11,280
titanium nail no no this was this was

1349
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,559
2016 so we were definitely hitting out

1350
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,000
of quartz yep we were definitely hitting

1351
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:18,798
out of quartz yeah there's no uh

1352
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,639
titanium Nails on that table do people

1353
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:23,719
really hate on titanium nails like am I

1354
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:27,920
really jamming up the program dude

1355
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:30,679
people no no no listen this is this yes

1356
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,880
yes and no the problem is Instagram has

1357
00:54:30,679 --> 00:54:36,159
created an enormous amount of [ __ ] boys

1358
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,838
and so you know the [ __ ] boy thing is oh

1359
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:41,039
you're hit yeah you know hold on hold on

1360
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:43,759
hold on you're talking about using all

1361
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:46,719
these different surfaces to to keep the

1362
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,880
same temperature I'm watching the SC

1363
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:51,118
when it's ambient right now it's 500

1364
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,838
Degrees when I'm ripping it like full

1365
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,798
bore it only drops to 480 that's right

1366
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,318
but that's just the temperature if you

1367
00:54:55,798 --> 00:54:59,519
did the same thing out of a quartz

1368
00:54:57,318 --> 00:55:01,440
Banger side by side you'd notice the

1369
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:04,239
preservation of the volatile organic

1370
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,200
compounds would be different the when it

1371
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:08,519
hits the titanium even at that low

1372
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:10,159
temperature it's not the same as when it

1373
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:12,480
hits quartz and that has nothing to do

1374
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:14,039
with the temperature as much as the the

1375
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,519
component that you're hitting off of

1376
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:18,719
they all are different titanium

1377
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:20,759
generally is looked at as kind of one of

1378
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:23,118
the first ones that you know branded

1379
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,920
many of us many of us wear our titanium

1380
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:29,000
brands for Life uh on our arms and on

1381
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,599
our wherever's but but then people you

1382
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,960
know like oh and it's kind of like this

1383
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:36,000
you know it's it's real but it's also

1384
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,760
like built up like people that don't

1385
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,079
even know will watch this and suddenly

1386
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,799
be like oh yeah man I would never hit

1387
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:42,760
off a titanium nail I would hit off a

1388
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:44,559
titanium nail if I didn't have a quartz

1389
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,039
nail if I didn't have a quartz or a

1390
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,920
titanium nail I'd hit off a pen or I'd

1391
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:52,359
hit off I just thought quartz is about

1392
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,720
how the hash moves the hash moves

1393
00:55:52,358 --> 00:55:57,598
differently on quartz in a way that it

1394
00:55:54,719 --> 00:56:00,358
can't move on titanium because titanium

1395
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,519
slows it down where if you allow it to

1396
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:05,239
move it can hit more surface area and

1397
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:08,480
vaporize more quickly more evenly so

1398
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:10,519
it's quartz has that that quality it to

1399
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,639
move more quickly and dance around that

1400
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:15,440
[ __ ] and then you know the cap is adding

1401
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:17,960
Spin and everything else to push it in

1402
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,960
different directions and we're trying to

1403
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,400
make it move we're trying to vaporize as

1404
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,639
much as we can and get a good hit and

1405
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,880
keep temp because temp is good is

1406
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:27,598
important part you can add pearls for

1407
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,559
that you can do other things for that

1408
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,480
and it's like you know that that all

1409
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:34,039
kind of comes to the picture the but the

1410
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,880
email has its [ __ ] place if you got a

1411
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:37,920
bunch of people coming over light them

1412
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,880
up because it's like yo I'm not gonna

1413
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,838
sit here [ __ ] I'm not trying to argue

1414
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:45,000
anybody but like I mean we take all that

1415
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:46,880
in consideration like this cap is rifled

1416
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,280
so when you pull the air through it's

1417
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,400
spinning it's designed to spin I mean we

1418
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,880
we did all kinds of airflow simulations

1419
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:56,798
and stuff when we design this snail so

1420
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:59,559
um you know I don't know like I'm

1421
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:02,838
I think it's cool you know [ __ ] I just

1422
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:05,760
want I'm not trying Rock the

1423
00:57:02,838 --> 00:57:07,279
Boat [ __ ] no they work man there you're

1424
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,240
definitely not rocking the boat like I

1425
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,200
said it's an Instagram [ __ ] boy thing if

1426
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:13,078
you posted you know it's just someone

1427
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,279
would jump on that [ __ ] in an oh he's

1428
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:17,798
[ __ ] puffing off a titanium nail [ __ ]

1429
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:20,599
him okay well [ __ ] you too I'm getting

1430
00:57:17,798 --> 00:57:22,920
high they'd also [ __ ] [ __ ] at you if

1431
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:25,079
your hash was too dark so don't take it

1432
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,920
with a grain of salt dude like it's

1433
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:29,798
whatever you're puffing out of

1434
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,760
is perfect and if you want to travel in

1435
00:57:29,798 --> 00:57:33,798
a different direction listen everyone in

1436
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,880
this room I would almost guarantee has

1437
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:38,440
puffed off of a titanium nail and in

1438
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:41,119
fact I have puffed off many of [ __ ]

1439
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:43,519
stainless steel knives hot knifing you

1440
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:46,119
know probably even aloys and Coke cans

1441
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:47,798
and all this other [ __ ]

1442
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:52,039
so it

1443
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:54,719
is rip on a screen on a

1444
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:57,880
denail titanium nail like back in the

1445
00:57:54,719 --> 00:58:00,480
day doing that screen Tech

1446
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:03,000
yeah the best hits back in the day that

1447
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,000
allows a

1448
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:08,798
lot no it is good I mean it's the the

1449
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,639
hardest part about dils and I think what

1450
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:11,798
kicked their ass or the electric Nails

1451
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:13,639
you couldn't really bring them in the

1452
00:58:11,798 --> 00:58:15,599
car unless you had something correct for

1453
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:17,400
that and like you know but everything

1454
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:20,160
has its [ __ ] purpose I mean if I show

1455
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,160
up somewhere and all they have is X

1456
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,440
we're using X you know what I mean that

1457
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:26,199
that it's a [ __ ] that's that's

1458
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,679
doesn't matter at all at that point it's

1459
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:29,358
like let's go that that's what's great

1460
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:32,000
about hash too is that you can do it so

1461
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:34,719
many different ways but no shout out to

1462
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,599
the I mean just remember when we were

1463
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,919
torching and then the d nails came out

1464
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:41,519
the electric nails came out how [ __ ]

1465
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,079
much that changed the game like how you

1466
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:44,960
know when you went to a session now it

1467
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:47,200
was like we're all getting [ __ ] lit

1468
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,599
in 10 minutes you know it's like that

1469
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:50,318
changed the [ __ ] game so it

1470
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:53,400
definitely still has its home and has

1471
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:57,440
its place and I think you know the

1472
00:58:53,400 --> 00:59:00,079
internet everyone's at different levels

1473
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,599
well that was all Sam before jar Michael

1474
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,760
before any of that it was Sam that

1475
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,599
turned me onto those screams in fact how

1476
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,480
I met Sam was someone told me that he

1477
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:11,838
used a new screen for every single bowl

1478
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,639
that he puffed out of so he'd like soak

1479
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:15,440
these screens and get the coding off of

1480
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:16,838
them and then he had a b a big bag of

1481
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,440
brand new screens like a thousand of

1482
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:20,318
them and he just walk around and you

1483
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,480
could when the first time I went to the

1484
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:24,480
Pack's party house I saw screens and

1485
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,119
matches like on the floor like if he

1486
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,920
stood anywhere even for like five

1487
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:30,720
minutes there'd be like 5050 matches and

1488
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,440
like 10 or 15

1489
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:36,078
screens and so I was like oh W and start

1490
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,480
and and in fact I remember picking one

1491
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:41,640
up and realizing he's not even finishing

1492
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:43,280
these the hashes melted into the screen

1493
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:44,879
and he's I was just like this is not how

1494
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,319
I'm going to try his hash for the first

1495
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,760
time so I threw it back down but I

1496
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:50,000
definitely saw people picking those up

1497
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,079
and hitting them and being like that was

1498
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,760
the best hash that I hit in Amsterdam

1499
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,318
was the screens that I picked up at the

1500
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,039
Pack's Party House think of how [ __ ]

1501
00:59:55,318 --> 00:59:59,798
mental that is dude yeah so I found him

1502
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:02,280
on the third floor with his [ __ ]

1503
00:59:59,798 --> 01:00:04,038
Birkenstock sandals on which was another

1504
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,960
uh look for the guy in the Birkenstock

1505
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:08,760
sandals uh and that's kind of yeah sort

1506
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,639
of met him and walked over he was very

1507
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:13,039
you know standoffish and it took a

1508
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:14,838
little while it wasn't until he found

1509
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:16,200
out that I used his saying if it don't

1510
01:00:14,838 --> 01:00:17,759
bubble it ain't worth the trouble for

1511
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:19,519
the Bubble Bag company that he reached

1512
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,720
out to me and was like do you know who I

1513
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:24,400
am and that's really how we ended up

1514
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:26,798
linking up but uh thank God because

1515
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,039
without Sam and his hack and all that

1516
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:31,798
like many many decades of work that he

1517
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:34,720
did uh we would not be having a Legends

1518
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:36,798
of hash in Los Angeles here in the next

1519
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:42,719
in the next month so we can we can thank

1520
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:45,440
Sam for that too so true yeah no he's uh

1521
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:47,199
he is yeah we we needed to talk about

1522
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,119
actually reaching out to him and and

1523
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:51,759
getting him to uh to say hello to US

1524
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:53,838
during the event if we could' be

1525
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,280
awesome that would be great I mean I

1526
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:57,920
don't know if we'll get to see him we'll

1527
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,680
probably get to see Dr Seuss but yeah no

1528
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,599
one gets to see him he's

1529
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:07,199
elusive very elusive very uh very

1530
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:09,798
secretive man now it's definitely uh I

1531
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,439
can't I I really can't wait to see

1532
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:13,318
what's entered this year because I've

1533
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,599
kind of started to get a bit of an

1534
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:16,599
understanding if you guys don't know we

1535
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:18,920
have a blockchain that we're going to be

1536
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:21,920
using for the judging uh so that

1537
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:24,680
everything's on there um and and it

1538
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,599
allows us to have uh ability to to see

1539
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:28,118
all the judging in real time but then to

1540
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:30,519
be able to publish everything afterward

1541
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:32,200
in case anyone tries to say somebody

1542
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:35,358
bought a win and in fact it makes it

1543
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:37,598
impossible to do that so anyhow um that

1544
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,880
whole system is there it's all put

1545
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,200
together and we've uh we needed to now

1546
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,559
we need to understand like what some of

1547
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:44,000
the strain names are because they're

1548
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,519
putting together the program that's

1549
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,599
gonna you know that's going to be able

1550
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:50,519
to allow us to do this so some guys have

1551
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:52,200
been sending us some information um on

1552
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:54,400
what their entries might be and and what

1553
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:56,639
they're doing and it's this is

1554
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:00,318
definitely going to be a [ __ ] why

1555
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:06,199
wild uh Kev how many entries is it it's

1556
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:08,119
uh 6 I think three 62 or 63 yeah

1557
01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:11,358
somewhere somewhere in that vicinity

1558
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:14,880
let's say just North of 60 yeah and in

1559
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:16,719
order to in order to land the plane you

1560
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,760
know like touch down and be able to get

1561
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:22,078
everything moving forward we really have

1562
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:23,839
to have 41 makers instead of 40 because

1563
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,599
if somebody backs out or you have to

1564
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:28,038
have a couple more makers just in case

1565
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:30,760
because things always happen um so this

1566
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:33,920
year it was at 41 makers last year I

1567
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:34,960
think we had 24 makers so you never know

1568
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,880
really where that number is going to

1569
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:40,000
fall either right below or just above um

1570
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,559
but this year we're able to you know

1571
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,599
because of the contingency and how it

1572
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:46,000
went through we have 41 makers so um I

1573
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:49,160
think we'll be posting an update of the

1574
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,960
new list on Monday uh that'll show you

1575
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:52,920
know all Corrections and all the and who

1576
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,400
all the makers are so but what that

1577
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,680
means is that you know now you have uh

1578
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,838
what Mark like what Marcus was talking

1579
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:02,399
about you have Legends you know you're

1580
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:05,199
able to to have a lot of hash there you

1581
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:08,680
know from different types of hash there

1582
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:08,679
because you have so many makers

1583
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:27,039
so everybody like hey the next the next

1584
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:29,760
for the next hour you guys can buy

1585
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:32,640
tickets these are all 250 selected

1586
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,480
people from our industry from the hash

1587
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:37,639
industry from the glass industry that

1588
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:39,719
are you know very very very in cash and

1589
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:41,038
about the culture and want to be there

1590
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:43,358
so that's kind of one of the cool things

1591
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:46,200
too is that it's all selected people

1592
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:48,679
that are there um you'll see old friends

1593
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:50,318
you'll see new friends uh and you know

1594
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:51,838
the the idea of having makers from the

1595
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:53,679
East Coast be able to sit down with

1596
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:55,519
makers from the west coast and I know

1597
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:58,000
there's other events that do this I mean

1598
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:59,960
OB obviously but to have it in this

1599
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,199

1627
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:01,879

1628
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,039
people being like Oh I should be on that

1629
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,920
list there's there's 40 dudes on that

1630

list that I'm better than and it's like

1631
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,920
yeah but maybe just this wasn't your

1632
01:05:08,358 --> 01:05:12,798
year to be a guy of that level coming

1633
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,599
into it and you know we have to cap it

1634
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:16,559
at something and you know let's give

1635
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:18,880
everyone the respect and but you know

1636
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:21,000
there's always people who instead of you

1637
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,240
know the the anger that comes from not

1638
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,519
being involved comes out and uh you know

1639
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:28,358
it's it's you know just is what it is

1640
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:29,679
but there's a lot less of that than

1641
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:31,880
there is of people just hitting us up

1642
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:35,558
and being super stoked and you know

1643
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:38,278
everyone [ __ ] fired up for this thing

1644
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:43,160
so about the glass

1645
01:05:38,278 --> 01:05:45,559
Addie oh man I mean you know the whole I

1646
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:48,199
mean what's great is that you do have

1647
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:49,680
Mothership bringing you know the heat

1648
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:51,960
always I mean Scott's always got

1649
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,278
something crazy up his sleeve but we got

1650
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,519
lucky enough where this is the Jeezy one

1651
01:05:54,278 --> 01:05:59,000
drop the herem drop

1652
01:05:56,519 --> 01:06:02,199
uh so it's you know H very hash specific

1653
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,639
art art specific and culturally specific

1654
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:06,000
so it's kind of cool to have that at

1655
01:06:03,639 --> 01:06:08,679
Legends and to have them be willing to

1656
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,318
to put that there but then you know JP's

1657
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:13,440
coming I know he's bringing some great

1658
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:15,480
glass I know uh there's a a you know

1659
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:20,000
task is sending stuff out from Highly

1660
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:22,639
Educated there's uh you know a um Dom is

1661

1662
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:28,078
his stuff is just always you know so

1663
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:29,880
solventless perfect specific uh great

1664
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,599
stuff he'll have like slurper sets and

1665
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:35,000
different stuff like that and um you

1666
01:06:32,599 --> 01:06:37,480
know a lot of glass and then just people

1667
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,960
with glass on the table uh I think

1668
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,719
there's going to be quite a bit of

1669
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,278
heaters you know because of who's

1670
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:45,558
invited and what they have for a

1671
01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:47,838
collection and you know so yeah but I

pretty important to us about um being a

1745
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:48,439
part of Legends as a sponsor was getting

1746

wash process is going on uh when you

1754
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:12,719
know we we were with somebody on the

1755
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:14,839
west coast and they were saying that

1756
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,399
they wanted different temperatures and

1757
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:19,560
humidities um during different stages of

1758
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:21,599
the process you know when they're first

1759
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:23,360
bringing in product when they're you

1760
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,480
know screening it different you know

1761
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:28,839
things whatever they they wanted

1762
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:31,678
advanced environmental stuff um so for

1763
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:34,319
us as equipment manufacturers as

1764
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:36,520
controls manufacturers that's that's

1765
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:40,639
really important feedback to get and

1766
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:43,199
hash the hash Community is you know um

1767
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:46,039
usually the most demanding customers

1768
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:48,119
that's why I think um there's so much

1769
01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:50,800
Innovation there's so much Hardware

1770
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:53,800
there's so many um odds and ends and

1771
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,279
things to consume hash with is because

1772
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:59,440
hash makers are just very hash users are

1773
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:02,079
just very demanding so that type of

1774
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:04,559
feedback is really valuable and and

1775
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:06,840
those type of producers that can provide

1776
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,199
that type of feedback is really

1777
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:11,000
valuable oh

1778
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:13,119
yeah yeah that's one thing I never

1779
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,319
really thought about is the is you know

1780
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:17,920
if you do have Savvy sponsors that are

1781
01:11:15,319 --> 01:11:19,359
taking you know you know they they they

1782
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,079
take the event seriously and they go

1783
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:23,079
there with these you know with different

1784
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:24,920
you know objectives what some of those

1785
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:26,319
objectives are because it is you know

1786
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:28,640
you do have an opportunity to be in the

1787
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:30,079
room with that many people at that level

1788
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,000
and get that feedback and I think it's

1789
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:33,479
probably the same for the Breeders you

1790
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,640
know to be there in the room with that

1791
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:37,718
many makers and kind of have you know

1792
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:39,360
and that's like you know it's it it

1793
01:11:37,719 --> 01:11:41,439
tells me that we're doing it correctly

1794
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:43,639
because now we are kind of curating that

1795
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:46,198
room in the right way you know to make

1796
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:48,000
it add value to the to the sponsors but

1797
01:11:46,198 --> 01:11:49,559
then add as much value as possible to

1798
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,198
the makers because now they're getting

1799
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:54,039
heard by the the you know the guys that

1800
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:55,559
are making different products and

1801
01:11:54,039 --> 01:11:57,760
putting things out there for them them

1802
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,159
so and then sometimes you see those guys

1803
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,600
themselves kind of turn into that like

1804
01:11:59,158 --> 01:12:03,799
if you look at simply Adam uh with his

1805
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,920
dial the resin dial that new unit that

1806
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:09,520
he put together for uh test washing and

1807
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,760
kind of checking material but no it's uh

1808
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,639
it's always cool to see the industry

1809
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:15,440
moving forward and just see it kind of

1810
01:12:12,639 --> 01:12:18,679
you know like Legends is uh you know

1811
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:20,198
gonna be to me uh just a party man it's

1812
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:22,520
like get to be in the room with all

1813
01:12:20,198 --> 01:12:24,238
these people all these friends and all

1814
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,080
these different guys and and then get to

1815
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:29,039
eat great food and the [ __ ] hash

1816
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:31,519
alone so you know that's it's to

1817
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:33,000
simplify all of it it's it's a party you

1818
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,560
know it's really just a time to get

1819
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,840
together and put all that [ __ ] down

1820
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,280
and just [ __ ] have fun you know

1821
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,880
because the the fomo is really going to

1822
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:42,759
come from not being able to be in that

1823
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,400
party and like you know Marcus said when

1824
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:47,639
they walked around and they and they

1825
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:49,559
gave out those lanyards you know the

1826
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:50,880
laminates it was really hard to get one

1827
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,320
of those things you had to have great

1828
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,400
hash and you had to kind of run into

1829
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:56,519
them and that stole to this day like

1830
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:59,238
Legends is it's it's a tough ticket to

1831
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:01,600
get like Kevin and I are are are sitting

1832
01:12:59,238 --> 01:13:02,759
there with like a great Rolodex of

1833
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,920
people that we know because we've been

1834
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,480
in the industry a long time but then

1835
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,239
they come out of the woodwork when

1836
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:10,678
Legends comes because everyone wants to

1837
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:11,839
be in that room and be at that party and

1838
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:14,359
that's what's you know we take it

1839
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:17,119
seriously like to throw the best [ __ ]

1840
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:18,839
party and now we get to make it two days

1841
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:20,840
because we listen to the makers you know

1842
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,440
we listen to the feedback it was a

1843
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,560
little dark in there I didn't get to

1844
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:27,638
have my phone I felt a little rushed you

1845
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:30,080
know there was no judging so who really

1846
01:13:27,639 --> 01:13:31,880
won and and you know all those things

1847
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:34,279
and we had the opportunity to change

1848
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,719
that stuff to actually make it evolve

1849
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:37,519
but then how do you do it you know you

1850
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:38,960
need the help of sponsors you need the

1851
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,960
help of companies to come forward and

1852
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,800
say Hey I want to get the value out of

1853
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,880
being in that room to get to talk to

1854
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,800
just Cur the list of people and and help

1855
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,840
push things forward but you know we're

1856
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,679
willing to exchange you know you know

1857
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,319
value for us that we can then use and

1858
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:57,199
turn into this event and we really try

1859
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:59,840
not to spare any expense like we try to

1860
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:02,319
you know just the judge kit boxes alone

1861
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:05,000
that you'll get as a judge you know for

1862
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:07,238
the makers that they'll get that box

1863
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,600
alone is is a piece of art you know it's

1864
01:14:07,238 --> 01:14:12,158
a really cool piece of art that a ton of

1865
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,320
energy and effort went into creating um

1866
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,079
at and at a at a cost you know so it's

1867
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:18,158
we try to create all these things and

1868
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:20,800
it's you know Marcus and those guys

1869
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:23,319
never monetized and never did anything

1870
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:25,679
and we have the website now we have the

1871
01:14:23,319 --> 01:14:27,279
e-commerce component and that's the idea

1872
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,800
is to create you know something that

1873
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:32,479
allows people to to to you know to hold

1874
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,159
a piece of that culture and to and to

1875
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:36,399
look more into it and figure more about

1876
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:38,759
it and make it a part of like them and

1877
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:40,399
and hash and and and build that

1878
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,920
Community stronger like put people

1879
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:45,238
together you know it's not about like

1880
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:46,440
you know uh if you don't get into

1881
01:14:45,238 --> 01:14:48,000
Legends this year it doesn't mean you're

1882
01:14:46,439 --> 01:14:49,319
not getting into Legends it's like you

1883
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,719
know we're just getting off the ground

1884
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:53,399
and we're we're trying to get it so that

1885
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,760
we can do maybe two events a year in

1886
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:56,279
different places you know we always

1887
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:58,880
wanted to do it in LA we feel like

1888
01:14:56,279 --> 01:15:00,920
that's kind of the epicenter of uh you

1889
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,719
know putting on things like that and

1890
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:04,199
making things like that you know a lot

1891
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:06,760
of people want to go there it's easy to

1892
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:09,079
go there so we we we're grateful for

1893
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:11,320
that component but you know as we get it

1894
01:15:09,079 --> 01:15:13,079
moving forward we'll you know the we

1895
01:15:11,319 --> 01:15:14,599
don't want to make it you know me and

1896
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:15,679
Marcus agree it's like you know Kevin

1897
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,840
says the same thing we don't want to

1898
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:19,000
make it where there's too much Legends

1899
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,319
you know and that's what the website's

1900
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,039
for so that you know when it's not a

1901
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:24,198
legend event you can go get a piece of

1902
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:25,479
merch or something from it and and then

1903
01:15:24,198 --> 01:15:27,839
be able to represent

1904
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:29,439
and have it you know be that rare

1905
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,440
product or something you know it's it's

1906
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:34,279
like there is marketing involved in

1907
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:36,279
everything that we do it's it's sad that

1908
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:38,319
like you know the hey boy culture

1909
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:40,359
sometimes doesn't want you to monetize

1910
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:42,399
something uh but it's like that's how

1911
01:15:40,359 --> 01:15:44,079
things are innovated because people make

1912
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:45,439
money and they can make things better

1913
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:46,600
and as long as the people are ethically

1914
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,238
correct and they're doing the right

1915
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:51,639
thing yeah the sky's the [ __ ] limit

1916
01:15:49,238 --> 01:15:54,439
man you can really push a lot of things

1917
01:15:51,639 --> 01:15:56,239
and you know make make a lot more happen

1918
01:15:54,439 --> 01:15:59,439
but it's it's really just about a

1919
01:15:56,238 --> 01:16:01,359
[ __ ] party a [ __ ] party and that's

1920
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:02,879
what I'm like super stoked as we get

1921
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:05,279
closer to it I get more excited about

1922
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:08,440
that part there's a lot of work you know

1923
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:12,158
Kevin I think we got 11,000 jars from

1924
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:15,198
kaix and we had to uh we had to cap and

1925
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:20,198
build kits of for 11,000 jars to go out

1926
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:21,638
to you know uh 61 or 60 63 kits going

1927
01:16:20,198 --> 01:16:24,238
out to these makers you know so that

1928
01:16:21,639 --> 01:16:25,920
they're able to bring a uniform uh a

1929
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:28,559
uniform off offing so that we're able to

1930
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:30,319
then put it out with with standardized

1931
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,120
delivery to every person that's there

1932
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:35,039
and there's and there's a a ton of

1933
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:37,760
problems that we had to solve behind the

1934
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:39,960
scenes to make all of this stuff

1935
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:42,079
deliverable to the culture and put out

1936
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:45,079
there you know in open hashbar and all

1937
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:46,760
these different things um and then using

1938
01:16:45,079 --> 01:16:48,519
our friends you know that that help

1939
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:50,440
design the the blockchain and all those

1940
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,159
things to bring that into it you know we

1941
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:54,479
had a call with Mothership the other day

1942
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:57,198
about the nfts that Mothership are going

1943
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:59,279
to drop at the event uh and what's

1944
01:16:57,198 --> 01:17:01,960
relevant about that is that every ticket

1945
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:04,679
is an nft so you'll have a wallet you'll

1946
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:07,198
be able to you know make the agreement

1947
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:09,960
and and get an nft and start that kind

1948
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:11,279
of part of your you know of your resume

1949
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:13,760
or whatever the [ __ ] you call it like

1950
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:14,960
have that in Your Arsenal uh but that's

1951
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,800
kind of where things are going and that

1952
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:20,520
nft will allow you to um you know go to

1953
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:22,440
any one of the mothership parties and be

1954
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,679
a judge for the hash competition and do

1955
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:26,839
these different things and like you know

1956
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,840
Sam and those

1957
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:40,599
directly to the consumer that you're

1958
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:41,960
trying to Market to that you have more

1959
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,960
information about that's part of a

1960
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:46,439
community and It ultimately makes it a

1961
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:48,079
lot more easier like mace is [ __ ]

1962
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:50,359
Jesus Christ on this stuff D when it

1963
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:52,399
comes to Discord and marketing but what

1964
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:54,158
it is is it's marketing to you know a

1965
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:56,079
younger crowd a more technically Savvy

1966
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:58,799
crowd that knows how to use these things

1967
01:17:56,079 --> 01:18:00,519
and wants to use them and and you know

1968
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,800
you if you don't adjust and have that in

1969
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,880
Your Arsenal but the point is this year

1970
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,279
we do have uh the nft component and some

1971
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:10,199
of the stuff mother ships bring in with

1972
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:12,519
jezy is just going to be ridiculous so

1973
01:18:10,198 --> 01:18:15,079
if people are into nfts uh and they're

1974
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:16,920
coming you know have your your your

1975
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:18,800
wallet and all your stuff ready have

1976
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,359
some some dough in there and those

1977
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,960
things like that but you know it's not

1978
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:23,399
going to limit people but it is kind of

1979
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,960
opening the door to that stuff which is

1980
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:28,039
also you know kind of [ __ ] cool I

1981
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:30,079
mean it's kind of like a whole different

1982
01:18:28,039 --> 01:18:32,519
approach um but it allows you know the

1983
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:33,880
judging it allows the ticketing uh it

1984
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,880
allows us to know who's going to be in

1985
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:38,239
the building before they get there and

1986
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:40,880
uh you know and like monitor everything

1987
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:42,959
but that kind of blows my mind that like

1988
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:45,119
this is now a part of it you know I a

1989
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,319
year ago I didn't know anything you know

1990
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:49,960
and now to see how we can integrate it

1991
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:51,519
and how it works and what it can do and

1992
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:53,639
it's kind of [ __ ] cool actually it's

1993
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,920
it's it's I mean I don't know how is

1994
01:18:53,639 --> 01:18:59,159
everybody's ticket a nft yeah everybody

1995
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:00,840
it is an nft so we're going to create a

1996
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:02,119
Kepler wallet we have all the Kepler

1997
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,719
wallets created we're going to send them

1998
01:19:02,119 --> 01:19:07,238
out to everybody airdrop their ticket to

1999
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:10,600
them and then there's also an app that

2000
01:19:07,238 --> 01:19:13,638
uh our partners at glass flow has built

2001
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:15,039
and so that app is where the judging

2002
01:19:13,639 --> 01:19:16,960
portal is going to be there's going to

2003
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:21,639
be event information your ticket is

2004
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:25,600
going to be represented there the nft um

2005
01:19:21,639 --> 01:19:27,760
oh and uh yeah

2006
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:31,520
just crypto

2007
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:34,320
curious so yeah no we're we're gonna be

2008
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:37,320
um it's about transparency right so the

2009
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:39,639
judging is fully transparent um it's

2010
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:42,759
going to be really cool so um and if it

2011
01:19:39,639 --> 01:19:45,319
sounds daunting or like some future [ __ ]

2012
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:47,280
or like whatever don't worry like we're

2013
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:50,920
setting everything upward so it's just

2014
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:53,158
very easy for everybody um and you're

2015
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:56,520
all going to get an email going to tell

2016
01:19:53,158 --> 01:19:59,519
you exactly how to you know access the

2017
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,280
app um we've built an app for this

2018
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,000
legitimately we've put it on a

2019
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:05,639
blockchain we've done all of this to

2020
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:10,079
have a level of transparency that you

2021
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:12,639
just don't get at events ever um so yeah

2022
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:14,559
we're really excited and we were able to

2023
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:16,520
do it because almost ready to talk there

2024
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,080
brother well we were able to do it

2025
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,560
because of you sponsors like that's the

2026
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,000
other thing we wouldn't be able to

2027
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,560
create that stuff and have that stuff

2028
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,399
and incorporate that team without having

2029
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:27,840
sponsors and like the big picture of

2030
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:29,719

2031
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,520

01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:22,560
right there yeah like an adult not be

2075
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:25,639
Legends of hashish branded coffee

2076
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:27,880
lattes yeah that pretty rad there's some

2077
01:22:25,639 --> 01:22:32,000
cool [ __ ] they can do with those now too

2078
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:34,039
so but yeah I need to take a dab so I

2079
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,479
just took a huge dab right now I don't

2080
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:40,800
know if you seen like really B it was

2081
01:22:37,479 --> 01:22:43,479
milky I'm uh I'm super stoked I'm gonna

2082
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,960
be in there mixing it up with all these

2083
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:48,158
guys smoking all the hash but also

2084
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:51,000
overseeing all the cameras so Addison uh

2085
01:22:48,158 --> 01:22:54,839
Kev and and Marcus who's an incredible

2086
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:57,439
photographer have uh brought in three

2087
01:22:54,840 --> 01:23:01,000
camera videographers to shoot the event

2088
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:04,000
so it's going to be really cool to be a

2089
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:06,359
part of documenting something that was

2090
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,960
not allowed to be documented for so so

2091
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:11,359
long so I'm super stoked about that I'm

2092
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:13,800
incredibly excited about all the flavors

2093
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:16,000
I know a lot of these makers are working

2094
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:18,480
really hard on on either securing or

2095
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,158
finding that that last minute perfect

2096
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:25,238
entry and I'm just incredibly stoked for

2097
01:23:21,158 --> 01:23:27,158
it and to be able to to to like see

2098
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:28,479
what happens once we put this out to the

2099
01:23:27,158 --> 01:23:29,879
public more because this has been so

2100
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:32,158
behind the scenes for so long it's

2101
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:34,639
almost been lore and now to kind of

2102
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:38,479
showcase it document it and put it out

2103
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:38,480
and just really excited to see what

2104
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:44,639
happens yeah dude I'm stoked on seeing

2105
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:47,800
some of that footage for sure we'll get

2106
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:49,960
that out here on Bubble man's world and

2107
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:52,840
uh it's going to be a pretty special

2108
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:55,319
event for sure it's been uh too long for

2109
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:57,319
myself

2110
01:23:55,319 --> 01:23:59,319
we think that you know if if we're going

2111
01:23:57,319 --> 01:24:01,719
to represent the culture we need to

2112
01:23:59,319 --> 01:24:03,920
represent the culture all the way and we

2113
01:24:01,719 --> 01:24:06,800
need to and the best way to do that is

2114
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:09,600
to get that footage out and put it in a

2115
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:12,320
way that's palatable and um catches

2116
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:15,920
people's attention and and lets them

2117
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:18,198
understand like the true Prestige of the

2118
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:20,440
legends of hashish and and what it is

2119
01:24:18,198 --> 01:24:22,439
and we want to build that fomo we want

2120
01:24:20,439 --> 01:24:26,039
everybody to be like holy [ __ ] I want to

2121
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:27,839
go to that party like I want I want I

2122
01:24:26,039 --> 01:24:29,800
want to provide things I want us to

2123
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,639
provide things for people that like when

2124
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,440
I was a kid and I was reading in High

2125
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:35,920
Times going [ __ ] I want to go to that

2126
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:38,559
like we could do that and I think that

2127
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:41,118
we're we're we're doing

2128
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:44,639
that oh

2129
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:47,158
yeah we're definitely uh definitely

2130
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:48,880
aiding and edding in the consumption of

2131
01:24:47,158 --> 01:24:51,039
quite a bit of [ __ ] hash that's

2132
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:53,118
pretty much what it comes down to that's

2133
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:55,319
a good uh that's a good foundation right

2134
01:24:53,118 --> 01:24:56,118
there no matter what as long as that's

2135
01:24:55,319 --> 01:25:00,118
the

2136
01:24:56,118 --> 01:25:03,319
foundation it can't collapse can't go

2137
01:25:00,118 --> 01:25:06,238
wrong people's desires are what makes

2138
01:25:03,319 --> 01:25:09,079
the world spin and the desire to smoke

2139
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:10,839
and enjoy hash is uh well look how

2140
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:12,760
[ __ ] far we've taken it like it's

2141
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:16,079
ridiculous we're [ __ ] measuring our

2142
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,880
bangers with thermometers and or you

2143
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:21,118
know all of our bangers are specifically

2144
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:24,079
made by slur yeah slurp and tpps and

2145
01:25:21,118 --> 01:25:25,639
[ __ ] Banger basketing and all this

2146
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:27,559
it's it's really quite incredible and I

2147
01:25:25,639 --> 01:25:31,159
get that it's not for everyone I get

2148
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:33,320
that we're a small group of people um

2149
01:25:31,158 --> 01:25:36,359
but it's kind of why I also look forward

2150
01:25:33,319 --> 01:25:37,559
to one day someone designing the perfect

2151
01:25:36,359 --> 01:25:40,960
micro

2152
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:43,880
dab unit because we need to turn people

2153
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:46,198
on to how great this is but not with

2154
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:49,600
monster dabs not even with a normal siiz

2155
01:25:46,198 --> 01:25:51,960
dab not even with a small dab K somebody

2156
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:54,480
Mar yeah of course

2157
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:56,760
dude yeah you gota you gotta be careful

2158
01:25:54,479 --> 01:25:58,718
it's it it it's what I'll be honest for

2159
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:00,880
a long time and it's it sort of speaks

2160
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:03,600
to to our culture of these you know

2161
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:07,039
heady boys as Addison put it you know

2162
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:10,560
the the the the roots of that were let's

2163
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:12,519
destroy him ha haa and I can take the

2164
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,960
biggest dab it really was like this

2165
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:17,119
really testosterone driven like I can

2166
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,760
take a bigger dab than you and I'm gonna

2167
01:26:17,118 --> 01:26:22,960
destroy you and I knocked countless

2168
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:25,159
people out I'll be honest show up I want

2169
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:28,480
to play Devil's Advocate to that

2170
01:26:25,158 --> 01:26:32,118
it was like for me I lose sight of

2171
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:34,678
reality and and what is a

2172
01:26:32,118 --> 01:26:37,399
non-consumers acceptable dose and I'm

2173
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:39,800
just a generous sharing person so like

2174
01:26:37,399 --> 01:26:42,479
we were in uh British Columbia together

2175
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:45,000
at an and an event and this really nice

2176
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:47,479
elderly lady was sitting with us me and

2177
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Marcus and we were just dabbing and this

2178
01:26:47,479 --> 01:26:50,279
elderly lady was so nice and she's

2179
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,039
asking all these questions and talking

2180
01:26:50,279 --> 01:26:53,960
she asked me she's like can I have a dab

2181
01:26:52,039 --> 01:26:57,198
and I was like Absol [ __ ] lutely you

2184
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:05,639
that half that Jame come on and so I go

2185
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:05,639
to

2186
01:27:06,198 --> 01:27:14,319
half Marcus looks over at me and he's

2187
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:16,279
like dude is that for her and I'm like

2188
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:19,359
yeah man she's she's a delightful lady

2189
01:27:16,279 --> 01:27:22,158
she's just looking at and she he's like

2190
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:24,920
no no and he like he went and served her

2191
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:27,399
up one of these micro dabs was like

2192
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:31,440
what's left on my dab when I'm done

2193
01:27:27,399 --> 01:27:33,719
dabbing L and and she was like she loved

2194
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:35,519
it she had such a great time she she

2195
01:27:33,719 --> 01:27:37,118
asked him for another one and I

2196
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:39,280
immediately realized I was like oh that

2197
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:41,319
would have played out completely

2198
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:45,279
differently if Marcus were not to have

2199
01:27:41,319 --> 01:27:48,039
intervened so all heroes don't

2200
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:50,039
wear I've seen it too many times I'll be

2201
01:27:48,039 --> 01:27:51,800
honest and I did it too many times I'll

2202
01:27:50,039 --> 01:27:53,560
be honest too like I just thought it was

2203
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:56,039
great too cuz when you get humbled and

2204
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:57,840
you're a hard smoker you want to go

2205
01:27:56,039 --> 01:27:59,719
share that with other hardcore smokers

2206
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,960
so you're out there looking to Humble

2207
01:27:59,719 --> 01:28:04,198
people this was also 20 years ago I

2208
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:06,399
haven't been you know doing this for

2209
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:09,719
more than 10 plus years I'm more

2210
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:11,879
interested in gently letting people come

2211
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:13,600
into what we find is special about

2212
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:15,079
cannabis and these extracts and bringing

2213
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,440
them in nice and gently and being like

2214
01:28:15,079 --> 01:28:19,118
listen this is a real this could really

2215
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:20,759
get you as high as you want what I'd

2216
01:28:19,118 --> 01:28:22,399
rather do is give you the tiniest little

2217
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:24,679
bit take away the fear give you the

2218
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:26,879
taste give you a bit of a buzz

2219
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:31,679
and if that's nice you can always take

2220
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:35,000
more but you can never untake any so if

2221
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:36,719
you take a big half Jameson dab H you

2222
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,560
can't untake it you're gonna be like

2223
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:41,800
uncomfortably high for probably at least

2224
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,320
an hour and I don't want to babysit

2225
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:45,119
people that and I also don't want to

2226
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:48,279
knock people unconscious anymore I hated

2227
01:28:45,118 --> 01:28:50,679
it watching people hit the ground flump

2228
01:28:48,279 --> 01:28:53,279
for everybody you

2229
01:28:50,679 --> 01:28:55,600
know not everybody who goes to the rodeo

2230
01:28:53,279 --> 01:28:58,359
wants to ride the F bull you know but I

2231
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:00,000
think it could be if you sedate the bull

2232
01:28:58,359 --> 01:29:01,399
and put them up there and go just take

2233
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,279
them for a short walk they'll be like

2234
01:29:01,399 --> 01:29:06,479
that was actually really nice pet him

2235
01:29:03,279 --> 01:29:08,399
pet look his balls like Co [ __ ]

2236
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:10,519
getting on there that's it man I'm

2237
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:12,599
telling you because um it doesn't have

2238
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,600
to be a rocket ship to the Moon it can

2239
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:18,239
literally be like a couple of Puffs off

2240
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:19,960
a joint but I also enjoy the pleasure of

2241
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:22,799
ninja dabbing the [ __ ] out of somebody

2242
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:24,840
with a giant dab that can handle it of

2243
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:27,239
course like jam

2244
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:29,800
like I I never see anyone ninja dab

2245
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:32,198
Jameson and he's a [ __ ] Sasquatch

2246
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:34,679
because there's no need to ninja he's

2247
01:29:32,198 --> 01:29:38,319
ninja dabbing

2248
01:29:34,679 --> 01:29:40,239
himself good point but no that's that's

2249
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:42,000
and I I I wish there was more Ninja

2250
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:44,599
dabbing you know that's what I hope

2251
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,158
Legends is like a a rebirth of ninja

2252
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:49,079
dabbing let's bring back ninja people

2253
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:51,118
are just like could totally [ __ ] I think

2254
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:54,079
there's a good reason for it I like

2255
01:29:51,118 --> 01:29:55,960
it giving your friend more than they for

2256
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:58,118
that's all you need to that's that's

2257
01:29:55,960 --> 01:30:01,279
different that's good I support that

2258
01:29:58,118 --> 01:30:02,920
giving regular people like just like R

2259
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:04,399
random people off the street like oh

2260
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:07,039
what is he you're doing over there young

2261
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:08,799
man that looks interesting that's

2262
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:10,880
requires a micro dab I want them to

2263
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,520
leave feeling super good and having a

2264
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:14,760
good experience and being like I'm gonna

2265
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:17,520
look into this dabbing thing that was

2266
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:18,960
quite Pleasant smells good yeah not to

2267
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:21,600
mention if you could get high off a

2268
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:23,719
micro daab can you imagine like that

2269
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,560

2270
01:30:23,719 --> 01:30:27,279

2271
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:29,920
like 42

2272
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:32,759
days yeah a month and [ __ ] three

2273
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:36,560
weeks I think we should get some special

2274
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:38,679
Ninja dabbers for Legends made like that

2275
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:40,840
are given out during the the the

2276
01:30:38,679 --> 01:30:43,800
shenanigans like you know those really

2277
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:45,199
long dabbers like I a couple sessions

2278
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:46,840
some guys show up with them where it's

2279
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:48,359

afar dude I I always go ahead I'm gonna

2282
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:56,920
make sure now that

2283
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,719
I pick a few volunteers that are just

2284
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:02,679
there to ninja dab people right that'll

2285
01:30:59,719 --> 01:31:04,480
be their job be in the crowd and just

2286
01:31:02,679 --> 01:31:06,920
[ __ ] oh you're taking a dab well

2287
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:09,039
here's another one and that'll be you

2288
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:11,000
know a thing and that's kind of in the

2289
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:14,560
it's almost like it's in the in the

2290
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:17,039
spirit of Sam because you know Sam was

2291
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,760
like pre-loading CBD and then [ __ ]

2292
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:21,238
going out and dabbing with everyone and

2293
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:23,480
like you know there's stories about Sam

2294
01:31:21,238 --> 01:31:25,198
about him and his like you know

2295
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:27,439
understanding of of like the endoc

2296
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:30,279
canabo system and saturating a system

2297
01:31:27,439 --> 01:31:32,399
with CBD and then going and [ __ ] like

2298
01:31:30,279 --> 01:31:35,198
dabbing all these people out and and

2299
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:37,759
actually being able to like use the CBD

2300
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:39,719
as a barrier for the the endoc canabo or

2301
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:42,000
the receptor so that he didn't get his

2302
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:43,600
loaded as everybody else and like you

2303
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,039
know this is in the spirit of that I

2304
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:49,039
think that's Sam would be proud of

2305
01:31:46,039 --> 01:31:51,158
us we got to mention that like a

2306
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:55,039
prankster kind of a thing is like the

2307
01:31:51,158 --> 01:31:56,118
the ninja dab like a jingle

2308
01:31:55,039 --> 01:31:58,359
yeah because you could be like I'm just

involved so we wanted to kind of

2389
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:35,360
throwback to that in a way and we do

2390
01:35:33,238 --> 01:35:37,599
have an outdoor area that will have the

2391
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:39,479
sponsorship booths with all the vendors

2392
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,400
out there and it's kind of a throwback

2393
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:43,279
to like that High Times experience that

2394
01:35:41,399 --> 01:35:46,279
you could have but then when you come

2395
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:48,679
inside um it has the sit down you know

2396
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:50,198
like the restaurant kind of feel um so

2397
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:51,520
we try to create that and sort of

2398
01:35:50,198 --> 01:35:53,919
incorporate that into it and then the

2399
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:56,760
whole entire design is all all Middle

2400
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:58,960
Eastern so like you know like [ __ ]

2401
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:01,280
pillows and and Carpets on the floor

2402
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:04,279
with pillows and sitting areas and you

2403
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:06,719
know easy comfortable [ __ ] for you know

2404
01:36:04,279 --> 01:36:09,719
for taking dabs and chilling

2405
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:11,920
so what we

2406
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:14,439
need yeah and then there's you know the

2407
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:16,079
sponsors come through too with a ton of

2408
01:36:14,439 --> 01:36:18,719

nutty yeah those would be crazy you know

2426
01:36:57,238 --> 01:37:03,079
so we have a lot of product we have

2427
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:05,519
about 25 or so other product sponsors I

2428
01:37:03,079 --> 01:37:07,479
wish we could have had like you know 40

2429
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:11,679
people that we this might have been a

2430
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:13,439
little much but um you know these guys

2431
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:15,520
has stepped up and some of them are

2432
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:19,399
making like custom Legends of Hashi

2433
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:23,239
stuff for us that's really awesome and

2434
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:26,399
really our gift bags our gift bags are

2435
01:37:23,238 --> 01:37:30,079
val valued probably at the same price if

2436
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:33,759
not more than like everybody's ticket

2437
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:35,960
cost like we're throwing so much value

2438
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:38,079
at people who are going to be there it's

2439
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:40,079
going to be stupid and and you know it's

2440
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:42,238
because of the product sponsors it's

2441
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:44,719
because of all of you here and every

2442
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:49,399
other sponsor that came in and did a

2443
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:51,359
120u 990u 73u or stepped up and and and

2444
01:37:49,399 --> 01:37:54,799
came like without all you guys like we

2445
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:58,559
really couldn't throw this kind value at

2446
01:37:54,800 --> 01:38:00,520
everybody um because I I we want it to

2447
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:02,159
be a great marketing platform and I

2448
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:04,599
think that this is a great way to do

2449
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:06,799
that and and I think we're uh

2450
01:38:04,599 --> 01:38:08,639
succeeding you know very well the other

2451
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,560
thing too you know what I always loved

2452
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:13,440
about Legends is that there was no

2453
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,719
trophy There's No Award you you had to

2454
01:38:13,439 --> 01:38:16,799
like you know you could tell your

2455
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:18,719
stories and say you won Legends but then

2456
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,199
Marcus and Sam had to kind of confirm

2457
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:22,319
that and it's and it's still in that

2458
01:38:20,198 --> 01:38:24,638
same place you know where you know

2459
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:26,479
there's there's we don't want to have

2460
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:28,239
like a a trophy that sits in a room

2461
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:30,399
somewhere that's like oh I won Legends

2462
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:32,559
you know second place

2463
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:35,158
2023 you know it just makes much more

2464
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:37,400
sense to to give the sponsors the

2465
01:38:35,158 --> 01:38:40,238
opportunity to put products in those

2466
01:38:37,399 --> 01:38:42,198
winners hands um that they can use every

2467
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:43,598
day that kind of make the experience

2468
01:38:42,198 --> 01:38:45,598
better that kind of brings the community

2469
01:38:43,599 --> 01:38:47,920
closer together uh and that was kind of

2470
01:38:45,599 --> 01:38:49,880
the idea so that's what what we did this

2471
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:52,520
year um mother ship's going to be making

2472
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:55,079
an award first second and third for each

2473
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:57,159
category for all three three categories

2474
01:38:55,079 --> 01:39:00,399
and I think there will be some uh some

2475
01:38:57,158 --> 01:39:02,000
dry sift that's being entered because we

2476
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:04,118
added that we added the dry sift

2477
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,840
category for Sam because we thought it

2478
01:39:04,118 --> 01:39:07,118
would be kind of a cool a cool throwback

2479
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:10,119
to that

2480
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:12,960
so yeah I'm excited trust me that's the

2481
01:39:10,118 --> 01:39:15,559
Holy Grail you know what 90% of people

2482
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:18,520
will enter rosin and a small percentage

2483
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:18,520
of oh I

2484
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:26,840
froze mark just went cold room I did

2485
01:39:25,079 --> 01:39:28,960
yeah I froze I stopped talking the

2486
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:30,480
minute I freeze but um you wouldn't know

2487
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:33,840
that anyway cuz I was

2488
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:36,118
Frozen um I don't know what I was

2489
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:39,599
saying you saying the dry sift is the

2490
01:39:36,118 --> 01:39:41,000
Holy Grail oh yeah yeah it's a listen

2491
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:43,520
anytime you're hanging out with Hardcore

2492
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,118
puffers they'll all have rosin a smaller

2493
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,679
percentage of them will have full melt

2494
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:50,039
bubble and almost almost none of them

2495
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:52,319
will have full mouth dry sift and it's

2496
01:39:50,039 --> 01:39:55,519
just how it goes so you know I'd love to

2497
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:57,920
see that category grow you know enter

2498
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:00,400
your rosin and do well and maybe even

2499
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:02,399
you know win a win a placing but then

2500
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:04,118
try to bring in full melt bubble next

2501
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:06,719
time and then try to bring in full melt

2502
01:40:04,118 --> 01:40:08,839
dry sift because to me that's like

2503
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:10,599
bringing in rosin is the easiest thing

2504
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:12,480
bringing in full melt bubble is the next

2505
01:40:10,599 --> 01:40:14,920
hardest thing bringing in full melt dry

2506
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:18,000
sift is like holy

2507
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:20,440
[ __ ] that's uh that's that's that's

2508
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,118
another reality completely uh there's

2509
01:40:20,439 --> 01:40:24,678
something to be said for it it's very

2510
01:40:22,118 --> 01:40:26,719
different than I mean the highest grade

2511
01:40:24,679 --> 01:40:28,599
full melt bubble is on par with the

2512
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:33,760
highest grade full melt dry sift they're

2513
01:40:28,599 --> 01:40:34,840
both uh spectacular oh yeah I mean

2514
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:37,480
there's a lot of people that have never

2515
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:41,079
tried dry sift I think they course you

2516
01:40:37,479 --> 01:40:43,839
know because dry sift is six-star that's

2517
01:40:41,079 --> 01:40:45,639
it you know that's hard very rare that's

2518
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:48,039
like yeah only the greatest this is the

2519
01:40:45,639 --> 01:40:50,480
thing only the greatest material will

2520
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:52,279
actually work and turn out the way you

2521
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:54,479
want it to work out so it's kind of like

2522
01:40:52,279 --> 01:40:57,000
there's this word of God going on

2523
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:59,118
whereas with like with oil products

2524
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,880
whether it's a BHO or rosin if you're

2525
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:03,039
making it into rosin I mean listen we

2526
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,118
all know what great rosin is we know

2527
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:07,000
what that is but there's a lot of people

2528
01:41:05,118 --> 01:41:09,559
who are deceived by what they think

2529
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,079
great rosin is by just making it look

2530
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:13,400
you know if it can if it can kind of

2531
01:41:11,079 --> 01:41:15,359
trick them with the way it looks uh

2532
01:41:13,399 --> 01:41:17,960
they'll be like oh this must be a great

2533
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:21,039
rosin it's uh it's not that easy you

2534
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:23,520
know to take to take and make great hash

2535
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:26,158
and then press it into rosin

2536
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:28,080
that's that's hardcore you know most

2537
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:30,079
people are pressing uh their hash into

2538
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:32,118
rosin because it doesn't melt and it

2539
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:34,639
can't be dabbed so they you know it's

2540
01:41:32,118 --> 01:41:37,799
kind of like a lot of rosin hash rosin

2541
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:39,599
is from mediocre hash uh not saying your

2542
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:41,960
guys's is but I'm just saying out in the

2543
01:41:39,599 --> 01:41:44,199
world there a lot of people are taking

2544
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:46,439
hash they're taking yeah they're taking

2545
01:41:44,198 --> 01:41:48,399
hash that can't be uh you know and then

2546
01:41:46,439 --> 01:41:50,039
there's the the there's the hardcore few

2547
01:41:48,399 --> 01:41:52,000
that are just like taking the most

2548
01:41:50,039 --> 01:41:54,599
ridiculous quality hash and pressing

2549
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:57,198
that which uh I'm on the sh I'm on the

2550
01:41:54,599 --> 01:41:59,920
fence with that I'm like well if it was

2551
01:41:57,198 --> 01:42:02,759
six-star bubble I don't know if I would

2552
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:05,520
press it it's going to dab just as nice

2553
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:07,520
it's already in form in heads like

2554
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,320
protected and there is something to be

2555
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,400
said for the laboratory where

2556
01:42:09,319 --> 01:42:13,238
everything's going down you know where

2557
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:15,319
all of the cannabinoids and volatile

2558
01:42:13,238 --> 01:42:17,519
organic compounds like filtering that

2559
01:42:15,319 --> 01:42:21,479
out is is different than not filtering

2560
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:24,800
it out I like uh I like the mop up trip

2561
01:42:21,479 --> 01:42:27,238
that uh hash offers and I do see oil as

2562
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:30,920
different myself I see rosin as a as a

2563
01:42:27,238 --> 01:42:32,919
hash oil but not a hash itself um just

2564
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:35,679
because it's the heads have been melted

2565
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:37,840
and it seems like it's it's oil now it's

2566
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:40,319
always going to melt whereas only the

2567
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:45,199
highest qualties hat of hashes dry

2568
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:49,679
sifted or whitewashed will

2569
01:42:45,198 --> 01:42:49,678
melt boom is that a melty Darth

2570
01:42:50,198 --> 01:42:55,118
Vader oh yeah he says on mute

2571
01:42:56,118 --> 01:43:00,279
JP's 27 dabs in he's thinking I'm

2572
01:42:59,079 --> 01:43:02,760
probably going to have to hit another

2573
01:43:00,279 --> 01:43:02,759
dab here

2574
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:08,840
soon I wasn't counting somebody counting

2575
01:43:06,279 --> 01:43:10,880
is somebody counting JP's dabs no I was

2576
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:12,119
just joking around but I suspect it's a

2577
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:14,840
lot are we all showing what we're

2578
01:43:12,118 --> 01:43:18,198
dabbing right now he's at like nine nine

2579
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:20,560
or 10 dabs so far I think is what I've

2580
01:43:18,198 --> 01:43:24,519
got

2581
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:28,000
damn be a high eight

2582
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:28,000
yeah the high

2583
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:35,238
AIDS start counting now we weren't

2584
01:43:32,679 --> 01:43:39,599
counting we'll start

2585
01:43:35,238 --> 01:43:42,279
counting little 9u pressed into

2586
01:43:39,599 --> 01:43:45,560
rosin I like that

2587
01:43:42,279 --> 01:43:47,960
too Canadian the legal Canadian Market

2588
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:49,080
makes it very hard to sell a 90 Micron

2589
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:54,480
into

2590
01:43:49,079 --> 01:43:56,599
Market um it's uh you have to COA every

2591
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:58,799
grade that you keep separate so it's

2592
01:43:56,599 --> 01:44:01,800
like adds $1,000 which shrinks your

2593
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:05,320
margin drastically especially test in in

2594
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:07,920
Canada in Canada yeah and then also test

2595
01:44:05,319 --> 01:44:10,118
every Micron separately you if you want

2596
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:12,719
to keep them separate so I've done it

2597
01:44:10,118 --> 01:44:14,920
it's like it can be like $8,000 just for

2598
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:17,198
the COA for that batch so you want you

2599
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:19,599
have to do big batches if you're also

2600
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:21,839
only releasing 90 Micron well that's

2601
01:44:19,599 --> 01:44:23,719
another like you know you're going to

2602
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,360
have to uh basic

2603
01:44:23,719 --> 01:44:27,800
what are you going to do with the other

2604
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:31,198
grades you know like if and if you put

2605
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:33,119
too many SKS on the market 90 120 like

2606
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:34,359
you might find the 90 sells really well

2607
01:44:33,118 --> 01:44:36,839
but the other ones are like oh these

2608
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:38,439
ones aren't selling quite as well oh

2609
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:41,679
yeah that looks

2610
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:44,479
nice so they make it hard here in Canada

2611
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:46,719
also the lot size I mean yeah the lot

2612
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:48,439
size and Ontario used to be the worst

2613
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:50,800
because if you sell if they ordered like

2614
01:44:48,439 --> 01:44:53,719
five kilos and then they sold it really

2615
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:55,800
fast and wanted another five kilos you

2616
01:44:53,719 --> 01:44:58,039
had to have it or you would be punished

2617
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,639
and put down lower on their ordering

2618
01:44:58,039 --> 01:45:03,238
order the next time they ordered product

2619
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:06,199
and so imagine like that's a whole

2620
01:45:03,238 --> 01:45:09,319
Province so and that's 10 kilos imagine

2621
01:45:06,198 --> 01:45:13,198
just making 10 kilos of just 90

2622
01:45:09,319 --> 01:45:15,000
Micron uh live hash rosin you know like

2623
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:18,439
if you're making just 10 kilos of that

2624
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:20,719
you have quite a bit of other material

2625
01:45:18,439 --> 01:45:23,559
that and it's also the because of the

2626
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:25,960
tax the higher price you put on it the

2627
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:28,119
the more ridiculous the tax will be on

2628
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:29,639
it so it ends up there's a few things

2629
01:45:28,118 --> 01:45:33,279
that work against us up here but we're

2630
01:45:29,639 --> 01:45:33,279
doing the best we can with what we've

2631
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:39,800
got how much diversion is in the

2632
01:45:36,439 --> 01:45:42,079
Canadian Market what's that how much

2633
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:44,639
diversion like in the black

2634
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:48,238
market well that all comes from stat

2635
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:51,039
statistics so it's like um they there's

2636
01:45:48,238 --> 01:45:53,319
this alcohol and tobacco board they get

2637
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:56,479
information from there's like they their

2638
01:45:53,319 --> 01:45:58,000
own uh questions you know with people

2639
01:45:56,479 --> 01:46:00,079
throughout the countries but it's all

2640
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,520
kind of like in my opinion the people

2641
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:04,559
who would know the real numbers they're

2642
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:07,239
not talking to so it's all really just

2643
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:09,159
[ __ ] the whole all of what they say

2644
01:46:07,238 --> 01:46:13,158
I mean the black market is for sure

2645
01:46:09,158 --> 01:46:14,679
alive and well um less so for flower my

2646
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:16,519
friends that were just growing and

2647
01:46:14,679 --> 01:46:18,800
making money they find it very hard to

2648
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:20,360
make money now because it's yeah may be

2649
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,800
expensive or whatnot but it's like if

2650
01:46:20,359 --> 01:46:24,960
you can go to the store and like pick

2651
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:26,639
out between like 30 30 or 40 flavors and

2652
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:29,039
then when you buy it have it be the

2653
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:31,480
flavor that you wanted it to be I mean

2654
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:33,479
sure there's shitty brands that sell M

2655
01:46:31,479 --> 01:46:35,118
dried pre-rolled joints or whatever that

2656
01:46:33,479 --> 01:46:37,759
are that are that are shitty but there's

2657
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:39,519
also you could navigate it if you needed

2658
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:41,400
to it wouldn't take you long Addison to

2659
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:43,880
find some decent product where you were

2660
01:46:41,399 --> 01:46:45,519
like yeah I found my dabs these pre-roll

2661
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:47,359
joints are actually pretty good this bag

2662
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:49,400
of weed is there there's products that

2663
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:52,039
are doing well they're the same people

2664
01:46:49,399 --> 01:46:55,000
from the Legacy industry that have moved

2665
01:46:52,039 --> 01:46:56,880
into the legal industry and it's just uh

2666
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:59,719
pushing these very large companies

2667
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:02,079
slowly out of market share because uh

2668
01:46:59,719 --> 01:47:04,480
their whole game was to suck and to

2669
01:47:02,079 --> 01:47:06,079
short the entire industry and if they

2670
01:47:04,479 --> 01:47:07,759
can suck long enough and short the

2671
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:09,880
entire industry long enough they just

2672
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:13,039
end up being the last guys standing and

2673
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:15,239
own a multi-billion dollar industry so I

2674
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:17,000
think that's what canopy and tillay and

2675
01:47:15,238 --> 01:47:19,118
you know some of these big companies are

2676
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,560
are potentially doing it's kind of

2677
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:24,399
unfortunate but yeah I was wondering how

2678
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:27,639
much if any gets diverted from the

2679
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:29,039
traditional Market into the black market

2680
01:47:27,639 --> 01:47:32,760
I think it happens for sure that's

2681
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:34,840
happening as well absolutely 100% I I

2682
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:37,000
don't think it's so much diversion I

2683
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:39,319
think that just the black market like

2684
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:42,319
competes at a much higher level like on

2685
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:44,920
the level of legal operators I mean

2686
01:47:42,319 --> 01:47:47,000
there's black market facilities that are

2687
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:48,760
operating you know on the same Block in

2688
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,039
the same building you know this that

2689
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:53,840
whatever the way some of these places

2690
01:47:51,039 --> 01:47:57,118
work down here in in the US us so I I'm

2691
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:59,639
not sure like that it's the the licensed

2692
01:47:57,118 --> 01:48:01,598
producers that are necessarily putting

2693
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:04,118
stuff out the back door I think it's

2694
01:48:01,599 --> 01:48:05,880
like the guy who's running next to

2695
01:48:04,118 --> 01:48:08,598
doesn't have a license doesn't give a

2696
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:11,359
[ __ ] and going there anyways so they

2697
01:48:08,599 --> 01:48:13,279
have billion grams over a billion grams

2698
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:15,719
just sitting in vaults like thousands

2699
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:18,759
and thousands and thousands of kgs

2700
01:48:15,719 --> 01:48:21,118
remember remember Indiana Jones remember

2701
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:23,639
that remember the end of Indiana Jones

2702
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:26,439
when they're pushing the CR through the

2703
01:48:23,639 --> 01:48:30,440
warehouse oh yeah yeah exactly that's

2704
01:48:26,439 --> 01:48:32,479
that's Canadian wreck Warehouse mids and

2705
01:48:30,439 --> 01:48:35,519
it is going out the back door we are

2706
01:48:32,479 --> 01:48:37,919
seeing in the market um I'm here it's

2707
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:40,280
happening um but to answer your question

2708
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,000
Adam Addison what's interesting about

2709
01:48:40,279 --> 01:48:44,920
like the dichotomy between Canada and

2710
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:48,439
the US markets is that in the US it's

2711
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:50,039
the the the term diversion and sort of

2712
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:52,238
that concept is much more clearly

2713
01:48:50,039 --> 01:48:53,560
defined and quantifiable whereas in

2714
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:55,759
Canada

2715
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:57,920
the market is still new you know we're

2716
01:48:55,760 --> 01:49:00,280
less than five years into this thing

2717
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:02,599
it's happening how everybody's doing it

2718
01:49:00,279 --> 01:49:06,479
is a little bit different but the mids

2719
01:49:02,599 --> 01:49:08,360
Market of the traditional Market uh it's

2720
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:10,839
specifically like uh Marcus said in

2721
01:49:08,359 --> 01:49:13,238
flower is just gone and that's not

2722
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:16,159
because all those consumers are now

2723
01:49:13,238 --> 01:49:18,479
going to recreational retail stores that

2724
01:49:16,158 --> 01:49:21,719
are licensed it's because these

2725
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:23,359
consumers are off-putting these Bates

2726
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:25,560
that they have to write off for whatever

2727
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:27,920
reason and destructing them the same way

2728
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:30,360
it happens in California but it's not as

2729
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:34,639
it's not as easily and openly discussed

2730
01:49:30,359 --> 01:49:38,719
as as it is in California

2731
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:41,079
yet well maybe Canadians are just more

2732
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:43,239
private yeah we're more polite about it

2733
01:49:41,079 --> 01:49:45,559
you know so it'll it'll it'll happen

2734
01:49:43,238 --> 01:49:48,039
more but you know guys like Marcus

2735
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:50,800
coming in and and really getting control

2736
01:49:48,039 --> 01:49:53,560
and and getting products out guys who

2737
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:56,279
came up under Marcus like you know slurm

2738
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:59,119
and and brindle and all these guys like

2739
01:49:56,279 --> 01:50:03,519
I mean not coming up under but um you

2740
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:04,920
know in following in his footsteps um

2741
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,639
you know these guys are coming to Market

2742
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:09,719
kind selections is coming to Market like

2743
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:12,679
real real people real smokers and that's

2744
01:50:09,719 --> 01:50:14,319
what we didn't have in Canada that was

2745
01:50:12,679 --> 01:50:15,920
always present in the US because when

2746
01:50:14,319 --> 01:50:18,198
the US legalized it wasn't Federal

2747
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:20,319
legalization so you always had to have a

2748
01:50:18,198 --> 01:50:22,359
little bit of an appetite for risk to be

2749
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:25,158
involved in cannabis whereas in Canada

2750
01:50:22,359 --> 01:50:28,079
it was like the lights are on there's no

2751
01:50:25,158 --> 01:50:32,439
risk come raise all the money and do all

2752
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:34,679
the things and so there there was no uh

2753
01:50:32,439 --> 01:50:37,359
the the individual a high Chad Factor

2754
01:50:34,679 --> 01:50:43,239
there's a high higher Chad Factor here

2755
01:50:37,359 --> 01:50:43,238
than than in the US yes absolutely no

2756
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:50,960
risk yeah that uh made a shiver go up my

2757
01:50:48,399 --> 01:50:53,638
spine I was like yeah that is pretty

2758
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:55,840
interesting how um

2759
01:50:53,639 --> 01:50:58,840
legalization you know went very

2760
01:50:55,840 --> 01:51:01,279
different um between US and Canada and

2761
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:04,000
and you know kind of lights on all at

2762
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:07,399
once and you know fundraising all at

2763
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,039
once right away um you know really did

2764
01:51:07,399 --> 01:51:12,000
make things different you really did

2765
01:51:09,039 --> 01:51:13,238
have a lot of um shitty operators go

2766
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,198
there you really did have a lot of

2767
01:51:13,238 --> 01:51:19,078
frauders go there you really did have a

2768
01:51:15,198 --> 01:51:21,238
lot of scumbags go there so um to raise

2769
01:51:19,078 --> 01:51:23,799
money just just to raise money because

2770
01:51:21,238 --> 01:51:26,799
the regulatory environment was different

2771
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:29,719
so um you know here in the US every

2772
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:32,239
state is different um you know and some

2773
01:51:29,719 --> 01:51:34,359
of these msos one of the things that

2774
01:51:32,238 --> 01:51:36,158
they are good at is you know they

2775
01:51:34,359 --> 01:51:38,719
they're able to take advantage of

2776
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:41,719
different regulatory patterns and things

2777
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:43,840
in individual markets and and play

2778
01:51:41,719 --> 01:51:46,158
things like that um you know play the

2779
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:48,199
tax in in Michigan against California

2780
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:51,399
against Oregon against Nevada this that

2781
01:51:48,198 --> 01:51:54,719
whatever and it's it's a strategy that

2782
01:51:51,399 --> 01:51:58,519
some of these brands rely on to survive

2783
01:51:54,719 --> 01:52:00,158
so um I do think that um you know the

2784
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:02,360
the regulat the difference in the

2785
01:52:00,158 --> 01:52:06,559
regulatory environment definitely

2786
01:52:02,359 --> 01:52:08,880
changes what the end user is able to get

2787
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:13,440
the the end user in the United States is

2788
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:15,560
able to access way more different um

2789
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:17,960
products and and and services and things

2790
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:19,639
like that than up in Canada because

2791
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:22,078
there's way more people operating

2792
01:52:19,639 --> 01:52:25,719
there's way more lure there's way more

2793
01:52:22,078 --> 01:52:28,319
guys making hash so um you know I think

2794
01:52:25,719 --> 01:52:30,000
I think that is definitely part of it

2795
01:52:28,319 --> 01:52:32,799
and I think that is definitely something

2796
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:35,679
that um the black market does a good job

2797
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:37,920
of people that bring stuff in from can I

2798
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:39,960
mean that's that's how a lot of people

2799
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:42,639
in the US survived for a long time was

2800
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:44,719
bringing [ __ ] in from Canada so now um

2801
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:47,078
there's a lot of high-end stuff that

2802
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:49,599
that comes from here and goes back up

2803
01:52:47,078 --> 01:52:52,198
there so you know I think the black

2804
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:53,840
market um kind of bridges the Gap I

2805
01:52:52,198 --> 01:52:56,078
think for the culture and I think that's

2806
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:57,880
why it's important to protect the black

2807
01:52:56,078 --> 01:53:00,319
market and respect the black market and

2808
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:03,520
remember that a lot of these people that

2809
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:07,078
um you know have been here for 15 years

2810
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:09,920
20 years 30 years Etc um had to do it a

2811
01:53:07,078 --> 01:53:11,519
lot differently and and again for us

2812
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:14,359
that's why an event like this was

2813
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:16,960
important to to give back to is because

2814
01:53:14,359 --> 01:53:20,158
a lot of these people have been here for

2815
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:22,560
20 years and you know it it it was just

2816
01:53:20,158 --> 01:53:25,960
a lot different back then um you know

2817
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:28,320
we're we've been making controls for 15

2818
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:31,679
years and and the way that people grew

2819
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:35,759
at scale 15 years ago versus at scale

2820
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:38,560
today is way different um and and you

2821
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:43,119
and just like the the risk people would

2822
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:45,719
assume back then and today so to respect

2823
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:47,719
um kind of the the older crowd and the

2824
01:53:45,719 --> 01:53:50,319
people that had to do it when there was

2825
01:53:47,719 --> 01:53:52,679
way more risk um is really important

2826
01:53:50,319 --> 01:53:57,118
because at the end of the day um our

2827
01:53:52,679 --> 01:53:59,239
culture is at risk every single day um

2828
01:53:57,118 --> 01:54:01,000
every single day there there's companies

2829
01:53:59,238 --> 01:54:03,399
coming in there's operators coming in

2830
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:05,279
there's people starting up that that

2831
01:54:03,399 --> 01:54:07,000
aren't about the culture don't respect

2832
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:09,399
about the don't respect the culture

2833
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:13,158
don't care about the culture so um you

2834
01:54:09,399 --> 01:54:15,960
know for us um that's that's a big thing

2835
01:54:13,158 --> 01:54:18,198
I love getting high I love using

2836
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:20,520
cannabis cannabis is really important to

2837
01:54:18,198 --> 01:54:22,719
me cannabis has done a lot for me we

2838
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:26,159
were able to have a business that Sur

2839
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:29,719
for coming on 16 years because guys are

2840
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:31,439
growing cannabis so um it's a big deal

2841
01:54:29,719 --> 01:54:33,599
and and it does matter to me that there

2842
01:54:31,439 --> 01:54:37,279
are people that operate in cannabis at

2843
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:39,400
any level that don't even get high uh

2844
01:54:37,279 --> 01:54:41,359
there it it it does kind of bother me

2845
01:54:39,399 --> 01:54:43,158
that there's people that operate stores

2846
01:54:41,359 --> 01:54:44,960
or brands or companies or this that

2847
01:54:43,158 --> 01:54:47,279
whatever that are comfortable making

2848
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:49,359
money off of cannabis but won't use

2849
01:54:47,279 --> 01:54:53,000
cannabis or or you know look down on

2850
01:54:49,359 --> 01:54:56,960
using cannabis so um culture is very

2851
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:59,560
much on the line the more that industry

2852
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:02,039
progresses the more [ __ ] we create the

2853
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:05,159
more things we monetize the more money

2854
01:55:02,039 --> 01:55:08,000
we wethink about trying to get out of it

2855
01:55:05,158 --> 01:55:10,799
the the more we we we lose like our

2856
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:13,800
culture whatever it is so um you know

2857
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:17,000
for us that's why participating and

2858
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:19,520
being able to to help Empower you guys

2859
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:21,439
to do it how you want to do it and and

2860
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:24,880
give back to the community that you guys

2861
01:55:21,439 --> 01:55:28,598
know best was really important to us so

2862
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:30,359
um you know we love getting high and

2863
01:55:28,599 --> 01:55:33,960
that's that's really important to us

2864
01:55:30,359 --> 01:55:36,880
that um that's able to still be a

2865
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:38,920
thing yep no and that's you know those

2866
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:41,319
those people that you were talking about

2867
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:43,520
the you know the Chads the [ __ ]

2868
01:55:41,319 --> 01:55:45,639
like they they can't sponsor Legends and

2869
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:48,040
they won't be at Legends and they they

2870
01:55:45,639 --> 01:55:50,560
literally can't be in the room just

2871
01:55:48,039 --> 01:55:52,439
based off the amount of culture and

2872
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:54,840
consumption and what's there and and

2873
01:55:52,439 --> 01:55:56,559
it's all you know that's why it's rad to

2874
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:58,360
have sponsors that are in line with that

2875
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:00,320
that are down and understand that that

2876
01:55:58,359 --> 01:56:02,158
is a big part of the culture you know

2877
01:56:00,319 --> 01:56:05,000
there are people that are you know Mega

2878
01:56:02,158 --> 01:56:08,439
do consumption people that just happen

2879
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:10,399
to fall into the the hash world and hey

2880
01:56:08,439 --> 01:56:13,559
if you want to talk you know you know

2881
01:56:10,399 --> 01:56:16,359
actual [ __ ] milligrams like BHO

2882
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:19,119
typically has more milligrams but I

2883
01:56:16,359 --> 01:56:21,359
think because solventless is is you know

2884
01:56:19,118 --> 01:56:23,399
a little less harsh on people you can

2885
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:26,000
consume a lot more it and get even more

2886
01:56:23,399 --> 01:56:28,198
milligrams but you know that's uh that's

2887
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,920
a whole other story but no it's it's

2888
01:56:28,198 --> 01:56:32,238
Legends is all about you know what

2889
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:34,440
Marcus and those guys you know created

2890
01:56:32,238 --> 01:56:36,319
and it's get getting all the best people

2891
01:56:34,439 --> 01:56:39,598
together and being able to like

2892
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:41,359
celebrate in this way and and now you

2893
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:43,239
know having it on a bigger scale but

2894
01:56:41,359 --> 01:56:45,719
still throwing back as much as possible

2895
01:56:43,238 --> 01:56:47,279
to the old school stuff is has kind of

2896
01:56:45,719 --> 01:56:48,480
been been it's been one of the bigger

2897
01:56:47,279 --> 01:56:51,719
challenges because you do have to

2898
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:53,879
monetize it you do have to figure it out

2899
01:56:51,719 --> 01:56:55,880
and and do it correctly and then make it

2900
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:57,319
so that at the same time while you're

2901
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:59,440
doing that and balancing that you have

2902
01:56:57,319 --> 01:57:01,719
to deal with the the politics and the

2903
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:04,158
culture itself and and you know how all

2904
01:57:01,719 --> 01:57:06,439
that stuff works so it's I don't know

2905
01:57:04,158 --> 01:57:08,439
it's it's it's been good because you

2906
01:57:06,439 --> 01:57:11,359
know at the same time you're so [ __ ]

2907
01:57:08,439 --> 01:57:13,519
busy with organizing this I mean last

2908
01:57:11,359 --> 01:57:15,238
year there was a 100 people so that's

2909
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:17,239
manageable right that's like oh okay you

2910
01:57:15,238 --> 01:57:20,559
know you can kind of Juggle that but

2911
01:57:17,238 --> 01:57:22,439
this year it's 250 people at Max and and

2912
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:24,400
you're just kind of expanding that list

2913
01:57:22,439 --> 01:57:26,759
and bringing in these other you know

2914
01:57:24,399 --> 01:57:28,719
figuring out the the proper you know

2915
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:31,480
list of of sponsors and everyone that's

2916
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:35,599
there so you know it's still a Juggle

2917
01:57:31,479 --> 01:57:40,559
but at the same time pounds of

2918
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:43,560
hash yeah apparently supposedly alleged

2919
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:47,679
allegedly allegedly

2920
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:49,520
allegedly allegedly but yeah I mean you

2921
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:50,679
know a private it's that's what's great

2922
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:53,320
about that too is that you still have

2923
01:57:50,679 --> 01:57:55,078
the right to have a private dinner and

2924
01:57:53,319 --> 01:57:56,920
the private get together in an event

2925
01:57:55,078 --> 01:57:59,639
where people come together all invite

2926
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:02,158
only um you know there's no open sale of

2927
01:57:59,639 --> 01:58:03,560
anything and it's it's it's nice to

2928
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:05,598
still have that right to be able to do

2929
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:07,679
that because that's kind of you know you

2930
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:09,639
can't do it in a restaurant because

2931
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:12,719
obviously um it would it would just

2932
01:58:09,639 --> 01:58:15,078
cause an issue but luckily you know

2933
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:17,039
there are guys that have some spaces and

2934
01:58:15,078 --> 01:58:19,719
that we work with that are capable of

2935
01:58:17,039 --> 01:58:23,479
putting it on and helping us do it so it

2936
01:58:19,719 --> 01:58:24,960
should be a [ __ ] Blast for sure man
