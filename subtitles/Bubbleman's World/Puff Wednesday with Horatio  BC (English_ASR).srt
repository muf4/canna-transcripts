about 19 years ago at least 1995 it was

36

20 years now 20 years you brought back a

37

seed it was in November of

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,159
1995 I heard they tape somewhere

39
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:07,000
too interesting

40
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,399

43
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,519

00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,800
where it came

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,600
from that sure would be the dream I'll

99
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,918
tell you you know a full circle like

100
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,560
that would be pretty

101
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:47,478
amazing I think it was talked about when

102
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,680
you po that that seed when he popped was

103
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:53,079
there five of

104
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,600
them eight eight one and one popped one

105
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,839
popped I remember putting the few in the

106
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,160
little planter to see if they might

107
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:02,038
actually

108
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:05,720
grow oh that's nice real

109
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:08,319
nice very subtle taste not sharp like

110
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,280
these new hybrids of today I I almost

111
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,959
got this

112
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,758
light background thing going on but as

113
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,879
as the hit dissipates you can taste it

114
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,000
deeper and deeper in your throat I feel

115
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:21,159
it in the back of my eyes and very

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,759
relaxing and and just like cerebral in a

117
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,800
sense there's definitely relief in

118
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:29,080
hitting it almost immediately yes in the

119
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,879
head like a loosening of the eard drums

120
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,800
I like say I'm feeling it right here

121
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,240
like for the first time like how you're

122
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,160
saying it just behind the eyes and stuff

123
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,038
very nice superb Johnny B give thanks

beautiful hopefully I have some in well

129

130
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,039
some hash with bubble hash I can finish

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,038
it off that's just a that epic first

132
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,959
bounce that I always talk about so first

133
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,680
bounce is always was very nice

134
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,359
Congo uh Congo let's leave the Congo for

135
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,759
second last because that is one of my

136
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,759
favorites like literally one of my

137
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,800
favorites and let's go with I mean your

138
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,759
medic Kush that go second last or third

139
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,280
last after the Congo this is this is

140
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,520
something that's very unique this is you

141
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,318
said last though right this is the

142
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,000
Haley's comment and this is that's last

143
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,598
for sure and that's all I got that's the

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,959
anti- THC just just a tiny bit be

145
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:32,399
completely straight once we hit that one

146
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:35,159
well this here is the is the number four

147
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,879
number two mix number four number two

148
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,199
mix and what about this one here well

149
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,038
this is actually the first bounce of the

150
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,639
of the med of the med okay this this was

151
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,399
just down on the

152
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:50,840
screen then I trimmed

153
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,839
up and I got more of what are you

154
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,960
feeling

155
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,719
nice so this would be number four number

156
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,560
two number four number two number four

157
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,199
number

158
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,519
two Romulan OG and Larry OG I was I was

159
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,720
told it was a Larry OG crossed with a

160
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:15,639
ramlin so I had said LR Kush kind of

161
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,840
made sense mhm that's it kind of made

162
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,400
sense that's the name of it yeah so all

163
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,318
right well I'm excited this looks very

164
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,439
buttery very tasty but this is actually

165
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:29,000
a lot of a lot of seeds that were popped

166
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,759
to find these oxy FAL that I liked I've

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,279
number a few few but I know some of them

168
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,639
didn't come back that nice some of them

169
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,918
were hard didn't didn't uh grow that

170
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,519
well but uh these particular ones

171
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,839
were were the tasty

172
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,918
ones I think it's gone up to a few

173
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,918
people's Gardens now

174
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,000
so that was lovely it's one of my

175
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,000
favorites real nice I really enjoy that

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,959
one yeah it's it's it's uh smooth as

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,120
butter too

178
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:07,638
my goodness Flor I mean I can't believe

179
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,639
it 34 pretty decent size RI 34 day

180
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:12,719
flush yeah I'm not sure that the flush

181
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,038
has much to do with the smoothness of a

182
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,360
resin compared to the smoothness of an

183
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:20,478
herb I think that there's something

184
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,759
going on in the Cure of the of the plant

185
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,120
matter and you know sometimes it's even

186
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,800
just maybe the luck of the draw of the

187
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,360
Tarpin that are present and that you get

188
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,639
a profile of Tarpin that even at a young

189
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,680
age are peeling and smooth and then you

190
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,080
get a variety of strains that require

191
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:40,158
more of a cure so the harsher more

192
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,399
volatile sharper tpin that hurt the

193
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:46,480
throat are able to dissipate evaporate

194
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,559
whatever and then eventually unveil the

195
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,320
the subtes or cesin or monotes the ones

196
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,799
below that are kind of waiting to

197
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:00,360
shine but can't until those other things

198
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:03,759
have been cured out very nice nice so

199
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,759
that was first the Jamaican beautiful

200
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:10,360
beautiful resin really nice color on

201
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:14,200
that a lamb's bread hybrid and then we

202
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:19,240
hit the number two number four so the

203
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,360
number four was um uh an old world py uh

204
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,000
sand strain is what I'm told hit with

205
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,320
the Larry

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,159
OG so these are Pani land R cross with

207
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,040
the lemon OG or yeah was the L OG

208
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,600
yeah whatever it's an OG and it was you

209
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,039
know one of those of those strains we

210
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,079
don't need to get so particular it was

211
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,559
can of everybody always asked and I

212
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,958
always called number two number four and

213
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,278
these were just particular beans that is

214
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,518
this the one we just didit yes all right

215
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:50,278
well lovely one are we just doing the

216
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,720
whole

217
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,879
on well yeah I think it's h it's

218
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,959
important I sat here just recently with

219
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,078
d420 K and we slammed back 11 rips of

220
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,518
his full melt dry sift I think we should

221
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:05,078
be able to hammer back six of yours oh

222
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,480
well that's we might even get into maybe

223
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:08,958
some of his yeah we've got four of his

224
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,360
right here so if we feel we want to do

225
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,879
the 10 uh the 10 rip Gauntlet we can go

226
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,800
ahead but who knows you know you've got

227
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,159
some Congo there and I got to say Congo

228
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,439
is a game changer when it comes to

229
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:21,120
gauntlets we're we going to do the Congo

230

lovely

263
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,879
yeah that's real nice you could Rock

264
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:06,879
yourself if you took a real big fat dab

265
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,519
of that one I just did and as you can

266
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,519
see I'm coughing trying not to I'm

267
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,198
easing off now thro's getting better

268
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,360
yeah I took just a mediumsized rip and

269
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:18,240
it was actually quite smooth got me a

270
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,079
little bit of a head ringer where I'm

271
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,879
kind of right

272
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:27,719
yeah it's nice isn't it mhm three big

273
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:31,159
rips three nice rips can't go wrong with

274
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,160
that right there

275
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,959
and I'll have to of course photograph

276
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,198
each one so we can get in on that macro

277
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:40,439
level and see the subtle differences of

278
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,439
each

279
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,839
one because there are differences now

280
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,720
we're getting into

281
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,560
Congo yeah oh that's

282
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,240
exciting Congo is just good for a head

283
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,399
rip to hit medy Kush and then just back

284
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,120
it up with a Congo rip is insane it's

285
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,120
going to pretty much

286
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,360
o that was nice and smooth once you

287
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,399
warmed it up a little bit yeah I found

288
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,399
that one I I went to clean my tool off

289
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:12,919
it heated up and I stuck in my resin

290
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,240
don't do

291
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:16,240
that yeah

292
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,839

off bump off bump it wasn't off bump I

306
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,039
was looking at that it was like falling

307
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,039
apart there we kind of white guy out

308
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:03,120

real you want to finish

317
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:53,959
it real nice taste on that Congo it's

318
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,600
unreal exotic lemony with some other

319
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:59,919
just different spicy flavors in there

320
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,480
that I are hard to explain I'd love to

321
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,838
see the tarine profile on it so I could

322
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:10,000
understand it

323
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,000
better that's a strong resin too oh it's

324
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:16,919
um trimming it up was

325
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:20,759
so just reeks it just rre even bumping

326
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:23,240
into it in the room crazy makes it reek

327
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,600
even when it was on my deck and we would

328
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,318
walk by and just tap it it was wreaking

329
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,440
no it's it's definitely got a very very

330
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:33,399
very unique smell and everybody that

331
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,680
smells it in the

332
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:39,480
jars right away they're like oh my God

333
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,278
what's that yeah like right away it's

334
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,839
and then the sift like I didn't do that

335
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,759
yet cuz I just had a couple buds but the

336
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,399
sift this

337
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,159
morning Wicked Strong man oh man I mean

338
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,000
we did just hit three other full melt

339
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:55,360
rips but that one that one makes me

340
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,159
really want to like relax and just

341
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,440
really

342
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:02,639
enjoy how

343
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,279
how medicated I

344
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,560
am not that I have a lot of pain or

345
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,600
anything a little bit that I did have

346
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:13,159
from traveling the last few

347
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,959
days disappeared with the

348
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:18,000
Congo such a nice uh

349
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,239
profile we even going to leave the lid

350
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,759
off of

351
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,399
that I can't wait to photograph each one

352
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,079
and sort of see in a close you know

353
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,480
version of what the resin looks like got

354
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,958
my macro lens right here guys so I'll be

355
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,000
uh yes we'll be

356
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:37,399
going from one I will from

357
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
1 to

358
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,799
21 to

359
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,600
31 to

360
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:48,919
41 and finally

361
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,278
51 now that gets in there that's when

362
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:53,240
you really are getting close that's when

363
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:55,519
you're getting so close it's insane

364
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,159
yeah the phones are great with their

365
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,839
cameras but they just can't quite

366
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,439
replicate the level of that m

367
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,959
when I was seeing when he had the shots

368
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,078
and he actually had images in the back

369
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,000
and stuff like that it's quite quite

370
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:09,959
cool that you can actually yeah that's

371
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,480
that's just a flavor that I know how to

372
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,480
describe it

373
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Beau

374
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:27,159
cush yeah very

375
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,440
cushy supremely cush so we can go this

376
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,600
is this is like all there there just

377
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,600
that the rest is um definitely going to

378
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,480
be uh be making

379
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,519
medicine W so we better uh photograph

380
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,798
this before we rip it yeah I think so

381
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:45,000
cuz that's all there is is this the last

382
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:47,359
one yeah that's all there was very very

383
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,279
minimal of the haly from from I mean of

384
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,719
the flavors have we hit that one

385
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,720
yet we not this no not this one then I

386
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,640
guess we better hit that one and then

387
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,798
we'll do this one but I'll photograph it

388
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,280
first because you guys want to see this

389
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:04,519
I'm sure I know I do I'm curious too

390
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,279
really am I was really disappointed I

391
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,759
only got this amount off it but I really

392
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:09,440
didn't want to I just let it hit the

393
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,319
screen I didn't want to agitate it or

394
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,440
anything because I don't want to Rob

395
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:14,558
anything from it so I mean except all

396
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,080
the

397
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,839
resin what's some all the resin it's

398
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:21,480
like the medy there was so much it was

399
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,759
so coated like when it hit the screen it

400
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,440
was like poof oh yeah it was really and

401
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:30,759
it's it

402
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,759
it yeah it's marshmallow

403
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,279
well shall we medy down Med it down

404
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,320
shall we you

405
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:44,319
shall heat her up cool it

406
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:46,480
down get we should have a rag

407
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,558
sometimes yeah I just kind of do this

408
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,360
thing here where I roll off the resin

409
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:56,119
pretty clean then put it on the uh I

410
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:59,399
have to say that the the new mother ship

411
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:01,279
is uh quite uh quite a nice quite nice

412
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,038
head I like it a

413
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:07,720
lot yeah the Fab egg sure is

414
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,240
beautiful it did a great job on

415
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,279
them amazing that that's a production

416
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,400
piece like that blows my mind

417
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,079
okay you

418
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,600
know all right dabbers cooled down

419
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:24,599
fingers are

420
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,599
clean I'm going in Johnny

421
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:33,639
B I have to say that this was uh

422
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,080
I I just this is one I always say this

423
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,919
is one I always say is my M it's one I

424
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:39,359
like the most

425
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,120
mhm have you had mad sessions on the

426
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:44,240
Congo yet though no I only did one

427
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,479
exactly I did one just wait and I'm

428
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,359
telling you look at it I

429
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,839
know I can't wait and and really in

430
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,158
reality I I'm still like it's all and I

431
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:57,639
mean I'm sure what everyone's waiting

432
00:19:54,159 --> 00:20:00,679
for is the medic Congo the medic Congo

433
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,360
coming soon from fellow seats the medic

434
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,519
cono no medic cono why not people would

435
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,839
love it dude think of those two strains

436
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:13,000
together oh would be insane come on both

437
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:13,000
ways female male male

438
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:25,840
female yeah it would be probably pretty

439
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,720
insane out of everything you gave me I

440
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,639
was pretty much the most stoked on medic

441
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,640
Kush

442
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:37,240
It produced I made real nice uh bubble

443
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,759
from it it makes really nice I I love

444
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,319
the flavor I love it effects strong I

445
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,960
mean it's it's it's strong it's really

446
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,119
nice

447
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,640
flavor it's a nice nice tasting strain

448
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,959
I'm going come on now and uh the Congo

449
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,120
is just I don't know maybe because it

450
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,960
was the Forbidden for so long but really

451
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:00,599
I think there's something to it it is it

452
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,600
is an unbelievably

453
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:06,000
it's one of the most well it's by far

454
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:08,879
the most uh like the strongest tasting

455
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,159
rip that we've had today the flavor on

456
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,240
that is very very strong sharp strong

457
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,919
this just like uh it's interesting that

458
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,359
it's over at this end compared to the

459
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,520
Jamaican which was very subtle you know

460
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,639
the

461
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:25,079
flavors and I wonder if that's because

462
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,919
it was grown here and it's used to a sun

463
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:29,119
grown you know I wonder if the profile

464
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,880
if we if we're able to to bring it back

465
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,798
to

466
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,840
Jamaica if that profile will increase

467
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:37,759
through the Tropical Sun and and give us

468
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,798
flavors that we were missing out here

469
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,759
that would be an interesting

470
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:45,599
experiment I have to go under the LED

471
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,759
next mhm yeah absolutely it sure has it

472
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,240
sure has the strength I'll tell you and

473
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,519
and uh that would be interesting because

474
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,038
that's one thing I did see

475
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,759
actually now just thinking about it when

476
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,599
I I looked at what what I should would

477
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,558
call is like there's money Zone on

478
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01,918
there's this Zone there's three

479
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:04,399
different zones and with the Jamaican It

480
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,559
produced the resin all the way down very

481
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,720
similar the bud structure was very

482
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,038
decreased when we got down to the bottom

483
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,480
and with the LEDs it was just a bigger

484
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,319
bud structure at the bottom than there

485
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,159
was compared that was the only real

486
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:20,439
comparison MH but the resin production

487
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:23,278
with with well I I am enjoying it nice

488
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,159
dude yeah I'm sure glad I have one or

489
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:26,759
two I guess I have two LEDs right now

490
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:30,159
that I've got

491
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:33,720
going I'm blooming on under uh x2x L

492
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:37,400

away that was nice

499
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,320
e yeah only did half of it that's okay

500
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,759
you took a big one not a big one is

501
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:02,960
still a pretty big

502
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:04,960
one I was a little excited in the

503
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,759
beginning hit them hard coughing a

504
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,640
little bit have to slow down excellent

505
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,119
you know well it were really nice

506
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,278
flavors man stoked that you have such a

507
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:17,119
nice stash that you're rolling with and

508
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:19,640
you're harvesting plants as always and

509
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:24,439
bouncing and making water hash too I'm

510
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:27,480
sure yeah I actually um have to get on

511
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,080
that me too working on the room first I

512
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,120
really need to get on that

513
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:32,599
I know I need to basically run a 20

514
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,278
gallon

515
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:38,519
batch that's what I need to

516
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:40,679
do yeah you doing a 20-gon batch yeah I

517
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,759
think I'll do a 20-gallon batch and just

518
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,278
uh you know stop doing all these

519
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,759
independent plants that I have all

520
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:48,599
separated in in in bags I think I'm just

521
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,919
going to like put all of them into one

522
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:54,558
20-gon batch and I'll do like bubble

523
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:57,000
man's you know Lucky Day profile it's

524
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,960
like one of my full harvests just P put

525
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,200
into bubble hash that's called laziness

526
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,798
catching up with you right there when

527
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,519
you get too busy and you don't have the

528
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,359
time to put into the water hash that you

529
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:10,079
spent all this time segregating all your

530
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:13,038
plants into different containers yeah I

531
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,918
have that right now yeah me too yeah I

532
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,679
know I'm ready to just like do a

533
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:18,720
20-gallon batch though that's a pretty

534
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,960
good idea or two or three or two or

535
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,600
three yeah well you know what that was

536
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,880
one thing about Amsterdam with the types

537
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:27,278
of hashes in that so so there there's

538
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,039
people REM mixing a lot of different

539
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,240
that's one thing that was uh

540
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:35,359
sure to make big batches just do it a

541
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,159
mix tastes good it does look how baked

542
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,798
we are isn't this great well actually

543
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,880
quite enjoying it you know it's been a

544
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:43,200
while just sitting here getting I feel

545
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,360
like I was just here a week ago with

546
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,440
d420 K doing this very same thing I

547
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,599
think you are actually I like it yeah

548
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,240
it's kind of relaxed it's nice this

549
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,918
could be an intro for all I know you

550
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,440
know you never know with John and I this

551
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:58,120
right here could be puff Wednesday and

552
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,159
it could be the and that would be fine

553
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:02,479
you know we went through six different

554
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,120
varieties of full melt dry sifts we

555
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,960
still have a d420 K's dry sift and one

556
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,439
of mine that I cleaned here well it's

557
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,480
yours there you can see the difference

558
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,000
between a a long cure and a fresher cure

559
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,919
you see the difference in the colors how

560
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,319
this has a reddish brown to it this is

561
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,799
more blonde

562
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:23,519
today yep definitely have to get picture

563
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,679
of that for sure yeah could have picture

564
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,440
all of these yeah no that was you can

565
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,000
subtle differences just how you said the

566
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,399
three subtle differences is where that

567
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,759
one's probably a couple weeks old that's

568
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:35,079
really here this is fresh and the colors

569
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:37,640
are just like pretty white though

570
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:42,240
surprisingly

571
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:44,799

uh inspired into learning

583
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:18,910
the the trade of sift

584
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,910
[Music]

585
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:25,639
cleaning all

586
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,640
right guess I better hit that too

587
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
huh

588
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,880
wow

589
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:56,158
that's well I'm becoming speechless

590
00:26:53,240 --> 00:27:00,880
because my throat's just like ah and I'm

591
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:03,278
definitely um well you could just

592
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,200
say I've

593
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:11,558
smoked this lucifa blocks got to F it

594
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,558
goad got you got to take a photo of it

595
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,880
first the real test PTO right

596
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,200
here I'll get a quick shot of it or or a

597
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:27,159
few quick shots of it really curious

598
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,558
like this is something you know what

599
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,320
what's

600
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:34,678
what's the difference is I don't see a

601
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:37,359
difference in Glad if it's if it's THC

602
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:40,720
or CBD or you know if there's any

603
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:44,678
difference in anything at all I don't

604
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,679
know if it's how clean it is or anything

605
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,278
so just get a couple of

606
00:27:52,679 --> 00:28:01,798
shots so the theory is behind CBD blocks

607
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,559
the fork effects of TC so if this being

608
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:07,440
high CBD and htio says he just does a

609
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,918
heavy hit of something that's high CBD

610
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,038
could bring you

611
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,799
down I'm curious because this is

612
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:18,440
actually just

613
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:21,440
a I don't know yeah we were noticing it

614
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,600
with Matt's CBD Renee yeah see curious

615
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,360
we smoked it for 10 days in Amsterdam

616
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:30,119
this

617
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:30,119
year and uh it was definitely

618
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,159
still pretty

619
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,679
contaminated not as clean as the Congo

620
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,080
or that Jamaican or any of those other

621
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:47,440
ones yeah I think yeah I think I only

622
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,839
looked at the Jamaican and the

623
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,840
Congo but I'll make sure I go over them

624
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,839
and get some nice fresh

625
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:59,919
pictures

626
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,720
well I definitely have the ringing of

627
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,720
the ears and

628
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,840
everything the ringing of the

629
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,399
ears well that's a few shots to give you

630
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:16,879
guys an idea of what the quality is

631
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:19,278
there I definitely say it's of a lower

632
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,919
quality compared to what else he's got

633
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,640
here but you want to start it off with a

634
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:23,640
rip there Johnny

635
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:29,519
B A little Ripper a little

636
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,278
Ripper

637
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,159
kind of sacrilegious after hanging out

638
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,880
with skunkman Sam and Rob Clark in

639
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:38,440
Amsterdam this past last year at the

640
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:42,519
Canabis cup and they're just

641
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,000
uh definitely not down with uh puffing

642
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,319
on

643
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,319
CBD go

644
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,558
figure but all for science

645
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,038
right

646
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,839
I want had a sharp sharp feeling in the

647
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:17,678
throat probably because of the little

648
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:19,278
bit of plant matter in there yeah the

649
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,759
other ones it's amazing how as you clean

650
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:25,038
it how creamy and smooth it com 100% see

651
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,079
the difference in

652
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:30,158
that you have to that but there's very

653
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,918
got a fruity

654
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,080
taste I find katonic has a fruity taste

655
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:35,080
as

656
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:44,278
well mhm so what was that one two three

657
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:47,398
four five six seven seven rips eh should

658
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:49,880
probably try D's uh OG Kush well we

659
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:52,439
probably add that one let's go right to

660
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:56,919
the bud bud

661
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:59,919
batch Bud batch that's always the nice

662
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
batch

663
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,599
how'd you feel on that stuff

664
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:06,199
there I don't think it took away my high

665
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:08,038
too much no I don't think it took away

666
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,120
my heart too much kind of went like this

667
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:12,278
I feel pretty I felt like I was

668
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:14,158
surprised by the flavor of it yeah after

669
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:16,720
I blew out the sharpness I felt like it

670
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,240
was very very flavorful on my lips much

671
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,319
like CBD Renee I don't know you know

672
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,319
what I'm like this

673
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:28,038
ABD I don't mind it

674
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:30,199
actually yeah I mean I just feel feel

675
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:32,000
like I'm still baked on all these other

676
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,960
ribs

677
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,278
yes I feel slightly baked uh from

678
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,399
theight that we've tried so this is just

679
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:42,880
a test so what do we got here we got uh

680
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:45,558
this is D we have a warning on on on

681

license in which case puff away yeah

684
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,840
make some dry sift grow some well grow

685
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:03,398
some herb make some dry

686
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:03,398
sift I did this one at uh 55%

687
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:10,398
humidity and uh 55 degrees actually 58

688
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,038
61 always fluctuated in there kept my

689
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,918
temperatures down very low for a couple

690
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:17,638

00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:49,798
bowl and I'm not sure if at the end of

717

726
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:11,199
Puff Wednesdays looks like Horatio

727
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,560
what's up in the house Johnny be's out

728
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,480
Horatio's in just like that um we had a

729
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:18,279
great time Johnny B and I he had some

730
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,240
incredible sifts that we went through I

731
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,919
think about six or seven different rips

732
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,239
oh you guys got to that point yeah we

733
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,199
did we did a good amount and then uh I

734
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,878
thought it was the end of puff

735
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,439
Wednesdays I ended up hearing from

736
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,239
Horatio that he was was on his way into

737
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,878
the City and for him what an hour and a

738
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,759
half to get to the city well it's pretty

739
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:38,358
much if I don't come now I've got a pack

740
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,159
up and Portage to come again tomorrow

741
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:43,239
right so yeah little nice yeah it's not

742
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,039
that late right now so we're going to

743
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:46,479
tune in what we're doing here with

744
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,559
Horatio which we're going to end up

745
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,918
tasting some of his dry sift and your I

746
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:54,799
guess your tur mouth in a sense yeah I

747
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:56,239
mean I'm looking at it from uh it could

748
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,160
we're looking at whether or not this is

749
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:01,799
the new seven star star can't be

750
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:04,639
six-star is the bar that is the de's

751
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,280
ultimate melt so is a sevenstar the

752
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:10,000
reintroduction of the lost tpin to in

753
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,839
the drying process added back to the dry

754
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,519
sift basically the impossible right

755
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,279
creating a new product because it's no

756
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,519
longer dry like tur melt pretty much

757
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,640
that's what Tony was calling it in

758
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:21,159
Amsterdam when he mostly he was doing it

759
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,838
with water hash adding the tpin to the

760
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,559
hash and doing the iron trick and

761
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:27,199
getting it into this opaque shatter

762
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:30,119
likee substance uh but we did do it a

763
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:32,679
few times with the sweet skunk dry sift

764
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,640
and that was a whole we were calling it

765
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:38,480
TP

766
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:41,879
sift TP sift so yeah there's I superp SI

767
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,599
Shiva serum Shiva there's some nectar

768
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,838
but I think I do like seven star

769
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:48,640
whatever seven star is nice yeah just

770
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:50,480
because it's pretty much a denotation

771
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:53,480
it's like live resin or anything else

772
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,358
but this in the case of dry sift it's

773
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,119
very specific cuz you can get six-star

774
00:35:55,358 --> 00:36:00,358
melt in bubble sure um any day the weak

775
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:02,400
but dry sift you better have your own

776
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,559
TPS and they better come from the bud

777
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,760
you derived for true enough especially

778
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:07,400
we're not down with that clear where

779
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,800
you're taking Turpin out of other things

780
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,838
I mean maybe one day they'll find out

781
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,599
it's cool but to me it sets my Spider

782
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:15,318
Sense off I like I want to use just the

783
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:17,039
plant I'm not it's not even that it's

784
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:19,000
the fact oh you think you're playing God

785
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,199
now well that's what I'm saying I you

786
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,400
understand this is a strain from a

787
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,159
concoction blend mhm we don't even we'll

788
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,800
get to the science of it maybe in 50

789
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,960
years and then there'll just be another

790
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,880
machine we go again the profile changed

791
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,838
from just us adding a small pretty much

792
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,480
it's like it's going to always be the

793
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,119
Kool-Aid of strains and it's always and

794
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,079
unfortunately we don't know what the

795
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:46,358
effects of Kool-Aid are when we came for

796
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,318
medicine so that mixup is it's a

797
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:51,119
different type of science that's not

798
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:52,920
really science at all I should also add

799
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,880
that um You probably noticed that

800
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,960
Horatio and I both have a unit in front

801
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,480
of us he's got the uh denil 2.0 with the

802
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:05,039
mothership fabri egg and the puking B uh

803
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:08,760
20 mm quartz bowl and whip uh I over

804
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:13,559
here have the straight Fab with a 14 to

805
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:17,680
14 male adapter that goes into a female

806
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:20,759
quartz bowl from Germany with a 16mm

807
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:22,759
whip that goes down into um a brand new

808
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:26,040
unit I just got today from Germany

809
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,640
called the dabinator so dabinator was

810
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:31,079
kind enough to send this custom box uh

811
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,719
it's got my logo burnt into the top of

812
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,480
it and on the side uh it says dabinator

813
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:38,399
not sure if you guys can read that but I

814
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,400
can show that in a picture later really

815
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,838
nice looking unit uh pretty solid uh

816
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,480
right away both Horatio and I were

817
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,239
pretty much assuming that it would be a

818
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,240
pretty efficient unit being from Germany

819
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:51,639
the components wouldn't be Chinese came

820
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:54,039
out set set at 710 right off the bat

821
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:55,960
it's got one more degree to go but

822
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:59,159
that's it pretty nice little unit so

823
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,720
we've got the Dil 2 .0 my standard

824
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:03,199
obviously I love my denail uh but we've

825
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:05,639
got the dabinator out as well so we're

826
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:08,399
going to both uh interchange and do a

827
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:11,039
few rips of Horatio's tur melt and then

828
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,760
I have a variety of uh sifts here of

829
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,519
course I want to give Horatio a rip of

830
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,680
Johnny be's first bounce of my

831
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:21,519
20-year-old Jamaican lamb spread hybrid

832
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:22,799
creamy really different like one thing

833
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:24,639
guaranteed when you hit it you'll just

834
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,519
be like that's different it's not

835
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:27,960
overwhelming it's not sharp I'm

836
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:29,960
wondering if the tur

837
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,000
that I remember are lost from The

838
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,039
Tropical Sun not being that factor that

839
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,039
factor that production Factor you can

840
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,358
almost smell certain things and know

841
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,239
there's a note that wasn't played

842
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,598
sometimes yeah that's what I'm saying

843
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:46,159
it's like a but yet when you hit it it's

844
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:49,440
really strong and different well I I got

845
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:51,199
to try the bud on a herb hit and it was

846
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,000
definitely I was like what kind of high

847
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:57,679
is this I'm like not couch locked I'm

848
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,639
not pumped I'm like kind of mellow I'm

849
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:03,199
like how can mellow be strong I was like

850
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:06,759
oh I'm being like mellowed man what the

851
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:09,039
heck right so strong so that's I noticed

852
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,599
you have your carb cap do we need I

853
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,199

just in your mouth like you can have

890
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,639

891
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,119
worried about the dry rip oh no that's

892

nice ready for this well I'm kind of

895
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,239
looking forward to hitting this

896
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,199
sure hits different than the Fab bag

897
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:09,838
I'll tell you that

898
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:13,159
much the straight Fab and the Fab I

899
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,159
guess I'll go for a little Jamaican

900
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,920
too first rip out of the dabinator

901
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:56,440
it's soft but it's kind of call it

902
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:57,838
creamy yeah it's a cuz when I tried it

903
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,000
on the herbal head I was I was like wow

904
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,519
that is

905
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,519
pretty creamy with this I'm like wo

906
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:08,759
that's smooth but I know my chest is

907
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:13,559
full so it's kind of I like how I feel

908
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:15,800
the effects uh in my head fairly strong

909
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:17,639
I'm feeling it it's it's a different

910
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,160
type of that's what I meant by what a

911
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:22,719
strong low mellow I'm not getting beat

912
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,558
up up top but I'm feeling John mentioned

913
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,318
it before too behind the eyes and I have

914
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,240
to admit when I think about him saying

915
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:31,400
that right away feel it as well like

916
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,199
it's I would put money on this strain

917
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,160
being effective in

918
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,519
glaucoma just the way it seems to

919
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:39,759
relieve tension in the forehead in the

920
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:43,599
eyes not that I had a lot of tension

921
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,280
going I'm feeling for it now cuz yeah it

922
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,838
was here and heading

923
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,519
outwards

924
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:52,960
I'm and I'm it's definite it's here so

925
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,239
it's definitely it came from my head

926
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,599
slow and after because I was feeling in

927
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,358
my chest but now I see what you're

928
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:00,960
saying yeah about the eyes it's a pretty

929
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,598
interesting uh little little thing like

930
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,199
I said it's by far not the the strongest

931
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,760
I mean John had the congales here

932
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:09,879
earlier which was just I mean that

933
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,839
strain is a special strain for Taste and

934
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,200
potency as well even this New York City

935
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:16,679
Diesel is probably at the table right

936
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:19,159
now one of the strongest yeah no I mean

937
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:20,838
that's I think that's the strongest I SM

938
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:22,358
out of Dar rank it's rank for sure you

939
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:25,159
know when Daren showed up I was like

940
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:26,799
okay that even for the Citrus cuz I'm

941
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:29,239
not a big fan of citrus I'm like okay

942
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,200
that I see why I see why you breed that

943
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:34,479
I see why you grow that sure I see why

944
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:36,558
you wanted to look at the uh let's take

945
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,559
a peek I close them up and I never know

946
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:42,440
how they which one is this transition

947
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,440
that's the God's green crack God's green

948
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,480
crack looks good looks good what's that

949
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,760
smell like I can't ever smell at my home

950
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,760
it's a crowded turpy

951
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:59,039
disaster it's hard to tell

952
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:06,358
cushy cuz I wondered about that and then

953
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,358
that's the death Bubba the death

954
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Bubba the death Bubba and what happened

955
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:14,960
here that is what seven star looks like

956
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,800
that's the Seven Star well that's what

957
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:21,240
I'm about to find out so what did it

958
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:28,079
turn into over time kind of looks like

959
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:32,479
a buttery kind of creamy it it does

960
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,480
oh it's tped out that's mad

961

tppy all right so we got some Gods Green

962
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,720
Crack is that right that's that I just

963
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:43,358
because I it froze it and I never I

964
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,959
never opened it that is well got the

965
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:47,598
macro lens out too so we'll be able to

966
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,519
shoot both um your powder bubble and

967
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,400
your turp sift or you would the thing is

968
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:55,000
you would you you might mistake it for

969
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,119
some of that live resin if you didn't

970
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,838
know that the you can see the

971
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,519
contaminant that tells you it's not

972
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:05,960
B yeah let's do

973

00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,199
go so close what I think that we should

976
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:17,039
be careful of is this you see how it's

977

979
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,960
island that was the only thing that was

980
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,239
left that was untouched Keef when I

981
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,639
closed it interesting I had a t i was so

982
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:29,199
it just gran

983
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:30,480
well I literally tried to do I tried to

984
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:32,519
do a half and half I thought I could do

985
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,199
a half moon and then it just traveled

986
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:35,880
I'd like to get a photograph of some of

987
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:37,919
this and I'd also like to get a

988
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,079
photograph of some of this and some of

989
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,838
this so maybe come in from the back here

990
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,200
yeah like just just the portion that the

991
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:45,719
middle the top middle yeah cuz when I

992
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,719
added it there was this section and I'm

993
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:49,480
like oh I didn't get the halfway mark

994
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:51,078
it's growing it's growing right oh I'm

995
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,119
going to use this you've also have that

996
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:54,880
ability if you want if you want to go

997
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,318
like with a much thinner well this seems

998
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,119
to be the kind of this is more daber

999
00:45:57,318 --> 00:46:02,400
friendly than the uh than the Scoops all

1000
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:05,200
right I'll hold it you pull yours all

1001
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,800

like you did the same thing I did you

1006
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,440
took that first part and was like oh

1007
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,880
that's too small I'll just double up I

1008
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,720
suspect these are going to be huge

1009
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,280
[ __ ]

1010
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:32,199

00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:37,919
right here Seven Star TP sift

1013
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,400
[ __ ] I keep smelling it before I go in

1014
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:46,838
oh it reeks on the

1015
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,838
Dabber in reaks but a

1016
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:58,838
petitte

1017
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:19,279
there's a lot going on there's a lot

1018
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:20,920
going on there's a lot going on right

1019
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,680
off the

1020
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,240
bat what changing it's oh it's changing

1021
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:27,759
it's like oh it's changing big time it's

1022
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,799
gone into the back my throat and it's

1023
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,319
twisted into the full flavor of the herb

1024
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,880
but even when it went in it was like

1025
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:38,400
hash but with these like hints of of

1026
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,800
cannabis

1027
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,639
Vapor it which now has completely

1028
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,640
satiated my

1029
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:52,039
throat I wish I could taste it on my

1030
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:52,039
lips stronger wrong kind of

1031
00:47:54,119 --> 00:48:01,760
bong what do you think of that

1032
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:03,680
I mean Chang my High completely cuz I

1033
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,559
mean that's the thing I wondered about

1034
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:09,039
the full tpine profile I'm like okay now

1035
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:10,880
this is supposed to be a downer high

1036
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:13,000
this is this is death Bubba I know this

1037
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,358
guy but then I didn't find a downer at

1038
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,880
all but I'm not this isn't a down

1039
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,880
zingery and zesty like TP TP rips that

1040
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,318
I've had in the past it's that was cuz

1041
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,079
that was my first question I'm like I

1042
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:26,039
don't know what the the effect is like

1043
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,160
because the strains didn't match it was

1044
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:29,838
always um it was always a cocktail blend

1045
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,759
so I'm like yeah but you're putting

1046
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:35,078
those turps on this High I what is the

1047
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,599
what if I just stuck to the same plant

1048
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,079
how many phases keep in mind most of the

1049
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:39,960
turps are available in most of the

1050
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,760
plants they're just different ratios

1051
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:45,000
well that's that's all these strains are

1052
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,520
is ratios and clearly ratios are I mean

1053
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,960
I suspect if we got in that hnmr the

1054
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:52,239
actual you know the testing that's super

1055
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,358
accurate it's it would get us into a

1056
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,078
point where we realize that the ones

1057
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:58,318
that seem like there's none of this

1058
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:01,240
particular tur it's just a it's just the

1059
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:04,159
smallest most infal amount absolutely

1060
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:06,919
it's a it's a code and just knowing that

1061
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:09,960
THC vs take so little to do so much you

1062
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,838
know every other I mean I'm still

1063
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,838
getting I'm still getting a bit dude I'm

1064
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:16,039
trying to getting modulated I'm getting

1065
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:18,239
I really liked the initial exhale of it

1066
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:22,519
like it was

1067
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:25,479
just so tasty it's really it's I don't

1068
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:28,719
know is Seven Star Cup only is it Hy

1069
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,719
only is it

1070
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,358
good God it's too far this is live resin

1071
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:59,239
sift it is resen

1072
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:07,480
sift wow major taste in there like

1073
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,480
vegetables and roots

1074
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:11,078
and so many

1075
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:17,558
different so many different flavors

1076
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:17,559
that's why I'm it's I'm

1077
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,719
grabbed me that time good you too we

1078
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:32,960
both had a little cough it's starting to

1079
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,719
spread didn't you find that that that

1080
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,079
hit was a real nice I'm still almost

1081
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:41,558
about to

1082
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:41,559
cut your water's right there sir oh

1083
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:49,838
cheers well what a great puff Wednesday

1084
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:53,159
um pretty stoked on the Heat and the

1085
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:55,920
whip of the dabinator I'm not a huge fan

1086
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:57,558
of the 16 mil Bowl I know that he said

1087
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,599
he was going to try and get me a 20 mil

1088
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:01,319
Bowl which and a whip which will be much

1089
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,318
better for me and then I'll also get a

1090
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:06,318
drop down for this so that uh you know

1091
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:07,798
that it can be down here a little more I

1092
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:09,599
think this is a little bit too high for

1093
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:11,639
me right now it's a bit tall I need to

1094
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,318
get a drop down for this as well even

1095
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:15,440
though this quartz doesn't get warm it

1096
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:17,159
doesn't warm the joint and this is the

1097
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,119
same it's I found since I switched to

1098
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:22,558
the drop down it's just being here

1099
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:26,079
versus playing this game exactly it's

1100
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,319
just a this one you know look at this

1101
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,960
and then I can't can't see so it's a

1102
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:32,039
very small surface that's where I

1103
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,199
started with adapters to get dabbing

1104
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:36,719
really nice uh whip I like the the lack

1105
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:39,919
of the curl in the Whip and uh the box

1106
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:42,358
is really beautiful and uh stoked on the

1107
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,358
quartz Banger so I I much appreciate Max

1108
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:47,358
for sending that out and uh you guys can

1109
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:49,119
check out dabinator uh Google dabinator

1110
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:54,400
cuz I'm not even sure if it's dabinator

1111
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:57,400
NL or dode or do or.org but it's

1112
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,798
dabinator it's the electric nail and uh

1113
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,079
well that was just real Pleasant right

1114
00:51:58,798 --> 00:52:03,318
there dude we'll have to get a couple of

1115
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,920
photos of that I just want to start

1116
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:08,199
enrolling it into my program just to

1117
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,440
playing around well it's not it's it's

1118
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:11,318
not even the playing around it's like

1119
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,119
okay is that your strange on is that

1120
00:52:11,318 --> 00:52:15,558
your um is that your medicine is that

1121
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,880
your medic cush well what about your

1122
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:21,319
medic cush now is it still your strain

1123
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:24,000
right does it do did it take you further

1124
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:25,880
um what's the difference because this is

1125
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,358
I'm I'm mainly just trying to discover

1126
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,160
it was the message Mage deeper than I

1127
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:31,759
first interpreted because of my

1128
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:34,318
limitations so as soon as I kind of got

1129
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,720
a sense of how much turps are lost

1130
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:40,000
because that means the loud pack how

1131
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:42,000
loud is it right well these are CES

1132
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,559
turpenoid that talked about earlier the

1133
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,760
super super volatiles and what uh Indra

1134
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:50,119
John Davis called them years ago to me

1135
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,119
he called them super terpenoids he said

1136
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:53,519
he was one of the only one of only

1137
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:56,039
people in the world capturing them

1138
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,400
through his cryogenic process absolutely

1139
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:59,880
and so I have no real way of

1140
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,639
understanding that without building a

1141
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,200
lab and getting into this game but it

1142
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:05,920
seems as though in the near future

1143
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:07,239
Jamaica will happen and uh potentially

1144
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,079
I'll be able to go there and build

1145
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:12,078
myself a really state-of-the-art hash

1146
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:14,480
lab uh have people like Horatio come and

1147
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,599
join us and help out with the uh the

1148
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,679
science and the the future of the

1149
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:20,680
project doing all these I guess really

1150
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:21,639
just standardizing the medicine well I

1151
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:24,199
mean

1152
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:27,920
somehow even I managed to become

1153
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:29,439
involved where I'm like how how is it

1154
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,480
those of us who are interested in

1155
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,480
standardizing the medicine somehow find

1156
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,639
themselves by their own interest

1157
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,920
becoming those people I'm like how did I

1158
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:39,679
get to be a considered for Jamaica I'm

1159
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,119
like well I'm just pushing I'm just

1160
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:44,199
pushing just when you why do Growers

1161
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:45,920
grow what gets them in that room every

1162
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:48,199
day well if if they're the only people

1163
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,000
that can experience these tpin they're

1164
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:52,239
living them because they're so volatile

1165
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,960
they're essentially taking huffing dabs

1166
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:58,199
in that room right it um it must be

1167
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,400
something very very at the core of our

1168
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:02,000
human nature why we're attracted to it

1169
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,639
and why it sticks in our brain so that's

1170
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,559
where I want to focus my research and

1171
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,639
here I am now um where normally the

1172
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:12,920
table this is normally where you see it

1173
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:14,838
on YouTube and then one day the sstar

1174
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:18,358
concept is something I'm I'm

1175
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:20,000
participating in so um worlds Chang

1176
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:22,039
perspectives change and um it's

1177
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,119
beautiful I I feel real lucky in all of

1178
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:25,960
this in the sense that I mean I still

1179
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:29,240
have ideas and whatnot and I still want

1180
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:32,119
to try Pioneer and help and Inspire but

1181
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:33,479
I'm really stoked on the Inspiration

1182
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:35,440
Point right now where it's like I've

1183
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:38,280
been showing these techniques in regards

1184
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,119
to water hash and dry sifting and it's

1185
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,440
starting to get to the point where so

1186
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:45,119
many people are picking it up and it's

1187
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,400
growing exponentially that it's

1188
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,960
really I was talking about it earlier

1189
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,039
how I don't really feel the need to go

1190
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,679
and like enter contests and try and and

1191
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,920
it's a different

1192
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:58,000
statement position in life cuz I looked

1193
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,798
at I'm like well when I picked up sip

1194
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,639
it's because I wanted control of data

1195
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,639
more than anything I'm like I need

1196
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:07,598
control because if I have a theory that

1197
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:10,118
there's an actual isolative split

1198
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,160
between the dry Berry Theory the right

1199
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:14,400
Berry Theory and the rotten Berry Theory

1200
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:16,558
the overripe heads yeah the only way to

1201
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,920
prove that I isolate it I photograph it

1202
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,119
I'm like there it is there's the ice

1203
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,200
ball there's the undeveloped there's the

1204
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:24,119
overdevelop it's no longer a theory it's

1205
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:25,439
real yeah exactly and that's how I

1206
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,480
learned everything with my macro

1207
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,039
photography really it was an incredible

1208
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:32,079
increase in my education not from

1209
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:33,839
Reading any books or Googling anything

1210
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,519
or reading scientific papers it was

1211
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:38,480
literally like I'd photograph something

1212
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:40,400
and then be like oh that's interesting

1213
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,599
like what I wonder what that is and then

1214
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:46,720
I'd start you know well I'm big on

1215
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:48,960
having multi- tangential knowledge so I

1216
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:50,679
can't you can't just sit and oh I'm a

1217
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,960
solving artist I know what I know and

1218
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:54,798
because at a certain point someone who

1219
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:57,199
knows both looks at your whole 20-minute

1220
00:55:54,798 --> 00:56:00,119
argument and goes this guy has no clue

1221
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:01,919
dry cfin Auto butter the same way it's

1222
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:03,318
tpin it has nothing to do with this they

1223
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,200
don't know if they don't do it I guess

1224
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:07,679
right that's kind of why the first time

1225
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:09,199
you had described I the minute you said

1226
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,879
we put the Barb in the freezer before

1227
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:14,480
the competition I'm like why I thought

1228
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:17,358
it was dry the only reason I could think

1229
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,240
of is those tpin are eating their way

1230
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:20,480
out that's the only reason those guys

1231
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:22,838
would put in the freezer and then it

1232
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,880
turned out to be so over time like okay

1233
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:26,558
the Barb is unique it's alcol we don't

1234
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,200
even know if it's those Tans like for me

1235
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,960
it's the weirdest resin I've ever worked

1236
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:32,000
with John had some resin today that was

1237
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:35,639
a little bit similar I was going to say

1238
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,400
this the reason is if anything we say

1239
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:43,440
tpin we think oils but that's not the

1240
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:46,559
case right and um alcohol is polar all

1241
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,480
right where lemoning is non-polar those

1242
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,920
are completely two different extractions

1243
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,519
and ability to extract toally and I

1244
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:56,280
found that so when I hear anytime you

1245
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:57,719
guys describe these arbl likee strains I

1246
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,640
Google them and I start looking up

1247
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:02,078
analytical results and I alcohol soluble

1248
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:04,400
th I look for the I go all right let's I

1249
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,760
literally when you said that I Googled

1250
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,480
um test of the shishkaberry and I went

1251
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,839
down I'm like okay out of these seven

1252
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,119
tests from all these random Labs linol

1253
00:57:10,838 --> 00:57:15,119
LOL linol all right now let's take that

1254
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,599
back information back to the bar now

1255
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,720
let's head out to its other parent and

1256
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:22,200
look up that okay this thing is

1257
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:24,358
practically all alcohol there's no

1258
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:26,719
non-polar and that's why it'll behave

1259
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:28,400
differently in water compared to the

1260
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:30,199
ones that actually can reject water

1261
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,880
still makes really nice water hash well

1262
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:35,279
no that's the thing about it is it's

1263
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,200
Rene style what's the qu now I asked you

1264
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,760
this question what's its storage life

1265
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:42,558
versus its I look at that and I'm like

1266
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,880
that's the ripest juiciest Berry if I

1267
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,200
leave it on the counter it's going to go

1268
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,079
bad by tomorrow because it's so volatile

1269
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:50,159
yeah I mean it it doesn't go bad by

1270
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:52,440
tomorrow but and even when I say it does

1271
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:54,279
it go bad it just changes its shape I've

1272
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,440
never seen it funk out and like grow

1273
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,640
mold no no no that's not kind of what

1274
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,760
I'm kind of asking how many times can

1275
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:03,920
the tpine profile change that kind of

1276
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,319
speaks to how volatile how if compared

1277
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,639
to well me that smells like two weeks

1278
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,239
ago when I smelted it off D4 20K with a

1279
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,519
little bit of I guess when it's fresh

1280
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:15,519
it's so loud when it's fresh that it can

1281
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:18,000
definitely change to a degree over the

1282
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:19,599
course of the first month to two months

1283
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,280
Matt would be a better person to ask

1284
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:24,200
because he's had it in his life for like

1285
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,640
a decade plus always the bud the hash

1286
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:27,639
it's always around because I only

1287
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:31,000
experienced it fresh I'm always like

1288
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:33,118
what this is this is insane but I've

1289
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,880
never basically it's never kept long

1290
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,680
enough that I'm like oh I see it's not

1291
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,960
like when I first met it which um tpine

1292
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:42,679
R um buttery things typically they give

1293
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,280
up and they lose um they give off so

1294
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:46,480
much that they change so that's kind of

1295
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,960
why I had so many questions about the

1296
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,400
Barb that yeah you're right only Matt

1297
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,679
would know what 6month old Barb is like

1298
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:57,318
what Frozen six-month old Barb is like

1299
00:58:53,679 --> 00:59:00,159
but it's definitely alcohol based in my

1300
00:58:57,318 --> 00:59:01,798
opinion and in look up linol look up the

1301
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:04,960
other turps you'll find in its parents

1302
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:08,639
and want to H this one yeah I totally

1303
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:11,079
see why um more of a six-star is pretty

1304
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:13,960
much a phenomenon of alcohol Turpin in

1305
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:16,079
my opinion yeah oh yeah it is so I think

1306
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,358
like if I anything if I wanted to figure

1307
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:20,079
out full melt genetics I might if there

1308
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:22,000
was only an app that we could search for

1309
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:24,640
testing of C show me some show me all

1310
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,239
the strains high in linol low in lemon

1311
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:28,358
show me all the strains high in Mercy

1312
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:30,798
once we get all these tests man it's

1313
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:32,279
going to be so that's different U feel

1314
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:34,480
free to hit anything I have here there's

1315
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,880
the diesel there's d420 K's OG there's

1316
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,599
some dry siip that I clean there's

1317
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,920
John's Jamaican that's uh which dry siip

1318
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:41,640
that you clean that's not a straight uh

1319
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,599
this is right here it was some it was

1320
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:46,159
like a hash plant that a friend from uh

1321

see the you see the color difference

1323
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,519
hold it next to any of these well I

1324
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,559
remember when I first saw I was like

1325
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:58,759
what is you

1326
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,760

01:02:27,278 --> 01:02:30,639
just the first time you heard about the

1381
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:33,559
Seven Star you can start talking about

1382
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:36,719
it on social media now this is some TP

1383
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:38,839
sift this is some sevenstar it was very

1384
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:41,959
interesting it looks like a live resin

1385
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:44,440
sitting on the table right now zero PPM

1386
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:46,278
for sure zero ppms you could uh get into

1387
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,639
some good arguments with that stuff and

1388
01:02:46,278 --> 01:02:49,239
I bet you you could get into some

1389
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,440
cognitively dissonant people who would

1390
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:53,479
claim they could a smell the butane

1391
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,400
coming out of it absolutely I'm pretty

1392
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,400
sure I smelled the butane in there Total

1393
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:01,039
Tan run

1394
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:02,400
dude I don't I don't actually sift dry

1395
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,559
sift I don't

1396
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,039
actually oh my god well maybe we should

1397
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:08,839
finish it off with one more hit of that

1398
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:10,599
live resin yeah cuz you haven't tried in

1399
01:03:08,838 --> 01:03:12,719
that way and I this does hit differently

1400
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:15,000
and it is a different uh resistor with

1401
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,838
your uh with your your Dabber you'll be

1402
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,400
able to fit it in much easier absolutely

1403
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:19,599
this is the this is the way to well this

1404
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:24,480
isn't going to have a problem melting

1405
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:27,760
off the Dabber at all no exactly all

1406
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,760
right very good

1407

Leafly and it says Pine so what's the

1437
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:17,000
tpine modulation of carrot cuz we don't

1438
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:20,798
have a carrot strain and we find out it

1439
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:24,000
came from Bubba so it's likey carrot

1440
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:25,798
every earthy every strain again in a

1441
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,480
whole basically it's like two sides of

1442
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:31,000
coin the dry and the wet um two

1443
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:34,400
different Med medicinal efficacies from

1444
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,719
the same plant so I'm sure interested

1445
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,119
I'm loving the way things are moving

1446
01:05:35,719 --> 01:05:39,838
forward at an accelerated rate we don't

1447
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:42,119
even know what we're doing we get

1448
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:43,880
together we sit we talk we get inspired

1449
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:46,039
someone says something in hash church we

1450
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:48,838
go away we do new things we come up with

1451
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:50,839
new things we get back together this is

1452
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:54,119
exciting man it's great to see uh

1453
01:05:50,838 --> 01:05:56,239
another uh new product hit the uh it

1454
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:58,440
just seems like it's a pathway that

1455
01:05:56,239 --> 01:06:01,199
well it's nice to see a true product cuz

1456
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,760
like we've seen there are there are many

1457
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:05,159
weird things going on in bait pens

1458
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,839
basically in the world of inhalation

1459
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:09,038
there's just as many new products that

1460
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:13,038
are negative as there are new products

1461
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:15,000
that are positive um so uh I sure love

1462
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:18,319
the electric nails and the quartz I

1463
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,039
really love the quartz although um maybe

1464
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:24,679
the next session we do will go back to

1465
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:26,839
hitting uh the sick carbine which is the

1466
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:28,519
Silicon carbine yeah they've got me one

1467
01:06:26,838 --> 01:06:31,358
on order right now that they told me

1468
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:33,798
about that has a ledge that a sapphire

1469
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:36,920
dish sits in double up for mil shots

1470
01:06:33,798 --> 01:06:41,000
yeah a sapphire ledge hitting it off the

1471
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:42,559
SIC so who's to know when it'll ever end

1472
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,838
I love the fact that we're not only

1473
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:47,960
trying to uh produce a you know what we

1474
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:51,119
call what I call the Holy Grail which is

1475
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:53,240
the ultimate Foundation as anyone in the

1476
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,880
extraction game or the resin isolation

1477
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:56,679
or decontamination or if you're trying

1478
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:00,119
to create new products like turp mouth

1479
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:02,719
or TP sift seven star um you're going to

1480
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:04,440
want to have a foundation of knowing a

1481
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:07,879
what the resin is when it's been cleaned

1482
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:11,599
to 99% and from there you can go and

1483
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:14,880
only then we even know oh you know this

1484
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,760
wasn't the melts right off the bat there

1485
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,358
would everything would be confusing

1486
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:22,559
there would be I don't even

1487
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:24,880
it's all I can say is I'm thankful I

1488
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,039
started and I got out the gate well so

1489
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,960
that I didn't really go through um the

1490
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:33,240
rough stages because um having the

1491
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,159
opportunity to produce high quality Sith

1492
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:36,759
and

1493
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:39,440
then have that as a foundation turn and

1494
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:41,480
go could there be more versus chasing

1495
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,639
the main goal I'm like could there be

1496
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:46,358
more could I'm smelling this I smell I

1497
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:49,199
have the wet butt I'm smelling the dry

1498
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:51,278
sip I'm smelling my lho I'm smelling I'm

1499
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:54,759
smelling the raw turps

1500
01:07:51,278 --> 01:07:57,440
mhm do you want to sniff the raw turps

1501
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:59,680
in fact you gave me turps before I left

1502
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,039
and I haven't even opened those oh those

1503
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:04,318
were pecs yeah cuz yeah I've got some MK

1504
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:07,599
Ultra my wife swears smells like th and

1505
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:10,558
meat nice interesting maybe another

1506
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:13,079
episode totally up to you my friend I'm

1507
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:15,000
uh I'm here with you now if you want or

1508
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:20,600
uh we can uh we could take a pause for

1509
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:23,759
the Cs more pause the C so all right

1510
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:26,719
back with the turps all I'm back with

1511
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:29,880
the turps all right so

1512
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:33,319
unfortunately because I had things to do

1513
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:37,480
today and I came here I haven't

1514
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:39,960
sifted the MK Ultra just the water yep

1515
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:41,119
MK and this is the turbs yep so I

1516
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,560
brought

1517
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:50,519
over fraction of that so um this belongs

1518
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:50,520
to the LH this belongs to the

1519
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:57,439
sift

1520
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,560
what that a memory

1521
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:22,158
of I mean I can definitely taste the the

1522
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:24,359
cush of the MK Ultra in there yeah

1523
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:27,039
without a shadow of a

1524
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:29,759
doubt but then there's this other thing

1525
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:31,359
above it that it's before you get to it

1526
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:33,359
it's just right at the start and then it

1527
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:36,640
disappears and you're deep into the

1528
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:39,400
cush that I can't call right that got

1529
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:42,920
that's the flash that's the most it's

1530
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:46,079
like 3% you get one chance to experience

1531
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:46,079
it and

1532
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:50,238
then no the alcohol

1533
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:55,360
portion I don't even know what to call

1534
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:58,480
that it's it's so wild the way it turns

1535
01:09:55,359 --> 01:10:01,158
turns into Kush cuzz she was like meaty

1536
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:06,119
salty and then she backed up and then

1537
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:08,879
she's like sweet because now check out

1538
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:08,880
the alcohol

1539
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:16,839
side is that

1540
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:22,119
citrusy tastes

1541
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:27,320
citrusy it's still cushy underlining but

1542
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:27,319
almost like like a chocolate orange or

1543
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:38,480
wow tpin are so subtle it's an

1544
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,880
incredible game of smelling them because

1545
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:41,599
that's why I'm so excited about I think

1546
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,159
it's counterintuitive too I think the

1547
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,600
way I'm taking deep smells I need to

1548
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:48,119
take these really light it changes if we

1549
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:51,640
put these all in the freezer and then do

1550
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:53,000
an initial because it bursts uh the

1551
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,600
temperature temperature differential

1552
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,679
bursts the V this reminds me of one of

1553
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,239
those Christmas is your whack and it

1554
01:10:56,679 --> 01:11:01,600
open up and it's like an orange

1555
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:04,599
chocolate yeah do you smell a citrus in

1556
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,600
that check out the

1557
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:13,800
water

1558
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,800
yeah you you almost see brown

1559
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,960
orange that's what I'm saying because

1560
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:21,600
it's not fresh but you know it's yeah

1561
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,239
it's that damn it's that damn christm

1562
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,960
the reason I think it's yeah the reason

1563
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:28,279
I it's like a flavoring of orang

1564
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:31,039
it's not a true Orange it's like the

1565
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:33,079
difference between delemon and orange

1566
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:35,198
oil it's another one of those I you

1567
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:37,600
clearly got some cheap orange turpins

1568
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:39,000
and put them in this I'm like this is uh

1569
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,280
yeah I actually like the smell of it I

1570
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,920
don't think it smells cheap it's just

1571
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:47,119
clearly not whole yeah like orange yeah

1572
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:49,600
it's like partially something just one

1573
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:51,559
of the components that makes an orange

1574
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,079
taken aside and it turns this is

1575
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,280
interesting now this is so much more

1576
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:57,399
interesting because it doesn't have the

1577
01:11:55,279 --> 01:12:00,479
the sharp validity of the alcohol that's

1578
01:11:57,399 --> 01:12:03,439
carrying that smell into your nose this

1579
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:05,759
is truly water so right away if you took

1580
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:08,599
a deep enough smell of it you'd smell

1581
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:12,000
nothing then you take a lighter

1582
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:14,920
smell almost touch it to your

1583
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:20,119
nose and then you feel these these these

1584
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:22,480
strange sharp like portions of cush that

1585
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:24,079
are completely missing the front the

1586
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:25,519
middle and the back end but there's like

1587
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:27,198
a component between the front and the

1588
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,639
middle that's there and between the

1589
01:12:27,198 --> 01:12:32,079
middle and the end you can you can smell

1590
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:33,480
them but they're not like when you smell

1591
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:36,198
them like that so if you tasted that

1592
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:38,000
what do you expect to taste I think I'm

1593
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:40,960
going to get a little bit of a cushy

1594
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,399
kind of taste but more of a I don't know

1595
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:47,600
why I want to say

1596
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:47,599
kerene cuz I'm not really exactly

1597
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:57,039
sure cuz it's not in that portion that

1598
01:12:53,319 --> 01:13:00,880
it's it's absolutely drinkable and when

1599
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:04,920
I actually uh interesting I made a uh

1600
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:06,800
tpine soda for uh my friend Mike and um

1601
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:09,199
I didn't add any sugar I just carbonated

1602
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:12,600
it the first time I tried to do a full

1603
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:16,799
bottle and the soda stream exploded so

1604
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:19,039
instead I put in um a fraction of the

1605
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,520
alcohol this much to a full Soda Stream

1606
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:25,319
bottle M tasted exactly

1607
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:27,040
it unbelievably strong and delicious I

1608
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:29,079
actually have to do it again in order to

1609
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,880
attempt it that's the same MK it's just

1610
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:33,119
a different portion nor I actually

1611
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:36,960
brought that by accident nor I just

1612
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:39,760
travel with the smaller one

1613
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:42,079
oops all the TP guys trip balls when you

1614
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,800
play around oh this is like just like

1615
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:45,800
what did you do like what did you do

1616
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:48,279
with the

1617
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:50,760
money the money's in the carpet and I

1618
01:13:48,279 --> 01:13:52,800
can't reach for it

1619
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:56,280
anymore is it the same as when you do

1620
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:58,840
the small perfume scale

1621
01:13:56,279 --> 01:14:00,439
it's really nice yeah similar I think

1622
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,639
the small perfume scale is a more

1623
01:14:00,439 --> 01:14:04,559
concentrated way of smelling it that's T

1624
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:07,239
that's what I found I was like there's a

1625
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,080
reason for this scale pure chines are a

1626
01:14:07,238 --> 01:14:10,638
trick to smell it's like a when they're

1627
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:14,000
in that concentrated form you really

1628
01:14:10,639 --> 01:14:16,039
need to create a waft to catch the smell

1629
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,238
of it cuz otherwise it's such a great

1630
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:21,359
smell it's too much for your senses yeah

1631
01:14:19,238 --> 01:14:23,839
there's a bunch of Senses shutting

1632
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:25,439
down as it's as you're getting the rush

1633
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,079
but that one wasn't too much when I held

1634
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:28,638
it under my nose that concentrated I

1635
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:30,679
mean it was the equivalent of taking a

1636
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:32,319
bong rip that's in a big giant neck

1637
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:33,880
compared to one that's real small you

1638
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:35,158
know what the Restriction is like it's

1639
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,560
the same with the smelling the

1640
01:14:35,158 --> 01:14:39,399
Restriction smell yeah that's a lot of

1641
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:41,039
that Citrus yeah there's some really

1642
01:14:39,399 --> 01:14:43,279
citrusy stuff in

1643
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:45,560

1644

01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:20,400
kind of makes the bathroom not her purse

1675
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:21,600
it's not her purse but no it's it's it's

1676
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:23,920
like something she has in her one of her

dude so what bub people are watching

1685
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:45,519
this and laughing their heads off at our

1686
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,800
conversation right now

1687
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:50,159
what well the bubble gum listen the

1688
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,679
bubble gum's there right at the start

1689
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:54,960
smell

1690
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:56,880
it y candy you get that candy wrapped

1691
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,840
something something there is candy and

1692
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,159
to me it just initially was a Bubba and

1693
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:02,880
then see I see colors typically and the

1694
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:04,879
colors tell me where I am well that's

1695
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:08,560
greenish

1696
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:10,279
yellow what color is that see to me cuz

1697
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,960
I don't really see colors I'm just like

1698
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:14,559
I went out on a limb and thought that's

1699
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:16,359
kind of Bri it's like I tend to smell I

1700
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:18,719
try to smell the colors and what do I

1701
01:17:16,359 --> 01:17:20,399
see like where would it put me I guess

1702
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,679
I'm thinking it's it's green and its

1703
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:26,198
smell in the sense that I don't know if

1704
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:29,560
it's a TH or if it's it's it's a variety

1705
01:17:26,198 --> 01:17:31,238
of herbs that are changing itself if you

1706
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:33,840
get too close it starts to get more

1707
01:17:31,238 --> 01:17:35,759
candy right that's and then because I

1708
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,840
was like I'm like I'm going try the

1709
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:40,960
alcohol go for it while you're

1710
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:43,400
continuing on with your water oh Shyer

1711
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,399
look at that

1712
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:48,519
one the alcohol ones are such a pleasure

1713
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,719
because obviously they're the sharpest

1714
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:52,520
of the bunch obviously taking a drink of

1715
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,520
alcohol compared to taking a drink of

1716
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:58,199
water is really the differences between

1717
01:17:54,520 --> 01:18:01,320
these smells it's truly alcohol and

1718
01:17:58,198 --> 01:18:04,079
water I like it so much cuz it's not we

1719
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:06,479
just focus so much on the oil the oil

1720
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:08,039
the oil I got to get the oil that I

1721
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:10,559
haven't seen anyone who's fractioned

1722
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:13,238
this off and that's the one I'm most

1723
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,199
excited about because tinure wise that's

1724
01:18:13,238 --> 01:18:16,759
pretty potent stuff yeah I'm not even

1725
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:19,439
sure what to say about that one that

1726
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,840
one's uh that one almost made me dizzy

1727
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:21,839
smelling

1728
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:28,120
it yeah

1729
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:29,559
whoa yeah it's strong this is modulating

1730
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:30,880
the that's modulating I'm just from

1731
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,679
smelling it it

1732
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,159
is I feel like we've been huffing Turpin

1733
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:38,239
here for the last five minutes and I'm a

1734
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:39,960
bit dizzy this one's a this one is dizzy

1735
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:42,439

1736
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:44,719
it what's the Dizzy what's the Dizzy

1737
01:18:42,439 --> 01:18:45,799
alcohol tpine that we've never tested

1738
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,039
before I don't know I'll tell you one

1739
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:49,920
thing it cleared my sinuses I felt it

1740
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:52,920
move through my sinuses so you're saying

1741
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:55,158
in Jamaica I'll be able to pour this in

1742
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:57,560
well not pour it in 5 gallon buckets 55

1743
01:18:55,158 --> 01:18:59,799
gallon buckets not not even I'm not I'm

1744
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:02,480
not even I'm just interested in the

1745
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:06,119
machine that will tell me really tell us

1746
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:08,439
NH HMR yeah no more buying Wiggy W

1747
01:19:06,119 --> 01:19:10,158
nulear HMR cuz everyone's buying

1748
01:19:08,439 --> 01:19:12,158
standards and now we have a new standard

1749
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:13,799
and our numbers are jumping I'm

1750
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:16,198
interested in this especially for the

1751
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,840
Tarpin because the tpin are the new

1752
01:19:16,198 --> 01:19:19,879
numbers we want to know all about

1753
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:23,639
especially how accurately we can get

1754
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:26,239
part of it for sure come on well is this

1755
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:29,480
um is death Bubba nasal cream made out

1756
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:32,198
of this is that what um is that the

1757
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:35,238
message from it um and separate from

1758
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:37,879
this which may be colic

1759
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:39,879
water there is a lot of potential in

1760
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:43,400
just these

1761
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:45,400
non phyto canabo based cannabis

1762
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:47,879
medicines absolutely thus they are

1763
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:50,198
modulators so potentially for all we

1764
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,400
know that you could be taking uh one

1765
01:19:50,198 --> 01:19:55,439
form of saturating your endoc canabo

1766
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:58,319
system with trans dermals or um the

1767
01:19:55,439 --> 01:20:00,359
sublingual drops or even vaporizing or

1768
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:02,880
consuming Edibles and then you could use

1769
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:06,039
a product like this in another form of

1770
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:08,000
perhaps drops or uh transdermal or

1771
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:09,679
whatever and and modula well the thing

1772
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,760
is that's the thing is I'm like well I

1773
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:14,840
can without even thinking about

1774
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:18,000
modulating let's just never seen this

1775
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:21,119
ratio of tpin in therapeutic use either

1776
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,920
orally Aroma therapeutically

1777
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:25,760
or and cannabis gives us another

1778
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,359
potential we just growing it to juice

1779
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:31,119
the alcohol because the alcohol turns

1780
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:33,960
out to be something right that's I get

1781
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:36,599
excited when you can completely step

1782
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:39,079
away from phyto canabo and cannabis

1783
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:40,960
still has so much for mankind that it

1784
01:20:39,079 --> 01:20:44,800
just makes you go oh my god well you're

1785
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:48,679
a fraction man yeah I just I just look

1786
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,320
at it I'm like the plant people just

1787
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:51,800
we've got so much going on with what

1788
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:54,719
what if we can get this into a machine

1789
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:56,480
in Jamaica that can fraction it into all

1790
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,480
of its components well that's and then

1791
01:20:56,479 --> 01:21:00,198
you could take each one of those and put

1792
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:02,799
it into the machine and potentially

1793
01:21:00,198 --> 01:21:05,759
fraction those down the re only reason

1794
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:07,800
why I'm scared is because there is

1795
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,360
already 300 of these if I just have

1796
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,360
River Rock strains that's what I'm

1797
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:14,158
saying so if I just put in the machine

1798
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:16,719
and get a feedback and then we find a

1799
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:18,319
therapeutic clinical trial use we're

1800
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:20,800
that's already our lifetime somebody

1801
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:22,519
else will fraction it and then put it

1802
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:25,000
back together I'm like keep feeding this

1803
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:26,960
thing freaking alcohol fractions and

1804
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,800
water fractions and the oil fraction and

1805
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:33,480
did I mention the bud still smells like

1806
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:35,639
the loud pack so there's fractions that

1807
01:21:33,479 --> 01:21:37,879
we know that are already in there so you

1808
01:21:35,639 --> 01:21:39,840
can actually take the bud like Bud and

1809
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:41,279
now go and extract other tpin out of it

1810
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,239
that have nothing to do with what I'm

1811
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:44,719
dealing with right now how excited are

1828
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:19,520
the culmination of smelling the four

1829
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:21,399
before it that's why I'm trying to

1830

1838
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:42,238
try that one more time and let's wrap up

1839
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:42,238
does it still do

1840
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:57,319
it

1841
01:22:55,479 --> 01:23:01,279
CU I feel like I'm feeling it in my

1842
01:22:57,319 --> 01:23:05,158
heart it's sharp yeah it's definitely

1843
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:07,198
sharp it's absolutely 100% when I stop

1844
01:23:05,158 --> 01:23:09,920
exhaling that

1845
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:13,039
thing I feel like I just exhaled a hit

1846
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:15,840
like an like a expectorant feeling in my

1847
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:18,519
lungs yeah my lungs I'm like dude my

1848
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,960
heart fter in my a little in my it does

1849
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:22,159
it's got a bit of a pikme apple I want

1850
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,439
to say lemony but it's not lemony it's

1851
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:25,279
sharper

1852
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:27,519
like

1853
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:29,960
grapefruit grapefruit thyme or something

1854
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:32,280
like grapefruit herb some type of that's

1855
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:35,039
why my wife says season meat yeah it's

1856
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:37,238
seasoning for sure it's seasoned she's

1857
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:39,519
like this is like I'm smelling cold meat

1858
01:23:37,238 --> 01:23:41,039
which is really nothing but seasoning

1859
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,840
and I'm like really and I'm like I

1860
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:45,000
wonder if it's thy that she's smelling

1861
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:47,079
there is definitely thyme in there she n

1862
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,920
she she named that one she started with

1863
01:23:47,079 --> 01:23:51,679
meaty salty and then she's like it's got

1864
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:53,719
thyme cuz when thyme is dried then it's

1865
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:56,199
the subtle tarpine it's not the Roaring

1866
01:23:53,719 --> 01:23:58,079
oil the fresh one yeah so fresh one is

1867
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:59,279
strong yeah it seems that's what it is

1868
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:02,960
the dried

1869
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:05,039
