00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,028
hey guys bubbleman here and I'm just

3
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,339
replying to all sorts of people that are

4
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:29,099
worried about the PM the Johnny be sent

5
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,809
my way with the clones I haven't seen

6
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,390
another reoccurrence of it other than

7
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:35,429
the three little dots it had on on a

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,739
couple of fan leaves which I did remove

9
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,299
and so what I'm doing today is I'm gonna

10
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,308
just take you guys through really quick

11
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,140
how you can eliminate powdery mildew on

12
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,238
your plants or at least attempt to

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,128
eliminate it it depends if you've got

14
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,049
huge trees and shrubs outside of your

15
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:50,308
grow that you're sucking in powdery

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,929
mildew right off of and you don't

17
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:53,698
realize that you're never gonna get rid

18
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:55,170
of it but if you just got a little bit

19
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:58,468
brought into your garden this is a great

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,960
way to to to take care of it so I've got

21
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,790
four litres of water inside my five

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,489
gallon bucket I've got a tablespoon

23
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:11,368
baking baking soda okay this is going to

24
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:13,679
help change the PIA the pH of the of the

25
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,200
surface of the leaf so we'll take this

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:24,270
two tablespoon and we'll dump it in

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:29,359
there alright we will drop just just a

28
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:31,649
drop of soap in boom that allows it to

29
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:38,280
emulsify and stick together and then

30
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:42,030
finally teaspoon of olive oil this

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:47,129
allows the mold spores to be trapped so

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:50,909
we'll get that in there and get that all

33
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:52,739
mixed up alright guys so back here in

34
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,530
the garden with the three planets no

35
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,899
signs of powdery mildew as of yet but

36
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,030
why would we wait we know it was there

37
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,790
when the clones were given to us I've

38
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,030
got the mixture into my spray bottle

39
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,439
which is the soap the baking soda and

40
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,789
the olive oil and

41
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,689
we're just gonna give it a real nice

42
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:20,979
life spray and cover all the surfaces of

43
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:22,270
Belize and you can do this a variety of

44
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,949
times whoops

45
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,710
make sure your thing doesn't follow up

46
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:30,250
it's always good to keep that on mind

47
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:33,219
strip so it only goes on a few times if

48
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,659
you if you push it on any more than that

49
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:37,449
it goes right around and does what you

50
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:41,879
just saw make sure you grab those bottom

51
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:46,469
leaves make sure they're all getting it

52
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:50,079
some of this you don't lift trust me

53
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:51,879
they're not all getting wet they're not

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,260
all getting exposed like it's even on

55
00:02:51,879 --> 00:03:09,269
this little one there's a few that I'm

56
00:02:53,259 --> 00:03:11,649
exposed all right so that will dry up

57
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,689
it'll leave a little bit of residual on

58
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,780
the on the leaf and that's okay because

59
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:18,609
that is what the the baking soda is

60
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,919
changing your pH and then you have that

61
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,290
olive oil which is really going once

62
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,750
properly emulsified into the water it's

63
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:28,840
going to trap the put the spores and

64
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,849
keep them from getting out and we'll do

65
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,039
this for a couple of days we'll keep an

66
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:37,030
eye on things like I said I haven't seen

67
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,889
any p.m. as of such but since the first

68
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,419
day but I might as well stay on top of

69
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:42,099
it and I'll let you guys know because

70
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:44,379
you know what nowadays I feel that

71
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:45,969
really what's the purpose on me growing

72
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,859
perfect crops and just sharing that

73
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:49,840
information with people when really if I

74
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,670
can have problems if I can get a bug or

75
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,259
if I can get a you know there's mites

76
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:54,939
and gnats and all sorts of different

77
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:56,979
things that thank God I don't have right

78
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:59,199
now but if I do get them I'm going to

79
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:01,119
make a point on sharing how I deal with

80
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,069
them with you guys sometimes it's a

81
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,080
matter of really making the attempt

82
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,939
other times I mean really with three

83
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,760
small plants like this ready to go into

84
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:11,259
a garden of 20-plus plants into bloom it

85
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,908
would be very easy to start

86
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:15,639
over into and through these plants away

87
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:18,488
but I like the idea of actually

88
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:21,488
gardening actually fixing my plants up

89
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,779
so simple simple little thing one gallon

90
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:25,779
of room-temperature water with a

91
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:29,009
tablespoon of baking soda a teaspoon of

92
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:32,859
olive oil and a drop or two of

93
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:34,719
dishwasher soap or dish soap and there

94
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,220
it is I hope you guys have enjoyed the

95
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,960
video you sure we're worried about the

96
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,430
powdery mildew and I appreciate all the

97
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,239
tips that you guys gave me if you want

98
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,579
to give more

99
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,978
there's no no problem on sharing but

100
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:47,889
please do me a favor only share things

101
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:50,168
that you yourself have done or try don't

102
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:53,189
share things just that you've tried

103
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:53,189
thanks for watching

104
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,719
