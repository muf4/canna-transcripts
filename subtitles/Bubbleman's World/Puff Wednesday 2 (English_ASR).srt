8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,079
today the way I did last episode [ __ ]

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,850
dropped 20 more knee well I made a game

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,799
out of it if you watch the video it said

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,289
take a dab every time I say yeah I know

12
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,968
right here pretty girl okay so today's

13
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,100
episode is a quick it's a short one

14
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,280
we're pretty excited we've headed down

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,020
to to support level well this is where I

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,270
grew up actually we're in Port Coquitlam

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,949
right now we're about 50 minutes away

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,539
from each of our houses and the reason

19
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:59,729
we came here is because I said to Johnny

20
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,980
is there any like cash or solvent less

21
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:04,049
oil available in the

22
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,789
you know stores yet and so he made a few

23
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,709
phone calls I got on the phone and I'm

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,300
like calling around and of course I

25
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:11,158
called my old buddy right and he was

26
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,170
English like we worked at the Green

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,150
Cross aside right like he's like he was

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,450
the hardcore jabbering I'm like dude I'm

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,359
looking for some legal sounds like dude

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,740
I'm gone she we just got to never go

31
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,989
away I think that's why I'm calling up

32
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,868
I'm making a call right now because this

33
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:29,609
is this is just like that this is she

34
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:31,109
want to talk no more well we're gonna go

35
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:32,728
talk to him soon so what I wanted to

36
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:34,739
tell you guys was I'm pretty sure it's

37
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:37,379
gonna be Whistler medicated hash it's

38
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,868
been pressed into rosin and is now a

39
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,459
solvent less oil so obviously listen

40
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:43,709
we're not gonna be commenting too much

41
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,329
in the store at the price because this

42
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:47,969
is the legal regime it's gonna be

43
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,129
outrageous buying stuff like this from

44
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:52,439
the black-market cost eighty to ninety

45
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:54,030
dollars wholesale so I can only imagine

46
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,590
what it's gotta cost in there we're not

47
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,030
gonna make it yeah we're not gonna make

48
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,009
the whole purpose of the video but

49
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,989
you'll be shocked we'll show you but

50
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,450
yeah we're hearing but Port Coquitlam

51
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:05,429
we've got the cannabis store right here

52
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,409
and the funniest thing is if Johnny

53
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,000
moves out of the way a little bit you'll

54
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,459
see there's a policeman right there

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,719
break there there's a cop part parked

56
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,239
right here so as I pulled into the

57
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,699
parking lot to buy some legal hash oil

58
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,259
I see cops and I don't even have to

59
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,849
worry about it so this is one of the

60
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:22,768
good things look John was even saying

61
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,019
when we got here that when he was 14 15

62
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,840
he used to sell or just down the street

63
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,090
and I'm sure at that point in time

64
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,770
it was scarier you had worried about

65
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,348
cops you didn't want to get your [ __ ]

66
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,390
taken away and so this is kind of

67
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:39,229
accessible to those like John and I who

68
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:41,029
don't have access to to rosin on a

69
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:43,219
regular basis but now they can come and

70
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,870
kind of get it if they're if they're a

71
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:46,098
multi-millionaire and they can afford it

72
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:49,580
well you can see all the cars revving

73
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:50,899
here are like BMWs and Jack right so

74
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,610

125
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:46,859
not allowed to speak on a medical half

126
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,389
but we still provide that knowledge to

127
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,288

128
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:53,639

the burgh throwing out the cash now you

303
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:45,779
don't see this this much this is very

304
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:45,779
rare get yourself a chance to steal King

305
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:52,620
now I appreciated the chocolate that I

306
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,420
ate markets dosage I am fine in the

307
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,799
nanotechnology especially the beverage

308
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,569
beverage lines becoming readily

309
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,909
available that the emulsification

310
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,260
program the way it exists with our own

311
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:03,779
bloodstream and are under a new

312
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:05,339
endocannabinoids system for our group we

313
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,990
make it that the tent will be more like

314
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,279
a 30 or 40 milligram that people are

315
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,910
used to is that they've been told this

316
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:14,639
is 40 milligrams no sure just wait until

317
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:17,759
when you fit when those companies move

318
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,770
away from liposome based technology and

319
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,480
they get into mesial which is just a

320
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:23,910
different structure of surfactant that

321
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,759
goes around the molecule it's even more

322
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,830
bioavailable it's actually kind of

323
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,900
frightening I think it's why it'll be

324
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:32,369
fine with 10 milligram doses people just

325
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,800
don't understand how efficient we're

326
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:36,539
about to get regional they're eating

327
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,480
like thousand milligrams choco bars that

328
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:40,769
maybe aren't really decarboxylate and

329
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,019
not really like the most bioavailable

330
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:45,599
and they think I can do a thousand

331
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:47,190
milligrams so I should try like 100 or

332
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:54,419
50 milligrams of just something that's

333
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:56,970
actually been properly welcome 896 my

334
00:17:54,420 --> 00:18:00,320
friend than plenty you know what a

335
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:05,390
high-end chocolate bar crush 225 so

336
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:07,609
infuse chocolate or Undertown you sweet

337
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,200
how many em jeez I don't know probably

338
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:10,699
eat the hard things like a hundred total

339
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,809
or something

340
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,809
I think the masses

341
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:22,529
ten milligram per per unit

342
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:25,379
total so I'm gonna have to eat a lot of

343
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:26,849
sugar you are mother try there are some

344
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,610
vegan friendly and some sugar-free

345
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:32,899
xylitol right becoming available over

346
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,899
the mo kio I got to come back

347
00:18:54,509 --> 00:19:03,730
then there goes the man all right so we

348
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:05,439

cactus Club Cafe yeah this is one of our

351
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:12,519
favorite restaurants but we're right you

352
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,980
know because of this ridiculous scenario

353
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:16,808
in Canada where you can buy cannabis you

354
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,640
just can't [ __ ] do it anywhere

355
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:20,440
it's hoping anyone know I fed your house

356
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,399
so you're legally allowed to smoke but

357
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,798
where people are allowed to smoke

358
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:26,379
cigarettes they should be good it's over

359
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:28,359
ten feet away from the door we've got a

360
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,299
little table here set up I got the ten

361
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:33,990

362
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:35,548
open our Rosen

363
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,240
you're gonna need to crack that if you

364
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:40,109
want

365
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,109
crack that

366
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,470
there you go oh we're saving tax stamps

367
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:50,769

368
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,089
dude man Sam see you know see this we do

369
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:53,918
things for people you don't wanna be

370
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:57,599
afraid right away right so apparently

371
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,600
this is some high-tech

372
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,530
okay so this this is cool show that to

373
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:06,450
the camera up close okay so there you go

374
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:09,059
you gonna press the side and it's gonna

375
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:13,140
slide over it so real up close like so

376
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:15,359
much so there's the case now this Steven

377
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,100
stays in the case it doesn't come out of

378
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,449
the case for whatever reason I don't

379
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:21,029
know if this is just some hilarious

380
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:25,319
ridiculous scenario I was told he goes

381
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:27,059

428
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,000
part it

429
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,440
No

430
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:30,450
you expect you like it almost

431
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,579
well I mean this isn't oil it isn't

432
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,069
listed I didn't really know what I

433
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:36,778
expected I hold that it would be

434
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:38,908
something that because it was you know

435
00:23:36,778 --> 00:23:44,669
fairly expensive

436
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:46,049
it would be and I I trusted your friend

437
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:47,999
you've known him for a long time Martis

438

440
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:55,829
but I didn't know it was gonna be fire

441
00:23:52,319 --> 00:24:00,138
and he's like right away when I called

442
00:23:55,829 --> 00:24:00,138

great the flavor is there

445
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,880
the taste is there I'm definitely gonna

446
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,370
have to Double Down

447
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:15,920
yeah I'll get it Double Down you got to

448
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:17,949
take a huge I didn't want to get that

449
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,940
it's like

450
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,429
where did he get this to hit

451
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,659
of his life from legal I mean not the

452
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:25,460
head of his life anyone he prays that

453
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:27,340
she's in the try something he's ever

454
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:33,769
troppo which is legal

455
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:36,250
whistler mountain bubble which was

456
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:36,250
awesome

457
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:43,950
oh yeah that's yeah that's desi it's all

458
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:46,789
part because you said dad

459
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,789
it was dang

460
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,069
one more for Johnny be one more bubble

461
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,069
be

462
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:00,408
so yeah it's kind of wild but now

463
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:05,649
there's always going to be a division is

464
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:08,980
it extremely expensive of course it is

465
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:11,950
are we gonna hope and and and make sure

466
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,599
that things become less expensive yeah

467
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,789
that's the plan it's definitely not

468
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,469
ideal for people I mean don't get me

469
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:19,329
wrong right now the black market price

470
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,089
of rosin is really too expensive for

471
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:24,159
most people to purchase it between 50

472
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:28,230
and 80 dollars a gram there's not enough

473
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:30,759
power there's not a lot that's which one

474
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:33,849
yeah yeah but there's house rosin as

475
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:35,379
well for those prices oh but it still

476
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:36,909
you can get it is what I'm saying yes

477
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,460
and what I'm saying is it's not super

478
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,500
affordable for people to be able to buy

479
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,370
that we'd love to see it at $10 a gram

480
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:46,869
now this was this was almost $200 a gram

481
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:49,329
but we did it for a video we wanted to

482
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:52,569
see a what was available be I gotta say

483
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:54,490
it's definitely great Ross I mean this

484
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:57,490
rosin will get you lit time and time

485
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:59,230
again I'm not sure you know I won't be

486
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,430
going and paying $200 a gram for every

487
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,069
gram for Roz and I spend that's

488
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:05,830
absolutely outrageous but

489
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:07,148
you can't blame the store you can blame

490
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:08,859
the government and you can blame the

491
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,259
system that's in place right now but the

492
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:12,359
bottom line is

493
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:14,879
being able to walk into a store like

494
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:17,969
that and pick and choose your edible

495
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,520
your flower and your solvent was hash

496
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:24,410
oil to me was a pretty cool experience

497
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,410
and a glad that we got to do it Johnny

498
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:32,639
sorry

499
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:35,200
yeah DVD 0 CBB

500
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:40,000
tell the camera what's this it says here

501
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:46,539
it's just total THC 650 point 7 mg total

502
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:48,740
THC 670 THC 5 5 point 5 point 3

503
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:50,269
milligram and we

504
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,849
we fly

505
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:56,309
I'm kind of curious right now

506
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:57,689
more curious about actually I'm going to

507
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:59,609
do it

508
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,799
maybe a little warmer of temperature

509
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:02,969
maybe even hotter I like I like a hot

510
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,409
down then we're going to take you guys

511
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,880
into the cactus Club we're going to

512
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,529
probably won't be able to film too much

513
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,450
but we'll show you guys the food if

514
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:10,920
you're from BC or anywhere in Canada

515
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,019
there's there's a bunch of these places

516
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,900
across Canada I think Manitoba Toronto

517
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:18,990
Calgary 8:23 pop yeah yeah you want to

518
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,759
go maybe around 7:00 7:10 is always used

519
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:23,789
to be my favorite but 680 seems to be

520
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:25,230
them if by the time you put that in and

521
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:28,230
it says something you see how fast it's

522
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,220
dropping you're already at 690 the

523
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:34,529
trucks fast

524
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:35,930
there we go be hitting that dab like he

525
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:38,579
should be

526
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:41,910
dude I'm super surprised at the quality

527
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:44,490
I would not okay I'm upset with the

528
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,480
price but I'm pretty stoked on the

529
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:49,240
[ __ ] phone

530
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,019

let's listen see that's a if that's a

534
00:27:56,999 --> 00:28:02,799
sort of foreshadowing of things to come

535
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:04,690
maybe Canada's gonna have some decent

536
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,750

596
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:39,240
turned on some lights I don't think

597
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,419
these lights were here you know they may

598
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:48,690

599
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:51,150
the camera okay we're back we just made

600
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,529
a delicious meal boom makes fairly dark

601
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,298
here you might not be able to see us

602
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:59,869
that well it's better than the under the

603
00:31:54,298 --> 00:32:03,619
bridge one right this is what you get

604
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:03,619
and wait a second here

605
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:13,109
don't touch it with your fingers John

606
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,110
here's the devil

607
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:20,080
let's get the show on the road got a

608
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:23,080
look around literally at a parking lot

609
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,230
but this is the ridiculousness of the

610
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:26,339
Canadian

611
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,650
situation now not only are we

612
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:31,589
recreational users but we also use

613
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:33,360
cannabis medicinal and so you think

614
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:35,099
there will be some responsibility to

615
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:38,339
people who use it medicinally to have a

616
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:41,849
place to use it a simple place allows

617
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:44,250
I'm goin sign have a really nice that we

618
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:46,579
get up 10 nice scotches but I have to

619
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,579
come outside

620
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,359
here at 960

621
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,200
box is found

622
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:06,189

624
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,519
little bit dark I get it but hey we're

625
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:24,650

00:34:50,128 --> 00:34:54,868
we've talked about how we have seen

658
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:58,289
getting beginning epic - cross into

659
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:58,798
legalization 2.0 on first day it's not

660
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:01,880
bad

661
00:34:58,798 --> 00:35:03,800
not a bad hit for the first day

662
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,570
first day for us any way that we bother

663
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,510
to go to a store and buy I am stoked

664
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:11,450
about the flavors I got I'm not full

665
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:13,580
price with qualities of the rosin and

666
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:15,739
the flavors and the high that I'm

667
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:17,269
getting from it is exactly what we're

668
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:19,759
looking for acid for patients and for

669
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:22,400
people who are looking for for what they

670
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,260
need like it's there I can't wait to try

671
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,139
the chocolate on that block apparently I

672
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:29,930
need about 10 on them because

673
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:34,150
really don't even know what that would

674
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:34,149
be like we can make with it

675
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:42,080
chocolate but it was the experience and

676
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:43,639
I had to get to the experience not how

677
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,139
to really know what was going on I made

678
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:46,940
even test the water activity inside that

679
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:50,210
chocolate because it can't be above 85

680
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,950
apparently yeah I'm just kind of curious

681
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,630
right so if some of that new is stuff

682
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,669

683
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:59,260
