2
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,599
hey guys welcome back to Bubble man's

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,278
world once again John B has come over

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,800
for a wonderful visit and brought me

5
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:32,719
he's brought me my new sublimator so I

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,039
just got the XTR I guess this is like

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,200
the sublimator 2.0 it is the 2.0 so um

8
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:41,439
yeah it's got the removable handle so

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,840
the cord comes off of the actual unit

10
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,399
which I thought was really pretty

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,160
cool and it's like an old like pretty

12
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,719
much like your band equipment it's got

13
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:55,038
the two pin simple click it's got a

14
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,879
little uh little box here for um dialing

15
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,120
it in like a dialing in your controller

16
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,479
a little heat heat dialer and then it's

17
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,839
got the um

18
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:07,438
the same old uh original Bowl this is

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,840
pretty much um the design that he's had

20
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,279
since the beginning and it's got the

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,320
little atomizer on the inside and it's

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,439
got the straight pull he has uh sped it

23
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,879
up or sped it up he's tightened it up a

24
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,639
little bit my old original one I have

25
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:24,199
here um when this part gets heated up it

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,200
started getting loose so we've got uh

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,478
the new one which is nice and tight fits

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,400
good into the mothership isn't loose or

29
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:34,519
anything and then the the sublimator

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,280
just fits right on top so it's a good

31
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:39,078
idea to type tape your little sublimator

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,439
uh dial box down because the cord is

33
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:41,959
fairly short and if you're moving it

34
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:43,359
around it can cause a little bit of

35
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:46,280
problems but just Taping that down will

36
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,799
eliminate that and and they do have an

37
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,320
extension he was saying there yesterday

38
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,479
I was talking to extension you can

39
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,959
excellent yeah I can see some people

40
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,798
wanting to be extended so if they want

41
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,759
an extension it can be actually here

42
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,399
we'll just drop a little screen in

43
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,718
there we'll see that oh look at that

44
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,879
fell pretty pretty much to

45
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:07,078
Perfection strain

46
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:09,399
101 and we'll just put that in there

47
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,000
this what it's all about that's the 101

48
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,800
this is the 101 okay well I'm looking

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,120
101 the sublimator up to temperature if

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,439
you want to slap some of that 101 101

pack and here you go my friend oh I'm so

63
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:57,158

64
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,158
through this Mothership

65
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,359
oh my gosh was that tasty that's why I

66
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,560
want that was just a light light perfect

67
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,640
Vapor rip I so wanted to hit this on the

68
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,239
sublimator and being just dying to try

69
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,759
it got a chance to try it with enrio

70
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,200
yesterday and I was like I got to get to

71
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,199
Marx head on

72
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,640
here oh I'm really glad you came this

73
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,640
that the taste is just amazing

74
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,480
I I mean how do you even describe such a

75
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,560
thing it's

76
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,679
so

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,840
almost

78
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,000
peppery not like not like black pepper

79
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,438
but like

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,438
Peppers M that's so tasty

81
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,119
that's his third ripped on that so you

82
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:08,399
know that last one is got all that THC

83
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,680
now it's going to give her a little big

84
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,879
hit which is always my favorite for

85
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,640
third burn for me depending on the

86
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,439
person we getting lots of smoke now so

87
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,599
we know we're got rid of that beautiful

88
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,160
taste in the beginning and and now he's

89
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,479
getting that

90
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,520
full what I found was that the first two

91
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,918
rips were perfect taste yeah but the

92
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,799
herb was well I mean as as it should be

93
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:32,439
it was a little bit moist still because

94
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,439
you don't want to Bone it out I would

95
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,160
suspect that or I would suggest that

96
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:40,079
when you're hitting a a vaporizer a

97
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,280
sublimator the ideal situation is to

98
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,439
throw a little bit of Herb in your

99
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,839
bubble box or outside of the jar and it

100
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:47,240
doesn't need to be dried for a long

101
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,560
period of time sometimes it just seems

102
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,120
like half an hour or 20 minutes out at

103
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,360
room temperature makes the herb just the

104
00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:00,120
perfect dryness for getting that third

105
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,520
hit in the first hit along with those TR

106
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,680
uh tur

107
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,478
hits and once we've done in in the past

108
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,519
here we've taken fresh herb right from

109
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,839
the garden right in the sublimator and

110
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,198
once again I couldn't believe that

111
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,399
actually that wow John came over one day

112
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,680
and was like Hey we're going to vape

113
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,799
some fresh herb and I was just kind of

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,840
like wasn't really feeling

115
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,759
it in my mind and then we did the hits

116
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,119
and it was just kind of unbelievable how

117
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,759
I couldn't believe it I had to try it

118
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,879
and I'm like wow the flavors once again

119
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,360
just an amazing flavor with the

120
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,800
sublimator

121
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,400
it's and you can see with this new one

122
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,199
you can actually dab on the side of it

123
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,359
too with the full up bubble absolutely

124
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,680
we're going to get to that there's no

125
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,879
doubt about it I remember talking with

126
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,439
him in the beginning and I was always

127
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,399
sticking dry sift in the

128
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,639
holes booah all right here let me clear

129
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,638
that for

130
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,280
you very tasty nice to bring herb back

131
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,399
to my palette you know I love hash uh

132
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,239
and even when I say herb we're really

133
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:07,598
only vaporizing the resin off the herb

134
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:10,598
so in a sense this is no different than

135
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:10,598
extracting

136
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,639
hatch Go

137
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,560
Johnny oh yeah I think the sublimator

138
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,439
has gotten to a nice temperature now

139
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,759
it's given nice uh nice deep Vapor hits

140
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,879
the one thing you'll know about a

141
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,319
sublimator when it's working 100%

142
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,439
properly is that it's going to give you

143
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,280
a kit that's pretty much unlike any

144
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,160
other herb vaporizer on the market I'd

145
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,799
say the verdamper is the

146
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,319
closest you know you can't get the and

147
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:46,759
out of a clean Mothership pipe wow you

148
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:50,479
know like that is good stuff that flavor

149
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,479
oh and that's why I so

150
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,680
love you know there's no other option

151
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:59,279
really that is the option for I can't be

152
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,400
hitting a volcano and I can't be you

153
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:05,079
know of red damper is big and glass and

154
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:08,279
gnarly and I like hitting out of my own

155
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:11,159
piece and that's one thing that both um

156
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,959
sublimator and denail allow for me to do

157
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,879
I don't want to have to buy some special

158
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,519
piece that comes with the vaporizer I

159
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,680
want it to fit on my pipe that I'm used

160
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:24,519
to hitting that I'm that I enjoy hitting

161
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,079
so anyway yeah pretty pretty cool new

162
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,079
product from enrio and the people at

163
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,038
sublimator the XTR check them out at uh

164
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,680

the way up now would you like to try

178
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,478
this the fresh Frozen that we did

179
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:04,959
because that took that next to 35 days

180
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,959
right yeah and we can match the flavors

181
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,359
sure yeah let's do that just an idea I'm

182
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,839
definitely that idea just thinking all L

183
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,240
because we're I'm liking your thoughts

184
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,799
John I don't know you know what so this

185
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,360
is this was the the tops all the bottoms

186
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,639
and I actually kept growing this strain

187
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,280
for another 30 days when I took that

188
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,158
down on day

189
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:28,529
75

190
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:30,240
right beautiful

191
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:32,639
[Music]

192
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,158
36 Days in total extra cuz gave me the

193
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:38,199
day 101 which was fun I'll make sure we

194
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,200
show you a little bit of this

195
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,720
too so I think what I'll do for this

196
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,959
because we're going to

197
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:52,480
dab I'm going to prepare

198
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:55,119
it and that's where the oil slick comes

199
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,839
in I've got my whole table covered in

200
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,879
the oil slick

201
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,279
here which you've seen on other videos

202
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,679
yeah and I'm just kind of pushing the

203
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,000
corner over with a little bit of

204
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,879
pressure from my

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,159
finger just kind of trying to dab a

206
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:13,679

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
right oh really yeah it's not a whole

219

thing at all it's just like there's it's

220
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,159
like anywhere on that edge anywhere all

221
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,599
the way around I love it Le what I love

222
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,958
so much about it yesterday I was like

223
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,879
hey that's that's that's really

224

convenient there's no hole anymore you

225
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,399
can actually just pour it on the side

226
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,160
that was definitely something I was

227
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,559
worried about here yeah no no just right

228
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,559
on that edge

229
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,200
watch a full bubble all the way around

230
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,440
that that's actually

231
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:12,759
uh and to no residue at all

232
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,200
either oh dude I'm Sook for that that's

233
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:17,039
nice I was stepping out cuz I had to

234
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,040
take a look

235
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,720

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,720
yeah that was

240
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:43,838
uh something else why don't I get you

241
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,639
one of those that was

242
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,079
like wow why would anyone even use the

243
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,839
sublimator to vaporize if you could just

244
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:55,399
do

245
00:10:50,839 --> 00:11:00,920
that you know or to Herb to vape herb as

246
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,919
opposed to Hash that was like times 10

247
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:09,120
all right this [ __ ] is just bubbling up

248
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,120
like crazy here on the skillet

249
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,720
too that's going to make a nice photo

250
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:19,078
you want a actual hit now yeah all

251
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,440
right okay I'm going to stand up for let

252
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,439
me clean your I'm going to put

253
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:28,000
the give you a little

254
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,600
clean comes with a nice little cleaning

255
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,919
tool kind of see how it is convenient eh

256
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,040
well you need it for sure yeah I I like

257
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,799
it because I don't dab with it and I

258
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:40,319
don't want to clean with my Skillet tool

259
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,319
anytime you're

260
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,480
ready pretty cool design he's tapered in

261
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:58,000
the nail and

262
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,600
um yeah basically where the holes are he

263
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,600
tapered the nail in in that hole whole

264
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,278
ridge there you go John want to hit that

265
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,800
a little bit more on there didn't want

266
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:07,879
to leave you hanging there I think you

267
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,278
pretty much got it but yeah very cool

268
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:14,000
little design he's tapered The Ridge in

269
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:18,600
that whole circular piece around the

270
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,559
nail um you can dab on so it's probably

271
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,278
what I'll be doing I also found when I

272
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:27,319
had my sublimator last round I really

273
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:29,879
enjoyed putting hash in the bowl I found

274
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,240
that I got a different tasting h hit as

275
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,639
opposed to when I put it right onto the

276
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,639
titanium wow that that I'm just getting

277
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,480
rip after rip it's like holding in there

278
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,240
almost like it's got a choke on it mhm

279
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,519
yeah I know it's very nice it's

280
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,519
like very

281
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,278
nice and once again we always want to be

282
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,159
careful with the unit that's really hot

283
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:55,439
yeah it's a large piece of hot metal and

284
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,639
because it has the handle that is

285
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,720
attached to a cord it's very important

286
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,720
that you just always respect your

287
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,120
sublimator it's not really a piece that

288
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,199
should be passed around as much as you

289
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,679
go to it if you get

290
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:11,639
comfortable you always use two hands I

291
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,838
wouldn't be confident in just holding

292
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,320
one hand it's good to secure this and

293
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,480
it's also nice to be able to pull it out

294
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,639
when you want to clear the bowl and

295
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,600
whatnot so ideally you'd have a nice

296
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,360
upright bong if you're not going to use

297
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,759
the one that sublimator supplies with a

298
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,720
very large base and you know not any

299
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,919
angle in the bowl the bowl should be

300
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,278
pointing straight up in my opinion well

301
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:34,039
we already these are all just my

302
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,159
opinions right so I wouldn't say an

303
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:37,559
opinion I think it was uh a research

304
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,319
design when we had the other one there

305
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,838
and we put it on on the angle it was

306
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,360
very easily a little bit more dangerous

307
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,480
not something that we witnessed you know

308
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,680
what has to be up and down for sure just

309
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,720
on the safe and there's actually also a

310
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,039
little cage around it so you can't burn

311
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,720
yourself if you want to get that yeah

312
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,000
and if it fell out or dropped it would

313
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,360
be not a worry so there's all kinds of

314
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,958
different either way you could say a

315
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,399
million things about the design and

316
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,078
things that you would want to improve

317
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,958
about it en Rico's come a long way the

318
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,919
bottom line is since the day I first hit

319
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,879
this thing it's pretty much one of the

320
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:14,639
tastiest rips that you'll get and you

321
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,240
can do it with herb oil or hash you can

322
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,440
do them all simultaneously or all

323
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,120
together that's simultaneously okay

324
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,079
thank you

325
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,480
and I don't know these and you're making

326
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,719
sublate at the same time we're actually
