106
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,848
definitely don't want to be getting

107
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,430
people all pissed off and choked at me I

108

am a bit of a joker I do have a little

109
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:12,319
bit of a sick humor in a sense awesome

110
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:15,340
circle a lot too bad you're not the pump

111
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,199
let's have a rip shall we

112
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,488
a guy from yesterday's waking big I

113
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,409
don't know do the bloody students work

114
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,000
for squishing bubble or should I be no

115
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,310
definitely yeah they do actually what am

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,168
I saying no we used to d'origine started

117
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,120
that we would roll roll it in there and

118
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:30,759
if you watched the first rosin video I

119
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,530
ever did it was a square piece I put it

120
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,719
in there I rolled it up in a little ball

121
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:36,279
and then just did the cruel sense of

122
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,190
humor like me I don't know if it's cruel

123
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,559
but it's definitely sadistic sometimes

124
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:44,199
sick at best but I'm definitely not

125
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,949
malicious I'm not out to harm any of you

126
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,289
and I have no intentions of you know

127
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,949
causing internet wars that go on forever

128
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,350
and ever

129
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:54,728
however I have been on the internet for

130
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,540
over 20 years and it seems like I

131
00:04:54,728 --> 00:05:00,129
somehow I'm always attracting it so must

132
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,270
