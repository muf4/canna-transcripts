00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:24,410
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,050
just a short little clip here today on a

4
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,719
beautiful afternoon I wanted to show you

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,460
just a few of my plants my mom's as well

6
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:33,289
as some mixed in they're going to go

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,780
into the next bloom potentially with the

8
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:37,729
lush XL Dominator like that I have on

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,429
the way shoutout to Kingston herb and

10
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:41,599
the kind people at lush for setting that

11
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:43,549
up we're gonna be doing a side-by-side

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,050
comparison and I'm hoping some of these

13
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:46,579
babies right here will end up in that

14
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:50,119
comparison what we're gonna do is have

15
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:52,009
the lush on one side and HPS on the

16
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:53,838
other side or potentially two separate

17
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:56,119
tents we'll see what happens anyway

18
00:00:53,838 --> 00:01:00,619
wanted to show you guys what we got

19
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:03,978

28
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:35,750
Diesel stretching out like nothing I've

29
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:37,909
ever seen very very crazy long stretches

30
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,129
with nothing from the stalk where I cut

31
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:43,100
it all the way up to 6 plus inches

32
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:46,250
before there's growth sites keep cutting

33
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:48,288
her down next up we have another Medi

34
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,578
Hey so I've got three mini Hayes's that

35
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:51,579
are gonna be going into balloon should

36
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:53,868
be interesting to see what she produces

37
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:56,449
right next to the mini haze you see this

38
00:01:53,868 --> 00:02:01,129
bush which I've yet to really trim down

39
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:03,379
and that is a sweet skunk this one I did

40
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:05,989
manage to spin down trim down this is

41
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:09,710
the Barbra bud and I've really trimmed

42
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:11,750
her down nicely and that is the original

43
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,840
Barbra bud that Matt the great gardener

44
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:18,680
gave me on the video there right next to

45
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,039
that is his Afghani nice little Afghani

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:25,599
a little side branch coming off there

47
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:28,150
these fats talk on that Afghani

48
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,789
Congolese

49
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,739
he's Bush on the Congo looking really

50
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:36,979
forward to flowering some con goes out

51
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:40,759
and then up here we have House of the

52
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:42,649
great gardener Afghani another sweet

53
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,389
skunk the one that I've posted on my

54
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,459
Facebook account the last couple of

55
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:48,259
times just really loving the petite miss

56
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,269
of this plant how it's almost bonds I'd

57
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,519
getting ready to go big

58
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:53,780
Barbara bud so this will be the first of

59
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,510
the Barbara buds and the size of the

60
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,158
leaf on a tiny plant like that you know

61
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:01,818
give you an idea of the size of that

62
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:04,848
thing and finally last but certainly not

63
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:08,388
least we have the 20 year old Jamaican

64
00:03:04,848 --> 00:03:10,668
triploid so as you can see on this

65
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:13,609
Jamaican we have a triploid right here

66
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:16,579
we have this leaf we have this leaf and

67
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:19,969
we have this leaf all coming off the

68
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:23,090
base stem instead of a two leaf we're

69
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:25,400
rocking a triploid so that's always very

70
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,128
exciting to get that one two three I'm

71
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:32,799
sure you guys can all see it and that is

72
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:36,560
the Jamaican lamb's Red Cross from 1995

73
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,349
you can see another mutation in this

74
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,739
leaf here as we lift the leaf you can

75
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:47,089
see more leaf underneath it it's a bit

76
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:49,959
of a strange mutant but yeah so back

77
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,959
over the babies

78
00:03:53,129 --> 00:04:01,409
all the different leaf structures what

79
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,419
can I say

80
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:06,150
I'm super excited to get these plants

81
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,589
all mothered out for future clones and

82
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,810
the ones that are going into the tent

83
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,879
I mean I'm super excited to check out

84
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,310
the possibilities between the led the

85
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,050
HPS the metal halides and everything in

86
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,600
between I'm looking forward to growing

87
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,520
resin for the resin production I want to

88
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,740
show you guys the profiles I want to

89
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,419
show you guys the melt factors and just

90
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,769
learn a bunch of new things as we're

91
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,650
doing it so stay tuned

92
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,359
