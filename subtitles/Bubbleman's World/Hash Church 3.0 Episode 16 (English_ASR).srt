I've sent out invitations to people and

00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:20,560
they haven't actually been sent out so

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,640
I'll just in case go back through my

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,118
indeed going to be here so I'm pretty

40
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,640
excited for a couple of reasons today

41
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:45,319
one we're supposed to get our Emerald

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,718
cup samples today so I am judging

43
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:51,158
cartridges so I'm really excited to uh

44
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:55,599
see everything and what's there this

45
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:59,039
year and the other reason I'm excited is

46
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:01,839
uh my my uh business as well as cannabis

47
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,239
was deemed uh not only essential it was

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,159
put to the top of the list for

49
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:10,639
covid-19 and uh so I just called Kaiser

50
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:14,359
and Friday I was able to go down and get

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:18,318
my first vaccine shot from fizer for uh

52
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,080
covid-19 so I was pretty uh stoked and

53
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,119
excited and more than excited for my

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,879
people and anyone in the Cannabis

55
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,480
industry especially dispensaries

56
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:30,199
Frontline workers can actually go get

57
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:33,119
your vaccines now so uh you can actually

58
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:35,000
call and make it happen so go call your

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,400
uh provider mine was Kaiser you can call

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,479
Blue Cross whoever and you didn't you

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,760
don't have to show your ID card you

62
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,518
don't have to pay for anything all you

63
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:48,079
do is show up fill out your card fill

64

now give you your shot you sit for 15

67
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,560
minutes see if you have any side effects

68
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,239
and then they send you on your way so

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,878
I'm pretty excited I got my first

70
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,000
vaccination shot and my people can get

71
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:06,878
more protection and uh yeah that we get

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,840
the actual Emerald cup samples today was

73
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,919
uh will be exciting to say the least I'm

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,000
not excited about foot Super Bowl Sunday

75
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:17,479
but I am about judging my cannabis

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,400
Sunday so that's more exciting for me

77
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:22,399
needless to say so how about you

78
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:28,199
Wade say again Marcus I was just

79
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,360
wondering today is the Super

80
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:34,119
Bowl uh yeah control that yeah that

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,159
today is or as I call it a good

82
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,560
commercial day so uh there's apparently

83
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:41,798
a game commercials why don't we all pack

84
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,400

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,438
Bowls well there you go I like that it's

86
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,239
great idea

87
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:51,680
Marcus I'm not sure why the new chat is

88
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,360

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,200

first comment first there we go isn't

91
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:04,158
that funny if I don't comment first the

92
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:06,840
chat doesn't open up for the rest

93
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:09,120
of really that's so funny well it's

94
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,560
working out everyone question for you is

95
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,560
that a uh uh is that a Statewide mandate

96
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,920
for uh cannabis workers or is that

97
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,560
something that's happening just in the

98
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,839
county yes one of my uh one of my

99
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,800
veterans Action Council uh Brian Buckley

100
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,198

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,600

102
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,759
showed up to do that uh and to get his

103
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,320
shot and when he did they were like

104
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,600
you're too young and he said well I'm an

105
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,240
essential worker uh in the Cannabis

106
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,199
industry and they checked with their

107
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,600
supervisor and they said yes and so they

108
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:47,240
actually put out a breakdown so um I

109
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,240
then got that breakdown uh sent it to my

131
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,519
arms no extra appendages no weird

132
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:50,120
feelings nothing uh the shot was you

133
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,318
know she did the old one two three you

134
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,038
know right into the arm it was quick and

135
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,439
painless you know it's was just a little

136
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:59,639
sore like us right around you know where

137
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:01,399
you usually get a shot but uh I sat down

138
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,280
for the 15 minutes had no adverse

139
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,799
reactions and I was allowed to go home

140
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,719
and I came home and ate because I was so

141
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,079
nervous I I didn't eat much beforehand

142
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,919
and then when I got home I was just

143
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:18,560
ravenous so uh yeah it was um yeah just

144
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:21,038
a good feeling and then this the the

145
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,839
night's sleep was fine woke up yesterday

146
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:26,800
no soreness in the arm and um yeah as

147
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,519
stated I'm just excited to get my People

148
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,639
Protected and that we're deemed

149
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:32,680
essential and if we're essential this

150
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,759
high up in the state we need to

151
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,199
definitely capitalize this on the

152
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:41,759
national and the state level for sure

153
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:44,120
because um that you know we've never

154
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,240
been this high or considered in society

155
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:51,160
before so this gives us a platform to

156
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,038
stand upon and uh kind of um you know a

157
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,919
unique position we've never had before

158
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,839
so we have to figure out how to properly

159
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:02,318
capitalize on that uh we had of course

160
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:04,279
uh sure come out this week and say here

161
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,919
in the United States they want to pass

162
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:09,559
some sort of cannabis uh

163
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:11,159
decriminalization reform uh this year

164
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,839
which is rather surprising because a lot

165
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,919
of the brain think we're thinking closer

166
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:19,598
to uh two years from now and to think

167
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,598
that uh they actually want to get

168
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,279
something through is one concerning

169
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:24,759
because they rush through the mo act and

170
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,359
then they added all kinds of things

171
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,598
including removing of social equity

172
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,439
which is a huge problem because you you

173
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,598
know felons veterans and those and you

174
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:36,240
know people of color across the board

175
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,079
that have been hurt by this drug war

176
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,000
especially those that have been arrested

177
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,318
should have access to this industry

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,439
because they're also some of the most

179
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,800
experienced you know people in this

180
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,719
industry uh they know the risk took the

181
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,759
risks and you know everybody who takes

182
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,440
the risks it's impossible to threat it

183
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,919
100% of the time there's going to be

184
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:57,959
things that happen so you know they

185
00:07:53,918 --> 00:08:00,399
shouldn't be penalized or hurt from that

186
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:05,598
in Canada uh do you have any such

187
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,598
disbarment for uh felons into the

188
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,639
industry Johnny

189
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Marcus sorry I'm like super stoned right

190
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,759
now I was

191
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,199
like does your country bar people who

192
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,000
have previous felonies in cannabis from

193
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,720
being in the industry that's why I'm not

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,240
in the industry oh really because I am

195
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,080
in the industry and I have previous

196
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,038
felonies so I have a very different

197
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:34,399
answer from John people with felonies

198
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:37,278
can get the industry if you try so

199
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,879
well depending on honest charges and

200
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,679
your felony charges so if you really

201
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,360
want to get into it depending on where

202
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,199
you lie and where you are in an industry

203
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,919
and what you've done so if you have an

204
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,959
EXT exactly if you have felony cannabis

205
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,559
charges if you have felony cannabis

206
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:55,319
charges you're okay if you've robbed a

207
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:59,009
bank you are not so okay Johnny's got

208
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,640
the bank charges I don't

209
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:04,519
[Laughter]

210
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,278
go thank you for the

211
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:09,200
clarification

212
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:11,919
clarification um I I have a I have a

213
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,920
charge in a slight of a stupid little

214
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,519
thing that is now dealt with actually it

215
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:20,360
was uh I'm not gonna get into it here on

216
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:22,600
Hur so bong R it's funny it's definitely

217
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,360

218
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,320

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,278

262

everything it's so thank you you know

263
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:16,958
it's funny I I uh I take you know I take

264
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,399
Marcus as a friend very seriously and

265
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,838
and I love I love you Marcus very much

266
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,480
and I I think there's a lot of things

267
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,920
that are being said on that platform

268
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,278
that we we shouldn't regulate but we

269
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,479
need to there needs to be truth to a lot

270
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:33,200
of this stuff and I think it's um it's

271
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,720
important that we share the truth that

272
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,759
we've been taught and and just continue

273
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,560
to be truthful to the individuals and

274
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,360
the the other people that are interested

275
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,679
in this plant and and also learn from

276
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,399
the other individuals that are on the

277
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,599
platform that we've never interacted

278
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,320
with before there's a lot of people that

279
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,440
I probably would never speak to in any

280
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,560
other instance um and it brings us all

281
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,560
together so it's really special in that

282
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,919
respect um and Johnny thanks thanks for

283
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,039
saying those kind words that you know

284
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,639
I'm just trying

285
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,879
to just trying to do my part you know

286
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,440
teach what I was talking I've really

287
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:13,639
enjoyed it I found that it wasn't until

288
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,880
a particular person ended up on there

289
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,399
and just I couldn't I suddenly started

290
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,958
looking at Clubhouse like oh I want to

291
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,720
go in that room but that person's in

292
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,278
there right now and I would be in the

293
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,680
room and that person would come in and

294
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:26,958
I'd be like oh I gotta just like the

295
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,958
absolute [ __ ] that was coming out of

296
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,958
this guy's mouth and the just the play

297
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,638
just the

298
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,399
slander just the full-blown slander I

299
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:39,320
personally chose to avoid it Colin chose

300
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,919
to take it on head on and literally you

301
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,600
know go to war uh with this guy and and

302
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,919
crushed him really I wasn't in the room

303
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,159
at the time because I didn't want to be

304
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:48,919
and I won't even mention his name

305
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,679
because he doesn't even deserve to the

306
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,719
exposure here on hash church but uh what

307
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:57,519
I would expl uh Express to people that

308
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,600
are using um Clubhouse and enjoying it

309
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,519
you know as far as I know I don't think

310
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,399
there's a block feature so when you go

311
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,159
into a room is there there is a block

312
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,958
feature yeah I have blocked if you go

313
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,078
into a room with a block person does

314
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:13,479
that mean you can't hear them uh I have

315
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:17,039
not gone into a blocked room to listen

316
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,480
to that person so uh I have yet to

317
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,719
actually do that but I get pinged all

318
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,720
the time for this person who I consider

319
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,040
one of the most unethical people in our

320
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,600
industry and uh for some reason people

321
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:31,078
pinged me and I had to write him on the

322
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,920
side and say look don't call me into

323
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:37,159
room with this person because uh here's

324
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:40,719
why you know because I will not be kind

325
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:42,439
um and we have to be in there we have to

326
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,800
be talking to people because these

327
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,240
people are dropping all kinds of

328
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:50,838
misinformation lies half truth and you

329
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:54,120
know they're trying to name dropping so

330
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,160
bad that it's just absolutely obnoxious

331
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,759
to the point where you know sure the

332
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,439
novice definitely gets intrigued by it

333
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,919
but it's really [ __ ] annoying to

334
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,199
those that have been in the movement and

335
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,078
watch these people use and manipulate

336
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:09,958
people and now you know try to win them

337
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:13,879
over you know you can't you can't go out

338
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:15,919
and you uh you know make yourself look

339
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,958
bad by saying these you know negative

340
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:22,039
things but it's definitely uh something

341
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,799
that we have to watch for uh especially

342
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:27,000
those that especially like overtake a

343
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:30,240
room and won't let anyone else talk oh

344
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,120
those those are obnoxious as hell

345
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,440
oh and let our Discord people know if

346
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,759

347
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,560

420
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,599
wish on clubhouse they had a schedule

421
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:28,160
speakers at certain times like we do

422
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,678
have certain meetings and I know it goes

423
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,160
all over the place that's the whole

424
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,559
thing it's like you go into one topic

425
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
it's not even on that topic you just got

426
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:35,798
to click on and see what the hell

427
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,679
they're talking about because you have

428
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:39,599
no idea what they really talking about

429
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,798
the headline might say something but

430
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,839
believe me it's completely different 15

431
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:46,440
minutes after that headline is been it's

432
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,159
it's awesome that way so I had a great

433
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,519
conversation with some Jamaicans the

434
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,600
other day on Bob Marley's Earth strong

435
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,079
February 6th that was yesterday I

436
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:56,759
invited weiten I thought it was a trip

437
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,079
these guys were getting into it like

438
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,759
Clubhouse style instead of blowing smoke

439
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:03,519
up the up the Marley foundations but

440
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,679
they were celebrating Bob but at the

441
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,798
same time they were like you know Bob

442
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,640
did this and Bob did that and he didn't

443
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:11,400
do this and he kind of [ __ ] this guy

444
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,159
over and you know the the Marley

445
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,360
Foundation wanted to create this image

446
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:18,480
of God of of a Godlike Bob Marley but in

447
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,439
truth he was really quite a real person

448
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,159
who had you know his own disagreements

449
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,679
and his own arguments and prior to

450
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:26,840
becoming Ras paparian was for sure you

451
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,559
know a gunman like a pretty serious guy

452
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,879
in Jamaica and it was just neat to hear

453
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,038
these guys talking about everything in

454
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,679
the realest of realest of ways and

455
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,798
talking about the guys you know who

456
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,720
brought Bob Marley and Peter Tosh and

457
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,480
Bunny wher to see Joe higs and how they

458
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,558
kind of screwed Joe over and ended up

459
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,519
going over to coxton coxton was this

460
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:50,000
full-blown like control Mafia the radio

461
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,759
any singer in Jama it was neat

462
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,558
conversation it was not soft it had a

463
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:57,519
sharp edge to it as Jamaican

464
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:00,279
conversation often does and I just

465
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,440
really enjoyed it they were also this

466
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:06,879
guy by the name of oh it was Johnny

467
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,440
pepper seed and he um he was a white guy

468
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,799
but he definitely had the voice of

469
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,720
living in the Caribbean I believe he's

470
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,519
like a you know a well-known kind of

471
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,079
radio DJ guy and he was playing all all

472
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,359
original songs from the Whalers from way

473
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,918
back in the day and I just thought you

474
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,719
know if you want to go on clubhouse and

475
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,919
stick with cannabis conversations you

476
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,880
certainly can but if you want to break

477
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:31,120
out of that there's literally convers

478
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,600
ations about everything you can possibly

479
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,158
imagine I ended up meeting um I got to

480
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,599
look up his name real quick because I

481
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:43,799

482
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:46,839

487

490
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,360
sent an email out to his guy I thought

491
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,840
it would be a good idea to offer corvan

492
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,079
Cooper especially if he had to gofund me

493
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:13,279
to promote him through hash Church to

494
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:15,639
raise some money for him to create a

495
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,079
little Nest Egg for him to for re-entry

496
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,840
because I'm not exactly sure of the

497
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:20,678
entire story and I don't want to share

498
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,798
it here anyway I want him to share it

499
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,880
when he finally comes on but that was

500
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,200
one of the things that Clubhouse sort of

501
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,760
exposed me to I also met a woman by the

502
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,080
name of Carrie who has a really powerful

503
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:35,038
story about you know birthing a child

504
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,639
while using cannabis as a medicine and

505
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,079
uh I think we're going to end up seeing

506
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,559
you know probably in the next two to

507
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:43,519
three weeks some fairly cool folks um

508
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:46,558
that are going to kind of come over from

509
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,599
Clubhouse so I'm I'm really hoping for

510
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,879
you know more diversity in just getting

511
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:52,678
some more females up here getting some

512
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,400
more black and brown people up here

513
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,240
getting some more Latinos up here just

514
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,120
getting some more diversity which I have

515
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,599
to admit there's a ton of it on

516
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,599
clubhouse

517
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,200

558
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:02,000
there um you know our plan is to do it

559
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:04,559
for an hour but um if it goes longer

560
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,558
then it goes

561
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,840
longer hey Alison do you know if you can

562
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:12,799
invite people on iPads with an email to

563
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:15,678
clubhouse you can I haven't figured out

564
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:19,158
how to do it but um I

565
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,759
did I just uh uploaded it on to when you

566
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:22,760
download on your iPhone or whatever it

567
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,720
automatically downloads it onto your

568
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:27,480
iPad then all you have to do is go put

569
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,240
in your phone number and it pops up and

570
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,798
I actually did it on my iPad so if you

571
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,278
don't have an iPhone you can do it on

572
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:36,480
iPad even if you don't have an iPhone

573
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:38,038
number an iOS number like you can use a

574
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,000
Samsung

575
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:43,599
number uh unsure it just ask for your

576
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,240
phone number that you registered with uh

577
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,678
on the club house so it makes me nervous

578
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,000
because invites are so rare I don't get

579
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,840
enough of them it's like and I've

580
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,558
already I think I pooched the first

581
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,558
three invites I got by a I somehow sent

582
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,158
Matt Stang one I just opened it up and

583
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:01,000
Matt's name was there and I clicked it

584
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,440
accidentally I was like [ __ ] oh my God

585
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,798
okay I did the same I did the same thing

586
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,840
we all did the yeah I've got 11 that

587
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:10,038
haven't been able to be open because

588
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,439
people either don't have access or they

589
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:15,240
don't have an iPhone so if you have an

590
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:19,240
iPad you can do it that way D I make

591
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:21,798
sure I ask each person I do too I ask

592
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,480
each person um I do I have like eight or

593
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:27,038
10 so if you need a couple of them for

594
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,360
people who have iPhones or iPads Marcus

595
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:32,558
I'm happy to like I

596
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:35,319
for sure Gavin um uh one of our

597
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:38,038
listeners here on hash Church hit me up

598
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:39,678
and um I hooked him up with an invite

599
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:41,519
well we're I'm gonna give all my invites

600
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,360
out to Hash church people and then I'm

601
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,119
also asking that they give their invites

602
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:49,319
out to Hash church people so that should

603
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:51,158
make it a solid 20 plus people and uh

604
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:53,439
it's it is a bit of a trust you got to

605
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,200
give your number and your name and that

606
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,759
I have to add the person to my contacts

607
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,759
I haven't been able to figure out how to

608
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,480
add someone to clubhouse without having

609
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:05,000
their phone number and their name in my

610
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,759
phone there is no other way you have to

611
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,278
a

612
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,919
text exactly so for those of you that

613
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:12,359
trust me no problem if you don't trust

614
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,200
having your number and name given to

615
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,519
someone who's a part of hash church and

616
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,679
you don't want that no problem we can

617
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:20,639
you know wait until I get more invites

618
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,200
and if you trust me I'll give you some

619
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,000
and if you trust the people on the panel

620
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm sure they'll link you up as well

621
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,679
believe me I'm not crank calling anyone

622
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,398
so I don't I think nowadays you can just

623
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,798
block people even on your phone so it

624
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:35,479
doesn't even matter if someone got your

625
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:38,359
phone number you you know I um I just

626
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,919
deleted it after I finished it because

627
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:42,398
it's just there's just you know I love

628
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,679
you Gavin if you're out there but you

629
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:45,879
know I don't really need your phone

630
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,798
number someone if if you know people

631
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,440
want to connect back again they can

632
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:53,558
always DM on Instagram I kind of like

633
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,558
that's how Clubhouse

634
00:25:54,278 --> 00:26:01,200
is yeah it Tri directly in your

635
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:03,959
Clubhouse uh in your bio it links your

636
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,720
Twitter and your Instagram so if people

637
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,880
like or interested then they can go in

638
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,919
and directly follow you on social media

639
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,600
and ping you that way as opposed to

640
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,559
there doesn't seem to be an instant

641
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,759
messenger on clubhouse which is kind of

642
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:19,158
cool because we can't always go behind

643
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:21,000
the scenes and see it's completely Rando

644
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:23,360
and live so you know that's kind of the

645
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,640
fun of it too and they uh the pain in

646
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,798
the ass sometimes when you're dealing

647
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,278
with people who aren't um very good at

648
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:32,359
communic ating their thoughts in a very

649
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:35,599
professional manner how's that for a

650
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:39,959
nice no that was really good T I agree

651
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:42,119
with you I do sometimes find um that

652
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,840
like certain people in a room will back

653
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:47,439
message me um especially if some shit's

654
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:52,038
going down there was some [ __ ] going

655
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:54,399
down in a room this week um with Brett

656
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:55,240
bog do you guys know Brett Bo you were

657
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:58,918
there

658
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:01,359
Marcus uh I leave quickly once Brett bog

659
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,440
enters the picture I just I've known him

660
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:06,398
for so long and he's just like and

661
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,519
listen I have a full appreciation for

662
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:13,599
off thewall crazy but when it just when

663
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:16,038
it goes beyond the wall I just uh I I

664
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,959
just I just remove myself rather than I

665
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:20,759
don't want to ruin anyone's good time on

666
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,960
clubhouse and I I can get into it like I

667
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:24,398
could easily get into it with Brett bog

668
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,399
and that it could be the whole

669
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,839
conversation that's focused and I don't

670
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:33,439
want to turn my Clubhouse erience into

671
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:35,720
that so you know I just leave I I um I

672
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,558
actually have blocked certain people

673
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,319
that create a negative experience for me

674
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:43,200
so that when I then I can see them when

675
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:46,278
I scroll down if they're in a room and I

676
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,200
can choose not to go in that room yeah

677
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:49,759
yeah that's that's exactly kind of the

678
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,960
way I've been playing it and there's I I

679
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:54,359
really only have the one person who who

680
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,519
who I feel that way otherwise the you

681
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,558
know Clubhouse has been amazing I also

682
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,720
find I should thank him in a sense

683
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,440
because he's literally in every cannabis

684
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,000
room every minute of every day like he's

685
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,240
not doing anything else I'm not sure

686
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,640
where he's raising these hundreds of

687
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,240
millions of dollars that he's talking

688
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,399
about but he's definitely sitting on his

689
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,519
ass on clubhouse a lot and so when I see

690
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:15,759
him in the room I choose to go somewhere

691
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,759
else and often he's in the main cannabis

692
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:21,038
room so I end up finding these really

693
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,720
random small rooms with magical people

694
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,519
and in that sense I should probably

695
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,519
thank him for

696
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,000
that some some people are just positive

697
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,919
examples of how you shouldn't

698
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,640
be yeah when I woke up this morning at

699
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,600
6:00 a.m I couldn't believe it I looked

700
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,120
at my phone I was like really where not

701
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:43,759
to go right it's almost important where

702
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,678
where to go you know I have to bring

703
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,798
this up Marcus because this was your

704
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,798
room and you had left the room at this

705
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:54,398
time right so it was like me and

706
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:57,278
Colin and I don't know if Johnny B was

707
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,879
still in the room at that point it was I

708
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:03,839
don't I don't know if you were in there

709
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:07,000
either Allison but um boy that woman got

710
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:10,359
really nasty with Colin for really no

711
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,519
reason at all and and like was saying

712
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:15,398
negative things that you know I think

713
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,278
from what I understand from followup

714
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:20,359
with Colin were're just completely off

715
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,679
base and so did you move her back down

716
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,599
to the audience so I tried to give her a

717
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,080
chance to like you know like I'm trying

718
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,439
to give everybody a voice and I knew

719
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:31,480
what she was saying was was she was

720
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,840
thinking I was someone else and she just

721
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,440
didn't her context was so off right and

722
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,079
we I just had to let her finish and then

723
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,000
I had to be like hey I just want to let

724
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:43,439
you know I'm not this

725
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,319
person you know that you think and you

726
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,440
know and then like she ended up getting

727
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,240
my number from a grower friend of ours

728
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,320
that used to work for me and he she was

729
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,839
like I'm so sorry I can't believe I did

730
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,839
that and like it's okay you know what I

731
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:58,240
mean it that's just human nature you're

732
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:01,000
gonna get information and wies get

733
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,798
crossed and you know we live in a world

734
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,679
of that right now of wires Crossing so I

735
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:10,119
try to be um accepting of that and know

736
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,080
that I'm not going to go below that

737
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:14,719
because it's just not necessary and I

738
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:17,839
think to Mark's point it was really out

739
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,779
of hand and I think someone did end up

740
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,558
removing the the woman from the room

741
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,960
[Laughter]

742
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,359
that but anyway that's that's the kind

743
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,200
of stuff I think um I mean it was

744
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,639
unproductive

745
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,640
she was yelling and talking just to hear

746
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:37,480
talk and everything was about negativity

747
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,399
about tearing Colin down and it's like

748
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,240
this isn't what this is about I mean I'm

749
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:46,119
new to this whole thing maybe I

750
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:49,359
shouldn't do this but Marcus bestowed a

751
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:52,000
uh a moderator on me and I just click on

752
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:55,199
it and it's like you know remove her

753
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,319
from room yes this is unproductive this

754
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,240
isn't what this is supposed to do us

755
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,638
wrong

756
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,558
everyone and then I don't know if you

757
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:07,479
recall the conversation leading up to

758
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:10,839
that Colin she was like oh why do I need

759
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,639
an hlc it's like what why do I need an

760
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:16,558
hlc are you kidding me you know what

761
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:19,079
really funny Colin the next night she

762
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,879
came into our room and I was talking

763
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:24,319
about what

764
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,200
hlc right and I was talking right about

765
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,200
my little extraction method to try to

766
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,080
break the Emulsion and you're like hey

767
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,798
Mark what' you do today at the lab okay

768
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,519
there's what I did at the lab today and

769
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:36,599
she was in there listening yeah but um

770
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:37,759
yeah that's just completely uncalled for

771
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,480
I mean

772
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,440
she so she thought you were somebody

773
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,919
else but even if you were that

774
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,919
individual yeah this isn't the venue to

775
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:48,919
tear somebody down you don't do that

776
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,919
right and she look she apologized she

777
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:52,639
wrote me messages and she even went into

778
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,000
another room and apologized in front of

779
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:56,599
swerve and everyone but again it's

780
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,798
you're I think you're right and it was

781
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:01,879
an honest mistake and

782
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:04,480
if it was really true then then fine but

783
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,679
it wasn't and and we move on and I'm

784
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,319
just we're just gonna move on and she's

785
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:10,720
not a bad woman that's what that's the

786
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:13,678
thing I think she she's very passionate

787
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,720
and I can I could feel that in in Mis

788
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,960
misinformation with along with passion

789
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,600
turns into confrontation right I mean it

790
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,159
just yeah can I like that she came back

791
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:26,319
around to you Colin and apologize that

792
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,799
means volumes um yeah she's nice about

793
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,879
it and you know look she's a great she's

794
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,000
actually a nice woman so I I I will say

795
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,360
that out loud to everyone she's really

796

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,599
you know she brought up some great

802
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,319
questions about hlc I thought I think

803
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,359
what we were trying to get after Mark in

804
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:56,798
the conversation was um and was I want

805
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:59,278
to turn this into a positive here is is

806
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,918
when's the right application for hlc

807
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:05,000
right and and can you get the same

808
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,799
service fast enough from another lab and

809
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,278
how does that move forward in terms of

810
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:12,000
of product development and the products

811
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:14,038
that you're making or Endor growing you

812
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,919
know and I thought you had a really good

813
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:20,119
explanation for that um you know Dr Mark

814
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:22,880
you you really you know broke it down so

815
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:25,278
so can I ask a question here um I've

816
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,080
always been uh I mean in my whenever I

817
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:31,919
tested Edibles or flour or concentrates

818
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:34,759
I always turn to an hplc over gas

819
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,960
chromatography um is there ever a time

820
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:40,158
when like you feel that you can get a

821
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,480
high standard of measurement from gas

822
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,679
chromatography yeah yeah you can get

823
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,839
actually a gas chromatography for the

824
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:50,960
canabo is actually more sensitive with a

825
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:53,439
mass spec detector than hlc can even

826
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,639
even dream to come so I mean the

827
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,240
sensitivity of the detector has a lot to

828
00:33:55,638 --> 00:34:02,158
do with how um how well the the method

829
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:05,319
works but I I think the the question was

830
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:09,519
is it's like it was more around do I

831
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:12,319
need internal testing when I'm spending

832
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:14,440
all of this money at the third party lab

833
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,960
and third party lab is giving me a

834
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,358
really good rate and they're giving me a

835
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,358
really good turnaround time so do I need

836
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:23,759
to have that capability inhouse and I

837
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:26,960
guess the question or the discussion

838
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,720
that we had with Colin was well if you

839
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,838
do if time is money and and I can

840
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,959
basically run like a distillation and

841
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:38,320
make a distillate or make a product and

842
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,639
then an hour later have the information

843
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,280
that would take a 48 turnaround time a

844
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,280
48 hour turnaround time at another lab

845
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,040
well then I'm going to get product out

846
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,879
the door quicker because I'm not waiting

847
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:52,480
that 48 hours and the other thing is

848
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,398
that like when you test stuff at

849
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,639
thirdparty Labs you have to use

850
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,960
thirdparty lab testing that's just kind

851
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,358
of like the validation that your stuff

852
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,280
is okay and safe and you're doing

853
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:06,400
testing at a lab that hopefully your

854
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,240
results agree with right and if your

855
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,039
results agree with that then you're

856
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,919
really confident when you send those

857
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:14,159
products out for your third-party

858
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,079
testing that you're going to hit exactly

859
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,960
where you think it's going to be if you

860
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,599
don't have that internal

861
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,358
testing it's like flying a plane with no

862
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:24,359
instruments the runway is there maybe

863
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:26,519
you're going to hit it maybe you're not

864
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:29,119
you know I don't know and to me time is

865
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:32,239
money if if we think that there's 62

866
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:35,039
milligrams per gram of total cannaboids

867
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,679
in that product thinking is not good

868
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,599
enough we need to actually measure it

869
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:40,879
and show that it's good enough and then

870
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,000
I don't mind spending that money at the

871
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,320
third party lab because I've already

872
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
tested it internally so that was the

873
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,880
nature of the discussion and she I think

874
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,679
she said that she came from Yukan

875
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,680
because she talked about working with

876
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,719
Tony at ukan and I I'm not sure exactly

877
00:35:54,679 --> 00:36:00,000
what facility she's at but I think that

878
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:03,039
again a lot of of facilities debate this

879
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,039
issue do I need internal analytics or

880
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,759
don't I and she was just in the camp

881
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,519
where I don't because I have a really

882
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,280
good relationship with my third party

883
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:14,000
lab and that's totally I guess you know

884
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,280
a valid thing to be I was in the other

885
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,559
camp but that's just for the you were in

886
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,079
the other camp the non-bankrupt camp is

887
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:23,239
that the camp you were in

888
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,119
Mark no but you bankrupt I just want to

889
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:26,679
make a point that that's not what got

890
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,800
her booted from the room which the

891
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:30,399
discussion back and forth with the hplc

892
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,200
that's where it started what got her

893
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,920
booted from the room was the fact that

894
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:37,199
she was really nasty to our friend and

895
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,920
our and the expert Colin and that's just

896
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,239
not going to be you know I think that's

897
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,400
part of the hash Church Brotherhood we

898
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:45,279
sort of have to look out for each other

899
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,000
Marcus you know I I could even tell you

900
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,079
that I've had people say negative things

901
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,800
about you to me and I'm like no sorry

902
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:56,599
that doesn't compute with me Marcus I

903
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,960
know Mar I even though we've never met

904
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:01,920
you know because we been connected on

905
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,800
hash Church all this time I feel like I

906
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,119
know you I feel like I know ATN ATN and

907
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,760
I have actually met we've had the luxury

908
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,720
of actually being at a Cannabis Cup

909
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,359
together but you know I think that we

910
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,318
have to kind of look out for each other

911
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:18,598
and so I think that a transition over to

912
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:21,400
clubhouse I think there there has to be

913
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:24,039
some kind of rules where again there's a

914
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,760
lot of negativity and a lot of nastiness

915
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:28,679
for no reason whatsoever other than

916
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,319
people have to feel like they have to

917
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:34,000
take somebody down and to me I'm just

918
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:35,838
not going to tolerate that and thank you

919
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,760
for making me a moderator there that I

920
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,920
could do something about it because our

921
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,200
friend was unfairly attacked in an

922
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,960
unfair way for no reason whatsoever and

923
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:48,039
that just goes to show that you know the

924
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,240
kind of people that we are we look out

925
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:52,679
for each other I think we should have a

926
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:54,358
bell on clubhouse where we ding a bell

927
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:57,239
when someone's going off and then it's

928
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:58,159
just like bong H time you know just a

929
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:00,879
little

930
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,679
readjust just a little readjust that's

931
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,960
all we might be able to come at this

932
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:07,199
from another

933
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:10,159
angle could even be a d420 k Bell it

934
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,598
could be like his voice going R Mother

935
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:14,480
Lover mother

936
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,119
lovers so I mean and Colin you're the

937
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,880
nicest guy in the world who can get mad

938
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,200
at you I mean they have to have a really

939
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,920
bad day to get mad at you Colin dude it

940
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:23,639
was just it was FAL and I don't want to

941
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,960
get into it anymore but I I will say it

942
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:28,279
did the same thing for Marcus you know

943
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,760
Alison you brought up Brett and I just

944
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,440
couldn't take it and he was talking

945
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,240
about Sam and Robert and all these

946
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,880
people that I feel just you can't you

947
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:42,039
you just gota you got to respect the

948
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,760
history and respect the groundw work and

949
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:46,000
it just didn't make any sense and I just

950
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,640
stuck to very simple things like hey man

951
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,559
if you have proof of this I'd love to

952
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:53,358
see it um but you know I just want to

953
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:55,159
keep this neutral these guys are mentors

954
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:56,598
and friends and people I look up to and

955
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:58,559
they want to make sure that what you're

956
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,960
saying because there's a lot of people

957
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:03,440
that don't know the history of this in

958
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,519
this room that you know I just said it

959
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,920
there's two sides to every story my man

960
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,400
and please make sure that what you're

961
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,838
saying is is number one not coming from

962
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:15,000
a negative place and number two has

963
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:17,159
truth to it yeah there was one guy who

964
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,000
popped in just because he saw the word

965
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:23,559
hash he had no concept that what we've

966
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,199
done here on hash Church like he he all

967
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:27,960
he knows is like hey man there's a room

968
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:30,039
talking about hash I'm going to get

969
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,079
myself in that room and he got in the

970
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:34,559
room and he talked and he was just so

971
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,599
funny because again had no concept of

972
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:40,559
who Marcus was no concept of Bubble Bags

973
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,039
all he knew is that he loves hash and it

974
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,759
brought him in the room you know and

975
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:46,838
that's cool you know that's we want to

976
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,160
talk to people who just love

977
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:50,960
hash and then that's how you educate

978
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:54,279
them about all the other things that

979
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:58,318
like we have experienced in our time

980
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:01,079
within the Cannabis community

981
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:03,759

982
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,359
I've not run it there's been very like I

983
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,960
can't even count like even on one hand

984
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:12,960
how many people that um have gone ay in

985
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,880
a room I find that most of the

986
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,199
moderators seem to handle it really well

987
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:21,358
and you know you can always put someone

988
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:24,960
down back down in the audience and then

989
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:28,078
kind of like address the situation in

990
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,599
Vivo and um and really kind of like

991
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,640
Smooth it out without having to engage

992
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:38,280
in like um a negative back and forth

993
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:39,960

1024
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,920
this uh lemon peel dog walker um

1025
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,920
90u from

1026
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,519
archive the dog walker so Marcus the

1027
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:15,358
bubble last time I had dog walker was

1028
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:18,440
the bubble man brand TP sauce that was

1029
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:20,558
made and that dog walker has always left

1030
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,000
a lasting impression on me from that

1031
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:26,000
batch that was done doger un variety

1032
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,800
does anyone know the the lineage behind

1033
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,960
dog walker I know it's like Walker from

1034
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:34,000
Oregon it's Albert Walker it's Albert I

1035
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,920
think Alber Walker by chem 91 I thought

1036
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,519
it was Albert Walker cross with dog

1037
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:44,119
[ __ ] probably not

1038
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:46,119
dog I thought it was chem 91 here it

1039
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:48,800
could that explain why it hits all my

1040
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:50,559
notes you know I know it's Albert Walker

1041
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,680
well let's figure out whether it's dog

1042
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,640
[ __ ] or Kem 91 that was another one Jeff

1043
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,679
always had access to he was always roing

1044
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:59,920
the Walker he was always rocking the

1045
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,960
hamster he was always rocking these like

1046
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,720
unique things from back in the day cat

1047
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,358
piss we had that up here

1048
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:11,039
too yeah reminds me of Sour Diesel a lot

1049
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:12,639
actually and you know if Jeff gets it

1050
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,920
then you know that Fletch is gonna get

1051
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:18,598
it it's kind of how that works or back

1052
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:22,358
and forth dog walker by chem

1053
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:25,680

1061
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,519
strain for sure depends on what kind of

1062
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:50,359
dog you have

the Trinity strain from 9s yeah I

1066
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,760
remember it I have a name Trinity so

1067
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:02,879
obviously I remember it I mean it was

1068
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:08,319
the what we used to get in Eugene was

1069
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:10,720
like a big Crystal Leaf wrapped Bud it

1070
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:12,800
wasn't like the traditional Bud that

1071
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:15,239
you'd see before it was like the leaves

1072
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,240
were left and they were just there was

1073
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:21,199
so much Crystal on it and then there was

1074
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:24,439
a variety called the White Witch which

1075
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,358
came into Eugene for a long time and

1076
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,720
that was hands down everyone's like if

1077
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:29,920
when the White Witch came to town

1078
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:32,799
everyone was just like oh [ __ ] you know

1079
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,240
we got to get some of that yeah Richard

1080
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:39,920
in the chat you are correct that's rich

1081
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:43,078
cromin who bred dog walker which is yes

1082
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,079
the Albert Walker cross with chem

1083
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,440
91 so

1084
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:51,039
yes Origins are you know are are in

1085
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:56,039
Oregon too as well with the Oregon the

1086
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:58,039
uh the dragon or the uh what is it

1087
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:00,519
the dog

1088
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:03,000
Bud which came that they were saying was

1089
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:06,159
crossed and to create the chem dog to

1090
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,440
begin with uh dogbud was that out of

1091
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:11,759
Oregon I mean those those cats were from

1092
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,800
Crest Deb Colorado but I thought that

1093
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,640
they had said that that lineage actually

1094
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:21,599
came from NorCal but that you know peab

1095
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:24,679
bud um well dog Bud which I guess again

1096
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:28,800
was the precursor in that lineage I

1097
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:31,318
think was out of crested but I

1098
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,480
I I think that's accurate from my my

1099
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:37,800
knowledge Dr Mark and it's fun you know

1100
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:40,240
a lot of those lot seeds you know I I

1101
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,400

00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:00,199
if anything comes of it but all that

1109

00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,119
of good things in the state and I can't

1143

see what they do because I know they

1146
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,720
Meg's awesome me Meg has just always

1147
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:35,279
been a leader in the industry and she

1148
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,159
just she's knows nonsense and everything

1149
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,079
she's done has been really really great

1150
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:42,879
I mean it you know I was so happy to

1151
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,880
see uh you know Greg L there because he

1152
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,000
definitely deserves a role in the

1153
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,400
industry so pabd I think is down in

1154
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:55,079
Florida now but we were talking about

1155
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,880
pabd because I guess right he's yeah

1156
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:58,680
what that guy that was in the room was

1157
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,000
talking about

1158
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:03,399
Mike the other day yeah he was actually

1159
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,800
a processor for for one plant he he was

1160
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,960
talking about how they were switching

1161
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,440
from because I've been watching their

1162
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,960
evolution I mean from they were first

1163
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,240
doing Greenhouse now they're back indoor

1164
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,318
I mean I can see why they're doing it

1165
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:15,239
from a commercial setting point of view

1166
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:17,719
it's just you know there's a lot more

1167
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:19,358
Security in in your environment down in

1168
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:21,679
that particular part of the world for

1169
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,880
green you know versus Greenhouse but I'm

1170
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:26,000
sure VPD must have been crazy to deal

1171
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,960
with down there you know like walking

1172
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,039
one day you're like my God it's like you

1173
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,519
know 90% humidity or whatever um but

1174
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:35,800
yeah they're doing a fantastic job I

1175
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,358
think he's you know he's really he's

1176
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,880
expanded a lot with him I thought I

1177
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:42,358
actually thought Greg was working with

1178
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,358
one plan as well I wasn't

1179

can't hear you I can actually picture

1195
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,519
exactly what he's doing in his house

1196
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:35,079
going from his chair over to where he

1197
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:39,679
keeps his computer like 12 15 feet

Sam and Clubhouse also would like to

1200
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:46,400
hear you like uh Dr Mark says your name

1201
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,079
definitely comes up a

1202
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,039
schwack and I think you'd probably spend

1203
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:53,798
o maybe the first 100 hours just sort of

1204
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:55,719
correcting what people are talking about

1205
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:59,880
in regards to breeding and what is the

1206
00:49:55,719 --> 00:50:01,318
land race what is a hybrid and and sort

1207
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,119
of all that stuff I don't pretend to

1208
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:04,880
know that information well enough so I

1209
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:09,440
just listen and

1210
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:11,920
cringe but I think man I got to the

1211
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,679
strands oh man that one that one was

1212
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,119
like

1213
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:16,639
prevalent that one I can swallow you

1214
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,599
know it's just like okay it's just a

1215
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:22,078
funny lingo or whatever but it does seem

1216
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:24,280
to connect with the not knowing and and

1217
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,720
the not knowing is the very thing that

1218
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,760
you're kind of trying to get out of when

1219
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:33,318
you're trying to learn right but but the

1220
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:39,160

about the ring of oil in the joint and

1228

1234
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,200
speaks my language 100% let's just say

1235
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:17,400
he has a level of awareness that we're

1236
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,358
looking

1237
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:23,680
for exactly yes for sure for sure yeah

1238
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:25,400
he's has a seat at this table for sure

1239
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,798
just from the knowledge he's dropping

1240
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,920
and he's correcting people properly and

1241
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:32,759
you know it's it's good to hear I was

1242
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,760
having a conversation about Wade the

1243
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,400
other day and maybe you could make sure

1244
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,599
that I was saying the right thing and it

1245
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,960
was about maybe it wasn't I don't forget

1246
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:44,880
maybe it was on tar live but um uh it

1247
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,760
was about when you discovered the

1248
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,160
Harlequin and were you I just I guess

1249
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,200
I'll just ask the question just in case

1250
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:53,719
anyone hasn't H it were you grounding

1251
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:57,639
pots when you found the harleyquinn or

1252
00:51:53,719 --> 00:52:00,000
the high CBD were they THC for ities and

1253
00:51:57,639 --> 00:52:03,358
what lab were you using at the

1254
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,880
time um yeah you didn't have that quite

1255
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:09,558
right uh yes I was grounding pots at

1256
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:13,119
that point it was an experiment that I

1257
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:14,798
was trying because um I was doing

1258
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,119
everything indoors in those days and

1259
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,199
yeah I had just sprouted the seeds that

1260
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,358
came from

1261
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:23,118
Switzerland uh but I was sitting in the

1262
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:25,880
flowering room and I meditating about

1263
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:28,798
what was going on why I could feel that

1264
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:31,760
the plants were not all the way there to

1265
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:33,159
happy and so I just said you know I ran

1266
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,280
down the list of all the things I was

1267
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:36,679
doing to make sure everything was

1268
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,519
perfect for the plants that I was

1269
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:41,118
growing at that point and what I heard

1270
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:44,159
was that they were

1271
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,838
lonely and I couldn't quite grock what

1272
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,399
that was about until I realized that

1273
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:51,159
plants evolved in the Earth and the

1274
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,798
Earth has a natural frequency of its own

1275
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:59,318
uh I think it's six or seven Hertz and

1276
00:52:54,798 --> 00:53:01,199
um and so I uh yeah I figured out a way

1277
00:52:59,318 --> 00:53:04,719
by putting a grounding bar on a copper

1278
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:09,318
pipe in the in the grow room and ran

1279
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:13,318
some uh I think it was 103 RX uh so I

1280
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:15,679
had four fat number 10 wires uh I hooked

1281
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:17,558
one end of each of those wires up to the

1282
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:20,000
copper water pipe that went to ground

1283
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:24,200
because I put it in myself and then the

1284
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:27,318
other end of it I stuck into four plants

1285
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:29,960
and those four plants at that point yeah

1286
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:33,279
what ended up being named harleyquin was

1287
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:36,159
uh those four plants and I had I had

1288
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,079
seven total that I had grown out it was

1289
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,759
the second batch of cuts I'd taken from

1290
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:44,039
the original seedling that I was so

1291
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:47,559
interested in and um and the grounded

1292
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:49,239
plants grew so dramatically quicker I

1293
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:51,200
mean one of the first things I noticed

1294
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:54,118
in addition to how much taller they were

1295
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:56,000
than their three sisters was when they

1296
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:56,960
started setting flowers I was used to

1297
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,960
seeing

1298
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,240
flowers about two weeks

1299
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,039
into their flowering cycle that were

1300
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,919
about the size of a pencil eraser and

1301
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:09,798
this is on things like Bubba cush or um

1302
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,798
grape AP that I was growing in those

1303
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:16,199
days and

1304
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:17,599
um the ones that were hooked the the

1305
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:22,519
three plants that weren't hooked to

1306
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:24,720
ground the flowers at um two weeks were

1307
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:27,480
more about the size of my little

1308
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:30,919
fingernail as versus a pencil

1309
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,039
eraser and the ones that were on ground

1310
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,480
that were hooked up to ground were

1311
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:38,358
already starting to be changing colors

1312
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,880
they weren't just green all of a sudden

1313
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:42,000
uh like everything else in the room that

1314
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:45,000
was green uh they were starting to show

1315
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,239
other colors and the flowers at two

1316
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,000
weeks were as big as my index fingernail

1317
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:53,358
so the the it it kind of blew my mind

1318
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:58,199
what was happening with that and part of

1319
00:54:53,358 --> 00:55:03,078
why um part of why was so memorable is

1320
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:08,000
uh at this time um Nico Escondido was in

1321
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:10,760
San Francisco H at a trade show and

1322
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,440
um one of the people I did business with

1323
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:15,880
had asked me for some flowers to give

1324
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,318
out at the show uh for folks who were

1325
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,838
coming in from out of town and niik

1326
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:21,880
ended up with a handful of those flowers

1327
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:24,239
and we had a label in those days and

1328
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,519
nice little package and uh so he was

1329
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:30,000
interested and wanted to see what was

1330
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:32,440
going on when he came over to the shop

1331
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,079
um one of the first questions he asked

1332
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,760
me once we were in the flowering room

1333
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:38,519
was what the hell is up with these wires

1334
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:41,359
going over here to the plants and so I

1335
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:43,358
explained to him what was going on and

1336
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:46,119
yeah by the time those four plants

1337
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:50,358
finished flowering they were the the

1338
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:56,440
colas on them were as big as my calf I

1339
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:56,440
mean they were just huge and uh the th

1340
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,079
Wade you just got muted on accident oh

1341
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:04,559
sorry and sorry for the long story

1342
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:07,839
fellas but um no take your time this may

1343
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:11,000
be the most important story on hash

1344
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:13,679
church I doubt that but it's a

1345
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,480
fascinating story and part of why I love

1346
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:19,399
the story is it's how I learn it's you

1347
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,400
know you you you think of things that

1348
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,039
might be going on with your plants or

1349
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,318
your growing situation or your

1350
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:28,160
extraction process whatever and then you

1351
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:31,000
set up a little experiment to try and

1352
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:33,719
verify what's going on if this idea is

1353
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,599
real and yeah the grounding thing was uh

1354
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:39,719
impressive enough to uh Nico that about

1355
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:43,640
six months after he was in my flowering

1356
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:45,318
room there was a company uh selling a

1357
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:48,759
product in High Times it was one of

1358
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:50,719
their products hot new products thing

1359
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,799
that was a little white box you could

1360
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:55,719
plug into the wall in your house and it

1361
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:57,358
had four little wires you plugged into

1362
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:59,519
the White box and a little red light

1363
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:01,159
that came on that said you had ground

1364
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:03,880
and yeah then you had some wires that

1365
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:05,440
you could plug into your plants but

1366
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,200
what's true is yeah I'm utterly

1367
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,318
convinced that if you have all of the

1368
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:13,279
things in your room dialed in in terms

1369
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:15,880
of environment temperature uh the

1370
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,880
quality of your water the the diversity

1371
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,559
in your soil um all of those things are

1372
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,920
sorted out you've got the right lighting

1373
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:26,240
everything else if you then provide

1374
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,798
ground to just a few of those plants I

1375
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:30,639
think you'll be astounded at the

1376
00:57:27,798 --> 00:57:33,038
difference because plants evolved in the

1377
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:36,719
earth and this is you know Sam has

1378
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:39,559
talked about how important genetics are

1379
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:41,879
in how well plants do in the environment

1380
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:43,559
that they are growing in and if you're

1381
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,000
working indoors you can shape that

1382
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:47,079
environment if you're in a greenhouse

1383
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
you can shape it to some extent but if

1384
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:51,240
you're outdoors in the Sun and in the

1385
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,519
earth you really need to look for and

1386
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:55,519
find the genetics that work in the spot

1387
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,798
you're in if you're going to see the

1388
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:00,239
best results of what the cannabis

1389
00:57:57,798 --> 00:58:01,440
genetics can provide for you in terms of

1390
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:04,358
cannabis

1391
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,039
chemistry thank you so for that that is

1392
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:08,279
so beautiful also what about the the

1393
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:10,039
testing component I I may have had that

1394
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,240
part wrong so please and I was say I

1395
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:14,359
think I saying as I was saying it that I

1396
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,959
may not have it right so I'm I really

1397
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:19,000
wanted to clarify so thank you well in

1398
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:22,119
those in those in that batch of seeds

1399
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,079
that we got from Switzerland um there

1400
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:26,720
were at least two different phenotypes

1401
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,960
in the things we sprouted and and again

1402
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:31,838
Harlequin really stood out it was one of

1403
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,798
the phenotypes uh and it was one of the

1404
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:36,920
SE just one seed uh but it was so

1405
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:39,280
different than the other phenotypes that

1406
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:42,960
I was looking at that I kind of went

1407
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:47,000
crazy um follow your passion is the

1408
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:49,599
message there um but the other phenotype

1409
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,199
that we tested the one that was worthy

1410
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,640
of growing out because in an indoor

1411
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:56,318
environment we had Fairly limited space

1412
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:57,798
and had to be fairly selective about

1413
00:58:56,318 --> 00:58:59,558
eliminating things that we weren't that

1414
00:58:57,798 --> 00:59:04,838
interested in the other phenotype that

1415
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:06,319
we tested was a high THC variety um and

1416
00:59:04,838 --> 00:59:10,199
uh the testing that we were doing at

1417
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:12,358
that point uh uh harbor side was one of

1418
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:16,798
the vendors that I was uh that our

1419
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:20,838
product was going to and um and they had

1420
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:23,358
just opened up Steep Hill labs and so

1421
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:24,759
yeah I went in and um talked to them

1422
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:27,038
about it and because I was a vendor they

1423
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:29,079
were willing to do it they hadn't

1424
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:33,559
started testing all their flowers at

1425
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:38,318
this point um and yeah they uh I think

1426
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:40,079
it was $100 a pop for canono and uh so

1427
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,719
that's how I knew the one was high THC

1428
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,640
and then the other one like I said it

1429
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:46,558
came back it was uh I think it was 8 and

1430
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:50,838
a half%

1431
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:56,039
CBD and 5 and a half% THC at eight weeks

1432
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:59,400
of flow and um and yeah they were pretty

1433
00:59:56,039 --> 01:00:02,960
excited they pointed me towards uh Fred

1434
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,720
Gardner uh the publisher of oanes and uh

1435
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,559
I spent some time learning a little bit

1436
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:10,838
more about him before I gave him a call

1437
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:13,039
and um out of meeting him and a couple

1438
01:00:10,838 --> 01:00:15,358
of other people who had found some CBD

1439
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:19,599
cultivars uh we started what's now known

1440
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:22,199
as project CBD and it was uh quite a

1441
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:25,079
project sorting out what were we going

1442
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:27,118
to do with these plants because one of

1443
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:30,000
the folks that

1444
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:32,798
um had this High CBD thing going on was

1445
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,599
me and I was already giving it away fast

1446
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:36,639
and furious because I was learning more

1447
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:40,039
and more about what CBD could do for

1448
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:43,719
folks uh one of the other people was

1449
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:46,400
kind of I don't know maybe we should

1450
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:49,598

1513
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:44,799
alive also we grew um the harus that we

1514
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:47,358
grew this year were just twice the size

1515
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:50,440
of everything else in the greenhouse and

1516
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:51,679
um really large large style buds I just

1517
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,039
want to point out I think it's really

1518
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:57,278
phenomenal that you were on your second

1519
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:59,079
cloning uh grow when you've then

1520
01:03:57,278 --> 01:04:00,400
grounded it and it really changed the

1521
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:01,680
plant I think that's just a really

1522
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,440
important teaching and a really

1523
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:05,960
beautiful teaching on how you can affect

1524
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:08,679
your plant was such a simple you know

1525
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:10,440
action and anyone could plug a wire into

1526
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:12,879
a ground and make that happen and I

1527
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:16,559
think that's really great but yeah the

1528
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:20,160
um CBD also with the CBD we were in

1529
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:22,000

01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:36,759
morning good morning lovely

1536
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,960
dear super quick story again about CBD

1537
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:40,799
we could move on whenever but we were in

1538
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,838
Colorado um you know I don't know five

1539
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:48,119
or six years ago and visiting uh uh

1540
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:52,358
Centennial seeds and uh the the CBD Seed

1541
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:55,358
Company out in Denver and uh is it Ben

1542
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:57,598
Ben yeah um and he was he had a GL uh

1543
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:59,358
gas chromatography machine like in his

1544
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,240
warehouse and in his Grill along with

1545
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:02,679
record players which I I like the record

1546
01:05:01,239 --> 01:05:05,159
players so I think the vinyl is an

1547
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:07,719
important component and that's probably

1548
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:10,358
the synthesizers too Colin if we're real

1549
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:12,038
but um anyway eight years ago but it was

1550
01:05:10,358 --> 01:05:14,679
a long time ago was in the beginning of

1551
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:16,599
the whole entire you know uh movement in

1552
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:18,679
Colorado was CBD and it was really cool

1553
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:20,000
to go through his and it was just what

1554
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:21,558
you were talking about you know he was

1555
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,119
able to look at all of his plants

1556
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:26,278
through his own home gas chromatography

1557
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:28,480
canabo machine and he was keeping all of

1558
01:05:26,278 --> 01:05:30,400
his own notes and he was really

1559
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,880
progressing at the time and it was

1560
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:36,240
really cool to see um you know to see it

1561
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,798
go from sort of what Wade and Ringo and

1562
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,519
and the the families out in California

1563
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:42,038
were doing to then like to a more

1564
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:44,358
commercial scale out in in Colorado and

1565
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:46,160
then come back now to Oregon and see

1566
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:48,239
what Oregon's done with it is just

1567
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:50,719
pretty amazing and Ben is sort of like

1568
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:53,519
one of the unsung heroes just like bod

1569
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:55,679
out there in Colorado as well you know

1570
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:58,880
those guys were searching for CBD and

1571
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:01,038
hemp well long before it was even sort

1572
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:04,119
of the in thing to talk about and to go

1573
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:06,440
into Ben's laboratory is like hilarious

1574
01:06:04,119 --> 01:06:10,720
he's got like his gas chromatography in

1575
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:13,079
the corner and then stacks of Records

1576
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:15,519
like more records than you've ever seen

1577
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:18,760
in your entire life and he just sits in

1578
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:21,000
there and just runs sample after sample

1579
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,400
after sample you with the storefront in

1580
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,159
front of it you know where he can sell

1581
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,000
his seeds it's it's sweet it was I don't

1582
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:28,679
know where he's at I don't know at the

1583
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,318
moment because we haven't been there but

1584
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:34,480
I I have I have a question in this story

1585
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:36,159
and I've been asked this question before

1586
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,838
and Wade maybe you could give me some

1587
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:41,558
color or you know certainly anybody on

1588
01:06:38,838 --> 01:06:44,119
the panel that knows how does how

1589
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:47,640
exactly does the Stanley Brothers

1590
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:50,039
Charlotte Web Charlotte's Web fit into

1591
01:06:47,639 --> 01:06:52,278
that lineage or does it not fit into the

1592
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:56,640
lineage or was that something completely

1593
01:06:52,278 --> 01:07:00,440
different or completely different yeah

1594
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:02,358
if I remember wasn't it the R4 cut guys

1595
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:05,440
the same time that's when uh even up

1596
01:07:02,358 --> 01:07:07,440
here in in VC when we tested a sample

1597
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,720
that was named Haley's Comet that came

1598
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:14,079
from Franklin from n Nimo it was like

1599
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:16,000
133% CBD 5% THC it was that two to one

1600
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,760
same kind of like it was all around that

1601
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,358
same time as a Harley Quinn as the

1602
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,200
Stanley Brothers came out with Charlotte

1603
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:24,400
SB and there's that big craze I think uh

1604
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:26,118
Haley's comment was around 2008 though

1605
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,000
one was Harley Quinn qu

1606
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:30,278
what year was that about 2008 as well

1607
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,358
yeah but remember that was around the

1608
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:34,199
same time because I mean and same with

1609
01:07:32,358 --> 01:07:36,318
Charlotte SW wasn't around that same

1610
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:40,038
time

1611
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:42,000
too and also the canonic and and SP it's

1612
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:44,559
important to note that Spain was doing a

1613
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,559
lot of work as well at the time and

1614
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,079
still does so big shout out we've met a

1615
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,119
lot of those breeders at Emerald cup

1616
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:52,519
over the years and if they're listening

1617
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:54,358
we appreciate you so how about a shout

1618
01:07:52,519 --> 01:07:56,719
out to skunkman Sam who might have been

1619
01:07:54,358 --> 01:07:59,078
doing his work 20 years prior to anyone

1620
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:02,000
we just mentioned

1621
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:04,599
yeah uh and also Shanti with the CBD

1622
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,838
crew what's the I don't know much about

1623
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:09,760
what when they started does anyone know

1624
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:11,679
what what the story with that is uh back

1625
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:16,640
in

1626
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:19,960
2013 I think it was in the spring I got

1627
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,960
uh a handful of seeds about seven

1628
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:27,119
different packets that ended up coming

1629
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:29,520
from Jamie at rosin seeds which is the

1630
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:30,920
Spanish I'm not sure about the corporate

1631
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,759
structure there but it's my

1632
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:36,079
understanding haime sorry I've never met

1633
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:38,798
the man nor spoken to him in person but

1634
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:40,759
uh oh you'd like yeah I got it yeah I've

1635
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:44,000
been told that uh but meantime yeah I

1636
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:47,560
was asked to beta test uh a bunch of

1637
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:51,920
seeds and there were seven different

1638
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:55,640
things there and uh one of those uh

1639
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:58,679
today uh I Learned was named medy haes

1640
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:00,480
and there was a cut a specific version

1641
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:02,759
of one of those medy Haze seeds that

1642
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:05,479
caught my eye just like harleyquin we

1643
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:08,560
made cuts of that and got it out here in

1644
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:11,198
Northern California and um I always

1645
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:13,400
point to CBD crew as the source of those

1646
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:16,399
seeds uh but part of why I wanted to

1647
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:17,519
mention Med specifically is Forest and

1648
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,479
his son

1649
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:23,480
Silas um who was on hash church with us

1650
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:26,718
at one point um they're still struggling

1651
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:29,439
with epilepsy and uh

1652
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:31,399
uh Forest has really had to withdraw

1653
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:33,919
from his cannabis advocacy trying to

1654
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:36,519
keep Silas alive is really what it boils

1655
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:40,279
down to uh but medy Hayes was the

1656
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:44,040
cultivar the specific cultivar from uh

1657
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:47,080
haime and uh the folks in Spain that

1658
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:50,560
gave that Silas went from having a

1659
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:53,119
hundred seizures a day over a period of

1660
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,560
months and they were going back and

1661
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:59,519
forth on trying to keep him alive

1662
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:02,039
basically and he got some medy hazee oil

1663
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:04,760
on a Friday night didn't have any

1664
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:08,519
seizures Friday night and then as they

1665
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:10,640
kept giving him U this oil he went four

1666
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:13,480
months before he had another

1667
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:16,880
seizure it was insane the change what's

1668
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:20,959
the ratio of canids in that again

1669
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:22,840
similar to harleyquinn uh different tpes

1670
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,719
uh and probably different conoids but it

1671
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:28,800
was a it's a two to one as well so

1672
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:30,560
another two to one yeah now the the two

1673
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,920
to one I mean way do you think that

1674
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,199
there's something to that I mean oh I'm

1675
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:37,600
utterly convinced yes right it's why

1676
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:39,439
hemp is not the answer I I'm sorry you

1677
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,640
know I love hemp it's the Cannabis plan

1678
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:43,879
it's the same thing but I think the real

1679
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:45,119
magic at least in my experience working

1680
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,119
with the people I've worked with over

1681
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:51,559
the years the real magic happens when

1682
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:53,800
you've got CBD and THC and a bunch of

1683
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:56,280
the other canono all together there's

1684
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:59,320
that Ensemble thing it's a real

1685
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:01,359
phenomenon in patient experience that's

1686
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:05,359
what I've seen again and again just to

1687
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:07,920
be clear it's to CBD for every one THC

1688
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:10,359
right well Harlequin and medy Hayes were

1689
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,480
both that what you just said like some

1690
01:11:10,359 --> 01:11:14,559
people say Harlequin can be a three to

1691
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:16,678
one and I think that depends on when

1692
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,560
it's harvested yeah I think there's a

1693
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:22,399
change that happens in ratio depending

1694
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:25,360
on harvest date these cultivars but uh

1695
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:26,639
I'm I'm pretty convinced that more

1696
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:29,719
important than the

1697
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,560
ratio uh in terms of what benefit is

1698
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:35,439
happening for a person is it really has

1699
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:38,280
to do with how much THC can a person

1700
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:42,000
tolerate in terms of using a cannabis

1701
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:44,679
product over a period of time if they

1702
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,679
enjoy THC then they might want something

1703
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:50,158
that has more THC than CBD but I'm

1704
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,279
pretty convinced that the best benefit

1705
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:53,920
in terms of your health and your

1706
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:56,639
well-being and your feeling good is

1707
01:11:53,920 --> 01:12:01,000
going to have some CB BD mixed into the

1708
01:11:56,639 --> 01:12:03,679
THC sorry Sam but feel that strong

1709
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,319
that's one thing I recommend to a lot of

1710
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:09,000
my uh cancer patients and my business

1711
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:12,039
partner he actually had cancer and I put

1712
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,279
him on that regimen and it it it got rid

1713
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:16,359
of his cancer along with conventional

1714
01:12:14,279 --> 01:12:18,319
treatments so and I just want to also

1715
01:12:16,359 --> 01:12:21,719
clarify is you're going to be hard Fel

1716
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:23,679
to find any CBD prior to 2008 in the

1717
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:26,198
United States domestically because it

1718
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:29,840
wasn't until we started testing then in

1719
01:12:26,198 --> 01:12:31,678
2007 and 2008 for THC that we found that

1720
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:34,319
secondary Spike that we were like what

1721
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:37,158
the [ __ ] is this and we were able to uh

1722
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:38,599
find that in mulan's uh now I know of

1723
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:40,279
course Sam has been doing this for a

1724
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,880
long time but you know I was part of

1725
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:44,000
that team here in America that we

1726
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:46,079
actually trying to test that so that's

1727
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,238
when those secondary spikes were mostly

1728
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,479
found so most of your CBD is from 2008

1729
01:12:49,238 --> 01:12:54,718
forward domestically that I'm aware of

1730
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:57,158
yeah I'm I'm gonna add something I want

1731
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,920
to add something really quick so this is

1732
01:12:57,158 --> 01:13:01,839
what we see in our office we work with a

1733
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:06,600
lot of oncology patients and the ones

1734
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:09,679
who are using um CBD with THC tend to

1735
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:13,159
have better results than those who are

1736
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:17,119
just using like something from WR Aid

1737
01:13:13,158 --> 01:13:18,879
that's a hemp derived CBD um and uh you

1738
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:21,559
know I I I would love to hear more what

1739
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,359
Sam has to say um about that but that's

1740
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,880
just what we

1741
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:29,399
see well

1742
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,400
I can you hear me

1743
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:36,520
now absolutely yes sir yes sir Charlie

1744
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:41,159
okay okay well I just wanted to say that

1745
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:42,679
we started our CBD work in the uh mid

1746
01:13:41,158 --> 01:13:47,638
and late

1747
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:49,880
80s that's when we started and we had uh

1748
01:13:47,639 --> 01:13:55,600
CBD plant by

1749
01:13:49,880 --> 01:14:01,440
1990 that was about 10% CBD with uh less

1750
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:04,960
than uh uh 3% uh THC so we we were

1751
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:07,678
focused on a CBD only plant and that's

1752
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:12,639
what we came up with it's it's hard to

1753
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:17,199
get a high CBD only plant because the

1754
01:14:12,639 --> 01:14:21,520
CBD synthese itself produces THC even if

1755
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:25,960
you have no THC synthes in your plant so

1756
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:30,040
uh it's it's extremely difficult and uh

1757
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:34,198
the the bottom line is we started in the

1758
01:14:30,039 --> 01:14:38,519
late 80s and uh we told Fred Gardner

1759
01:14:34,198 --> 01:14:41,238
about our work and uh that that helped

1760
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:46,800
kick off the whole

1761
01:14:41,238 --> 01:14:51,439
uh uh CBD uh quest uh because they heard

1762
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:54,279
it existed we told them we had it uh but

1763
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:56,839
uh we we licensed it to a pharmaceutical

1764
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:59,279
company to pay for our research and

1765
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:04,760
development and

1766
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:06,840
uh yeah I I I I think CBD is amazing and

1767
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:09,719
all the time people are making fun of me

1768
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:12,560
because I say I don't like it you know

1769
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:15,079
it's has it because I don't need it for

1770
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:17,840
medical benefit if I needed it for

1771
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:21,920
medical benefit uh I would like it and

1772
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:24,159
we did stick our necks out on the limb

1773
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:28,000
uh you know in the late 80s and

1774
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:31,079
developed a CBD only variety and we were

1775
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,760
able to do that with uh gas

1776
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:37,359
chromatography and highpressure liquid

1777
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:40,239
chromatography and uh oh I I want to say

1778
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:43,880
something else too Dr Allison asked what

1779
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:47,319
is the GC useful for well another thing

1780
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:52,480
no the CB no I I meant like hemp derived

1781
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:55,359
um CBD versus cannabis derived um CBD no

1782
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:57,879
I was talking you asked about a DC

1783
01:15:55,359 --> 01:16:03,238
chromatography what was it useful

1784
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:05,480
for oh yes sir yes sir okay and uh

1785
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:07,879
they're very useful for determining

1786
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:12,559
turpins we always use

1787
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:14,760
GCF for the last uh 30 years and uh that

1788
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:17,280
was a state-of-the-art maybe there's

1789
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:21,760
some more sophisticated ones that I'm

1790
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:26,920
not as aware of today but uh GCF for

1791
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:26,920
turfing is is the answer

1792
01:16:27,079 --> 01:16:33,639
quick question Sam from hermesa

1793
01:16:30,279 --> 01:16:36,719
ucin um you had hplc and analytical

1794
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:43,319
standards for THC and CBD by

1795
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:43,319
1990 oh earlier yes and how did you do

1796
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:50,880
that well first of all the only canono

1797
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:55,238
that's controlled in the Netherlands

1798
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:58,880
which we didn't possess until uh the

1799
01:16:55,238 --> 01:17:02,279
very early 90s when we were licensed but

1800
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:06,319
the only canbids that are controlled is

1801
01:17:02,279 --> 01:17:08,960
uh delta9 and Delta 8 all the other

1802
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:11,279
canono are not controlled in the

1803
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:14,399
Netherlands if you can find them or

1804
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:16,119
isolate them yourself or whatever did

1805
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:19,158
you get testing standards like from

1806
01:17:16,119 --> 01:17:22,000
segra and stuff like that absolutely but

1807
01:17:19,158 --> 01:17:25,638
we we made uh ones ourselves that were

1808
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,920
actually purer and better than segra or

1809
01:17:25,639 --> 01:17:30,199
yeah that what we did we had to bring in

1810
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,679
you know Dr hosom to actually make the

1811
01:17:30,198 --> 01:17:34,919
solution since he was making the

1812
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:37,000
solutions for the Dutch it was easy for

1813
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:39,079
him to once we had him in a lab here

1814
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,760
domestically then he was actually able

1815
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:44,238
to do gas chromatograph and uvh PLC so

1816
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:46,520
that we had both online to actually

1817
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:49,559
quantify just again just

1818
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:54,000
THC yeah well the our problem was when

1819
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:57,440
we got segra standards uh one of the

1820
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:01,840
first sources we got uh when we they

1821
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:05,000
said they were 98% pure when we tested

1822
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:09,319
them they were 86% pure

1823
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:12,238
THC so uh you know if you have numbers

1824
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:14,639
that screwed up from the beginning all

1825
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:17,319
of your work will be screwed up because

1826
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:19,560
it's built on that

1827
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:22,840
Foundation right that screws your ring

1828
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:26,120
testing in every way shape or form Yes

1829
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:29,840
except for I was doing ring testing with

1830
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:32,920
Dr El solle and Bren Eisen in

1831
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:35,719
Switzerland and uh the three of us were

1832
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:38,600
getting identical results I knew we were

1833
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:38,600
doing something

1834
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:43,678
right that's how we do it ladies and

1835
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:49,880
gentlemen um wait I wanted to just back

1836
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:51,599
up really quick um and just talk about

1837
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:55,079
how you're really finding you know those

1838
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:58,679
oneto ones or you know where THC is

1839
01:18:55,079 --> 01:19:01,000
heavily present as well I feel like um

1840
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:05,239
you know we've been treating patients

1841
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:07,920
for 25 years and as the information you

1842
01:19:05,238 --> 01:19:10,599
know comes to light there was a lot more

1843
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:12,920
THC we didn't have testing back at that

1844
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:15,920
time but we were using a lot of old

1845
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:19,279
varietals so my guess is that there was

1846
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:22,199
a lot of CBD in those sort of land

1847
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:25,000
Rish varietals that we had at those

1848
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:28,198
times and I noticed that when we were

1849
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,760
making medicine say like in the early

1850
01:19:28,198 --> 01:19:34,960
90s the late 80s um it seemed like it

1851
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:37,920
was helping people more more quickly and

1852
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,198
then as the varial started to change

1853
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,840
they were becoming more hybridized more

1854
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:45,439
higher THC the same medicine that we

1855
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:49,000
were making I was finding that we were

1856
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:51,719
needing more like heroic doses of it to

1857
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,198
where people were really sort of like

1858
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:57,198
you know out they were only waking up to

1859
01:19:54,198 --> 01:20:00,519
to go to shower to eat to go to the

1860
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:02,919
bathroom it was healing them but they

1861
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:07,320
weren't having you know they were just

1862
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:09,119
having to take more and as we started to

1863
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:13,158
then get in more of the varietals of the

1864
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:15,039
Ono one I was seeing that healing again

1865
01:20:13,158 --> 01:20:18,920
with the same medicine that we were

1866
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:21,000
making except even more exorbitant and

1867
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:24,480
the patients were having to use even

1868
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,920
less and now the next step to that is

1869
01:20:24,479 --> 01:20:30,839
and I just wanted to introduce here is

1870
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:34,158
utilizing hemp but at super high

1871
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:36,800
concentrations as a whole plant medicine

1872
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:41,079
so that you're getting much higher THC

1873
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:43,600
levels along with much higher CBD levels

1874
01:20:41,079 --> 01:20:47,840
we're really noticing that that also

1875
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:50,039
seems to be a real magic key and when

1876
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,960
I'm saying like whole plant

1877
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:57,079
extraction you know we're using maybe

1878
01:20:52,960 --> 01:21:01,760
like you know uh hemp that's you know

1879
01:20:57,079 --> 01:21:04,519
23% to maybe a06 or something like that

1880
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:06,679
um is is about the numbers and average

1881
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:11,000
of what we're getting we're adding about

1882
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:13,840
two pounds of really intense flour into

1883
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,560
an oil so it's a super concentrate so

1884
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:18,279
the THC levels are much higher and I

1885
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,360
feel like even with that progression

1886
01:21:18,279 --> 01:21:23,399
we're noticing that you're having to

1887
01:21:20,359 --> 01:21:25,158
take me even less of that medicine to

1888
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:28,439
get to the same result

1889
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:32,359
this is totally ongoing observation it's

1890
01:21:28,439 --> 01:21:34,519
a lifelong experiment of of medicine but

1891
01:21:32,359 --> 01:21:36,039
also as much as we're talking about

1892
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:38,840
compounding

1893
01:21:36,039 --> 01:21:41,479
cannabinoids also compounding plant

1894
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:44,719
medicine with cannabis I feel like is

1895
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:47,879
equally as important as compounding all

1896
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:50,198
of the cannabinoids for the medicine so

1897
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:53,920
sorry I went off on a rant on that but

1898
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:56,119
like mushrooms and like kavak Cava and I

1899
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,039
could go on on and on and different

1900
01:21:56,119 --> 01:22:01,039
types of Chinese herbs and roots and

1901
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:04,519
Josh said a stralis you know I could go

1902
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:07,319
on and on with important compounding and

1903
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:09,760
looking at different symptoms like CBD

1904
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:12,920
and THC are wonderful symptomatic

1905
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:14,960
healers and they can be total curatives

1906
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:17,920
but when we add different compounds of

1907
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:20,439
other types of medicines and we bring in

1908
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:22,639
other plant intelligence into it then

1909
01:22:20,439 --> 01:22:25,599
we're compounding the cannabinoids the

1910
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:28,719
Tarpin and all of the other alkaloids

1911
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:30,679
and other plant compounds that um you

1912
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:33,239
know can go hand inand sorry for the

1913
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:33,239
long wind

1914
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:39,000
there uh

1915
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:43,079
well I would say Sam would probably have

1916
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:46,359
a better uh opinion on what sort of

1917
01:22:43,079 --> 01:22:49,639
canono were in the early land races that

1918
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:51,920
came to North America um but I I

1919
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:54,119
remember reading at one point some

1920
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:56,119
information from the drug enforcement

1921
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:59,399
administ Administration where they were

1922
01:22:56,119 --> 01:23:01,238
running analytical testing for canono on

1923
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:03,879
cannabis that had been

1924
01:23:01,238 --> 01:23:06,718
seized uh coming into the United States

1925
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:08,239
as part of law enforcement action and

1926
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:12,520
yeah a lot of the Cannabis that was

1927
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:15,638
coming in from Mexico and from um uh

1928
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:20,040
Jamaica are two places that I remember

1929
01:23:15,639 --> 01:23:22,199
that had CBD and THC together and so I'm

1930
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:25,158
not surprised that your observation is

1931
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:27,000
that 20 some years ago you felt like

1932
01:23:25,158 --> 01:23:32,559
people were seeing benefit at lower

1933
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:34,119
doses because in the 50 years that we've

1934
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:37,400
had

1935
01:23:34,119 --> 01:23:40,079
cannabis on any scale in North America

1936
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:43,158
most of us were breeding for

1937
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:45,719
psychoactivity so we were breeding out

1938
01:23:43,158 --> 01:23:47,638
CBD without really understanding that

1939
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:49,880
that's what was going on we were just

1940
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:53,719
trying to optimize the GI High

1941
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:54,960
experience and wonderful job that flavor

1942
01:23:53,719 --> 01:23:57,480
too and

1943
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:01,840
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah flavor and get

1944
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:04,198
high so tpes and all of that and yeah I

1945
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:06,159
I I love the diversity of the cannabis

1946
01:24:04,198 --> 01:24:08,799
plant because all of these different

1947
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:10,960
experiences that we are mostly talking

1948
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:14,039
about on hash Church associated with

1949
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:16,880
canono we're primarily talking about THC

1950
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:18,679
and THC is a wonderful canono but

1951
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:21,359
there's all of the other things that are

1952
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:23,319
going on in the plant are part of what

1953
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:27,158
makes the difference between something

1954
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:29,439
like headband and and uh Northern Lights

1955
01:24:27,158 --> 01:24:31,920
you know they're just there's so much

1956
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:33,638
variety and yet most of the chemistry is

1957
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,960
similar when you're talking about just

1958
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:40,359
THC or CBD but when you start talking

1959
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:44,719
about minor canono and other tpes and

1960
01:24:40,359 --> 01:24:47,719
it's just uh it it's astounding and

1961
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:50,719
beautiful the Majesty of this plant and

1962
01:24:47,719 --> 01:24:54,679
what she can create for us and yeah I to

1963
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:58,279
Circle back to ratios and CBD and THC

1964
01:24:54,679 --> 01:25:01,359
I'm pretty sure that if you took uh pure

1965
01:24:58,279 --> 01:25:04,920
THC and pure CBD and put them into a

1966
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:06,599
product at whatever ratio you wanted uh

1967
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:09,679
you wouldn't see the benefit that you

1968
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:12,159
would see if you made an oil from

1969
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:14,079
something like medihaze where you did

1970
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:16,519
the best you could to preserve the

1971
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:19,198
original chemistry of that specific

1972
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:20,840
plant because there's minor canono that

1973
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:24,399
have effects and we're learning more and

1974
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:27,239
more about how those minor conoids not

1975
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:29,359
only affect our bodies by themselves but

1976
01:25:27,238 --> 01:25:30,479
how they affect our bodies in concert

1977
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:32,920
with other

1978
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:35,039
conoids and again I'm not really the

1979
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:36,719
expert on this Mark you could speak more

1980
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:40,279
about it or Sam could speak more about

1981
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:43,880
it but my experience has been that much

1982
01:25:40,279 --> 01:25:46,920
what you were saying uh Kelly at lower

1983
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:50,319
doses we see much better benefit when

1984
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:54,359
there's whole plant versions of CBD THC

1985
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:57,198
minor conoids flavonoids and I for one

1986
01:25:54,359 --> 01:26:00,198
am utterly convinced that other herbal

1987
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:05,279
and fungal

1988
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:08,519
allies uh will be of benefit to us in

1989
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:11,319
conjunction with cannabis um

1990
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:13,600
particularly the Psychedelic realm but

1991
01:26:11,319 --> 01:26:16,238
because I don't have much experience or

1992
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:18,520
practice with it myself I I don't speak

1993
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:21,439
much about it here but I do use all

1994
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:23,520
kinds of herbs in my own care uh for

1995
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:25,960
working with other people I just offer

1996
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:29,480
cannabis and that's kind of where I'm at

1997
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:32,920
with that uh yeah I'm utterly convinced

1998
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:35,479
uh whole plant CBD and THC and whatever

1999
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:37,960
ratio works for the end user you'll see

2000
01:26:35,479 --> 01:26:43,000
much better results at much lower

2001
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:43,000
doses that's I'm trying to like turn my

2002
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:51,479
microone and I

2003
01:26:46,359 --> 01:26:51,479
real cutting out cutting out you're in a

2004
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:57,639
car you're on mute now you're on mute

2005
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:00,000
can explain that time Marcus where you

2006
01:26:57,639 --> 01:27:03,760
had to cut me off because I was getting

2007
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:06,039
on a conference call I didn't realize

2008
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:08,400
remember that yeah you were starting a

2009
01:27:06,039 --> 01:27:09,840
zoom call it was good yeah I think there

2010
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:11,359
was another one that happened like that

2011
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,719
the other day that we were oh it was the

2012

2023
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:41,719
black belt in muting people at this

2024
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:44,118
point in time uh over five years of hash

2025
01:27:41,719 --> 01:27:45,880
Church where are you Johnny B come on

2026

there oh I'm doing well nice to see you

2032
01:28:01,479 --> 01:28:06,678
guys just having a good old time dude a

2033
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:09,238
lot of people ask me if the picture of

2034
01:28:06,679 --> 01:28:11,440
rosin on the front page of this hash

2035
01:28:09,238 --> 01:28:13,879
church was yours so many people asked me

2036
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:17,079
that and I have to shout out whose it

2037
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:20,400
was because that rosin belonged to Good

2038
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:22,519
Buds I believe it was snow God but it

2039
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:25,198
might have been Time Warp and it was

2040
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:27,040
this young kid I think he's like 19

2041
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:30,519
years old he works over at goodbuds on

2042
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:36,198
Salt Spring Island his name is Tristan

2043
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:38,920
Colin c l l o m b i n Tristan with an a

2044
01:28:36,198 --> 01:28:41,158
t r i s t an I wanted to shout him out

2045
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:43,279
because he made that bubble he made that

2046
01:28:41,158 --> 01:28:45,439
rosin he took that

2047
01:28:43,279 --> 01:28:47,319
picture and although I knew he would be

2048
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:49,839
stoked when I used it on the front of

2049
01:28:47,319 --> 01:28:51,759
hash Church uh there was no I couldn't

2050
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:53,520
figure out a way to shout him out so

2051
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,159
I'll put a little shout out for him in

2052
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:58,119
the comments section once the YouTube

2053
01:28:55,158 --> 01:29:02,679
video is actually up and uh I have also

2054
01:28:58,118 --> 01:29:04,679
just shouted him out now and man it's uh

2055
01:29:02,679 --> 01:29:06,560
a lot of people know your resin when

2056
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:08,880
resin looks like your resin they think

2057
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:12,440
it's your

2058
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:14,159
resin well nice work to homie there

2059
01:29:12,439 --> 01:29:16,678
definitely shout him

2060
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:19,439
out we've been getting some good results

2061
01:29:16,679 --> 01:29:21,359
though lately you guys get great results

2062
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:23,719
man I'm always blown away at what you

2063
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:26,679
guys are pulling off over there it's uh

2064
01:29:23,719 --> 01:29:28,880
it's like East Coast Cali over

2065
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:31,440
there well man brought a little bit of

2066
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:33,000
that back actually and yeah but

2067
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:37,238
definitely started with the whole bubble

2068
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:40,600
hash thing oh gez almost 20 years ago on

2069
01:29:37,238 --> 01:29:41,759
the East Coast you know so nice to be

2070
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,679
back here doing it we've been getting a

2071
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:46,679
lot of good results with the with the

2072
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:49,359
cured resin dry flower hole plant bubble

2073
01:29:46,679 --> 01:29:52,199
runs and showing some of that work

2074
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:54,719
lately but um yeah loving the

2075
01:29:52,198 --> 01:29:56,759
conversation about the CBD medicine and

2076
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:58,000
full Spectre medicine with other plants

2077
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:00,360
definitely with the

2078
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,760
THC done some breeding of my own with

2079
01:30:00,359 --> 01:30:06,439
some trying to go TP forward put some

2080
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:08,000
TPS on that CBD THC stuff uh I

2081
01:30:06,439 --> 01:30:11,960
introduced a little bit of pineapple

2082
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:14,319
fields actually and a few other

2083
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:16,239
different hoping for turpy types we work

2084
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:18,439
with one actually out here called Purple

2085
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:21,678
orange which is a Calo

2086
01:30:18,439 --> 01:30:24,919
bcross a Calo diesel backcross that I

2087
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:27,480
think came from dinam overseas in Europe

2088
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:29,639
and that one's really loud Turf forward

2089
01:30:27,479 --> 01:30:32,359
super bright so I just want to throw

2090
01:30:29,639 --> 01:30:34,719
that out there definitely use a lot of

2091
01:30:32,359 --> 01:30:37,238
CBD medicine and recommend it especially

2092
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:39,800
for us you know heavy THC consumers

2093
01:30:37,238 --> 01:30:42,000
seems to kind of uh flatten out the

2094
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:45,520
roller coaster with that

2095
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,520
so yeah hey

2096
01:30:46,118 --> 01:30:50,839
everyone what are you with the whole

2097
01:30:48,679 --> 01:30:53,560
plant dried resin runs are you what bags

2098
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:54,719
are you using um to catch the whole

2099
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:57,119
plant

2100
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:58,319
is it down to 45 oh that's F so we're

2101
01:30:57,118 --> 01:31:00,759
we're

2102
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:03,198
actually well we're using the full bag

2103
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:05,600
set so we do six bag and then we do a

2104
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:07,799
three wash series on the full bag we do

2105
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:10,320
what I've been calling kind of a micro

2106
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,520
macro so we're like small batch we're

2107
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:13,279
kind of excited about it we've been

2108
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:16,000
doing this for a couple years just for

2109
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:18,719
our own Rhythm and it works really well

2110
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,719
we've kind of dialed in for our I think

2111
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:24,560
a primary 5 10 15 minute wash

2112
01:31:21,719 --> 01:31:27,039
consecutively with the clean out between

2113
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:29,480
and you know fresh water ice input up to

2114
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:32,600
the last run then kind of a cleanout

2115
01:31:29,479 --> 01:31:35,158
dump and we've been focusing on

2116
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:39,079
definitely for the whole for the kind of

2117
01:31:35,158 --> 01:31:41,719
broad spectrum 73 to 160 and that's been

2118
01:31:39,079 --> 01:31:43,840
our best trap for for the whole plant

2119
01:31:41,719 --> 01:31:47,079
dried stuff but we're I'm finding that

2120
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:50,119
for the Rosen press the 120 to 160 for

2121
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:52,279
the dry you know versus fresh frozen

2122
01:31:50,118 --> 01:31:55,158
always love the the black bag the 90 to

2123
01:31:52,279 --> 01:31:58,000
120 black bag is like you know the baby

2124
01:31:55,158 --> 01:32:00,039
but gooey turpy and the resin both

2125
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,960
together but I'm finding for like the

2126
01:32:00,039 --> 01:32:03,920
pristine lighter nature that maybe the

2127
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:06,480
market Demands a little bit in the new

2128
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:08,520
day for like the lighter look rosin that

2129
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:11,678
you can still get from an air dry cured

2130
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:14,520
resin uh comes from that 120 to 160

2131
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:14,520
locked in for

2132
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:21,359
sure big up I love it I love it and um

2133
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:23,118
yeah I mean and also have you are you

2134
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:25,960
pressing have you pressed or made any

2135
01:32:23,118 --> 01:32:28,079
hash from hemp or any kind of CBD stuff

2136
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:29,639
I I know Nic te and essential extracts

2137
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:31,079
was doing some cool stuff a long time

2138
01:32:29,639 --> 01:32:34,960
ago and I remember when I first smoked

2139
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:37,880
my first hemp like hash I was kind of

2140
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:39,960
like trippy and it was weird when

2141
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:42,600
smokable hemp took off too you were like

2142
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:44,719
whoa like smokable hemp is one of the

2143
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:48,000
number one products for hemp Farms you

2144
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:49,840
know originally you know not maybe now

2145
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,359
but you know but still smokable hemp was

2146
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,960
big but uh any experience with making

2147
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:57,359
hash out of hemp

2148
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,279
yeah making some bubble hash out of hemp

2149
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:02,198
we made some full spectrum from dried

2150
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:04,639
plant dried flow like a couple years ago

2151
01:33:02,198 --> 01:33:07,079
just found kind of on repeat um the

2152
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:10,920
yields were a little lower and such but

2153
01:33:07,079 --> 01:33:12,399
they did make a really goopy black tar

2154
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:15,039
substance I can't remember if it was at

2155
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:18,000
the bottom lower Micron or higher set

2156
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:20,439
but it was not your average tra you know

2157
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,319
73 to 160 even it was almost on the

2158
01:33:20,439 --> 01:33:25,879
other side of that and with some I think

2159
01:33:23,319 --> 01:33:28,079
up the 73 to 90 maybe that was kind of

2160
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:31,359
you know it was very black tar it was

2161
01:33:28,079 --> 01:33:33,679
tan and Rich but had a a tacky glue

2162
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:36,000
quality that just dents stuck together

2163
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:38,760
very heavy small dents you know black

2164
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:41,000
dark right away and it had a bubble it

2165
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:43,920
had a melt quality to it even you know

2166
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:46,158
with heat but it was not not full melt

2167
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:48,158
it was perhaps not the best tasting had

2168
01:33:46,158 --> 01:33:50,839
a good heavy CBD

2169
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:52,519
effect um yeah but always on the search

2170
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:54,480
for new stuff I talked to the ancient

2171
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:57,480
green friends last week that said they

2172
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:59,519
have something like a peach tree or some

2173
01:33:57,479 --> 01:34:01,759
other work from I think from a moon

2174
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,560
gazer or somebody anyway it's a peach

2175
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,920
tree or something with some Peach TPS

2176
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:09,119
and I'm always kind of looking for the

2177
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,880
like I said very TP forward kind of CBD

2178
01:34:09,118 --> 01:34:13,799
work we've been doing otherwise like a

2179
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:15,400
sub Haze cut last year for the full just

2180
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:18,199
went full plant like you guys are

2181
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:20,519
talking about into the extraction Loop

2182
01:34:18,198 --> 01:34:23,960
there for the FICO for the you know for

2183
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:25,920
the ancient greens processing and and

2184
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:28,520
getting amazing healing results for a

2185
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:31,239
couple years between Elders in the

2186
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:33,880
community solving their pain to my dog

2187
01:34:31,238 --> 01:34:35,319
showed my younger dog has lyme disease

2188
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:38,319
and I don't know I can't say that this

2189
01:34:35,319 --> 01:34:40,519
is what helped or did it but we put her

2190
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:42,679
on the antibiotic because her platelet

2191
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:46,000
count was so high at like a

2192
01:34:42,679 --> 01:34:48,118
171 where she originally showed a 29

2193
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,479
which was flagging for the for the lime

2194
01:34:48,118 --> 01:34:52,799
at a young age six months a year later

2195
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:54,759
she was 171 we did the regimen and I

2196
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,000
suck her on the

2197
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:57,480
you know with some other medicine here

2198
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,238
and there too a little bit for about a

2199
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:01,399
month at the end before testing and she

2200
01:34:59,238 --> 01:35:04,399
showed at about I think it was a 19

2201
01:35:01,399 --> 01:35:06,759
count like not even on the chart after a

2202
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:09,679
year of regimen every single day with

2203
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:13,079
that CBD formula you know pretty heavy

2204
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:15,520
dosing honestly daily didn't skip a day

2205
01:35:13,079 --> 01:35:17,279
my old dog with us lives by it too and

2206
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:19,639
has the most high quality of life with

2207
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:22,279
it and anyway I wanted to throw that in

2208
01:35:19,639 --> 01:35:24,118
the pets are absolute amazing I saw Lyme

2209
01:35:22,279 --> 01:35:27,679
disease I believe is what kind of kicked

2210
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:30,079
its butt you know what was the dose that

2211
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:33,319
you were giving it

2212
01:35:30,079 --> 01:35:34,760
daily well I'd say about a dropper full

2213
01:35:33,319 --> 01:35:37,000
I don't know what that equivalates to

2214
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:40,199
what is that like a

2215
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,840
so just is that meat oil or is that oil

2216
01:35:40,198 --> 01:35:46,399
that's been

2217
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:49,639
diluted so I went with a MCT oil uh with

2218
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:51,519
um what I would say about a 2500 mil is

2219
01:35:49,639 --> 01:35:54,400
what I make it home for us you know

2220
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:57,400
honestly 25 to 3,000 mil kind of go

2221
01:35:54,399 --> 01:35:59,759
strong it it tastes it's rough you know

2222
01:35:57,399 --> 01:36:02,359
but what I would do is you know a full

2223
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:05,760
droper full two to three M milligram not

2224
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:08,519
not Mill right just so I know milligram

2225
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:11,039
milligram yeah excuse me yeah so like

2226
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:14,040
what a 2500 to 3,000

2227
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:16,960
milligram um type of bottle size 2 O

2228
01:36:14,039 --> 01:36:20,399
bottle in a 1 o yeah 1 o I guess

2229
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:21,960
suspension is that an MCT so yeah a 1 o

2230
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:24,479
bottle you're asking kind of the wrong

2231
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:27,600
person was

2232
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:29,319
um a 31 oun bottle you know I'm trying

2233
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:32,320
to get as much information on this

2234
01:36:29,319 --> 01:36:35,559
because people this all the time I've

2235
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:39,759
never heard of for limes disease so like

2236
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:42,320
um I I I think that that's uh you know I

2237
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:46,199
mean again more things to look into I

2238
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:49,198
mean my gosh so like what um do you

2239
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:52,000
notice like so like three gram like like

2240
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:55,799
three grams of crude oil carbon dioxide

2241
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:59,279
you know crude FICO into one ounce of of

2242
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:00,840
MCT oil that gives you 100 milligrams

2243
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:04,439
per

2244
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:06,840
milliliter okay that 100 milligrams per

2245
01:37:04,439 --> 01:37:08,799
that's that's pretty concentrated right

2246
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:10,960
yes I mean that's like we go pretty

2247
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:13,800
strong that's i' I've went from about

2248
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:16,158
half of that up and we I definitely make

2249
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:18,679
it pretty strong no no question very

2250
01:37:16,158 --> 01:37:21,439
crude even on the taste are you mixing

2251
01:37:18,679 --> 01:37:23,920
this in so what I do for my doggies with

2252
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:26,638
my doggies at at dinner time for I will

2253
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:28,800
mix it up on their food and I give them

2254
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:31,920
a special gravy from our own chicken

2255
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:33,679
bone stock at home that we make you know

2256
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:37,000
from the neighbors chicken so we do it

2257
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:39,520
pretty right and a local protein Source

2258
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:41,279
typically for them reduced we ref freeze

2259
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,679
it and break it out they get gravy every

2260
01:37:41,279 --> 01:37:45,000
night on their dinner and I'm able to

2261
01:37:42,679 --> 01:37:46,639
mix it in with the warm you know a

2262
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,960
little warm water with the gravy with

2263
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:51,319
the CBD and I just swirl it right up and

2264
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:53,960
they can't get enough my older dog licks

2265
01:37:51,319 --> 01:37:56,639
that medicine off the dropper

2266
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:58,039
she likes it she knows it heals her and

2267
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:59,960
then I don't know this one either for

2268
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:02,359
sure but it's so exciting that she has a

2269
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:05,079
skin cyst like a fatty tumor the older

2270
01:38:02,359 --> 01:38:07,639
dog that comes up on her back for about

2271
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:10,399
three years and when I apply that pure

2272
01:38:07,639 --> 01:38:13,000
MCT oil even right by the dropper a full

2273
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:14,559
dropper full on it two to three days

2274
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:18,079
right into the tumor and that thing

2275
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:21,719
reduces by like half to three4 size

2276
01:38:18,079 --> 01:38:24,198
every time it's wild amazing right this

2277
01:38:21,719 --> 01:38:28,239
[ __ ] is [ __ ] amazing this

2278
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:30,960
conversation about because our dogs have

2279
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:33,559
been our patients like our dogs have

2280
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,520
been and our cats and our animals and

2281
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:38,800
then the neighbors horses and the

2282
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:43,880
neighbors goats I've been using cannabis

2283
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:45,360
you know for 30 years to see you know

2284
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:47,800
how we can take them either out of a

2285
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:52,118
death situation or out of acute

2286
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:55,840
different types of symptoms and um that

2287
01:38:52,118 --> 01:38:58,198
super high concent at CBD like you're

2288
01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:01,880
talking about like 100 milligrams per

2289
01:38:58,198 --> 01:39:04,279
gram is what we're making here so each

2290
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:06,039
capsule is worth about a gram give or

2291
01:39:04,279 --> 01:39:09,079
take just a little bit in the way that

2292
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:12,399
we make it so it's about 90 to 100

2293
01:39:09,079 --> 01:39:16,118
milligrams per capsule and our dogs will

2294
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:19,719
get a heaping tablespoon in their food

2295
01:39:16,118 --> 01:39:26,198
per day so they're eating about probably

2296
01:39:19,719 --> 01:39:29,639
2,000 milligrams of CBD per day um

2297
01:39:26,198 --> 01:39:32,198
and I think it's it's amazing the

2298
01:39:29,639 --> 01:39:34,440
changes guys ever found have you guys

2299
01:39:32,198 --> 01:39:36,719
ever found where it makes the dog

2300
01:39:34,439 --> 01:39:39,000
Restless at night and like they

2301
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:40,920
sometimes will be panting at night I

2302
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,359
mean I think that again that's one of

2303
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:45,679
our things about giving super heroic

2304
01:39:43,359 --> 01:39:48,359
doses we don't know if we're just

2305
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:50,800
overstimulating their cannabinoid system

2306
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:53,559
I'm always worried about giving giving

2307
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:56,480
the dog too much canabo so now they're

2308
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:58,840
just all well I think it depends on the

2309
01:39:56,479 --> 01:40:03,000
age of the dogs and what the dogs have

2310
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:06,119
as far as symptoms because I never young

2311
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:08,079
dog that amount what I'm talking about

2312
01:40:06,118 --> 01:40:12,079
is our older dog I'm looking at him

2313
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:15,198
right here he's got tumors he's over 14

2314
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:18,840
I think he's 15 now sweetest thing but

2315
01:40:15,198 --> 01:40:22,638
just you know keeping his you know zest

2316
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:25,400
for life is all that's important and I

2317
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:28,679
just what I wanted to say in here was

2318
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:31,279
that you can use yeah and and the THC

2319
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:32,599
needs to be incredibly low so that's why

2320
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:34,960
those High

2321
01:40:32,599 --> 01:40:38,599
concentration of the hemp because I

2322
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:42,118
noticed if it's a high THC they're

2323
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:44,159
affected very quickly I know I know a

2324
01:40:42,118 --> 01:40:47,359
veterinarian here in Northern California

2325
01:40:44,158 --> 01:40:51,359
that's had a couple of dogs die from

2326
01:40:47,359 --> 01:40:55,479
consuming Edibles that were high THC

2327
01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:57,960
dogs have uh an insane number of conoid

2328
01:40:55,479 --> 01:41:01,559
receptors in their cerebellum and that

2329
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:03,920
will uh so THC affects them very

2330
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:06,679
strongly really be careful giving your

2331
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:09,279
dog cannabis that has THC in it hey

2332
01:41:06,679 --> 01:41:12,039
speaking California hold on for one

2333
01:41:09,279 --> 01:41:14,759
second uh there is an actual uh assembly

2334
01:41:12,039 --> 01:41:16,760
Bill 384 which would prohibit the border

2335
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:19,199
of dis from uh disciplining

2336
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:22,199
veterinarians who recommend cannabis on

2337
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:27,118
an animal for medical purposes so in

2338
01:41:22,198 --> 01:41:29,118
California AB 384 is the one you should

2339
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:32,198
be calling your representatives and your

2340
01:41:29,118 --> 01:41:33,920
local people to make them aware so that

2341
01:41:32,198 --> 01:41:36,359
uh you know because we can't carry

2342
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,880
products currently uh for Animals

2343
01:41:36,359 --> 01:41:41,039
because of this uh it is very much a

2344
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:42,719
challenge so this will be a step towards

2345
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:45,599
normalization here in the state of

2346
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:47,239
California so AB 384 call your people

2347
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:49,239
now thank

2348
01:41:47,238 --> 01:41:53,598
you thank

2349
01:41:49,238 --> 01:41:56,638
you you can't carry pet products ATN it

2350
01:41:53,599 --> 01:42:00,000
is a gray area I mean people can choose

2351
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:03,039
to but the sboe I mean not SBO BCC

2352
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,000
currently is yeah they're kind of um

2353
01:42:03,039 --> 01:42:07,560
it's it's it's one of those areas where

2354
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:10,158
we need a bill like SB 384 for that type

2355
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:13,239
of protection uh again remember I can't

2356
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:15,638
carry CBD from hemp I can carry CBD from

2357
01:42:13,238 --> 01:42:19,638
THC plant so I can carry it from Indica

2358
01:42:15,639 --> 01:42:22,400
but not from sativa so CBD is CBD is CBD

2359
01:42:19,639 --> 01:42:24,520
but the law here is ignorant and dumb

2360
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:26,238
and we still have to educate the

2361
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:29,040
ignorant and dumb because we've got

2362
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:33,000
ignorant and dumb laws like this so you

2363
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:36,000
know I hear you are doing I think is

2364
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
they they can take

2365
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:42,158
metric tag material and somehow add it

2366
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:44,238
to that hemp derived material and get it

2367
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:46,439
into the metric system somehow through

2368
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:49,519
the back not in California that's just

2369
01:42:46,439 --> 01:42:52,198
not in California at this time it

2370
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:54,920
illegal has a way to do it through the

2371
01:42:52,198 --> 01:42:57,118
um I think there there's a there's an

2372
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:59,880
organization that that was set up for

2373
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:01,799
Massachusetts so you can get it in as an

2374
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:05,400
ingredient there's like a weird gray

2375
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:07,480
area there so that's the best that the

2376
01:43:05,399 --> 01:43:11,158
state's really done so it's kind of

2377
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:14,000
weird but it's just you know because

2378
01:43:11,158 --> 01:43:15,799
it's a can avonoid you know I want say

2379
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:20,439
you know Josh Kelly I've made some three

2380
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:22,920
to one here Ren um from fresh Rosen hemp

2381
01:43:20,439 --> 01:43:27,759
that um well really a drug cultivar but

2382
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:29,079
I also been working with um lifter and

2383
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:30,480
Hawaiian Haze and a bunch of other

2384
01:43:29,079 --> 01:43:31,920
varietals and I'm trying to get some

2385
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:34,238
better understanding of like how it

2386
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:36,239
reacts to different processes so I'll

2387
01:43:34,238 --> 01:43:38,678
let you guys know how I get as I get

2388
01:43:36,238 --> 01:43:40,959
deeper into it I've got quite a bit to

2389
01:43:38,679 --> 01:43:44,158
play with so that's awesome and those

2390
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:46,480
are generally High plants I mean you

2391
01:43:44,158 --> 01:43:49,319
grow those I mean they they smell good

2392
01:43:46,479 --> 01:43:51,799
yeah lifter super sour really kind of

2393
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:54,679
like got that nice like you know I have

2394
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:56,920
some here you know it's it's nice and

2395
01:43:54,679 --> 01:43:58,920
it's uh I'll let you guys know I mean

2396
01:43:56,920 --> 01:44:00,639
it's it's really sappy but this is this

2397
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:04,399
was really beautiful I mean the color is

2398
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:06,359
really nice on it um you know it's just

2399
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:09,079
it's it's a nice

2400
01:44:06,359 --> 01:44:12,639
floral um you know that one's from

2401
01:44:09,079 --> 01:44:14,118
Electra so but it's um but each varietal

2402
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:17,440
is like is all over the place you know

2403
01:44:14,118 --> 01:44:19,679
I've had varieties that test really hot

2404
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:21,359
but then other ones that don't and when

2405
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:24,239
you do these big mixed batches you just

2406
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:26,319
get a a cannaboid ratio that's um that's

2407
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:29,879
varying in different either or

2408
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:31,719
Direction so it's pretty interesting I

2409
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:36,440
would love to dig

2410
01:44:31,719 --> 01:44:39,639
into why this group thinks different

2411
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:43,000
cultivars work differently in the

2412
01:44:39,639 --> 01:44:46,079
extraction process and part of what's

2413
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:49,479
driving this in my mind is in making

2414
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:53,079
feco full extract oil of different

2415
01:44:49,479 --> 01:44:55,959
cultivars one of the things I've come to

2416
01:44:53,079 --> 01:45:01,519
realiz is things that are predominantly

2417
01:44:55,960 --> 01:45:04,880
THC uh at in feco uh don't flow well at

2418
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:08,520
all at room temperature whereas things

2419
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:11,319
that are more rich in CBD and low in THC

2420
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:13,639
do flow pretty readily at room

2421
01:45:11,319 --> 01:45:17,039
temperature and I know that turpins

2422
01:45:13,639 --> 01:45:20,039
probably play a part in that but when I

2423
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:22,359
play with uh making hash because I enjoy

2424
01:45:20,039 --> 01:45:27,000
smoking hash uh one of the things I

2425
01:45:22,359 --> 01:45:30,598
found is as a general thing uh most THC

2426
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:33,800
cultivars don't work up into a nice

2427
01:45:30,599 --> 01:45:36,800
little pucka hash as readily as things

2428
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:38,119
that are rich in CBD so I think conoids

2429
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:40,320
have something to do with it but even if

2430
01:45:38,118 --> 01:45:43,079
you're talking about like what's the

2431
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:46,079
difference between I remember bubus was

2432
01:45:43,079 --> 01:45:48,880
a cultivar that never worked into hash

2433
01:45:46,079 --> 01:45:50,639
very well whereas Sour Diesel for

2434
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:53,679
example you could work a nice little

2435
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:55,719
puck of that in your hands so what's the

2436
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:57,480
difference there is it it's it can't be

2437
01:45:55,719 --> 01:46:01,359
just canono there's something else going

2438
01:45:57,479 --> 01:46:03,238
on with the tricomes that gives us this

2439
01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:06,880
different response whether we're

2440
01:46:03,238 --> 01:46:09,118
pressing or um yeah you guys get the

2441
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:11,639
gist of my question I'm I'm wondering

2442
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:11,639
I'd love to

2443
01:46:12,359 --> 01:46:17,799
hear I would say it's a wants to be a

2444
01:46:15,639 --> 01:46:19,920
solid right are you are these in liquid

2445
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:22,279
are you talking about liquid

2446
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:26,599
extract Sam speak up you were a little

2447
01:46:22,279 --> 01:46:29,920
low there I heard you I said I presume

2448
01:46:26,599 --> 01:46:29,920
it's mostly the

2449
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:37,440
Turpin yeah I concur with that I've seen

2450
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:40,400
um and I'm sure maybe Marcus could could

2451
01:46:37,439 --> 01:46:42,839
share some of his experiences but um I

2452
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:45,079
think certain varietal like a Jack

2453
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:47,679
herrer is just like historically a low

2454
01:46:45,079 --> 01:46:51,198
yielding varietal because of the type of

2455
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:52,920
tpin it actually produces um but also

2456
01:46:51,198 --> 01:46:54,839
you know I think we could even get more

2457
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:58,118
granular in terms of the type of triome

2458
01:46:54,840 --> 01:47:00,880
heads that it grows as well but I'm

2459
01:46:58,118 --> 01:47:03,639
leaning towards Colin is the the the

2460
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:06,359
Tricom heads or whenever you

2461
01:47:03,639 --> 01:47:08,239
touch most of the hemp flowers They're

2462
01:47:06,359 --> 01:47:11,000
they're really greasy you know they're

2463
01:47:08,238 --> 01:47:13,519
that same kind of Jack Herer greasy

2464
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,840
right thing so I I there's something in

2465
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,960
the tpin and the canabo makeup and maybe

2466
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:19,599
that's why it flows better it makes

2467
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:21,000
sense right like when you touch it it

2468
01:47:19,599 --> 01:47:23,239
just greases out in your hands that

2469
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,880
would make the the FICO that you make

2470
01:47:23,238 --> 01:47:28,439
more viscous and and flow a little bit

2471
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:33,359
better and I think the THC

2472
01:47:28,439 --> 01:47:36,559
varietal can um CBD has a a larger head

2473
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:40,639
and a and a bit of a different shape now

2474
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:43,039
that can be proven wrong I that's just

2475
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:45,719
observational through growing and and

2476
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:47,760
making hash out of but that's my think

2477
01:47:45,719 --> 01:47:49,198
what did you have oh I was just thinking

2478
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:51,639
yeah we're talking about when we talk

2479
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:53,559
about Turpin just talking about oils and

2480
01:47:51,639 --> 01:47:55,920
then different viscosi

2481
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:57,520
levels for the oils with different

2482
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:59,679
temperatures and how different

2483
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,520
temperatures grease out at different you

2484
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:06,599
know volatile

2485
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:07,880
oils be the T yeah so sorry gonna say I

2486
01:48:06,599 --> 01:48:10,880
was just gonna add that different

2487
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:13,760
cultivars all have different

2488
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:16,560
tpes and different tpin have different

2489
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:19,800
saturation points for

2490
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:23,039
TCA right and and PCA which is the

2491
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:25,639
predominant cannabinoid that's in these

2492
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:29,399
uh kinds of varieties are is going to

2493
01:48:25,639 --> 01:48:31,480
want to CR crystallize out above its

2494
01:48:29,399 --> 01:48:34,079
saturation point but just before its

2495
01:48:31,479 --> 01:48:36,959
saturation point if it's a super

2496
01:48:34,079 --> 01:48:39,319
saturated solution it's going to be

2497
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:41,920
viscous yeah and the thing with with

2498
01:48:39,319 --> 01:48:45,079
it's I found interesting way with with

2499
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:49,319
CBD so and again we're talking about

2500
01:48:45,079 --> 01:48:51,840
thca which wants to be a solid right t8c

2501
01:48:49,319 --> 01:48:53,960
is a is a is a liquid it's just a very

2502
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:59,400
very very viscous liquid it's not quite

2503
01:48:53,960 --> 01:49:01,960
a solid I mean you can freeze THC into a

2504
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:04,079
hard pocket low temperatures but when

2505
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:07,079
you warm it up it becomes just an

2506
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:09,238
amorphous liquid right so it's just

2507
01:49:07,079 --> 01:49:13,519
basically the the difference in the

2508
01:49:09,238 --> 01:49:16,359
viscosity might have to do with how much

2509
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:19,119
if there is any adventitious decarbox

2510
01:49:16,359 --> 01:49:21,198
silation in your extraction process so

2511
01:49:19,118 --> 01:49:23,359
that's what I was going to ask is in

2512
01:49:21,198 --> 01:49:28,039
your in your process itself is this

2513
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:30,519
after you've decarbox it are you we try

2514
01:49:28,039 --> 01:49:34,000
to do the extraction we do exraction

2515
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:36,280
extract itself in cold ethanol and we

2516
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,158
don't DEC carboxilate before we do it

2517
01:49:36,279 --> 01:49:39,439
because again if you're not if you're

2518
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:41,399
looking for psycho activity you would

2519
01:49:39,439 --> 01:49:42,839
DEC carboxilate but if you're trying to

2520
01:49:41,399 --> 01:49:45,559
make medicine particularly for people

2521
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:48,800
who are sensitive to THC you try and

2522
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:50,800
keep it decarbox or carboxilate you

2523
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:53,119
still want what we found is and I don't

2524
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:55,840
know if you see this two Colin in

2525
01:49:53,118 --> 01:49:58,719
alcohol recovery from an alcohol

2526
01:49:55,840 --> 01:50:04,880
extraction that you get spontaneous

2527
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:09,279
decarbox of cbda and cbda in

2528
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:10,520
solution cbda in solution is not stable

2529
01:50:09,279 --> 01:50:13,519
and it readily

2530
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:16,440
decarbox and so what we find is just

2531
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:20,440
that letting the crude sit will measure

2532
01:50:16,439 --> 01:50:23,158
it and we'll see no cbda at all however

2533
01:50:20,439 --> 01:50:26,638
all the CO2 that's been

2534
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:30,118
that's been lost through adventitious

2535
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:32,440
decarbox silation is still dissolved in

2536
01:50:30,118 --> 01:50:35,479
the crude itself because if you try to

2537
01:50:32,439 --> 01:50:37,678
dissolve that crude good luck because of

2538
01:50:35,479 --> 01:50:40,479
that CO2 in there you're going to be

2539
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:43,199
messing with your vacuum constantly so

2540
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:46,718
you still have to somehow Purge all of

2541
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:50,359
that CO2 out of your crude but what I

2542
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:54,399
find is that after that you have a very

2543
01:50:50,359 --> 01:50:58,359
different viscosity for a high CBD crude

2544
01:50:54,399 --> 01:51:00,039
than you do for a high THC crude and I

2545
01:50:58,359 --> 01:51:02,078
would just attribute that again I think

2546
01:51:00,039 --> 01:51:04,479
Sam's right absolutely for the tpin

2547
01:51:02,078 --> 01:51:07,000
that's in there but ultimately I mean

2548
01:51:04,479 --> 01:51:09,439
those two compounds just have very

2549
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:13,479
different characteristics Al together I

2550
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:17,078
mean THC is just uh viscous viscous

2551
01:51:13,479 --> 01:51:20,279
viscous honey likee syrupy oil that

2552
01:51:17,078 --> 01:51:22,359
again you can freeze into a solid below

2553
01:51:20,279 --> 01:51:25,198
roof temperature but for the most part

2554
01:51:22,359 --> 01:51:27,719
it room temperature it's just a viscous

2555
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:29,799
oil and uh the last other thing I was

2556
01:51:27,719 --> 01:51:34,078
just going to mention is that sometimes

2557
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:37,560
with thca when you get a saturated thca

2558
01:51:34,078 --> 01:51:41,479
solution it does get very very very

2559
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:44,560
viscous so I've seen some saps that are

2560
01:51:41,479 --> 01:51:48,000
almost solid but they're just still a

2561
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:50,599
runny liquid and it's because the tpin

2562
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,880
are doing a good job at keeping all that

2563
01:51:50,599 --> 01:51:57,960
TCA in solution and it's not kind of

2564
01:51:53,880 --> 01:52:00,800
gone above the THC saturation point but

2565
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:02,800
the fact that each individual strain is

2566
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:05,279
going to have a different saturation

2567
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:08,039
Point like what we had found is like

2568
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:10,439
with headband in particular it makes a

2569
01:52:08,039 --> 01:52:12,960
really good you know diamonds really

2570
01:52:10,439 --> 01:52:15,559
good sauce but for some reason some of

2571
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:17,840
those hazes and again this has to do I

2572
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:20,560
guess with the fact that they're high in

2573
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:22,639
the sesat Turpin sesat Turpin don't

2574
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:25,199
necessarily volatilize away but they're

2575
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:28,239
still liquids and they solubilize all

2576
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:31,078
the cannaboids those strains tend to be

2577
01:52:28,238 --> 01:52:33,198
more sauce-like tend to make a lot of a

2578
01:52:31,078 --> 01:52:35,799
lot of sauces and you could still get

2579
01:52:33,198 --> 01:52:38,198
diamonds to partition out of those

2580
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:40,800
saturated Solutions but it might take a

2581
01:52:38,198 --> 01:52:42,638
little bit longer on the shelf and also

2582
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:45,079
what you might find is that if you're

2583
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:47,480
filling VAP pen cartridges with those

2584
01:52:45,078 --> 01:52:48,840
types of sauces early on you might find

2585
01:52:47,479 --> 01:52:52,000
after a few weeks you got a little

2586
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:55,679
crystals in your VAP pen tank because

2587
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:58,319
yeah the saturation has not fully or the

2588
01:52:55,679 --> 01:53:01,078
crystallization hasn't hasn't fully

2589
01:52:58,319 --> 01:53:02,719
happened but um from my experimental

2590
01:53:01,078 --> 01:53:04,719
results I think we have measured this

2591
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:06,560
actually on three or four different ones

2592
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:10,158
it appears as though the

2593
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:12,239
thca uh saturation point in things like

2594
01:53:10,158 --> 01:53:14,679
I think we did for headband and I want

2595
01:53:12,238 --> 01:53:17,000
to say we did for Lemon Diesel was right

2596
01:53:14,679 --> 01:53:21,039
around 86 or

2597
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:22,800
87% so if you exceed that in terms of

2598
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:24,719
the amount of cannabinoids in and you

2599
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:26,840
have less tpin in there you're going to

2600
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:28,560
start crashing things out but that's

2601
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:31,039
going to be very specific to the

2602
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:33,760
cultivar and probably very specific to

2603
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:36,198
the way that that cultivar was grown and

2604
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:40,480
probably more specific to how it was

2605
01:53:36,198 --> 01:53:40,479
extracted and you know put into the

2606
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:46,719
jar yeah I agree with you mark think you

2607
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:49,118
staying there hey

2608
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:51,078
Colin yeah go ahead have you been Wasing

2609
01:53:49,118 --> 01:53:53,279
any ha have you have you been washing

2610
01:53:51,078 --> 01:53:57,118
any hazes at all

2611
01:53:53,279 --> 01:53:59,840
so yeah so I've um you know I I've

2612
01:53:57,118 --> 01:54:02,158
washed the you know a lot of hazes in

2613
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:05,639
general uh just because I like them I

2614
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:07,319
mean I I I really enjoy them and um

2615
01:54:05,639 --> 01:54:10,239
commercially they just don't make sense

2616
01:54:07,319 --> 01:54:12,920
like I've I've you know yeah P Hill

2617
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:15,598
Hayes you know six over 16 weeks just

2618
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:17,760
it's it's hard but um I think the

2619
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:19,440
closest thing commercially viable just

2620
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:21,199
to like think you know like grows really

2621
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:25,479
well is like some of the Jack cleaner

2622
01:54:21,198 --> 01:54:28,238
lines um that to if you can find a good

2623
01:54:25,479 --> 01:54:30,198
phenotype and chemotype there it'll it

2624
01:54:28,238 --> 01:54:33,959
definitely dumps and it makes six-star

2625
01:54:30,198 --> 01:54:35,638
like a beauty um but I think um I'm

2626
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:37,599
trying to think of the name of the

2627
01:54:35,639 --> 01:54:40,440
variety that I ran this past year that

2628
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:44,360
was like super amazing but it just

2629
01:54:40,439 --> 01:54:47,879
yielded like 2% and it was just like for

2630
01:54:44,359 --> 01:54:50,118
the became head stash at that point um

2631
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:53,118
but we did like yeah maybe like 100

2632
01:54:50,118 --> 01:54:53,118
pounds

2633
01:54:53,319 --> 01:54:59,479
it was really good though um but yeah I

2634
01:54:55,560 --> 01:55:01,119
think you know for hazes for me um I try

2635
01:54:59,479 --> 01:55:03,078
to look towards things like that have

2636
01:55:01,118 --> 01:55:06,198
been worked a lot you know like like

2637
01:55:03,078 --> 01:55:07,840
that you know like the Jax cleaner or or

2638
01:55:06,198 --> 01:55:11,759
any of those types of variety or even

2639
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:14,239
the the um Jack Frost from Loompa that

2640
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:16,639
was one that I've I've ran that had like

2641
01:55:14,238 --> 01:55:18,879
a pretty good yield if I I don't have my

2642
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:22,719
notes around me but I think that was

2643
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:25,039
another one that was good um but yeah

2644
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:28,118
you know also Brothers Grim I you know

2645
01:55:25,039 --> 01:55:30,359
Rosetta Stone was actually one that I

2646
01:55:28,118 --> 01:55:32,279
put out in Massachusetts and people

2647
01:55:30,359 --> 01:55:35,078
loved it because it just embodied the

2648
01:55:32,279 --> 01:55:37,158
Jack herrer but had this like floral

2649
01:55:35,078 --> 01:55:38,679
Ecuador vibe to it that was very

2650
01:55:37,158 --> 01:55:42,399
different for the Northeast here like

2651
01:55:38,679 --> 01:55:44,719
people just weren't next to

2652
01:55:42,399 --> 01:55:46,839
um like they just weren't next to these

2653
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:48,920
varietals you know so to speak you know

2654
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:51,880
they they really didn't get into this

2655
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:53,399
floral thing out here um very much you

2656
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:54,880
know they look at what California's

2657
01:55:53,399 --> 01:55:58,000
going through in terms of what their

2658
01:55:54,880 --> 01:56:00,078
their kind of uh their favorite you know

2659
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,599
songs of the week if you will and it's

2660
01:56:00,078 --> 01:56:03,399
it's like a lot of those gelato and the

2661
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:05,000
sherbs and a lot of that stuff and and

2662
01:56:03,399 --> 01:56:07,679
out here as you know it's just

2663
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,560
traditionally been sours and chems and

2664
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:11,800
you know and I I really appreciate a lot

2665
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:14,599
of that rosett the Rosetta specifically

2666
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:18,119
from Rick was was actually really great

2667
01:56:14,599 --> 01:56:20,039
um Uptown Funk was really great on this

2668
01:56:18,118 --> 01:56:23,439
on the plant but didn't translate so

2669
01:56:20,039 --> 01:56:24,960
well through the process um c99 was

2670
01:56:23,439 --> 01:56:27,678
another one that I felt like had that

2671
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:32,118
grapefruit Funk to it that kind of had

2672
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:33,800
Ecuador little bit of um Haze yeah the

2673
01:56:32,118 --> 01:56:36,158
super silver haze is one that I used to

2674
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:39,159
grow a ton of man that was like my

2675
01:56:36,158 --> 01:56:41,158
classic that's another one historically

2676
01:56:39,158 --> 01:56:44,198
I don't know Sam maybe Sam has some some

2677
01:56:41,158 --> 01:56:48,118
more you know maybe from the perspective

2678
01:56:44,198 --> 01:56:49,919
the super silver haze around here uh FL

2679
01:56:48,118 --> 01:56:51,920
you know finishes pretty early like

2680
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:54,440
people grow It Outdoors here in British

2681
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:56,239
Columbia so I'm imagining it's some

2682
01:56:54,439 --> 01:56:58,519
hybrid version of it I don't if there's

2683
01:56:56,238 --> 01:57:01,919
any thoughts on that but I'll also say

2684
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:05,079
rell's gift was you know has the Jack

2685
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:07,158
career mother clone from Eugene which is

2686
01:57:05,078 --> 01:57:08,799
the jack career's got Haze in it right I

2687
01:57:07,158 --> 01:57:12,158
mean that's this one right here the Jack

2688
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:13,440
R's got Haze and skunk in it and I wish

2689
01:57:12,158 --> 01:57:15,559
I could share this with you guys it's

2690
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:18,519
unbelievable and uh then the zel's gift

2691
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:21,039
has Super Lemon Haze that we got from

2692
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:22,679
Hawaii from the North Shore of kawaii so

2693
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:25,880
the zel's gift has

2694
01:57:22,679 --> 01:57:28,359
a nice batch of Super Lemon Haze and

2695
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:30,520
original haze from Jack and then the

2696
01:57:28,359 --> 01:57:32,118
also the lemons and the tur pinin and

2697
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:35,400
stuff but it is a

2698
01:57:32,118 --> 01:57:36,960
greasy plant still our H but a bunch of

2699
01:57:35,399 --> 01:57:38,920
people are washing it down in San

2700
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:41,760
Francisco and they're saying that it's

2701
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:45,239
their most favorite sort of creamy and

2702
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:48,239
also it's mixed with the AF goo so now

2703
01:57:45,238 --> 01:57:50,118
we've got the goo in there I mean not

2704
01:57:48,238 --> 01:57:52,559
now it's been for forever it's our

2705
01:57:50,118 --> 01:57:57,639
oldest one but anyway I just like the

2706
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:59,239
goo mixed with the the lemony hazes um

2707
01:57:57,639 --> 01:58:02,039
and it makes really good

2708
01:57:59,238 --> 01:58:04,799
hash you got to get you some seeds we're

2709
01:58:02,039 --> 01:58:07,960
seeing a popularity here in the Bay area

2710
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:10,760
of the cake varieties and cereal milks

2711
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:12,359
apparently there's are apparently really

2712
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:15,039
popular between the wedding cake

2713
01:58:12,359 --> 01:58:18,000
birthday cake uh we're still seeing the

2714
01:58:15,039 --> 01:58:19,960
hazes lemon Jack gelato you know those

2715
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:23,399
are still you know the prevalence the

2716
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:25,880
Kush the Diesels but uh yeah this cereal

2717
01:58:23,399 --> 01:58:28,839
the the cereal milk and the uh the cake

2718
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:31,400
varietals seem to be uh the the latest

2719
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:31,400
flavor

2720
01:58:32,479 --> 01:58:38,919
dour what about the orange Aid um and

2721
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:42,039
the uh those kind of there's some pretty

2722
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:43,760
good uh still cream sickles and stuff

2723
01:58:42,039 --> 01:58:46,158
going on still oh yeah they're coming

2724
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:48,679
through as well but I'm just again the

2725
01:58:46,158 --> 01:58:51,078
popularity with the the consumers they

2726
01:58:48,679 --> 01:58:53,800
seem to be what they seem to be

2727
01:58:51,078 --> 01:58:56,880
gravitating toward Ward it's it's always

2728
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:59,360
fascinating as a cannabis so you know

2729
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:01,599
sociologists have always been fascinated

2730
01:58:59,359 --> 01:59:03,759
by the trends as they've come through

2731
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:07,560
and as you know such as when we won the

2732
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:09,239
Cannabis Cup for you know um uh you know

2733
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:11,119
Girl Scout cookies you know then

2734
01:59:09,238 --> 01:59:13,039
everything was cookies so it's just

2735
01:59:11,118 --> 01:59:15,719
always fascinating to watch the

2736
01:59:13,039 --> 01:59:18,399
different flows of you know genetics as

2737
01:59:15,719 --> 01:59:21,319
they come through what stays and sticks

2738
01:59:18,399 --> 01:59:23,598
in the uh in society's mind and what

2739
01:59:21,319 --> 01:59:27,198
goes the way of the dinosaur and we

2740
01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:29,440
never see again so those Trends are just

2741
01:59:27,198 --> 01:59:32,678
rather fascinating everywhere from

2742
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:34,319
looking back on the old THC mq or

2743
01:59:32,679 --> 01:59:36,639
whatever that we used to look for the

2744
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:38,840
actual prices in High Times you know and

2745
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:40,239
they' be like in your area there's Kush

2746
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:41,960
available for this amount of money

2747
01:59:40,238 --> 01:59:43,638
you're like nobody's got that [ __ ]

2748
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:46,000
pot around here especially at that kind

2749
01:59:43,639 --> 01:59:48,520
of money but you know so now we have

2750
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,960
actually dispensaries and you know

2751
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:52,520
varietals that are going out via metric

2752
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:54,520
but you know metric's one thing it's

2753
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:55,920
another thing to see what the trends

2754
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:58,119
people are going by what's getting them

2755
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:00,319
high what phenotypes are you know

2756
01:59:58,118 --> 02:00:03,279
actually triggering people right now

2757
02:00:00,319 --> 02:00:05,319
through the populace it's I don't know

2758
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:07,439
do y all find it as fascinating as me I

2759
02:00:05,319 --> 02:00:11,198
I I just you know always find it kind of

2760
02:00:07,439 --> 02:00:13,678
neat uni uniquely human right only hum

2761
02:00:11,198 --> 02:00:17,039
half of it is genetics and the other

2762
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:19,480
half is just names and other words if

2763
02:00:17,039 --> 02:00:23,158
you don't have any Jack herar because

2764
02:00:19,479 --> 02:00:26,399
that's what you want well some UNS

2765
02:00:23,158 --> 02:00:30,799
scrupulous dealers have been known to

2766
02:00:26,399 --> 02:00:32,519
call uh whatever they got Jack harar oh

2767
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:34,960
that's a thing and that's the also the

2768
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:36,960
very interesting thing about this year's

2769
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:40,319
Emerald cup is that they're doing it by

2770
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:43,760
tarpine profile not by names because

2771
02:00:40,319 --> 02:00:46,279
we've got terar you know uh depending on

2772
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:48,239
the name of the genetic etc etc so by

2773
02:00:46,279 --> 02:00:51,559
actually going with these profiles I

2774
02:00:48,238 --> 02:00:53,279
think it's going to be a new dimension a

2775
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:55,679
new IA but I think it's rather

2776
02:00:53,279 --> 02:00:58,439
fascinating than just you know the

2777
02:00:55,679 --> 02:01:00,920
standard names that are out there yep

2778
02:00:58,439 --> 02:01:03,759
now I guess we just have to worry about

2779
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:05,800
varieties from seed that have multiple

2780
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:07,079
phenotypes in them with different

2781
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:09,639
turpine

2782
02:01:07,078 --> 02:01:12,158
profiles that's true man there's a lot

2783
02:01:09,639 --> 02:01:12,159
of that going

2784
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:19,078
on um it's really awesome that you know

2785
02:01:16,158 --> 02:01:21,000
have the The Knowing of the general

2786
02:01:19,078 --> 02:01:23,759
public and those different flavors I

2787
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,719
find it totally fascinating ATN and it's

2788
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:27,360
really different than the Legacy Market

2789
02:01:25,719 --> 02:01:29,319
or the traditional Market you know where

2790
02:01:27,359 --> 02:01:32,519
you were just selling pounds and it was

2791
02:01:29,319 --> 02:01:35,078
just decided upon you know the buyer and

2792
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:36,960
the buyer maybe in in his or her likes

2793
02:01:35,078 --> 02:01:38,840
and maybe that was it or what they felt

2794
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:41,800
like if they could sell to their next

2795
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:45,199
big buyer so it wasn't at all about

2796
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:47,960
consumers so I just am so fascinated

2797
02:01:45,198 --> 02:01:49,919
with what consumers are interested in

2798
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:53,279
and it's interesting too if you study

2799
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:56,078
tpin which I do and itic medicine and

2800
02:01:53,279 --> 02:01:59,279
sort of ancient Essences and Flower

2801
02:01:56,078 --> 02:02:02,198
Essences um sort of the signs of the

2802
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:04,920
time and maybe what's going on in the

2803
02:02:02,198 --> 02:02:07,198
world or even seasonally what people are

2804
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:10,480
more drawn to you know are they drawn to

2805
02:02:07,198 --> 02:02:12,879
more brighter you know turpine notes in

2806
02:02:10,479 --> 02:02:15,559
the wintertime and more earthy tones

2807
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:17,840
when it's super hot and sunny out I just

2808
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:19,400
think that that's just like incredibly

2809
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:22,440
fascinating and I think it would be

2810
02:02:19,399 --> 02:02:24,638
really fun to track and a lider

2811
02:02:22,439 --> 02:02:27,879
experiment at some

2812
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:29,880
time hey Josh one thing I wanted to add

2813
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:32,560
on the haze that you mentioning AF GUI

2814
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:35,159
is um uh Brian I had really good luck

2815
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:38,039
with the AF GUI times old meno Haze I

2816
02:02:35,158 --> 02:02:40,879
had a I got a bunch of stuff from um

2817
02:02:38,039 --> 02:02:42,399
from guey breeders that he he released I

2818
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:45,000
guess last year or something like that

2819
02:02:42,399 --> 02:02:47,559
maybe a year before and I had really

2820
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:49,920
good luck with that um particular um

2821
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:53,159
variety I think it really leaned on both

2822
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:55,520
the mom and dad there um and gave you

2823
02:02:53,158 --> 02:02:58,799
know a nice yield and and really gave

2824
02:02:55,520 --> 02:03:00,599
that that you know that Haze Vibe but um

2825
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:02,239
I'm not really um I don't really know

2826
02:03:00,599 --> 02:03:04,360
where old meno haes comes from I don't

2827
02:03:02,238 --> 02:03:08,118
know if Josh Kelly or even Sam if you

2828
02:03:04,359 --> 02:03:10,359
know what that is um but it it seemed to

2829
02:03:08,118 --> 02:03:13,078
actually produce well and then Blackjack

2830
02:03:10,359 --> 02:03:16,279
has been historically one that not the

2831
02:03:13,078 --> 02:03:18,519
best yield but it Peters on you know

2832
02:03:16,279 --> 02:03:20,479
it's so it can be so great if you grow

2833
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:22,800
it really well um that I really think

2834
02:03:20,479 --> 02:03:24,839
you know the black Domin and that one in

2835
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:27,000
the jackar really kind of equally kind

2836
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:27,880
of throw out the parent stock it's kind

2837
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:32,158
of

2838
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:34,599
cool black part of that blackberry kush

2839
02:03:32,158 --> 02:03:37,158
or no so I think black Blackjack is the

2840
02:03:34,599 --> 02:03:40,039
Black Domina oh the

2841
02:03:37,158 --> 02:03:42,960
black and then it's times to um the

2842
02:03:40,039 --> 02:03:46,000
jackar rare um I don't know which way it

2843
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:48,760
was it was created I'm not sure

2844
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:51,319
who our biggest excitement this year

2845
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:54,360
with Jack is the rainbow Jack that we

2846
02:03:51,319 --> 02:03:56,118
got from Heart Rock Mountain so big up

2847
02:03:54,359 --> 02:03:58,238
Daniel to Heart Rock Mountain and all

2848
02:03:56,118 --> 02:04:00,238
the work that they're doing on breeding

2849
02:03:58,238 --> 02:04:02,118
as well as everyone else um but the the

2850
02:04:00,238 --> 02:04:06,638
rainbow Jack was really beautiful it was

2851
02:04:02,118 --> 02:04:10,598
a incredible you have a purle purple

2852
02:04:06,639 --> 02:04:12,159
urle uh Grand I believe and I could be

2853
02:04:10,599 --> 02:04:15,119
corrected on this I think it's a

2854
02:04:12,158 --> 02:04:18,359
granddaddy granddaddy per purple urle

2855
02:04:15,118 --> 02:04:21,719
Jack and it was a really just a vigorous

2856
02:04:18,359 --> 02:04:24,639
plant it had like the crazy thick leav

2857
02:04:21,719 --> 02:04:27,800
leaves and the and the purple stock butt

2858
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:31,359
with red stripes up it so it's like

2859
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:33,520
purple with red and then when the leaves

2860
02:04:31,359 --> 02:04:35,359
came out it was like you know how the

2861
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:37,880
the where the leaf hits the stem there's

2862
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:42,039
like a hand you know where the veins pop

2863
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:44,440
out all those were bright red bright red

2864
02:04:42,039 --> 02:04:46,319
underneath with a totally Green Leaf

2865
02:04:44,439 --> 02:04:48,000
really beautiful really beautiful we we

2866
02:04:46,319 --> 02:04:49,599
had a lot of cross we did a lot of

2867
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,679
crosses with that this year that's

2868
02:04:49,599 --> 02:04:53,880
amazing I see talking about the black

2869
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:56,399
Blackberry I do remember when Blackberry

2870
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:58,800
came out kind of like a pop culture

2871
02:04:56,399 --> 02:05:01,238
phenomenon it was just so unbelievable

2872
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:03,719
i' I'd never seen that electric purple

2873
02:05:01,238 --> 02:05:06,558
I've seen some purple but that that was

2874
02:05:03,719 --> 02:05:08,399
a very special purple at the time so I'm

2875
02:05:06,559 --> 02:05:10,279
pretty sure the pinkleberry from Green

2876
02:05:08,399 --> 02:05:13,000
Green Source Gardens has some of the

2877
02:05:10,279 --> 02:05:16,039
Blackberry cush in there and it's an

2878
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:20,238
early finisher right so a lot of people

2879
02:05:16,039 --> 02:05:22,639
use the Blackberry cush as their early

2880
02:05:20,238 --> 02:05:24,238
part of their genetics and and we were

2881
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:27,078
just working we we were just working

2882
02:05:24,238 --> 02:05:30,879
with some here from uh Jordan of the

2883
02:05:27,078 --> 02:05:34,279
islands um they had a what was it the

2884
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:36,880
black Dosey dough so it was a Blackberry

2885
02:05:34,279 --> 02:05:38,599
Kush Dosey dough black dolato it was a

2886
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:40,800
black Dosey dough gelato that's what it

2887
02:05:38,599 --> 02:05:43,119
was yeah anyway it was it was really

2888
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:46,760
beautiful and it kind of did have that

2889
02:05:43,118 --> 02:05:49,238
bready sort of not cake cuz it cake is

2890
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:52,159
its own thing but it had that kind of

2891
02:05:49,238 --> 02:05:54,879
sweet I guess it's like a dessert

2892
02:05:52,158 --> 02:05:57,638
ganja you know you'd almost say I can

2893
02:05:54,880 --> 02:06:01,639
definitely say that back in the day the

2894
02:05:57,639 --> 02:06:07,000
Blackberry Kush was the most sought

2895
02:06:01,639 --> 02:06:07,819
after um varietal so I'm going back to

2896
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,920
maybe

2897
02:06:07,819 --> 02:06:13,198
[Music]

2898
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:16,319
92 no a little bit later than that 95

2899
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:18,678
maybe and the Blackberry Kush it was

2900
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:22,399
like the most sought after the highest

2901
02:06:18,679 --> 02:06:24,520
price per per pound the one that had

2902
02:06:22,399 --> 02:06:26,439
like all of the different colors and all

2903
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:28,480
of the different smells and it was

2904
02:06:26,439 --> 02:06:31,158
really cool because oddly enough we

2905
02:06:28,479 --> 02:06:32,439
would get a whole crop of that from an

2906
02:06:31,158 --> 02:06:36,679
all

2907
02:06:32,439 --> 02:06:39,479
women colletive out in Northern Cali

2908
02:06:36,679 --> 02:06:40,920
just all women growing up in the hills

2909
02:06:39,479 --> 02:06:43,198
and they were the ones that were really

2910
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:45,039
holding on to that Blackberry cushion it

2911
02:06:43,198 --> 02:06:47,799
was worth a lot out in the east coast

2912
02:06:45,039 --> 02:06:49,559
because nobody had seen those chirps or

2913
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:51,880
you know smelled those chps or seen like

2914
02:06:49,559 --> 02:06:53,880
those colors in a plant before pretty

2915
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:55,800
exciting and there there I would also

2916
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:58,359
say that there's a lot of success out

2917
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:59,800
there with our lemon mering Homestead

2918
02:06:58,359 --> 02:07:02,039
our lemon Homestead that we've been

2919
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:04,000
doing Tara Le big up to you she's been

2920
02:07:02,039 --> 02:07:06,198
out there making some really beautiful

2921
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:10,198
hashes uh with our lemon mering

2922
02:07:06,198 --> 02:07:13,000
Homestead as well um and also this tire

2923
02:07:10,198 --> 02:07:15,719
fire so I mean the skunks are amazing

2924
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:17,800
you know Duke Diamond incredible with

2925
02:07:15,719 --> 02:07:20,158
the with the Dominion seed company and

2926
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:22,279
all of the the fire I don't I don't

2927
02:07:20,158 --> 02:07:24,839
think the tire fires from Duke but we've

2928
02:07:22,279 --> 02:07:31,198
just gotten so much the CIS skunk and

2929
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:33,920
the SSC skunk the SSC skunk a lot of M

2930
02:07:31,198 --> 02:07:36,399
too do do you have the mass Super Skunk

2931
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:39,319
going on out there at all or yeah so I

2932
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:41,118
have so I have um what's known as the

2933
02:07:39,319 --> 02:07:44,039
math super skunk and there's a lot of

2934
02:07:41,118 --> 02:07:48,319
controversy behind where that came from

2935
02:07:44,039 --> 02:07:50,760
how that came about um you know I've had

2936
02:07:48,319 --> 02:07:52,599
that one for a while and um I know bod

2937
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:55,039
was working with and he's kind of

2938
02:07:52,599 --> 02:07:56,960
feeling the same way where it's a

2939
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:59,479
beautiful variety but there's it feels

2940
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:02,000
like just a a really great selection of

2941
02:07:59,479 --> 02:08:03,919
Super Skunk to me that maybe has just

2942
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:07,118
been passed around the region of New

2943
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:09,760
England New York and and um Pennsylvania

2944
02:08:07,118 --> 02:08:12,039
and the DMV area as well um because I

2945
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:15,039
know Duke diamonds worked with it a bit

2946
02:08:12,039 --> 02:08:18,039
um but it's um that's what it feels like

2947
02:08:15,039 --> 02:08:20,960
to me it's very garlicky but very

2948
02:08:18,039 --> 02:08:23,158
skunky um has a very skunky vibe to it

2949
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:24,639
it's it's really great I mean I I don't

2950
02:08:23,158 --> 02:08:25,920
want to just take anything away from it

2951
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:27,359
but there's a lot there is a lot of I'm

2952
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:29,679
sure there's people in the chat that

2953
02:08:27,359 --> 02:08:32,319
probably want to chime in on where it

2954
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:34,039
came from but it's um it's a really

2955
02:08:32,319 --> 02:08:35,759
great variety and it's it's the backbone

2956
02:08:34,039 --> 02:08:38,840
of a lot of things that we know of it's

2957
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:41,800
said to be you know one of the pieces of

2958
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:45,279
Sour Diesel um you know it's it's

2959
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:47,119
definitely a unique one um you know and

2960
02:08:45,279 --> 02:08:50,679
it is a little unstable at times you

2961
02:08:47,118 --> 02:08:50,679
have to be very careful

2962
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:56,039

2986
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:54,000
question for you guys um maybe Josh and

2987
02:09:51,719 --> 02:09:57,679
Kelly can ask what are you guys finding

2988
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:01,118
in your region that really is um little

2989
02:09:57,679 --> 02:10:04,319
effort with you know Pest Management and

2990
02:10:01,118 --> 02:10:05,759
um you know just you know General

2991
02:10:04,319 --> 02:10:08,078
environmental things are you guys

2992
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:10,360
finding some some certain varieties or

2993
02:10:08,078 --> 02:10:12,639
are things that you're gravitating more

2994
02:10:10,359 --> 02:10:14,558
towards over the years or are you guys

2995
02:10:12,639 --> 02:10:17,279
still fresh on like we we're still

2996
02:10:14,559 --> 02:10:21,520
trying stuff or you guys have any kind

2997
02:10:17,279 --> 02:10:24,519
of um things that you guys look for so

2998
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:26,239
for I wanted to invite Ka on here maybe

2999
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:30,280
next time you know from Pacific

3000
02:10:26,238 --> 02:10:32,359
Northwest Roots um his alieno crosses

3001
02:10:30,279 --> 02:10:33,840
that he made with the coffee the coffee

3002
02:10:32,359 --> 02:10:35,598
has been really good to us green Source

3003
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:38,520
has done really good with it down in

3004
02:10:35,599 --> 02:10:40,199
southern Oregon and it was one of one of

3005
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:42,639
the varieties that I can think of just

3006
02:10:40,198 --> 02:10:47,158
right off the top of my head that did

3007
02:10:42,639 --> 02:10:50,800
really unbelievable in just zero issues

3008
02:10:47,158 --> 02:10:51,879
and and incredible flavors really bright

3009
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:55,119
alien

3010
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:57,400
um flavors you know maybe it's an Al

3011
02:10:55,118 --> 02:10:59,078
some of the other alien varieties we I

3012
02:10:57,399 --> 02:11:02,558
think it might be an alien thing for

3013
02:10:59,078 --> 02:11:04,840
sure and I think what Josh is talking

3014
02:11:02,559 --> 02:11:08,239
about too is what we notice is that it's

3015
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:10,800
our varietals that do like totally

3016
02:11:08,238 --> 02:11:12,439
amazing you know year after year so

3017
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:14,559
we'll bring in a certain percentage of

3018
02:11:12,439 --> 02:11:17,359
other varietals you know and it really

3019
02:11:14,559 --> 02:11:20,279
only maybe only two to three% of those

3020
02:11:17,359 --> 02:11:22,479
ones that we bring will be vigorous that

3021
02:11:20,279 --> 02:11:25,439
will carry on maybe bring into our

3022
02:11:22,479 --> 02:11:28,959
lineage and breed and I think that those

3023
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:32,439
alien were definitely really good but

3024
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:37,679
for us I think what is the most vigorous

3025
02:11:32,439 --> 02:11:40,279
are those is our Mothership AFU what

3026
02:11:37,679 --> 02:11:44,279
Josh was saying before is sort of that

3027
02:11:40,279 --> 02:11:47,599
original it's a real Afghan sort of

3028
02:11:44,279 --> 02:11:52,078
father it's super rich it's incredibly

3029
02:11:47,599 --> 02:11:54,599
vigorous it has um candy cane Stripes of

3030
02:11:52,078 --> 02:11:59,158
purple up it and the leaf pattern is

3031
02:11:54,599 --> 02:11:59,159
specific you know to what we know and

3032
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:07,440
[Music]

3033
02:12:05,198 --> 02:12:10,118
what do

3034
02:12:07,439 --> 02:12:14,279
well that we craw

3035
02:12:10,118 --> 02:12:17,639
into it's more resistant things uh and

3036
02:12:14,279 --> 02:12:19,840
it has just a lot of count so that's

3037
02:12:17,639 --> 02:12:22,440
another thing sorry we're on a liquid

3038
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:24,920
ens so you we're a we gotta go B add the

3039
02:12:22,439 --> 02:12:27,279
glazed cherries that we've brought in

3040
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:30,199
into our world has been really amazing

3041
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:32,479
um yeah so resistant yeah totally

3042
02:12:30,198 --> 02:12:35,479
amazing and what I can say is that the

3043
02:12:32,479 --> 02:12:39,759
tarpine profiles that don't work with us

3044
02:12:35,479 --> 02:12:43,558
are definitely any of the oranges or the

3045
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:46,000
Tangy or you know we've got a gorgeous

3046
02:12:43,559 --> 02:12:49,559
African orange well it's a gorgeous

3047
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:51,719
flower but I'm working so hard at it for

3048
02:12:49,559 --> 02:12:54,039
any type of pest manag

3049
02:12:51,719 --> 02:12:57,319
because for some reason we're in a

3050
02:12:54,039 --> 02:13:01,399
non-agricultural area we only grow by

3051
02:12:57,319 --> 02:13:03,920
seeds there's nothing around us but we

3052
02:13:01,399 --> 02:13:07,158
have you know hemp aphids we have bong

3053
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:09,158
aphids that continue to come back and

3054
02:13:07,158 --> 02:13:12,158
we're really watching closely and have

3055
02:13:09,158 --> 02:13:15,439
been for many many years on what tpine

3056
02:13:12,158 --> 02:13:17,439
profiles that they're most interested in

3057
02:13:15,439 --> 02:13:20,919
and so we're really trying to stay away

3058
02:13:17,439 --> 02:13:22,558
from those turine profiles even though

3059
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:24,800
they they're really amazing and we grow

3060
02:13:22,559 --> 02:13:28,159
them anyway and you know we just work at

3061
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:30,480
it so that was

3062
02:13:28,158 --> 02:13:34,279
long-winded no that was awesome that was

3063
02:13:30,479 --> 02:13:36,598
super cool I so skunkman you know you've

3064
02:13:34,279 --> 02:13:37,679
grown more cannabis than anyone in this

3065
02:13:36,599 --> 02:13:40,078
room

3066
02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:42,920
combined what over the years have you

3067
02:13:40,078 --> 02:13:44,558
seen from your experience for dry sift

3068
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:46,719
that that's that's like something that

3069
02:13:44,559 --> 02:13:49,320
you be you know I know skunk Wan's been

3070
02:13:46,719 --> 02:13:51,719
been the main squeeze as as it's proven

3071
02:13:49,319 --> 02:13:53,840
to be for a lot of the things that I've

3072
02:13:51,719 --> 02:13:57,118
made I've come to found out that there's

3073
02:13:53,840 --> 02:14:00,039
skunk one in everything that I've done

3074
02:13:57,118 --> 02:14:01,839
um you know is there is that you know

3075
02:14:00,039 --> 02:14:03,479
skunk onean to me is is really

3076
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:04,239
interesting because it it embodies such

3077
02:14:03,479 --> 02:14:08,439
a

3078
02:14:04,238 --> 02:14:11,359
hybrid um you know what what do you

3079
02:14:08,439 --> 02:14:15,279
think you know attributes to that

3080
02:14:11,359 --> 02:14:18,039
stuff well what probably what I like

3081
02:14:15,279 --> 02:14:23,719
best about skunk number one for dry

3082
02:14:18,039 --> 02:14:27,479
sifting is it uh one you uh dried and

3083
02:14:23,719 --> 02:14:31,800
aged and cured the uh buds for a couple

3084
02:14:27,479 --> 02:14:37,919
of months then uh and so that the resin

3085
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:40,400
is more like a a a a raisin rather than

3086
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:42,279
a wet gooey

3087
02:14:40,399 --> 02:14:47,598
grape

3088
02:14:42,279 --> 02:14:50,319
uh uh skunk is very easy to work with

3089
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:54,480
because I mean what you need is number

3090
02:14:50,319 --> 02:14:57,479
one a lot of dried plant material for

3091
02:14:54,479 --> 02:15:01,759
dry sifting I'm talking about and then

3092
02:14:57,479 --> 02:15:06,359
number two which you need is

3093
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:09,679
uh you you have to have a lot of

3094
02:15:06,359 --> 02:15:11,719
it so that you can experiment and

3095
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:14,239
understand all the different uh

3096
02:15:11,719 --> 02:15:17,359
techniques and what it means to do it

3097
02:15:14,238 --> 02:15:19,959
it's it's kind of like Johnny does he he

3098
02:15:17,359 --> 02:15:25,118
sits up there and tries to find new cool

3099
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:29,480
things to do constantly but uh

3100
02:15:25,118 --> 02:15:32,558
if I don't have true favorites I mean

3101
02:15:29,479 --> 02:15:37,638
probably Hayes and skunk is is two that

3102
02:15:32,559 --> 02:15:41,199
I love the best but uh I mean whatever

3103
02:15:37,639 --> 02:15:46,520
appeals to any one individual is good

3104
02:15:41,198 --> 02:15:50,759
for them and uh any turpine profile uh

3105
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:54,719
can be appealing to different people uh

3106
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:57,320
I I I've seen stuff that I made me gag

3107
02:15:54,719 --> 02:15:59,880
but other people thought it had sort of

3108
02:15:57,319 --> 02:16:02,279
an appealing smell

3109
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:06,239
so what is

3110
02:16:02,279 --> 02:16:08,198
reality Sam you mentioned skunk and hay

3111
02:16:06,238 --> 02:16:14,118
did you ever breed those

3112
02:16:08,198 --> 02:16:18,000
together oh yeah uh all the time and uh

3113
02:16:14,118 --> 02:16:19,880
skunk uh times Haze and Haze times skunk

3114
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:22,559
I made them both they're both very

3115
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:26,199
similar and and very wonderful you can

3116
02:16:22,559 --> 02:16:29,840
get ones that are almost hazy looking

3117
02:16:26,198 --> 02:16:33,799
and smelling and tasting and effects but

3118
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:36,960
with a lot more uh muscle to them

3119
02:16:33,799 --> 02:16:41,478
meaning a bigger plant with bigger buds

3120
02:16:36,959 --> 02:16:44,518
more skunky rather than uh hazy but uh

3121
02:16:41,478 --> 02:16:48,478
also too there I I did varieties with

3122
02:16:44,519 --> 02:16:53,159
like some ties that I I had brought back

3123
02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:57,718
from Thailand and they were times uh it

3124
02:16:53,159 --> 02:17:00,679
was called Funk it was Tai ha skunk and

3125
02:16:57,718 --> 02:17:03,358
uh let me tell you people I I've seen

3126
02:17:00,679 --> 02:17:07,200
people who still have those mother

3127
02:17:03,359 --> 02:17:10,200
plants and just swear by them so I mean

3128
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:11,679
i' I've created hundreds of varieties

3129
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:15,760
and

3130
02:17:11,679 --> 02:17:18,280
uh I I just hope that somebody enjoyed

3131
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:20,398
them because my focus was primarily

3132
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:21,399
recreational even though we did a lot of

3133
02:17:20,398 --> 02:17:25,318
medical

3134
02:17:21,398 --> 02:17:28,599
work uh first uh we were really trying

3135
02:17:25,318 --> 02:17:31,279
to understand cannabis as deep as

3136
02:17:28,599 --> 02:17:35,719
possible so that we could make better

3137
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:39,760
herb and resin for the

3138
02:17:35,718 --> 02:17:42,438
folks or allow them to make their

3139
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:44,159
own yeah and you you know you definitely

3140
02:17:42,439 --> 02:17:47,398
touched everyone with all your work I

3141
02:17:44,159 --> 02:17:48,959
mean I I I love the contrast with you

3142
02:17:47,398 --> 02:17:50,638
know with Josh and Kelly you guys are

3143
02:17:48,959 --> 02:17:53,318
selecting for your region for what works

3144
02:17:50,638 --> 02:17:54,679
for for you guys and and Sam you've

3145
02:17:53,318 --> 02:17:58,000
you've been in a lot of different

3146
02:17:54,679 --> 02:18:02,439
regions and different scenarios as well

3147
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:03,840
um it's cool you know I I'm in a in a

3148
02:18:02,439 --> 02:18:05,439
situation where I'm in all these

3149
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:08,639
different environments and I'm trying to

3150
02:18:05,439 --> 02:18:10,599
learn as much as I can because it's like

3151
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:13,518
you know we have the regulated side then

3152
02:18:10,599 --> 02:18:15,558
we have the personal side and you know

3153
02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:17,920
there there's sometimes very separate

3154
02:18:15,558 --> 02:18:19,879
spaces you know um when you want to

3155
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:21,879
breed towards selective things that

3156
02:18:19,879 --> 02:18:24,398
don't really aren't towards the end of

3157
02:18:21,879 --> 02:18:26,959
like a you know an eight table room

3158
02:18:24,398 --> 02:18:28,478
that's 2500 square feet or or a field

3159
02:18:26,959 --> 02:18:31,638
you know that that's going to end up in

3160
02:18:28,478 --> 02:18:34,079
someone's Bowl so you know it's it's

3161
02:18:31,638 --> 02:18:38,438
cool to hear the the

3162
02:18:34,079 --> 02:18:41,439
contrast I I I remember growing imported

3163
02:18:38,439 --> 02:18:43,840
seeds from Afghanistan I did this many

3164
02:18:41,439 --> 02:18:46,800
different times from many different

3165
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:51,159
Imports of of seeds from

3166
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:53,920
Afghanistan uh because a after went

3167
02:18:51,159 --> 02:18:56,200
there when I was very young uh it wasn't

3168
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:59,239
really possible to go to Afghanistan

3169
02:18:56,200 --> 02:19:03,359
safely maybe a few people have done it

3170
02:18:59,239 --> 02:19:06,558
recently but uh uh yeah I mean if they

3171
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:09,239
want to kidnap a foreigner and uh hold

3172
02:19:06,558 --> 02:19:12,039
him for ransom or

3173
02:19:09,239 --> 02:19:14,159
something that's not a

3174
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:17,599
vacation there's some good traveling

3175
02:19:14,159 --> 02:19:20,558
going on earing online on IG has been

3176
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:22,359
doing some incredible travels um you

3177
02:19:20,558 --> 02:19:26,358
know a good amount of people involved in

3178
02:19:22,359 --> 02:19:28,439
their Himalayan connection online um

3179
02:19:26,359 --> 02:19:30,920
been doing some really you know amazing

3180
02:19:28,439 --> 02:19:33,719
travels and collecting a lot of strains

3181
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:38,478
um I forget

3182
02:19:33,718 --> 02:19:41,799
Baba woman hemp hemp vti hemp FTI she's

3183
02:19:38,478 --> 02:19:44,478
been Josh did you know that technically

3184
02:19:41,799 --> 02:19:46,799
it's illegal to go to a third world

3185
02:19:44,478 --> 02:19:49,438
country and collect their genetics and

3186
02:19:46,799 --> 02:19:51,840
bring them back to America you have to

3187
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:55,359
now do it it's

3188
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:57,359
there's United Nations biodiversity laws

3189
02:19:55,359 --> 02:20:00,800
against doing that

3190
02:19:57,359 --> 02:20:03,760
now Sam Sam we have a question from uh

3191
02:20:00,799 --> 02:20:08,639
the group uh do you have any information

3192
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:13,478
about the mid late 70s Fall Brook red

3193
02:20:08,639 --> 02:20:16,760
hair uh no I mean but uh I I don't know

3194
02:20:13,478 --> 02:20:19,959
who is growing in fber in the 70s that

3195
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:24,000
was out near the avocado Growers uh I

3196
02:20:19,959 --> 02:20:27,000
imagine a lot of different people and uh

3197
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:30,478
I'm not sure what the red hair was I I

3198
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:34,680
wasn't down there in the 7s I was up in

3199
02:20:30,478 --> 02:20:38,799
central California on the coast but uh

3200
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:41,159
uh yeah Fall Brook was one of the first

3201
02:20:38,799 --> 02:20:47,119
places where they were able to

3202
02:20:41,159 --> 02:20:49,359
successfully grow later Seasons sativas

3203
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:54,200
Outdoors the other question is did you

3204
02:20:49,359 --> 02:20:56,920
work with the SSS C SE bank I I gave

3205
02:20:54,200 --> 02:21:01,359
them most of my well they bought most of

3206
02:20:56,920 --> 02:21:03,760
my varieties uh you know around the same

3207
02:21:01,359 --> 02:21:10,280
time as naille so that must have been

3208
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:13,920
like 85 86 87 is uh they got skunk ha

3209
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:17,079
and a dozen other varieties that I had

3210
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:21,799
and did Greg mallister have strains in

3211
02:21:17,079 --> 02:21:24,879
there too at the time well Greg had his

3212
02:21:21,799 --> 02:21:29,719
strains being sold by

3213
02:21:24,879 --> 02:21:32,079
uh uh Neville at cannabis Castle but I'm

3214
02:21:29,719 --> 02:21:35,478
not so sure about uh

3215
02:21:32,079 --> 02:21:38,000
sssc I I I never saw his strain sued in

3216
02:21:35,478 --> 02:21:41,398
there but M maybe he did and I I just

3217
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:42,799
wasn't paying attention hey Sam I'm

3218
02:21:41,398 --> 02:21:46,318
curious who did the Northern Light

3219
02:21:42,799 --> 02:21:46,318
number five skunk hay

3220
02:21:46,799 --> 02:21:51,599
91 okay but what about it I don't know

3221
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:54,520
where it came came from it's just a bag

3222
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:56,640
SE that I had marked on a bag and I

3223
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:59,720
actually got my mail from that 12 years

3224
02:21:56,639 --> 02:22:01,439
ago that's I've been play I played with

3225
02:21:59,719 --> 02:22:03,599
and I'm just curious I'm just trying to

3226
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:05,680
find like where's where that seed bank

3227
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:08,960
came from or who actually created that

3228
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:12,639
that line say say it again Northern

3229
02:22:08,959 --> 02:22:16,438
Light number five skunk Haze I

3230
02:22:12,639 --> 02:22:19,879
think yeah well I I I was behind most of

3231
02:22:16,439 --> 02:22:23,559
the skunk haes I didn't I didn't hardly

3232
02:22:19,879 --> 02:22:27,279
work with Northern Lights at all okay so

3233
02:22:23,559 --> 02:22:31,279
uh but somebody probably got a skunk Cas

3234
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:33,960
uh either me or vi v of me and uh then

3235
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:35,399
cross at times Northern Lights himself

3236
02:22:33,959 --> 02:22:38,599
and what he got would have been

3237
02:22:35,398 --> 02:22:42,199
something a bit like silver

3238
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:45,040
Hayes so Mr Bob hemp Hill in Northern

3239
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:47,840
California and Darcy there that him that

3240
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:47,840
family

3241
02:22:48,079 --> 02:22:56,840
um crickets and of seeds amazing family

3242
02:22:52,719 --> 02:23:00,719
they've got a lot of those original um

3243
02:22:56,840 --> 02:23:03,239
probably of the largest collections of

3244
02:23:00,719 --> 02:23:05,879
original mother clones and mother plants

3245
02:23:03,239 --> 02:23:09,520
and stuff and one of the interesting

3246
02:23:05,879 --> 02:23:13,119
varieties from them on this thread top

3247
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:15,319
the 88 crazy redhaired interesting

3248
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:17,319
variety and it made a flower that was

3249
02:23:15,318 --> 02:23:19,000
probably unlike any other flower that

3250
02:23:17,318 --> 02:23:21,079
we've had in our property before which

3251
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:26,920
was

3252
02:23:21,079 --> 02:23:29,159
super fat zeroing airy no like sun

3253
02:23:26,920 --> 02:23:32,000
leaves to trim off or anything weird

3254
02:23:29,159 --> 02:23:36,920
orange long hairs and really kind of

3255
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Airy dense with crystals but not solid

3256
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:42,359
so it was like it was hard to explain

3257
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:45,559
but that all crystal no carbon all yeah

3258
02:23:42,359 --> 02:23:48,920
Kelly saying all crystal no carbon so

3259
02:23:45,559 --> 02:23:51,159
anyway the 88 G13 hash plant super good

3260
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:52,680
crickets and sakata seeds Mr Bob Hill

3261
02:23:51,159 --> 02:23:55,760
check him

3262
02:23:52,680 --> 02:24:01,680
out did you have anything to do with the

3263
02:23:55,760 --> 02:24:05,760
Freez land f r i s l n d Sam well

3264
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:09,120
freezeland was a a uh one of the

3265
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:11,439
varieties along with purple pars which

3266
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:14,399
was uh popular here in the Netherlands

3267
02:24:11,439 --> 02:24:18,279
when I first visited in

3268
02:24:14,398 --> 02:24:22,239
1984 and uh the it's still grown a

3269
02:24:18,279 --> 02:24:26,239
little bit but uh it was

3270
02:24:22,239 --> 02:24:27,840
some we do still actually from Maine we

3271
02:24:26,239 --> 02:24:31,559
got it at the regenerative conference

3272
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:33,239
it's a gg4 freezeland cross and we also

3273
02:24:31,559 --> 02:24:36,478
have a freezeland cross and I forget the

3274
02:24:33,239 --> 02:24:39,000
Breeders name wait you're saying it's GG

3275
02:24:36,478 --> 02:24:42,639
four times freezeland cross so that's

3276
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:45,719
Gorilla Glue yes definitely is I'm

3277
02:24:42,639 --> 02:24:48,639
saying we have more than one seed like

3278
02:24:45,719 --> 02:24:50,119
packet of it one of them is all freezin

3279
02:24:48,639 --> 02:24:53,760
the other one is him trying to work it

3280
02:24:50,120 --> 02:24:55,120
into the gg4 and make it finish early so

3281
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:58,159
am I right to say the freezeland

3282
02:24:55,120 --> 02:25:00,880
finishes early yeah freezeland finishes

3283
02:24:58,159 --> 02:25:06,039
fairly early it's just not really high

3284
02:25:00,879 --> 02:25:09,039
in THC or crystals but uh you

3285
02:25:06,040 --> 02:25:10,279
know it's what people were using here in

3286
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:14,040
Holland

3287
02:25:10,279 --> 02:25:17,560
Outdoors uh before the mid 80s did you

3288
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:20,319
breed with it or modify it in any way no

3289
02:25:17,559 --> 02:25:23,439
I tried to grow it I grew it in at my

3290
02:25:20,318 --> 02:25:28,359
Greenhouse in California and I didn't

3291
02:25:23,439 --> 02:25:30,120
like it so uh you know I I I just I

3292
02:25:28,359 --> 02:25:32,479
think I threw the seeds away to be

3293
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:36,079
honest what did you not like about it

3294
02:25:32,478 --> 02:25:41,039
the high the Vigor the size the growth

3295
02:25:36,079 --> 02:25:46,520
yeah to me uh I really really wanted

3296
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:50,359
plants that were uh you know the elite

3297
02:25:46,520 --> 02:25:55,000
version of whatever Arch type they are

3298
02:25:50,359 --> 02:25:59,760
if it was Mexican or Colombian or Thai

3299
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:04,040
or or whatever and the freezeland to me

3300
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:09,439
uh yeah it was it was what I used to

3301
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:12,359
call ropa doe yeah it it had THC but it

3302
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:14,680
it it wasn't screaming high now I I'm

3303
02:26:12,359 --> 02:26:18,600
not saying that all freezeland are that

3304
02:26:14,680 --> 02:26:20,960
way but uh but vast majority of because

3305
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:23,800
I got them from many different Dutch

3306
02:26:20,959 --> 02:26:26,318
sources and I took samples from their

3307
02:26:23,799 --> 02:26:29,239
plants and none of them were screaming

3308
02:26:26,318 --> 02:26:34,079
high in THC I I'm not sure if I ever saw

3309
02:26:29,239 --> 02:26:36,600
one more than 10% but whatever uh and uh

3310
02:26:34,079 --> 02:26:39,959
I didn't particularly like the taste or

3311
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:43,200
the smell or the aroma or the effects uh

3312
02:26:39,959 --> 02:26:47,719
screaming high so uh yeah it just SP bit

3313
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:51,439
of the Wayside for me so is freezeland

3314
02:26:47,719 --> 02:26:54,079
part of Ukraine is that a a

3315
02:26:51,439 --> 02:26:56,639
freand is in the Netherlands it's up in

3316
02:26:54,079 --> 02:26:59,000
the north

3317
02:26:56,639 --> 02:27:01,478
Netherlands yes you can still get some

3318
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:04,680
freezeland seeds from the real Seed Co

3319
02:27:01,478 --> 02:27:07,478
they're still offering there you go if

3320
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:10,000
if it's anything like it was I have no

3321
02:27:07,478 --> 02:27:12,119
idea I have some of the seeds I haven't

3322
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:15,239
had a chance to go through them I I was

3323
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:18,200
they were also sold by lowand Seed

3324
02:27:15,239 --> 02:27:21,000
Company one of the early Dutch ones and

3325
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:22,760
Dr V the

3326
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:24,680
uh

3327
02:27:22,760 --> 02:27:28,200
uh

3328
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:30,920
the a woman who sold seeds in the

3329
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:33,960
Netherlands in the mid

3330
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:37,040
80s so I remember the name of the seed

3331
02:27:33,959 --> 02:27:41,079
bank was the Clone only seed bank and

3332
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:43,800
that was his big like funny you know

3333
02:27:41,079 --> 02:27:44,600
name I I don't get it will you explain

3334
02:27:43,799 --> 02:27:47,799
it to

3335
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:51,720
me I'll let him explain it to you but

3336
02:27:47,799 --> 02:27:53,559
the Clone only seed bank is in Maine and

3337
02:27:51,719 --> 02:27:55,438
he's a really awesome guy so we got

3338
02:27:53,559 --> 02:27:58,959
those Freez we really liked the cross

3339
02:27:55,439 --> 02:28:00,880
with the Gigi for this time so um it was

3340
02:27:58,959 --> 02:28:03,000
something that we were going to continue

3341
02:28:00,879 --> 02:28:06,079
with and we got seeds from it and it did

3342
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:09,239
add a nice flavor to it and maybe on its

3343
02:28:06,079 --> 02:28:10,719
own the freezeland like uh F2 or

3344
02:28:09,239 --> 02:28:13,359
whatever that we got the the double

3345
02:28:10,719 --> 02:28:13,358
freezeland

3346
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:21,680
cross you're you're freezing up I think

3347
02:28:18,398 --> 02:28:24,719
we lost and yeah

3348
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:29,359
I have another question for

3349
02:28:24,719 --> 02:28:31,760
Sam flavorful so you know obviously we

3350
02:28:29,359 --> 02:28:31,760
for the

3351
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:38,279
tur hey Sam I have a question from again

3352
02:28:36,239 --> 02:28:41,279
from the chat I'm gonna say this

3353
02:28:38,279 --> 02:28:42,600
probably terribly wrong have you grown

3354
02:28:41,279 --> 02:28:46,840
the

3355
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:50,760
ziua Teno purple while in California in

3356
02:28:46,840 --> 02:28:53,799
the 70s z i h u a

3357
02:28:50,760 --> 02:28:57,920
there you go yeah yeah yeah I'm familiar

3358
02:28:53,799 --> 02:29:00,639
with Zano purple yes it's a Mexican

3359
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:03,520
variety which I think is gone now

3360
02:29:00,639 --> 02:29:06,119
because all the Mexican land races got

3361
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:10,079
hybridized with Northern American

3362
02:29:06,120 --> 02:29:12,720
varieties that Smugglers and do gooders

3363
02:29:10,079 --> 02:29:15,398
uh took down there to where there are no

3364
02:29:12,719 --> 02:29:20,559
Pure Mexican land races anymore

3365
02:29:15,398 --> 02:29:23,639
including zat too purple or uh aop

3366
02:29:20,559 --> 02:29:26,840
gold is probably now probably got Tha

3367
02:29:23,639 --> 02:29:29,959
blood in it or loud blood who

3368
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:33,159
knows we really enjoyed our aapco gold

3369
02:29:29,959 --> 02:29:37,519
that we grew out from bod seeds um it

3370
02:29:33,159 --> 02:29:40,959
was definitely you know look a lot like

3371
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:42,720
a wild you know varietal and I do

3372
02:29:40,959 --> 02:29:45,398
understand totally what you're saying

3373
02:29:42,719 --> 02:29:47,358
you know it's hard hard to get that we

3374
02:29:45,398 --> 02:29:50,879
we just recently got given seeds from

3375
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:53,040
the Colombia from Colombia in the 7s s

3376
02:29:50,879 --> 02:29:54,879
or was it early' 70s yeah we got like

3377
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:57,200
super old seeds so we're waiting on how

3378
02:29:54,879 --> 02:30:00,119
to propagate those proper and we're not

3379
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:01,760
we might do that this spring but yeah

3380
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:03,720
every once in a while a person comes out

3381
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:06,279
of the wood works with old seeds and

3382
02:30:03,719 --> 02:30:08,719
stuff from Afghanistan and and and even

3383
02:30:06,279 --> 02:30:12,720
out of out of Mexico but it is extremely

3384
02:30:08,719 --> 02:30:14,559
rare but I I do like the aao gold flavor

3385
02:30:12,719 --> 02:30:16,079
and that lemony flavor and we just

3386
02:30:14,559 --> 02:30:18,478
smoked some

3387
02:30:16,079 --> 02:30:20,000
Congo you know there's a lot of you know

3388
02:30:18,478 --> 02:30:22,438
the interesting Congo strains that are

3389
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,439
going around and that's also got a nice

3390
02:30:22,439 --> 02:30:26,680
I felt like a similar flavor to the aqua

3391
02:30:24,439 --> 02:30:28,559
Poco gold but um I don't know if anyone

3392
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:31,120
has any thoughts on that we have to duck

3393
02:30:28,559 --> 02:30:33,600
out our Internet's going out and it's um

3394
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:35,960
you know just a beautiful day so thank

3395
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:38,800
you so much for your time everyone we

3396
02:30:35,959 --> 02:30:40,919
love you see you guys keep

3397
02:30:38,799 --> 02:30:45,039
growing

3398
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:48,040
blessings bye Josh bye

3399
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:49,680
Kelly Half strains isn't that what we're

3400
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:51,399
all chasing little strains that make

3401
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:55,600
that epic

3402
02:30:51,398 --> 02:30:58,639
house so it's

3403
02:30:55,600 --> 02:31:02,720
um what we have to do is we have to

3404
02:30:58,639 --> 02:31:06,920
breed hashish varieties that have resen

3405
02:31:02,719 --> 02:31:10,398
the size of grapes so you can just

3406
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:16,040
freeze it so it's rock hard for shake it

3407
02:31:10,398 --> 02:31:18,519
and uh you know a single resin will fill

3408
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:23,000
many

3409
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:26,680

clubhous yeah I find you know the bridal

3416
02:31:44,559 --> 02:31:50,559
that work for me have obviously the

3417
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:52,880
largest largest heads but um it also

3418
02:31:50,559 --> 02:31:54,760
depends on what you're trying to do with

3419
02:31:52,879 --> 02:31:56,879
the material if you're trying to get

3420
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:58,200
full melt heads then you know you're

3421
02:31:56,879 --> 02:31:59,679
going to want to be really gentle and

3422
02:31:58,200 --> 02:32:02,600
you need those larger heads if you're

3423
02:31:59,680 --> 02:32:04,559
going to try to make you know an edible

3424
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:06,399
or a tincture you could probably wash

3425
02:32:04,559 --> 02:32:08,799
for a really long time and get a much

3426
02:32:06,398 --> 02:32:10,799
larger yield and knock some of those

3427
02:32:08,799 --> 02:32:13,478
heads that otherwise would never come

3428
02:32:10,799 --> 02:32:15,119
off I was just imagining what those

3429
02:32:13,478 --> 02:32:19,199
actual plants would look like that

3430
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:23,720
actually have grap size can you imagine

3431
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:26,479
the size actual plan yeah I mean come on

3432
02:32:23,719 --> 02:32:30,278
Sam we got to get you out of retirement

3433
02:32:26,478 --> 02:32:33,679
man well I I have the vision I just

3434
02:32:30,279 --> 02:32:37,359
don't have the willpower

3435
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:39,520
anymore I was told one of those uh old

3436
02:32:37,359 --> 02:32:41,840
um you know wives tales you hear in your

3437
02:32:39,520 --> 02:32:44,120
smoking circles is that you can

3438
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:46,000
accomplish that if there's a particular

3439
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:48,520
growth cycle during the plant and you

3440
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:50,439
graph them together at this particular

3441
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:53,239
day in the growth cycle then you could

3442
02:32:50,439 --> 02:32:56,279
actually double the THC of your plant I

3443
02:32:53,239 --> 02:32:56,279
was like good luck with

3444
02:32:56,439 --> 02:33:01,559
that I I wish them all the best they're

3445
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:04,960
G to need help

3446
02:33:01,559 --> 02:33:04,959
though yeah a

3447
02:33:06,439 --> 02:33:11,479
lot yeah I mean Oregon CBD is doing

3448
02:33:10,159 --> 02:33:13,200
things at scale I'd love to see what

3449
02:33:11,478 --> 02:33:16,920
they do with drug cultivars if they

3450
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:16,920
start start doing more with

3451
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:22,120
that they've had some uh some

3452
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:24,840
breakthroughs in terms of

3453
02:33:22,120 --> 02:33:26,880
uh the things that they've been breeding

3454
02:33:24,840 --> 02:33:29,159
on the H at least on the hemp

3455
02:33:26,879 --> 02:33:32,438
side basically a lot of the work youve

3456
02:33:29,159 --> 02:33:36,719
been doing uh Sam I mean single canono

3457
02:33:32,439 --> 02:33:40,200
you know C brial SE Seth was a friend uh

3458
02:33:36,719 --> 02:33:44,478
he invited me several times up to

3459
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:47,640
visit them up in Oregon but uh the whole

3460
02:33:44,478 --> 02:33:49,840
Co thing is sort of not I I I would have

3461
02:33:47,639 --> 02:33:53,398
already been up there to to see what

3462
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:55,880
they're up to but uh yeah no I I I I

3463
02:33:53,398 --> 02:33:59,760
think it's great that people are picking

3464
02:33:55,879 --> 02:34:03,278
up uh uh ideas that I first exploited 20

3465
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:06,359
years ago and uh running further with

3466
02:34:03,279 --> 02:34:09,200
them I I I think it's wonderful I stood

3467
02:34:06,359 --> 02:34:12,680
on the back of Giants and uh if they

3468
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:15,880
want to put one foot up on one of my

3469
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:19,559
shoulders I'm happy that they're doing

3470
02:34:15,879 --> 02:34:21,278
it hey Sam so you know you've made your

3471
02:34:19,559 --> 02:34:23,039
more more than your share of mistakes

3472
02:34:21,279 --> 02:34:25,200
going through and doing this and as well

3473
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:28,560
as your successes what would you tell

3474
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:30,120
these people to avoid do doing so that

3475
02:34:28,559 --> 02:34:33,119
they could save themselves a little bit

3476
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:37,960
of time and mistakes along the

3477
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:41,800
way uh well it might be as simple as

3478
02:34:37,959 --> 02:34:45,000
don't do things that don't feel right in

3479
02:34:41,799 --> 02:34:48,398
in your heart I mean really go after

3480
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:52,359
your dreams don't you

3481
02:34:48,398 --> 02:34:55,239
know do do stuff you don't want to

3482
02:34:52,359 --> 02:34:58,840
do it's really almost that

3483
02:34:55,239 --> 02:35:01,039
simple do what feels right I I know that

3484
02:34:58,840 --> 02:35:04,159
you've had to listen to that and I'm

3485
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:07,240
sure you've had many authors of uh

3486
02:35:04,159 --> 02:35:11,119
nefarious uh uh individuals trying to

3487
02:35:07,239 --> 02:35:15,398
suck you into their uh black hole but uh

3488
02:35:11,120 --> 02:35:17,319
you know it's the just because it's an

3489
02:35:15,398 --> 02:35:20,278
easy way to make money doesn't mean it's

3490
02:35:17,318 --> 02:35:23,559
a good thing

3491
02:35:20,279 --> 02:35:27,720
oh yeah and being that litmist of um

3492
02:35:23,559 --> 02:35:30,159
Integrity as well as honesty is why we

3493
02:35:27,719 --> 02:35:32,239
have to educate ourselves as best as

3494
02:35:30,159 --> 02:35:34,318
possible so that we can know the

3495
02:35:32,239 --> 02:35:37,119
[ __ ] so we can see through it so we

3496
02:35:34,318 --> 02:35:39,559
can call it out which I know I I you

3497
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:41,200
know you do so effectively because you

3498
02:35:39,559 --> 02:35:44,159
know from the experience that you've

3499
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:44,159
been through and done

3500
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:54,239
so I I hardly have an answer it's a yeah

3501
02:35:51,799 --> 02:35:58,679
I mean anybody who's been in this

3502
02:35:54,239 --> 02:36:02,600
business very long has seen uh double

3503
02:35:58,680 --> 02:36:05,398
dealing [ __ ] talking you know people

3504
02:36:02,600 --> 02:36:09,079
it's it's the nature of the game it's

3505
02:36:05,398 --> 02:36:12,358
kind of like a candle and all the moths

3506
02:36:09,079 --> 02:36:15,559
are drawn to it but both good and bad

3507
02:36:12,359 --> 02:36:18,159
moths but there's lots of moops out

3508
02:36:15,559 --> 02:36:22,318
there oh yeah I have had the DEA

3509
02:36:18,159 --> 02:36:22,318
actually serve me war at my

3510
02:36:22,799 --> 02:36:27,199
dispensary don't recommend it it's not

3511
02:36:24,959 --> 02:36:29,159
very fun but you know that's you know

3512
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:32,279
when you're when you're doing this it's

3513
02:36:29,159 --> 02:36:32,279
gonna you're gonna get all

3514
02:36:33,159 --> 02:36:40,719
kinds yeah true story well said

3515

Sam very well

3516
02:36:42,159 --> 02:36:48,239

3517
02:36:44,719 --> 02:36:51,559
me and uh I I'd love the talk to you Sam

3518
02:36:48,239 --> 02:36:54,199
about about light about LEDs about about

3519
02:36:51,559 --> 02:36:56,119
HPS lighting and just a new technology

3520
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:58,600
that is really changing the game and the

3521
02:36:56,120 --> 02:37:01,600
gardens that we're seeing and any

3522
02:36:58,600 --> 02:37:01,600
thoughts on on

3523
02:37:03,639 --> 02:37:09,840
that I have a question people who use

3524
02:37:06,559 --> 02:37:13,398
LED lights do they find that they're

3525
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:17,398
better for veg because I've I I I've

3526
02:37:13,398 --> 02:37:21,478
seen veg use and I agree they they're

3527
02:37:17,398 --> 02:37:24,920
Dynamite but for flowering do people

3528
02:37:21,478 --> 02:37:26,840
think that they're truly the best source

3529
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:32,879
or just cheaper

3530
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:35,318
or better light lumens or or not lumens

3531
02:37:32,879 --> 02:37:39,799
uh wavelengths

3532
02:37:35,318 --> 02:37:43,119
uh who really thinks that LEDs are

3533
02:37:39,799 --> 02:37:45,599
better than other systems and they have

3534
02:37:43,120 --> 02:37:48,240
the experience to know the

3535
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:51,279
difference um I will raise my hand here

3536
02:37:48,239 --> 02:37:56,079
because my company is using fluent uh

3537
02:37:51,279 --> 02:37:59,159
LEDs in Nevada uh I have grown in uh on

3538
02:37:56,079 --> 02:38:02,200
various lights Etc uh it is definitely

3539
02:37:59,159 --> 02:38:06,840
cheaper um it was definitely it had its

3540
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:09,359
own overall cost but uh due to uh you

3541
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:12,239
know heat issues that you have being in

3542
02:38:09,359 --> 02:38:16,159
Nevada especially during the oh Spring

3543
02:38:12,239 --> 02:38:19,478
to Fall uh you know Heat's a huge issue

3544
02:38:16,159 --> 02:38:21,398
for us so uh we've been able to uh

3545
02:38:19,478 --> 02:38:24,358
Supply our demand and we've been in

3546
02:38:21,398 --> 02:38:26,920
action for a few years but you know

3547
02:38:24,359 --> 02:38:29,239
we're not huge we're not large and it

3548
02:38:26,920 --> 02:38:32,680
works for us the initial thought was to

3549
02:38:29,239 --> 02:38:36,398
be able to stack um and have more lights

3550
02:38:32,680 --> 02:38:38,840
inside which is why we went LEDs there

3551
02:38:36,398 --> 02:38:41,639
um but again just due to availability of

3552
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:44,318
size we can't grow outdoors in Nevada in

3553
02:38:41,639 --> 02:38:46,079
the desert it's just impossible whereas

3554
02:38:44,318 --> 02:38:50,439
here in central violent California

3555
02:38:46,079 --> 02:38:54,279
that's different so for us it was a uh

3556
02:38:50,439 --> 02:38:56,960
it was multiple decisions in arriving at

3557
02:38:54,279 --> 02:39:00,479
that and I've went and I also toured

3558
02:38:56,959 --> 02:39:04,159
multiple facilities including uh up in

3559
02:39:00,478 --> 02:39:05,879
Alaska I saw multiple Growers uh and

3560
02:39:04,159 --> 02:39:08,680
I've been in multiple Gardens and they

3561
02:39:05,879 --> 02:39:11,358
use fluent lights which is why I decided

3562
02:39:08,680 --> 02:39:14,318
to go with them in the end they seem to

3563
02:39:11,359 --> 02:39:16,800
uh to work as well as I I've not I don't

3564
02:39:14,318 --> 02:39:20,278
have a facility built out currently in

3565
02:39:16,799 --> 02:39:23,478
Nevada Sam so I can say you know here's

3566
02:39:20,279 --> 02:39:26,640
uh you know uh metal highight or HPS

3567
02:39:23,478 --> 02:39:28,438
versus uh my fluence all I started there

3568
02:39:26,639 --> 02:39:30,760
because I had to make the decision

3569
02:39:28,439 --> 02:39:32,920
because of the factory that's there and

3570
02:39:30,760 --> 02:39:34,398
it has been beneficial and has been

3571
02:39:32,920 --> 02:39:38,359
working for us

3572
02:39:34,398 --> 02:39:40,000
so do you see any differences in yield

3573
02:39:38,359 --> 02:39:42,920
or

3574
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:45,600
quality uh I could probably get a better

3575
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:48,478
yield and a little better quality is my

3576
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:50,479
assumption if I had you know different

3577
02:39:48,478 --> 02:39:52,559
lights but we been very pleased and

3578
02:39:50,478 --> 02:39:54,639
happy with the product and the flowers

3579
02:39:52,559 --> 02:39:56,959
that have been coming forward but again

3580
02:39:54,639 --> 02:39:58,680
I don't that's just my own previous

3581
02:39:56,959 --> 02:40:00,959
Growing Experience from working with Ed

3582
02:39:58,680 --> 02:40:03,880
Rosenthal and others because I grew

3583
02:40:00,959 --> 02:40:06,599
under various lights in very different

3584
02:40:03,879 --> 02:40:09,559
experimental situations from growing in

3585
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:12,159
socks to growing in soiless to growing

3586
02:40:09,559 --> 02:40:15,318
in soil to living soil versus potted

3587
02:40:12,159 --> 02:40:17,920
soil so I have a bit of experience but

3588
02:40:15,318 --> 02:40:21,398
again here it was you know Hydroponic

3589
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:24,239
and uh going in with uh these lights

3590
02:40:21,398 --> 02:40:26,680
because of what the dictation of the

3591
02:40:24,239 --> 02:40:28,799
laws as well as the region I was growing

3592
02:40:26,680 --> 02:40:31,880
in so I wouldn't do that here in

3593
02:40:28,799 --> 02:40:33,719
California but there in Nevada it made

3594
02:40:31,879 --> 02:40:37,318
sense and

3595
02:40:33,719 --> 02:40:43,039
dollars yes well more and more people

3596
02:40:37,318 --> 02:40:46,879
tell me that uh LED is as good or better

3597
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:49,319
some say than high pressure sodium or

3598
02:40:46,879 --> 02:40:52,000
metal highight so that that's what I was

3599
02:40:49,318 --> 02:40:54,799
ious about

3600
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:57,799
yeah in all all of those settings I

3601
02:40:54,799 --> 02:41:00,438
actually had a facility where we had led

3602
02:40:57,799 --> 02:41:04,599
in two rooms we had a mix Spectrum in a

3603
02:41:00,439 --> 02:41:08,479
room and then the rest were all all um

3604
02:41:04,600 --> 02:41:10,600
HPS and I found that certain varieties

3605
02:41:08,478 --> 02:41:12,358
performed better under certain light

3606
02:41:10,600 --> 02:41:15,159
light spectrums and certain light

3607
02:41:12,359 --> 02:41:17,960
intensities and also D Daily Light

3608
02:41:15,159 --> 02:41:20,159
intervals um but you know I was getting

3609
02:41:17,959 --> 02:41:21,719
you know in terms of sure sheer yield

3610
02:41:20,159 --> 02:41:23,478
like I was still hitting we like we

3611
02:41:21,719 --> 02:41:27,639
ended up hitting around three pounds per

3612
02:41:23,478 --> 02:41:29,799
light on LEDs so it performs you know

3613
02:41:27,639 --> 02:41:32,079
and and the resin's really good because

3614
02:41:29,799 --> 02:41:34,358
you can really dial it in but I think it

3615
02:41:32,079 --> 02:41:37,520
it goes back to what type of light

3616
02:41:34,359 --> 02:41:40,239
you're using and how well that's built

3617
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:43,479
and not every manufacturer makes the

3618
02:41:40,239 --> 02:41:46,159
same you know you know they just don't

3619
02:41:43,478 --> 02:41:47,519
make the same lights so I think that is

3620
02:41:46,159 --> 02:41:50,799
also a factor when you're dealing with

3621
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:52,399
LEDs you know I I like fluence a lot I

3622
02:41:50,799 --> 02:41:54,679
think fluence is really great I think

3623
02:41:52,398 --> 02:41:57,559
they have a a really nice line of light

3624
02:41:54,680 --> 02:41:59,680
so they're they've really thought about

3625
02:41:57,559 --> 02:42:01,799
you know what it means to be an as an

3626
02:41:59,680 --> 02:42:04,318
LED manufacturer in the Cannabis space

3627
02:42:01,799 --> 02:42:05,759
so I really like what they're doing um

3628
02:42:04,318 --> 02:42:08,398
but there's also other manufacturers

3629
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:10,359
that are doing awesome stuff too um I

3630
02:42:08,398 --> 02:42:12,079
know that Johnny B is working with some

3631
02:42:10,359 --> 02:42:14,920
some people up in Canada that are also

3632
02:42:12,079 --> 02:42:18,520
doing some great stuff so my experience

3633
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:20,239
is that it's it it has a lot to do with

3634
02:42:18,520 --> 02:42:21,760
your growing stuff it has a lot to do

3635
02:42:20,239 --> 02:42:24,478
with the varietal that you're you're

3636
02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:26,040
growing with um and then of course your

3637
02:42:24,478 --> 02:42:27,959
environmental controls but they're

3638
02:42:26,040 --> 02:42:31,319
they're really awesome Sam I think the

3639
02:42:27,959 --> 02:42:33,239
resin is is is

3640
02:42:31,318 --> 02:42:35,318
impressive yeah I was going to say I've

3641
02:42:33,239 --> 02:42:37,559
been looking at the LED lights now for

3642
02:42:35,318 --> 02:42:39,278
over a year I started growing with LED

3643
02:42:37,559 --> 02:42:40,959
lights with Spectrum king led in the

3644
02:42:39,279 --> 02:42:43,200
very beginning and I saw that difference

3645
02:42:40,959 --> 02:42:45,239
right away with resin for first balance

3646
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:48,319
that's why I really liked LEDs was just

3647
02:42:45,239 --> 02:42:49,680
specifically for the resin but as as I

3648
02:42:48,318 --> 02:42:51,439
really started looking at the different

3649
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:53,079
spectrums and like I say now it's kind

3650
02:42:51,439 --> 02:42:54,639
of like what car do you want to drive

3651
02:42:53,079 --> 02:42:58,120
and where you going to park it because

3652
02:42:54,639 --> 02:43:00,639
there's 256 LED companies that are DLC

3653
02:42:58,120 --> 02:43:02,040
listed as of last week so this this is

3654
02:43:00,639 --> 02:43:05,000
like the next Green rush for the

3655
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:06,600
Cannabis industry really it is is LEDs a

3656
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:09,680
from one they're more efficient they're

3657
02:43:06,600 --> 02:43:12,000
growing better resin um we we're getting

3658
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:14,840
better uh air control because we're not

3659
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:17,000
dumping with AC units and and all this

3660
02:43:14,840 --> 02:43:19,120
but there is definitely uh a big rush

3661
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:22,079
with LEDs and I'm kind of looking more

3662
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:24,200
more towards those uh you know those 16

3663
02:43:22,079 --> 02:43:25,719
18 weeks sativas and what spectrum

3664
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:28,479
they're growing under and seeing what

3665
02:43:25,719 --> 02:43:30,199
they can do with that with LEDs but uh

3666
02:43:28,478 --> 02:43:33,119
with the far red that's what I've been

3667
02:43:30,200 --> 02:43:34,840
testing with the Alias LED um I think

3668
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:37,000
everybody's been seeing my Instagram

3669
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:38,398
what I've been doing I've seen such a um

3670
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:40,680
it's probably the best crop I've ever

3671
02:43:38,398 --> 02:43:43,000
grown right now is growing with LEDs and

3672
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:46,800
really learning VPD

3673
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:50,920
ppfd dat DLI dialing in those numbers

3674
02:43:46,799 --> 02:43:55,438
and um wow I'm just see

3675
02:43:50,920 --> 02:43:58,439
Johnny do you ever grow with

3676
02:43:55,439 --> 02:44:00,159
sunshine I have but you know what um

3677
02:43:58,439 --> 02:44:01,318
back in the days I used to do a lot of

3678
02:44:00,159 --> 02:44:02,639
good little gardening because that's how

3679
02:44:01,318 --> 02:44:04,760
we used to do everything was out in the

3680
02:44:02,639 --> 02:44:06,920
bushes like out s here and there like

3681
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:09,439
where I used to live um and those are

3682
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:11,840
always like the blueberries or or a

3683
02:44:09,439 --> 02:44:13,600
greenhouse with Sunshine not a

3684
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:15,359
greenhouse me specifically I've been

3685
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:21,239
growing

3686
02:44:15,359 --> 02:44:24,680
indoors for 15 20 years probably 15

3687
02:44:21,239 --> 02:44:27,199
years well the the sun is an amazing

3688
02:44:24,680 --> 02:44:30,040
source of

3689
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:32,399
light yeah but nothing finishes here in

3690
02:44:30,040 --> 02:44:34,359
my backyard that well just because of

3691
02:44:32,398 --> 02:44:36,358
the Pacific Northwest I've always had

3692
02:44:34,359 --> 02:44:37,760
problems with the oakd doors um

3693
02:44:36,359 --> 02:44:41,640
definitely seeing the difference between

3694
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:43,478
going from HPS to LEDs was a difference

3695
02:44:41,639 --> 02:44:46,199
and recently I was in a place where

3696
02:44:43,478 --> 02:44:47,840
someone was vegging with uh a gavita

3697
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:49,960
dual end and Bes saw that they had an

3698
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:51,760
LED light and directly underneath the

3699
02:44:49,959 --> 02:44:52,959
plants directly underneath the uh the

3700
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:56,000
Dual and gavita we're actually

3701
02:44:52,959 --> 02:44:57,799
stretching towards the LED light so I I

3702
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:59,478
was just smiling because I was like

3703
02:44:57,799 --> 02:45:01,159
that's just just that's that's the

3704
02:44:59,478 --> 02:45:04,318
difference that we're seeing right now

3705
02:45:01,159 --> 02:45:07,159
and uh outdoor resin I like um but

3706
02:45:04,318 --> 02:45:10,079
indoor resin's always being my go-to

3707
02:45:07,159 --> 02:45:13,359
just because of where I am in the in the

3708
02:45:10,079 --> 02:45:17,439
world now but the way you can use a

3709
02:45:13,359 --> 02:45:20,880
greenhouse in Canada is with a darkening

3710
02:45:17,439 --> 02:45:23,159
system that way you use the Sun but you

3711
02:45:20,879 --> 02:45:25,478
darken it and you can finish a crop

3712
02:45:23,159 --> 02:45:28,079
before it gets too

3713
02:45:25,478 --> 02:45:30,159
cold yeah I just uh recently was just at

3714
02:45:28,079 --> 02:45:32,120
a greenhouse in Robert's Creek that was

3715
02:45:30,159 --> 02:45:33,680
state-ofthe-art and I was out testing

3716
02:45:32,120 --> 02:45:36,399
its uh their lights and they had these

3717
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:38,200
lights from NASA and uh did it have a

3718
02:45:36,398 --> 02:45:40,799
darkening system it had a whole

3719
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:43,319
darkening system on the inside oh that's

3720
02:45:40,799 --> 02:45:46,239
what you need you try one of those and

3721
02:45:43,318 --> 02:45:47,879
you might really like it yeah I'm

3722
02:45:46,239 --> 02:45:50,318
definitely be going up there and looking

3723
02:45:47,879 --> 02:45:52,159
at this over the next like year like I'm

3724
02:45:50,318 --> 02:45:53,840
I'm I've been I'll be going up every

3725
02:45:52,159 --> 02:45:56,680
month every couple weeks to look at this

3726
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:58,040
greenhouse all living soils I stepped on

3727
02:45:56,680 --> 02:46:00,559
the Betty freaked I was like what are

3728
02:45:58,040 --> 02:46:01,840
you doing that's all living so I can't

3729
02:46:00,559 --> 02:46:03,359
wait to see what they're growing there

3730
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:05,159
and they're going to be growing sativas

3731
02:46:03,359 --> 02:46:10,559
so um I'm really looking forward to

3732
02:46:05,159 --> 02:46:13,478
seeing outdoor grown um properly run um

3733
02:46:10,559 --> 02:46:15,199
strains yeah I've seen amazing stuff

3734
02:46:13,478 --> 02:46:17,438
here in Northern California I've grown

3735
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:19,920
outdoors in Southern California and

3736
02:46:17,439 --> 02:46:22,520
Northern California both great

3737
02:46:19,920 --> 02:46:24,439
environments phenomenal of course uh

3738
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:26,560
Southern California I got hit with those

3739
02:46:24,439 --> 02:46:29,040
damn moths that lay these little

3740
02:46:26,559 --> 02:46:31,278
caterpillars way at the base of your

3741
02:46:29,040 --> 02:46:33,800
plant and I I was sitting on my deck one

3742
02:46:31,279 --> 02:46:36,800
day and I was like why is my top Bud

3743
02:46:33,799 --> 02:46:38,759
moving around and all of a sudden Boop

3744
02:46:36,799 --> 02:46:40,478
out pops a little caterpillar head like

3745
02:46:38,760 --> 02:46:43,120
oh yeah right that's problem with

3746
02:46:40,478 --> 02:46:43,119
Outdoors damn

3747
02:46:43,159 --> 02:46:47,559
it yeah I think the light depths come a

3748
02:46:45,359 --> 02:46:49,559
long way man I'm I'm working on a a

3749
02:46:47,559 --> 02:46:52,398
hybrid Greenhouse that

3750
02:46:49,559 --> 02:46:55,559
incorporates pretty much everything for

3751
02:46:52,398 --> 02:46:57,599
a year round setting and um some really

3752
02:46:55,559 --> 02:47:00,719
tight air exchanges for going through

3753
02:46:57,600 --> 02:47:03,079
HEPA filters and I'm really I I really

3754
02:47:00,719 --> 02:47:05,318
love where you know things are headed

3755
02:47:03,079 --> 02:47:07,039
with Greenhouse in the capabilities for

3756
02:47:05,318 --> 02:47:09,600
for what we're we're trying to do at

3757
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:11,840
least it's uh it feels like it's come a

3758
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:13,359
long way and I mean Sam I don't you know

3759
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:15,478
at the same time it feels like not much

3760
02:47:13,359 --> 02:47:18,200
has changed but

3761
02:47:15,478 --> 02:47:20,159
um you know I think the systems

3762
02:47:18,200 --> 02:47:21,520
themselves are amazing like it's it's

3763
02:47:20,159 --> 02:47:25,760
pretty incredible what's out there right

3764
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:29,640
now between ggs and NEX NEX systems and

3765
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:32,920
I I I go to the uh agricultural

3766
02:47:29,639 --> 02:47:35,039
Greenhouse uh show here in the

3767
02:47:32,920 --> 02:47:38,680
Netherlands every year it's the world's

3768
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:43,040
biggest yeah and uh but this year they

3769
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:45,600
cancelled it because of covid but uh I I

3770
02:47:43,040 --> 02:47:48,200
see all the latest

3771
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:51,479
state-of-the-art uh stuff and cannabis

3772
02:47:48,200 --> 02:47:55,279
Growers openly sell and advertise there

3773
02:47:51,478 --> 02:47:57,959
now because it's accepted it's legal for

3774
02:47:55,279 --> 02:48:02,520
medical uses at least in most countries

3775
02:47:57,959 --> 02:48:04,318
so the world is changing step by step

3776
02:48:02,520 --> 02:48:07,960
yeah yeah we just need fertigation to

3777
02:48:04,318 --> 02:48:11,199
catch up so we can get away from The Cut

3778
02:48:07,959 --> 02:48:13,559
Flower industry still stuck on ventury

3779
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:15,920
systems so it's just drives me crazy

3780
02:48:13,559 --> 02:48:18,000
because we want to be efficient but we

3781
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:20,398
also want to use inputs that go beyond

3782
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:23,079
the capabilities of these systems and it

3783
02:48:20,398 --> 02:48:24,799
becomes difficult um especially when you

3784
02:48:23,079 --> 02:48:26,799
want to use organic inputs it's like

3785
02:48:24,799 --> 02:48:29,398
nearly impossible at sometimes

3786
02:48:26,799 --> 02:48:30,199
especially DP drip irrigation it becomes

3787
02:48:29,398 --> 02:48:32,920
a

3788
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:34,560
battle and then now you know Mal

3789
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:36,760
nutrition happens and you're just trying

3790
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:38,799
to you know it's just the it's the

3791
02:48:36,760 --> 02:48:41,520
mechanics you know it has nothing to do

3792
02:48:38,799 --> 02:48:45,000
with your your your skill

3793
02:48:41,520 --> 02:48:48,279
sets you can focus on the problems or

3794
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:51,120
you can focus on the solutions because

3795
02:48:48,279 --> 02:48:53,560
I've never seen a problem that you

3796
02:48:51,120 --> 02:48:56,479
couldn't find a solution for to be

3797
02:48:53,559 --> 02:48:58,398
honest I agree that was one thing that

3798
02:48:56,478 --> 02:49:00,119
they always taught us in the military is

3799
02:48:58,398 --> 02:49:03,719
don't present a problem without a

3800
02:49:00,120 --> 02:49:06,600
solution you know forces you to think so

3801
02:49:03,719 --> 02:49:09,000
my solution is we need we we need um we

3802
02:49:06,600 --> 02:49:11,079
need more sophistication in terms of our

3803
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:14,279
our inje injection systems and we just

3804
02:49:11,079 --> 02:49:17,120
need to replace them with um a very

3805
02:49:14,279 --> 02:49:19,920
simple setup that's based on on pumps

3806
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:21,479
that are that are not these ventes I

3807
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:24,359
think it's a very simple fix it's just

3808
02:49:21,478 --> 02:49:27,318
doing it which I'm in the middle of so

3809
02:49:24,359 --> 02:49:29,760
I'll let you know when I when I get

3810
02:49:27,318 --> 02:49:31,959
there about to say if you're not if you

3811
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:34,600
don't know what it is then create it so

3812
02:49:31,959 --> 02:49:37,159
then create it no

3813
02:49:34,600 --> 02:49:38,840
doubt Wade are you are what are you up

3814
02:49:37,159 --> 02:49:40,680
to with uh with all the things that

3815
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:42,439
you're doing are you are you using um

3816
02:49:40,680 --> 02:49:44,398
drip irrigation like how how are you

3817
02:49:42,439 --> 02:49:46,840
guys managing a lot of your

3818
02:49:44,398 --> 02:49:49,079
stuff well

3819
02:49:46,840 --> 02:49:51,079
um because of the way the California

3820
02:49:49,079 --> 02:49:54,478
Market works I don't have commercial

3821
02:49:51,079 --> 02:49:56,959
cannabis activity allowed on my farm um

3822
02:49:54,478 --> 02:49:59,840
so I have personal use grow which I I'm

3823
02:49:56,959 --> 02:50:02,519
in the ground and I give them water when

3824
02:49:59,840 --> 02:50:05,439
they need it uh we have abundant

3825
02:50:02,520 --> 02:50:06,680
beautiful water uh here on the property

3826
02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:09,439
and

3827
02:50:06,680 --> 02:50:12,159
U uh I always found when I was working

3828
02:50:09,439 --> 02:50:14,079
indoors that yeah irrigation was an

3829
02:50:12,159 --> 02:50:15,920
interesting problem to sort out with

3830
02:50:14,079 --> 02:50:17,959
organic nutrients it's really a

3831
02:50:15,920 --> 02:50:20,478
challenge uh it's part of why I really

3832
02:50:17,959 --> 02:50:22,159
enjoy working outdoors in the Sun and

3833
02:50:20,478 --> 02:50:24,920
yeah Sam is totally right the best light

3834
02:50:22,159 --> 02:50:27,559
you can get is the Sun and it's

3835
02:50:24,920 --> 02:50:31,439
free but all of that being said yeah I'm

3836
02:50:27,559 --> 02:50:34,238
still doing uh uh what I think of as

3837
02:50:31,439 --> 02:50:37,200
compassion work I just last night had a

3838
02:50:34,238 --> 02:50:41,199
pretty depressing conversation with u

3839
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:43,520
actually the very first family that I

3840
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:46,920
contacted uh where there was a

3841
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:50,000
catastrophic situation going on and uh

3842
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:53,000
their son just got out of the Hospital

3843
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:55,879
uh from a septic uh

3844
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:58,318
infection uh bacterial infection it

3845
02:50:55,879 --> 02:51:01,079
wasn't clear it's still not clear how he

3846
02:50:58,318 --> 02:51:02,760
contracted the infection but uh while he

3847
02:51:01,079 --> 02:51:05,680
was in the hospital they put him back on

3848
02:51:02,760 --> 02:51:08,238
some of his anti-seizure medications and

3849
02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:13,159
so I was talking with mom about that and

3850
02:51:08,238 --> 02:51:16,879
suggesting um that she that we would uh

3851
02:51:13,159 --> 02:51:19,079
try and find some CBG and some and I'm

3852
02:51:16,879 --> 02:51:20,959
going to see about getting her set up to

3853
02:51:19,079 --> 02:51:24,000
be able to juice some fresh cannabis

3854
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:26,318
plants to see if that doesn't help him

3855
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:28,040
stabilize uh because of the acid forms

3856
02:51:26,318 --> 02:51:32,398
that are found in fresh

3857
02:51:28,040 --> 02:51:37,840
juice um but the real focus of my time

3858
02:51:32,398 --> 02:51:39,639
these days um is about education I've uh

3859
02:51:37,840 --> 02:51:42,960
uh entered into a contract with a local

3860
02:51:39,639 --> 02:51:45,039
dispensary and um have created an

3861
02:51:42,959 --> 02:51:48,159
education program for their Wellness

3862
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:51,000
Associates as I call them and uh and

3863
02:51:48,159 --> 02:51:53,318
whole another line of uh classes if you

3864
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:57,159
will for the public uh because I've

3865
02:51:53,318 --> 02:51:59,159
realized that most most folks who know

3866
02:51:57,159 --> 02:52:01,119
cannabis what they know about it is it

3867
02:51:59,159 --> 02:52:02,719
gets just owned and they don't know much

3868
02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:06,040
more about it but they've heard there's

3869
02:52:02,719 --> 02:52:08,879
other benefits available and so the

3870
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:11,479
focus there is just on educating how

3871
02:52:08,879 --> 02:52:13,358
cannabis products work in the body how

3872
02:52:11,478 --> 02:52:17,318
that system the endoc conoid system

3873
02:52:13,359 --> 02:52:18,840
functions and then um how to relate to

3874
02:52:17,318 --> 02:52:23,000
the products that are available in the

3875
02:52:18,840 --> 02:52:24,760
California space and uh uh you've heard

3876
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:26,639
me say it before you know we talk about

3877
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:29,559
legalization here in California really

3878
02:52:26,639 --> 02:52:31,680
what we have is heavily regulated

3879
02:52:29,559 --> 02:52:34,318
commercialization as versus

3880
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:37,159
legalization over regulated over

3881
02:52:34,318 --> 02:52:39,478
regulated thank you Aton of course

3882
02:52:37,159 --> 02:52:41,478
anyway what one of the few benefits of

3883
02:52:39,478 --> 02:52:44,278
what's happened is the products that are

3884
02:52:41,478 --> 02:52:47,599
available in dispensaries right now are

3885
02:52:44,279 --> 02:52:49,680
among the cleanest of any contaminants

3886
02:52:47,600 --> 02:52:52,399
free they are exactly what they say they

3887
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:54,800
are in the packaging too much packaging

3888
02:52:52,398 --> 02:52:56,519
don't even get me started but yeah

3889
02:52:54,799 --> 02:52:58,799
there's products that are actually

3890
02:52:56,520 --> 02:53:02,120
really what they say they are available

3891
02:52:58,799 --> 02:53:04,478
on the shelf for a price and so that's a

3892
02:53:02,120 --> 02:53:06,439
benefit and yet most people most

3893
02:53:04,478 --> 02:53:09,398
consumers don't really understand how to

3894
02:53:06,439 --> 02:53:12,000
how those products work in their bodies

3895
02:53:09,398 --> 02:53:13,519
and how to use them how to find the dose

3896
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,719
that works for them how to find the

3897
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:17,760
product or the way of getting that

3898
02:53:14,719 --> 02:53:20,000
chemistry into their bodies so that's

3899
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:25,478
you know two minutes

3900
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:29,159
of uh so far we've created about 20

3901
02:53:25,478 --> 02:53:31,760
hours of video content of conversation

3902
02:53:29,159 --> 02:53:34,840
uh me doing presentations and uh just

3903
02:53:31,760 --> 02:53:39,200
yesterday we had our first live class

3904
02:53:34,840 --> 02:53:42,200
with uh we did a zoom with the I think

3905
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:45,319
50 some people showed up and yeah it was

3906
02:53:42,200 --> 02:53:46,800
on the basics of cannabis and uh a

3907
02:53:45,318 --> 02:53:49,079
little bit of the history of cannabis

3908
02:53:46,799 --> 02:53:53,478
use and how it came to be recognized as

3909
02:53:49,079 --> 02:53:55,879
medicine and then um a little bit of a

3910
02:53:53,478 --> 02:53:58,199
skim through the endoc canono system and

3911
02:53:55,879 --> 02:54:02,238
how Canabis relates to the

3912
02:53:58,200 --> 02:54:04,200
ECS and then uh something about how

3913
02:54:02,238 --> 02:54:07,000
products work in the body you know all

3914
02:54:04,200 --> 02:54:07,000
of that in 40

3915
02:54:07,680 --> 02:54:13,200
minutes so there's more to come and I'm

3916
02:54:10,559 --> 02:54:15,199
really excited about it because uh our

3917
02:54:13,200 --> 02:54:18,560
agreement with the dispensary is House

3918
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:20,159
of harlequin owns all this content I'm

3919
02:54:18,559 --> 02:54:22,278
looking forward to the opportunity to

3920
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:24,520
create more content and share it with a

3921
02:54:22,279 --> 02:54:28,279
wider range of folks because I think

3922
02:54:24,520 --> 02:54:29,680
there's a real need for people I mean we

3923
02:54:28,279 --> 02:54:32,159
there's all kinds of information out

3924
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:34,439
there about how to grow your own how

3925
02:54:32,159 --> 02:54:37,478
there's information about how to do

3926
02:54:34,439 --> 02:54:39,040
extractions and whatnot but there's and

3927
02:54:37,478 --> 02:54:41,039
there's lots of information for healthc

3928
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:42,960
Care Professionals you know if you if

3929
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:44,640
you talk the language of research and

3930
02:54:42,959 --> 02:54:46,719
science there's a bunch of good

3931
02:54:44,639 --> 02:54:49,439
information coming increasingly about

3932
02:54:46,719 --> 02:54:51,840
cannabis but there's not really much for

3933
02:54:49,439 --> 02:54:53,840
the consumer the person who actually

3934
02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:55,760
doesn't know much about cannabis and

3935
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:57,760
would like to maybe explore the

3936
02:54:55,760 --> 02:55:00,639
potential benefit so that's what I've

3937
02:54:57,760 --> 02:55:03,639
been doing lately and uh yeah I'm going

3938
02:55:00,639 --> 02:55:05,079
to be putting out uh once we get this

3939
02:55:03,639 --> 02:55:09,039
program with the dispensary we're

3940
02:55:05,079 --> 02:55:11,879
working with now 2477 in Nevada city is

3941
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:15,479
the folks doing that Daniel Bachelor

3942
02:55:11,879 --> 02:55:17,920
good friend and uh he he came he's one

3943
02:55:15,478 --> 02:55:21,119
of the first folks he was first Pres

3944
02:55:17,920 --> 02:55:26,359
recomend mended cannabis by his doctor

3945
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:27,800
at the age of 15 up here in h Dr Todd I

3946
02:55:26,359 --> 02:55:30,000
think was the first guy who was willing

3947
02:55:27,799 --> 02:55:32,159
to recommend cannabis for his

3948
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:34,639
ADHD and I'm probably revealing more

3949
02:55:32,159 --> 02:55:37,840
under Hippa than I should but that being

3950
02:55:34,639 --> 02:55:39,639
said yeah Daniel's a great guy and um

3951
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:41,279
and yeah he was open to the idea of me

3952
02:55:39,639 --> 02:55:43,959
continuing to own the content that we're

3953
02:55:41,279 --> 02:55:45,960
creating and uh I'm really looking

3954
02:55:43,959 --> 02:55:48,959
forward to how this is going to play out

3955
02:55:45,959 --> 02:55:50,799
over the next year or two uh uh because

3956
02:55:48,959 --> 02:55:54,438
yeah there'll be a lot of opportunity

3957
02:55:50,799 --> 02:55:55,920
there so that's what I've been up to um

3958
02:55:54,439 --> 02:55:56,559
and I'm excited about it you can

3959
02:55:55,920 --> 02:55:57,960
probably

3960
02:55:56,559 --> 02:56:01,519
[Laughter]

3961
02:55:57,959 --> 02:56:03,679
tell amazing it's awesome yeah weade

3962
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:05,960
that you know you've been been doing

3963
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:07,639
this a long time and you know I think

3964
02:56:05,959 --> 02:56:09,839
what you're touching on is is what

3965
02:56:07,639 --> 02:56:12,719
everyone always asked you know at the

3966
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:14,799
retail level at least you know they just

3967
02:56:12,719 --> 02:56:18,039
need to know more you know from a

3968
02:56:14,799 --> 02:56:20,159
consumer point of view and you know

3969
02:56:18,040 --> 02:56:23,279
there's got to be people like yourselves

3970
02:56:20,159 --> 02:56:25,398
and all everyone here as well that needs

3971
02:56:23,279 --> 02:56:26,920
to share this information it's really

3972
02:56:25,398 --> 02:56:29,439
cool that you're bringing it to a

3973
02:56:26,920 --> 02:56:31,279
centralized place and you know it allows

3974
02:56:29,439 --> 02:56:33,079
people to actually have a place to go

3975
02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:36,800
and say hey I can reference this thing

3976
02:56:33,079 --> 02:56:38,238
that Wade said and keep going back to it

3977
02:56:36,799 --> 02:56:40,358
because I think sometimes information

3978
02:56:38,238 --> 02:56:42,318
gets lost in the ether as you get new

3979
02:56:40,359 --> 02:56:43,880
information and there's so much new

3980
02:56:42,318 --> 02:56:46,039
information today that doesn't really

3981
02:56:43,879 --> 02:56:48,119
have a place that it sits on these

3982
02:56:46,040 --> 02:56:50,000
social forums or these social platforms

3983
02:56:48,120 --> 02:56:52,079
that that gets lost and you really have

3984
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:53,478
to dig for them and and providing that

3985
02:56:52,079 --> 02:56:55,959
that home for it it's going to be really

3986
02:56:53,478 --> 02:56:59,199
cool it's that's that's a really it's a

3987
02:56:55,959 --> 02:57:00,358
really Noble thing you're doing well uh

3988
02:56:59,200 --> 02:57:02,800
you know we've been talking about

3989
02:57:00,359 --> 02:57:04,880
Clubhouse here a bit it's one of the

3990
02:57:02,799 --> 02:57:06,438
things that my team is asking me to do

3991
02:57:04,879 --> 02:57:11,000
and I'm still trying to get my head

3992
02:57:06,439 --> 02:57:14,318
around it is creating a room um toh chat

3993
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:16,520
about cannabis and the consumer products

3994
02:57:14,318 --> 02:57:19,519
that are available and how the Cannabis

3995
02:57:16,520 --> 02:57:23,399
chemistry uh how it affects our bodies

3996
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:27,960
how it works in our bodies and uh one of

3997
02:57:23,398 --> 02:57:29,639
my uh one of my taglines if you will is

3998
02:57:27,959 --> 02:57:32,199
uh in the in the context of this

3999
02:57:29,639 --> 02:57:35,039
conversation psychoactivity is a side

4000
02:57:32,200 --> 02:57:36,840
effect of cannabis medicine it's one

4001
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:38,840
that I enjoy very much and for many

4002
02:57:36,840 --> 02:57:41,799
people it's the only reason they use

4003
02:57:38,840 --> 02:57:45,318
cannabis but in the fact in the effects

4004
02:57:41,799 --> 02:57:48,799
that cannabis can have in our bodies THC

4005
02:57:45,318 --> 02:57:52,238
and the not THC excuse me Psy coactivity

4006
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:55,039
which isn't one of the effects of THC is

4007
02:57:52,238 --> 02:57:56,959
a side effect that can be mitigated by

4008
02:57:55,040 --> 02:58:00,160
dose by a method of getting that

4009
02:57:56,959 --> 02:58:02,559
chemistry into your body U by how

4010
02:58:00,159 --> 02:58:04,799
frequently you take that that

4011
02:58:02,559 --> 02:58:08,600
preparation and what the needs of your

4012
02:58:04,799 --> 02:58:10,079

4013
02:58:08,600 --> 02:58:12,399
one of the chat rooms or maybe it was

4014

4016
02:58:14,799 --> 02:58:19,719
response to the Cannabis chemistry is

4017
02:58:16,920 --> 02:58:21,398
unique so part of it is educating people

4018
02:58:19,719 --> 02:58:24,519
so they can find The Sweet Spot for

4019
02:58:21,398 --> 02:58:25,920

4020
02:58:24,520 --> 02:58:28,238
where you're finding the benefit you

4021
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:30,000
