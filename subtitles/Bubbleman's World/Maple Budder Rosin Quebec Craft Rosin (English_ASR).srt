7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,400
today some of the works that have been

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,579
coming out from the maple butter boys

9
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:32,579
out east and Quebec well hung out with

10
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:34,799
these guys at the karma cup they shared

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,539
a booth with me and I really you know as

12
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,729
bubbleman as someone who's been focused

13
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,549
on extracts and hash making for the last

14
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:43,319
20 years I'm always looking for the new

15
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:45,209
up-and-coming artists the people who are

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,159
really pushing boundaries and actually

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,600
just crushing the game with superb

18
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,578
quality and it really starts with

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,039
growing and so these guys have

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,439
incredible grows I'll show you some of

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,550
their plants upcoming here and they're

22
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,829
really starting to make some nice

23
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:05,548
product mostly rosin right now but it

24
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:09,090
really is as they're little little logo

25
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,640
says maple butter Quebec Kraft rosin so

26
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,460
here is my little package that I ordered

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,069
up and pretty reasonable prices you got

28
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,169
about 60 bucks between 60 and 70 for a

29
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:22,289
gram of really incredible Rozz and you

30
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,170
absolutely will not be sorry perfect

31
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,960
little droplets into each container and

32
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,509
you can see there's the rockstar cush

33
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:33,030
just white and beautiful and just

34
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,530
looking like you want to devour it and

35
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,890
then I got a couple of head banger dry

36
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,829
sip draws ins and one special one that I

37
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,129
actually already puffed which is $60 1/2

38
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:45,658
gram it's the Viper tricep draws and if

39
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,179
you can get it get in touch with maple

40
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,560
butter there email simply put across the

41
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,720
screen there maple butter at protonmail

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,540
dot-com and I'm really excited to get

43
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,269
into this I got myself my Faberge egg

44
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,030
plugged into the dl at 6:10 and then

45
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:04,978
i've got myself the klein with the mega

46
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,299
pot i'm starting to get a little chest

47
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:09,580
but you know what she still tastes as

48
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:13,030
good can be so I guess without any

49
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:18,430
further ado let's do a little review on

50
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:22,449
the maple butter boys oh yeah very very

51
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,719
happy with this let me tell you money

52
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:30,280
well spent

53
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:32,020
so yes it's hard to really think of

54
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,030
which I should smoke first but I guess

55
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,740
I'll just pull them out as they come out

56
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,590
we'll go with some rock star

57
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,230
Coosh let's see if I can't just give you

58
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:46,170
guys a little a little close-up on that

59
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:51,609
cuz it's so pretty it is so Purdy

60
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:56,459
mmm-hmm yeah definitely tasty definitely

61
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:59,140
stoked on the maple butter oh yeah so I

62
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:02,290
guess the one thing I'm missing is some

63
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:08,379
q-tips for the silicon carbide so why

64
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:09,159
don't we take the first rip off of the

65
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:12,219
torch

66
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,989
we'll turn the timer on cuz it's always

67
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:15,729
nice to have that timer on I've

68
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:17,650
mentioned it before I like to do 20

69
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:20,399
seconds heat up and about a fifty five

70
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,400
second cooldown

71
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:46,629
all right 20 seconds on the cooldown do

72
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:50,840
a quick reset will go for 55 seconds

73
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:53,900
almost hard to put the first dabber into

74
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:59,360
this perfect little medallion

75
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:05,030
oh yeah Jesus don't go too big you got a

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:10,060
few more flavors to try how does that

77
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,060
nice it just wants to pull so much out

78
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,850
and I've got quite a few more to hit so

79
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,890
we're just gonna be hitting reasonable

80
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:17,659
size dabs the flavor on the Rockstar

81
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,000
right off the bat without have been

82
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,840
tasting it the smell profile is

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,550
incredible

84
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,909
it smells like he came out of Remos

85
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:29,629
garden mmm gonna have to puff some of

86
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,670
that with Remo in fact the old wrist

87
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:33,350
tech to tell how hot your quarts is for

88
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,900
me it's always been accurate with the

89
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,460
mothership mega pots and less accurate

90
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:37,879
with other courts I'm not sure why that

91
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:41,019
is

92
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,019
let's give it a go

93
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:03,348
well you know it's really hard to put

94
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:06,259
that subtle nuance of what makes resin

95
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:09,680
nice versus resin that's not nice the

96
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:11,408
smoothness of that was like cream very

97
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,579
reminiscent of how it photographs

98
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:27,110
reminiscent of how it picked up off the

99
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:30,318
dabber just creamy perfection so my

100
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,080
q-tips and a tiny little bit of my DC

101
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,060
glass cleaner as it's not always

102
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:40,158
necessary when I get the perfect perfect

103
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:42,439
temp rip like that it cleans so perfect

104
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:45,589
it's usually when it gets a little bit

105
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:47,330
too hot and I get near the Chas that's

106
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:53,239
when you're really required to use the

107
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:55,248
DC glass cleaner well I'll tell you

108
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,499
something about that right there I could

109
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:59,449
puff that really fast that is so damn

110
00:05:57,499 --> 00:06:01,699
enjoyable it's strong it's definitely

111
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:05,838
that indica that narrow leaf or sorry

112
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:07,580
wide leaf drug cultivar and what can I

113
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:10,218
say more about it I mean the taste is

114
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:12,918
very full I can still taste it in my

115
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:14,269
throat pretty pretty pretty on point

116
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:18,378
gonna have to give that one a pretty

117
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:21,560
high mark if you're thinking about the

118
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:24,229
rock star Kush I got to give it a couple

119
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,209
of thumbs up let's move right along

120
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:31,550
shall we I think we're gonna hit the

121
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:35,180
next dab off the egg all right we'll put

122
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,718
the client over here put the this stuff

123
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,228
over here

124
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:42,528
don't put your dab or down on the table

125
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:44,088
you'll get rosin on it mmm I'm always

126
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:46,278
picking up little bits of oil and

127
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:47,750
rubbing it into my skin how many of you

128
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:50,269
guys do that out there where you just

129
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,158
have a little bit of reclaim or droplets

130
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:53,778
of resin from your pipe or even a little

131
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:56,509
rosin from your dab right that's at your

132
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:58,370
table I just rub it right into my skin I

133
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:59,930
love the smell that it gives me

134
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,550
afterwards and once it's gotten to a

135
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,550
point where it's no longer sticky and

136
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,579
it's been absorbed into my skin I just

137
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,889
feel good about it

138
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:12,419
all right back into the bee man bag here

139
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:18,979
if he's open and seeing what wonderful

140
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:22,560
things we have here so head banger to

141
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,319
dry sipped rosin all right so they have

142
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,209
dry sick to this head banger looks quite

143
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,849
lovely of course I'm gonna show pictures

144
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:31,439
but the Johnny be and me wants to bring

145
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:36,600
it right up to the camera and show it to

146
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:44,790
you there as well so there it is good

147
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:47,040
banger boom alright so let us get right

148
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,110
in wonderful thing about the d-mail D

149
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,819
nail it's already a temperature there's

150
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,259
no need for me to torch anything and

151
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,019
wait 20 seconds and this that the other

152
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,269
thing that being said I get such

153
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:59,370
enjoyment from this system of

154
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,799
motherships this dial system with the

155
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,629
little quartz you know the mega pot that

156
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,540
goes up and down and they're the the way

157
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:09,810
that it carves I really gotta say it's

158
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:12,060
probably one of my favorite systems this

159
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,829
gains favoritism for a whole variety of

160
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,019
different reasons it's not about how

161
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:18,180
awesome it hits although the d-mail does

162
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,129
hit great it's more about the

163
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,680
convenience and being able to plug it in

164
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:24,360
not have to go through gas not have to

165
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,689

like getting my head banged 19 Joe it

179

184
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:48,759
great it was amazing it was like dessert

185
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,800
but his head banger it's like a

186
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:55,379
four-course meal right here this is like

187
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:59,169
you're done trust me you do not require

188
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:05,169
to hit 10 more rips after this one which

189
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:08,319
is wonderful because as much as I enjoy

190
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:11,519
popping as much as I enjoy you know the

191
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,820
ritual of a pipe and inhaling vapor I

192
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,710
also and it's nice to be free of it it's

193
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,680
nice to be able to get along with your

194
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:23,019
day be able to have a quick rip and move

195
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:25,959
on and go it's a quick moment in time

196
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:27,909
it's not this sitting at the table in

197
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,800
sessioning for an hour or two straight

198
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:32,110
which is wonderful don't get me wrong on

199
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:33,729
its own in its own right but in everyday

200
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,289
life when you're busy and you're active

201
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,840
and you got to get out and you got to

202
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:39,490
keep going it's just so nice to be able

203
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:45,639
to have these quick little rips the way

204
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:48,009
these pipes offer it alright so we just

205
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,509
hit pet bang or to dry sit frozen so

206
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:53,409
this one is also head bang or two dries

207
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:55,809
mm we've got two of those ones so the

208
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:59,500
two that we have left are the head

209
00:10:55,809 --> 00:11:00,369
banger for dry sip frozen and the trim

210
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,289
bin dries

211
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,110
Rasen so I think I might go in for the

212
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:07,870
trim bin just to separate it got a real

213
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,759
nice nose to it I almost want to say

214
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:13,120
some viper might have ended up in there

215
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:15,460
mm-hmm these guys do a whole host of

216
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,870
wonderful cultivars I'm not sure if

217
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,310
they're gonna be making their flowers

218
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,259
available I think they're gonna be

219
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:22,389
really sticking to the concentrates but

220
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:26,799
we'll see in the near future if people

221
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:28,569
are willing to pay pay the price for the

222
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,449
flowers you know maybe I mean I

223
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,129
certainly was I was very happy to have

224
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,650
gotten these two buds of where is my

225
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:37,000
bike we're actually gonna be squishing

226
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:39,009
those I don't know if that's gonna be in

227
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,589
part two of this video because it seems

228
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:43,389
like it should be its own video or if

229
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:44,920
it'll be at the end of this video

230
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:46,899
either way it's content that I want to

231
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:48,639
share with you guys the last time we

232
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:50,649
squished whereas my bike it came out of

233
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,360
damn near 30 percent I think it was

234
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:55,329
twenty-eight twenty-nine percent return

235
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,339
and this is what I've heard about this

236
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,100
one as well so that's pretty sweet to

237
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:02,920
buy a nug and realize that what you're

238
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,560
getting is is 28 to 30 percent

239
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:10,179
cannabinoids on that on that flower so

240
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:15,239
alright without further ado it's going

241
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:18,899
for some trim bin dry sipped rosin

242
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,899
alright trim bin

243
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,100
[Music]

244
00:12:41,269 --> 00:13:01,519
yummy hmm and it just keeps hitting it

245
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,519
just keeps hitting oh my goodness

246
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:08,570
you don't another cool thing about maple

247
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:11,820
butter is that they've been purchasing

248
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:13,620
bubbleman Penn's wholesale been

249
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,960
producing their own sauces now I

250
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,360
actually don't have any of their sauces

251
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:21,240
here probably gonna get some in the near

252
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,960
future but yeah they do blue river

253
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,419
terpenes mixed with these roses and then

254
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,290
they fill it into the the bubbleman pens

255
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:33,089
and it was quite nice they sold quite a

256
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:35,250
few of them at the karma cup standing at

257
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:37,560
the booth there I was watching them go

258
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,950
through their rows and like it was on

259
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:43,049
fire and yeah it was cool you know to

260
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:46,080
see the Pens get filled with product and

261
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:48,719
to hear the feedback of people very

262
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,000
specific pen really does need to

263
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,310
sometimes a walkthrough often people

264
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,700
think it's not working when it is at the

265
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:58,709
same time is are there warranties to be

266
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,850
had absolutely it's a new product we're

267
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,100
trying to make it the best that we can

268
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,800
but sometimes you know getting it out

269
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,750
onto the market is the best way to move

270
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,939
it forward so for those of you that had

271
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,620
any problems with yours please bear with

272
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,230
us and have patience we're gonna make

273
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,600
sure that you are not left holding the

274
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,159
short stick in that relationship so

275
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,710
please don't feel at any point in time

276
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:23,459
that that's how it's gonna be in the

277
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:25,019
meantime I guess I have one more rosin

278
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:28,080
to go through and it's one of those

279
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:31,889
headbangers my goodness so we did the

280
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:34,379
head banger - yeah we did those but we

281
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:39,419
did not do is the head banger for dry

282
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:40,559
sift rosin mmm my god that's serious

283
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,209
product you know when you see the

284
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,149
headbanger plant which I can show you

285
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:47,820
right here you know right away that the

286
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:50,929
rosin is going to be you know something

287
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:55,920
like this right here

288
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:58,919
ridiculous but true alright here we go

289
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:03,299
it's crazy to break into these roses

290
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:04,889
they're so they're so smooth and the

291
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:08,429
rosin doesn't seem to leave much behind

292
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:10,259
when alright we froze up there what I

293
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:11,939
was saying was that it was so smooth and

294
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:14,519
that it doesn't leave a little bit much

295
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,440
rosin behind on the glass and I really

296
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,569
like that so you know my camera froze up

297
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,370
there and paused right out on me so I

298
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,970
guess we better get this last rip done

299
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:28,070

ringers says I feel like this video has

313
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:39,420
been mostly just me coughing I feel like

314
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:42,778
I don't spend as much time coughing in

315
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:44,969
my videos as I have today apologies for

316
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:47,179
that no one wants to listen to someone -

317
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,560
koffe I know I don't want to anyway so

318
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:51,569
try to keep that down to a minimum but

319
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:56,489
I'll tell you when you're hitting maple

320
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:57,899
butter mmm [ __ ] Sturbridge it's hard not

321
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,509
to cough for real

322
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:03,389
I caught for me as I hit things in the

323
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:05,160
10 plus percent range of terpenes as I

324
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:08,699
grew up on things that were in the 1 to

325
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:12,630
3 percent range and as I grew through

326
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:16,140
the 1 to 3 into the 4 to 5 into the 6 to

327
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:19,470
7 and all the way into the 10 plus you

328
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:22,079
know I feel that a 5 to 7 is pretty

329
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,568
awesome for me and I quite enjoy some

330
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,818
threes and some fours and some fives as

331
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:28,740
long as it's not a 1 you know then it's

332
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:30,869
just lacking loudness completely and

333
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,250
it's very low percentage 1% terpenes

334
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:35,009
that's extremely low

335
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,900
but I would say it's definitely average

336
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:40,379
for what most people are producing

337
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,600
unfortunately well if you are unable to

338
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:46,350
produce for yourself or you're currently

339
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:48,179
not producing fire of this quality the

340
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:49,980
beautiful thing about this the beautiful

341
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:54,259
thing about Canada's simple disobedience

342
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:57,299
while LPS are unable to fulfill people's

343
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:59,490
desires and urges and needs for that

344
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:01,649
matter for wanting products like this

345
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,509
they are unable to do it certain people

346
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,420
are willing to practice a level of civil

347
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:08,460
disobedience and to make this medicine

348
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,289
available so to all of those people

349
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,350
doing that from the dispensary owners

350
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:16,019
tui growers who produce conscious

351
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:18,959
chemical free organic medicine for the

352
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:20,609
sick to all of you for making this

353
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,110
medicine available through civil

354
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:24,899
disobedience which is how we got the

355
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:26,549
dispensaries or the LPS here in Canada

356
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,810
in the first place that means licensed

357
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:29,970
producers for you

358
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:32,129
watching outside of Canada those are the

359
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:35,069
only legal people in Canada who can grow

360
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:38,580
and distribute sell through the mail and

361
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:40,349
whatnot legally so in the meantime while

362
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:43,710
while their hands are tied and they are

363
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:46,799
unable to risk losing their license to

364
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:49,019
fulfill their patients needs you'll have

365
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,089
