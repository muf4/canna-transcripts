2
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:23,730
hey guys what would a bubble man's world

3
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,198
today we're gonna be doing something

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,210
that I've said I was gonna do quite a

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,289
while ago now we're gonna get the peer

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,600
pressure the lungs the long peaks press

7
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,450
going and what we're gonna be doing is

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,808
we're going to be squishing a half pound

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,010
I'm player it's my bike so if I take you

10
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:43,259
through a little bit of the workflow

11
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:47,670
although you have seen a little bit of

12
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:52,829
it Oh beautiful beautiful half pound of

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:55,320
where is my bike on point as always try

14
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,759
to do a little bit more video but for

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,738
you the buttons are quite big

16
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:01,530
they're definitely larger than what I

17
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:04,349
like to press some people don't prepare

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,239
the herb at all they just you know press

19
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,849
it the way the way it is I like to make

20
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:12,750
sure when the bags are full and I'll be

21
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:17,849
using 115 micron bags today these are at

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,829
the 2.5 inch by 9 inch which fits

23
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:24,359
perfectly in this press right here in

24
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:27,929
this template a little pre-press unit

25
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:31,680
from pure pressure got my nitrile gloves

26
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,810
here powder free and latex free I've got

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,579
my little tool for both flipping the

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,280
bags inside out which I can show you

29
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,019
real quick as leaving the seam on the

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,269
outside we know that we're gonna collect

31
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,158
a lot of resin there and that's not

32
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:47,399
really ideal so we just flip the bag

33
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,680
over that way and it's real quick to

34
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,560
flip the bag inside out so we'll be

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,649
doing probably about seven of these as I

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,719
can fit about 30 to 35 grams in each one

37
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,320
so I'll probably do seven of those at

38
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,879
one point in time and I'll be

39
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,619
putting on my gloves so we can get the

40
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,159
buds broken up I've got a couple of

41
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,319
trays here I'll probably weigh out 30

42
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,599
grams at a time throw it in here get it

43
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,939
into the bag and pre-press the bag put

44
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,739
it over here and repeat until the whole

45
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:19,919
1/2 pound is taken care of

46
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,790
it's I'm guessing it's 224 200 put in

47
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,899
grams in here

48
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:31,139
so that's gonna be like 6 and a bit bags

49
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:32,480
really quite lovely bud though there we

50
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:36,719
go

51
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:40,310
yep me a beer beer beer beer beer all

52
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:44,430
right put that great turpino lean smell

53
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,709
and yeah we're looking forward I've got

54
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,030
the press you might hear the air

55
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:51,989
compressor go on every once in a while

56
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:54,150
as I've got it up to 140 psi anytime it

57
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,930
drops below that it turns on and that

58
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,300
goes up the press is also on the plates

59
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,230
are heated I'm heating today we're gonna

60
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,939
be doing 220 some say it's too hot I can

61
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,429
assure you the resin is actually

62
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,049
absolutely Terp rich when it comes out

63
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,730
it's gonna be a beautiful yellow golden

64
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,159
color and it's gonna be very glossy and

65
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:16,159
it's gonna be very chirpy I've got the

66
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,799
little funnel here which I love for

67
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,900
placing inside the screen and then I

68
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,780
usually just sort of collect the herb

69
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,450
and I use the little stick to pound it

70
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,939
through the hole and pack it down into

71
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:31,379
the bag nicely any little spaces that

72
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,180
you leave generally in the screen

73
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,009
particularly in the corners or on the

74
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,129
sides are going to collect and pool

75
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:40,289
rosin and every little bit counts you

76
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,539
end up losing more than you need to lose

77
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:43,319
so those are just simple things to keep

78
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:47,269
in mind

79
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:50,430
and rather than video record this entire

80
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:53,009
preparation of all this bud I thought

81
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:57,110
what I would do is do a time lapse for

82
00:03:53,009 --> 00:04:00,298
you so I am going to change the camera

83
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,040
put it on time lapse for you guys go

84
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,439
through this entire half pound and then

85
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,789
we'll video some of the presses or all

86
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,389
of the presses it's going to be real

87
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:10,169
nice

88
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:12,208
do 35 gram raw bags each time and I

89
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,639
suspect with the where's my bike that

90
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:18,420
will get anywhere from 25 to 30 percent

91
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:21,509
returned 28 to 29 would put a big smile

92
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,689
on my face so yeah why don't we get

93
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,689
started

94
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:46,040
[Music]

95
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:46,039
the old blood medicine

96
00:04:46,470 --> 00:05:42,759
[Music]

97
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:45,069
that was fun that took me about a half

98
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,780
an hour although on the time-lapse I'm

99
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:52,478
sure it's only gonna be a minute or two

100
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:56,888
and yeah we got five six thirty five

101
00:05:52,478 --> 00:06:01,060
gram bags pre pressed and loaded and

102
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:03,490
ready to go got a few extra buds that I

103
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,199
kept out here for photography um and do

104
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,509
some macro photography so you guys can

105
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,050
see the glandular trike trichome heads

106
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:12,788
excuse me and I'll also do a few photos

107
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,379
just of the buds themselves and some

108
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:15,639
video of them up close so you can see

109
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:19,120
the quality of the bud that I'm working

110
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,978
with and I guess next up is let's go do

111
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,449
the pressing I'm gonna probably do one

112
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:25,089
full press where I take you through

113
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:27,340
creating the recipe I take you through

114
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:29,279
the whole process of what will change

115
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:34,138
our gloves as well because we've

116
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:37,538
fingered up these ones pretty good and

117
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:39,340
yeah I think I like the time-lapse so

118
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:41,978
what we'll probably do is I'll take you

119
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:43,719
through one squish on regular time we

120
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:45,399
can watch it nice and close-up dripping

121
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,039
and then I think I'm gonna do the

122
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:50,649
time-lapse for the pressing as well just

123
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:52,779
to kind of make the video not two hours

124
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:54,219
long note that it would be that long I

125
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:57,309
usually press for a couple of minutes

126
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,930
per bag and there's only six bags here

127
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,180
so even if I did a full three-minute

128
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,370
press still be under 20 minutes although

129
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,978
I do like to go back and do a second

130
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,110
press as well so I'll record that for

131
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:11,860
you guys so why don't we head into the

132
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:14,770
rosin office and get this job done the

133
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,288
compressor just loaded up to 150 psi so

134
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:20,109
we've got a little bit of give I've got

135
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:21,728
my set six sheets of pre-cut parchment

136
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,060
paper from pure pressure that are

137
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:26,459
sitting right here I've got one of the

138
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,038
plates for pressing the

139
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,209
plates to hold it down so it doesn't

140
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,300
slide out and that way I have it

141
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:36,079
accessible right here I've got my six

142
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:39,960
filled screens pre pressed right here

143
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:43,579
and then I've got some older parchment

144
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,579
pieces that I've already pressed once

145
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:50,490
this is what they look like and that way

146
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:53,399
press

147
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,079
I thought sheets that are ready and I

148
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,329
don't what I can do is I can do my first

149
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:01,258
press and while I'm collecting the first

150
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:03,569
press I can actually go and collect the

151
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,699
second press so what we're gonna do

152
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:08,189
right now is I'm going to do a full

153
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:11,310
press and show you what we get and then

154
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:13,500
we're going to do the time lapse showing

155
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,500
all the rest of the five getting pressed

156
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,810
really quickly and then I'll do a

157
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,000
collection I'll do that on time lapse as

158
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,530
well I'll collect one maybe off of time

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,189
lapse and collect the rest off time

160
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:28,049
lapse do a pre press through the detail

161
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:31,319
press of getting it all into a nice big

162
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,269
orb and that'll be it we'll do the

163
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,799
second press and you guys will see how

164
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:37,889
easy it is to work with the long peaks

165
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,519
peer pressure and let's get started

166
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,889
shall we

167
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,838
okay so here we have the settings right

168
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:47,309
here there's all set up if we go to our

169
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:49,020
recipes and we go where is my bike so

170
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:51,179
I've got this set up we're gonna change

171
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:56,159
this a little bit the weight is actually

172
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:59,489
35 35 grams so we'll get that up there

173
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:02,009
the bags are actually two point five by

174
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:05,430
nine it is 115 we'll go for a medium

175
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:09,360
speed the humidity is way closer to 60

176
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:10,370
than it is to 16 and then we'll do three

177
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,709
stages

178
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:16,500
Stage one we're gonna do sixty seconds

179
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:20,609
and the pressure we're gonna go at is a

180
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,740
hundred and forty psi and we'll repeat

181
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,528
that as well and the reason I do this

182
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,419
and not just one full stage is at any

183
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:29,789
point in time I like to just I can shut

184
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:31,588
her down obviously you can do it however

185
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:34,860
you like you can do it all in one stage

186
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:37,320
your third stage second stage at a much

187
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,300
higher psi 140 psi is a little bit too

188
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,480
high for half

189
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:44,339
but it works great for flour and these

190
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,149
are all things that you learn over time

191
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:53,160
when you okay let's just make sure that

192
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:58,709
saved the way I wanted it to yep it just

193
00:09:53,159 --> 00:10:03,509
missed my third one so we'll go 60 will

194
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:05,570
go pressure 140 it'll save and then

195
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:09,000
we'll save and run

196
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:15,420
yep there it is perfect all right so

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,100
here we go with our our where is my bike

198
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:19,229
and if you're wondering where the e is

199
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,879
there's not enough letters so I'm gonna

200
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:28,889
pull the camera back so you guys can see

201
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:32,279
the press and we'll get going here nice

202
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:36,449
and long cut perfectly for the unit just

203
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:38,779
fold them over and there's no crinkles

204
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,780
in it

205
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:52,019
magnets here that I've got that I use I

206
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:54,000
use it so much as I like the back the

207
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,490
parchment to hang a little bit lower

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,340
than that is set up but it is there for

209
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,590
you if you want to use it we'll get our

210
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,300
bag in what I generally like to do

211
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,220
because I really like the placement of

212
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,809
this to be up top which we've talked

213
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,509
about before is so you can pull the bag

214
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:11,939
out once you've opened the pressed rosin

215
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:14,730
but what I do like to do is I like to

216
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,810
make sure like I don't generally put it

217
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:21,240
in like that before I pre lower the the

218
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:22,649
place so what we're gonna do is we're

219
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,129
going to hold these two buttons down

220
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:29,220
which are going to go for five seconds

221
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:32,350
three two one and we're ready we're

222
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,160
gonna lower these plates just a tiny bit

223
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,629
[Music]

224
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:40,649
just a tiny bit and that gives us a

225
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:42,480
tighter space to press down on the on

226
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:45,779
the bag with so I'm gonna get kind of

227
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:50,659
out of the way here I'm gonna lower this

228
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:50,659
down in that toggle dropper

229
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,139
generally after about 10 to 30 seconds

230
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:03,759
you'll start getting the rosin coming

231
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:07,539
out and that is where is my bike never a

232
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,069
disappointment with where is my bike so

233
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:14,139
we've got a couple of drips happening

234
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:17,500
now and we'll hold this up so it doesn't

235
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:20,559
go all the way down it's a nice squish

236
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,210
for sure and that's generally what it

237
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:26,469
looks like when you squish flower that

238
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:27,940
has proper resin content on it I'm sure

239
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,670
if we went around to the back of the

240
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,710
unit right now we'd see a little bit

241
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:34,089
squishing out the back as well and you

242
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:40,000
can see it right in there

243
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:42,480
boom all right so this is just a quick

244
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,950
minute so far a minute and 30 seconds

245
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,129
and you can see they're still really

246
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:50,259
nice flow the drips are collecting at

247
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:53,649
the bottom here it's starting to fatten

248
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:55,149
up and we've still got flow generally

249
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:57,129
when you still have flow like this and

250
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,100
you're almost done your two minute press

251
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:00,939
it's not a bad idea to just continue on

252
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,800
otherwise you're gonna have to go back

253
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,810
and do a second press and you're gonna

254
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,099
expose it to more heat in the second

255
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:10,500
press than you will if you just do a

256
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:16,200
full two to three minutes first press

257
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,200
quite lovely look at that

258
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:36,710
all right we're in our last 60 seconds

259
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:37,790
of pressing here and she is bubbling you

260
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,990
know there's always people that are

261
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:40,370
gonna say oh if you don't want to get

262
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,139
the bubbles you got to press a lot

263
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,330
lighter it's this is a subjective thing

264
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:48,799
you can press however you like anywhere

265
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:50,960
between 180 and 220 Fahrenheit is

266
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,250
seemingly pretty good you might end up

267
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,950
with a little bit more of a buttery

268
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,350
consistency versus a shadowy consistency

269
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,060
depending on the resin but you can play

270
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,110
around with your times and your pressure

271
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:05,000
I like to 24 flower between 200 and 220

272
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:09,019
but with the moisture content when it's

273
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,500
high 220 is perfect for me and the PSI I

274
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:15,919
like to go up to 140 so we are pressing

275
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:18,289
at 137 psi right now we've got six

276
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:22,929
seconds left and this is gonna crack

277
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:22,929
open I'll have to put the camera down

278
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:29,329
yeah I'm gonna put the camera down real

279
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:30,979
quickly here all right so I didn't have

280
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,770
the record button on when it popped open

281
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,839
but that is our squish right there very

282
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:38,240
reasonable by flower standards I'm

283
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,450
definitely feeling above a 25% return

284
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:45,159
and we're going to collect this one

285
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,160
right away so let's go do that

286
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,110
[Music]

[Music]

289
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:34,039
as you can see a pretty king pretty

290
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:37,220
clean pickup you know what I consider

291
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,899
near-perfect as it's grown to perfection

292
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,779
beautiful cultivar that's able to

293
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:44,329
express itself in the first place you

294
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:47,179
just end up with a real nice easy resin

295
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:50,090
to squish and collect everything about

296
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:53,138
it is pleasant

297
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,139
[Music]

298
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:34,459

oh here you go without touching any

302
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:55,659
resin that she pretty

303
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,480
[Music]

304
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:18,079
tear it a little piece of parchment

305
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:20,450
I'd like to twist the tool to get the

306
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:27,369
rosin off of it usually works pretty

307
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:31,640
good and that's a nine grammar nine

308
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:34,069
grammars that's pretty darn good that's

309
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,840
a little under 30% I'd say we're at

310
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:37,309
about twenty seven twenty eight percent

311
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:41,359
but there's gonna be another squish in

312
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:46,210
the second one so very very nice results

313
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:50,419
for a first squish beautiful color and

314
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:53,079
yeah I'm quite happy with that there

315
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:56,539
that Golden Delicious that's right there

316
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:59,000
so why don't we leave that one there

317
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:04,299
we'll come back and do some pressing in

318
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,299
a bit and let's go press the rest

319
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:32,819

[Music]

322
00:18:52,309 --> 00:19:01,799
nice spot

323
00:18:55,529 --> 00:19:03,480
pressing let's get this going up so I

324
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,279
push the two buttons for five seconds I

325
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,710
use the toggle switch to bring the plate

326
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,450
down just a little bit my way it creates

327
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,390
a tighter area and I can just kind of

328
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:19,830
squeeze the bat again and control where

329
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:21,840
that little bit of make sure your screen

330
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:27,809
doesn't pop out you can lower it really

331
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:30,179
nice and slowly so we've got 138 psi so

332
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:32,119
we're good I turned off the loud air

333
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,170
compressor cuz nobody needs to hear that

334
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:39,299
but this should be a good press right

335
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:41,340
here this should be a good press the

336
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:45,569
quality of the where's my bike is just

337
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:48,929
second to none is absolutely gorgeous to

338
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:55,559
squish I always like to count my streams

339
00:19:48,930 --> 00:20:01,019
I like when I get 10 or 11 oh we've got

340
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:03,000
seven but they're long just a beautiful

341
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:03,980
press got some good motion on this one

342
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,920
over here

343
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:11,579
she's a drippin big clear dome window on

344
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,440
the inside there and like I said when we

345
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:15,369
go to the back you can also generally

346
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,259
see in there that you

347
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:19,259
a nice little squish happening as well

348
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:28,000
beautiful so as you can see the long

349
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,720
Peaks is quite a lovely little press to

350
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,480
press on

351
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,759
it's very controllable I love the the

352
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,440
dual buttons I love the dual toggle I

353
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,329
love the emergency stop not that I've

354
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,269
needed to use it as of yet but it is a

355
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:42,549
nice option and of course there's our

356
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:45,460
recipe going to town right there

357
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:48,029
showing us our maximum psi reached the

358
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,799
amount of time that we pressed for and

359
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:53,019
generally I've weighed the first one I

360
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,928
got almost 10 grams it was nine point

361
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:59,410
something I'm sure with the second

362
00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:02,170
presses that I will do on these that we

363
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:05,290
will see another gram come out of rosin

364
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:13,750
out of each one of those so we'll get

365
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:20,889
those done next beautiful so 5 seconds

366
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:23,289
left I usually get the magnets off pull

367
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,870
it out put my fingers underneath to hold

368
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:28,659
the bag blade to the top of the bag like

369
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:31,779
that grab that little piece so you can

370
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:35,019
get it out without spreading any of your

371
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:37,660
resin around and that looks like a real

372
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:40,179
nice squish so let's go do some

373
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:45,040
collecting and my life it's my life it's

374
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:50,700
my life and it's your life your life

375
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:57,808
it's your life but every come together

376
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:57,808

around 40

383
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,430
maybe I'll get more than a gram gram and

384
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:59,200
a half

385
00:22:44,430 --> 00:23:02,410
we'll see 73 our night in my run

all right well the compressor finally

393
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,680
shut off that's why the music was

394
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:39,809
playing there and yeah we're getting

395
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,970
some decent returns here it looks like

396
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:44,940
at least a half gram do a gram and a bit

397
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:47,130
per bag so you know when there's six

398
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,470
bags that's another quarter plus you

399
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,910
know quarter to 10 grams of rosin that

400
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,670
you would other have otherwise not

401
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:55,410
gotten I don't think we're gonna get 70

402
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:58,080
grams off a half pound but I certainly

403
00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:00,870
think we'll get above 60 in total I've

404
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:03,509
already got fifty five point six in the

405
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:11,279
other bag so this is gonna crack open in

406
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:15,629
about 15 seconds all right a little bit

407
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:18,269
there anyway this one that had a mild I

408
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,650
had one that I kind of pushed out a

409
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:26,789
little bit there's gonna be some decent

410
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:30,420
resin in that little guy right there it

411
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:32,339
is always be prepare for as you're

412
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,810
removing you know lowering the toggle

413
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:36,750
down if you've got your fingers in and

414
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:38,609
around in and around that area you

415
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,109
really really really I don't think I

416
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:43,439
have to say this but you want to avoid

417
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:46,229
pressing your fingers that is gonna be

418
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,430
no bueno all right let's see the rosin

419
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:51,259
starting to come out already

420
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:53,549
what a lovely cultivar shout out to

421
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:55,589
maple butter boys for growing some

422
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:57,389
incredible herb shout out to karma

423
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:58,619
genetics for breeding some incredible

424
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,080
herb for those of you that don't know

425
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:04,439
where is my bike it is from karma

426
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:07,230
genetics it is the amnesia haze I

427
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,990
believe pre 98 cut if I've got that

428
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,819
right or 98 cut and it is crossed with

429
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,920
the biker Kush so a real producer

430
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:17,220
crossed with this real beautiful sativa

431
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:20,009
you know euphoric effects almost amnesia

432
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,750
like effects to be honest and yeah look

433
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:23,640
we left a little bit of rosin behind on

434
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,289
this one it's dripping on a second so

435
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,460
you know that there's a decent

436
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:30,089
in there if it's gonna get the drip

437
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:33,059
going terpene alene rich very very

438
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:35,159
sativa very euphoric uplifting some

439
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:37,169
people love it some people don't love it

440
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:40,019
it can cause a little bit of anxiety and

441
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,820
those that aren't heavy smokers but

442
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,509
heavy smokers generally really like this

443
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:47,939
cultivar great quick you know I think

444
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:50,339
I've been working maybe an hour and a

445
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,860
half total and I've squished a half

446
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:54,509
pound I've got close to 60 grams of

447
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:57,569
rosin that I've produced top-quality

448
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:59,129
rosin I'm gonna keep it myself because

449
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:01,019
it's beautiful and it's my medicine and

450
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:04,140
it'll probably keep me in rosin for the

451
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:07,470
next 3-4 months probably all the way

452
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:09,960
through the summer but I know the maple

453
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,490
butter boys have this cultivar available

454
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,410
so I'm not sure if they're still

455
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:16,140
retailing or what they're doing but I

456
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:18,150
know another group recently that I've

457
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,240
been promoting and helping which is see

458
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,710
this guy extracts and dabs to go you can

459
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,880
check them out on Instagram if you

460
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,940
wouldn't mind going and given those two

461
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,760
accounts follow they also have where as

462
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,769
my bike and a lot of the varieties that

463
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,450
I've been pressing lately because I got

464
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:38,279
some of the flour from them so the

465
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:40,230
chocolate the god but where is my bike

466
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:42,990
they've got some decent varieties

467
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,730
available as well and I consulted and

468
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:54,779
trained their guys so they're using the

469
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:57,620
long peaks press as well and alright not

470
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,619
a ton there but

471
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:04,519
Shuler kind of real cloud like I say

472

473
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:31,759
[Music]

474
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:44,119
all right I collected the other three

475
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:47,890
then I squished so far and got 2.5 grams

476
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:54,699
I suspect in total I'll probably get

477
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:54,700
maybe four see what happens

478
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:03,048
all right the compressors off again and

479
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:05,269
so thus is the music we've got a little

480
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:06,950
bit coming out on this one not quite as

481
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:09,009
much my battery's about to die so I'm

482
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:16,630
gonna switch that out right away

483
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:19,429
all right second last one here oops

484
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:21,590
I'm gonna slip slide but not too bad

485
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:23,179
still got the majority of the resin

486
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:28,639
there got a tiny bit on my glove at the

487
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:32,090
bottom but we survived it let's get

488
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,270
right to the last one and then down she

489
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:34,269
goes

490
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:42,629
[Music]

491
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:53,599
[Laughter]

492
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,599
[Music]

493
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,500
all right so this is the last squish of

494
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,720
all the squishes I've done I've done six

495
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,420
bags twice so this is the twelfth squish

496
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,710
and it's actually giving us a little

497
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,080
drip we're gonna get a substantial

498
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:26,590
amount I have gotten four grams so far

499
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:30,279
out of the second press I got over 55

500
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:35,500
grams for the first press so I'm looking

501
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:40,750
at about a hundred or surahs 6262 grams

502
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:46,119
of rosin per half pounds so that's like

503
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:50,109
a hundred and twenty to 124 grams I have

504
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:55,179
seen as high as 130 130 plus from this

505
00:29:50,109 --> 00:30:01,469
upwards of 30% but I certainly won't be

506
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:01,470
upset with a 27 to 28 percent return

507
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:09,869
all right

508
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,880
I've already pretty much removed all the

509
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:13,500
other ones but why don't we come and

510
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,450
we'll do this last one together and

511
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,619
we'll show you what we ended up getting

512
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:21,319
and yeah we'll finish off this video all

513
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:26,909
right

514
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:28,529
the way make sure we get all little

515
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,150
particulates of herb usually I would

516
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:33,660
have swept this all up but I've been a

517
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:35,070
little bit preoccupied also be careful

518
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,590
when you're collecting on an oil slick

519
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:39,329
or a silicone mat like this and

520
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:41,339
generally why that is because it's soft

521
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:43,169
and if you do the collection the way I

522
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:46,319
do the collection you can tear through

523
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:48,620
the screen I learned that with Johnny B

524
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:51,329
the other day when we did his cush and

525
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:53,549
so I'm just a little bit more careful on

526
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:56,279
this I do have to say I like collecting

527
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:59,129
on a larger surface area with this small

528
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,440
dab or that being said these guys have

529
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:04,320
sent me a really nice collection tool

530
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,630
that I have not yet used yet I have a

531
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:09,299
hard time collecting with a tool that

532
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,770
has such a flat large surface area it

533
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:13,379
just feels like it's gonna make it more

534
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:14,849
difficult to get the rosin off that

535
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,090
being said that is an assumption that

536
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:19,769
I'm having and I could potentially just

537
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:21,839
give it a shot and see see how easy it

538
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:24,180
actually is so far these guys haven't

539
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,730
let me down they have engineered the

540
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:30,660
Machine quite beautifully and as well as

541
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:32,009
the tools very simple tools but wow your

542
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,390
life sure becomes more difficult when

543
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:36,150
you don't have those simple little tools

544
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:38,220
to prepare your bud with you guys saw

545
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:40,380
how easy it was to break the buds up and

546
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,960
then jam them through the little funnel

547
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,700
with a little stick as well as flipping

548
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,059
the bags inside out all that stuff just

549
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:51,059
makes life easier so we'll put that on

550
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:54,089
our second batch and there's you know

551
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:59,069
I'd say there's 4.5 grams of seconds

552
00:31:54,089 --> 00:32:01,679
here you'll get this out of the way I'm

553
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:03,058
gonna scale out this is just a beautiful

554
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:07,169
cookie

555
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:10,528
almost 60 grams of where is my bike in

556
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:12,330
yo face it's got some weight to it I

557
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:14,148
won't lie that is some serious weight

558
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:16,528
right there so let's tear this other

559
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:19,109
section of the sheet then goes the air

560
00:32:16,528 --> 00:32:22,220
compressor in the background so yeah

561
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:25,859
this is just over 55 grams actually 50

562
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:30,269
5.06 not quite as high as I thought and

563
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:35,069
this is about 4.3 a little bit different

564
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:40,079
on the tare so you've got just under 60

565
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:44,220
grams here we go quickly here to my

566
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:47,339
little calculator my percentage

567
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:51,028
calculator you can zip that up right

568
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:54,868
away let's see what we got here 60 grams

569
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:56,759
now I didn't actually weigh the herb I'm

570
00:32:54,868 --> 00:32:58,288
guessing it was an accurate 1/2 pound it

571
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,069
could have been a little bit less well I

572
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:08,730
know it was a little bit less because I

573
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:10,369
kept out 9 grams right here so it's

574
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:13,509
probably more accurately

575
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:13,509
[Music]

576
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:27,920
let's just make that a little bit more

577
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:30,769
accurate 15 grams 28.0 3% is what we

578
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,920
have gotten here with that press pretty

579
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:35,839
solid return I'm not gonna lie and I'm

580
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,870
not sure what I'm gonna do with this big

581
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,699
paddy I guess I could get a big piece of

582
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:43,279
parchment and press it out into a big

583
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,759
disc why don't I do that I'll be right

584
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,920
back

585
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,079
all right so I ended up pressing that up

586
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:53,019
into a nice disc as you guys can see

587
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:57,589
here it's very thick it's a thick piece

588
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:59,660
55 plus grams and just yeah looks great

589
00:33:57,589 --> 00:34:02,769
let me see if I can't get the camera off

590
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,769
the tripod here

591
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:12,450
beautiful beautiful beautiful you can

592
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:14,789
already see within it there's a little

593
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:22,409
bit of buttering going on and this will

594
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:24,840
butter eventually all right why don't we

595
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:32,639
do a quick dab all right let's pull the

596
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:36,510
tiniest little section of this out I'm

597
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:39,329
gonna probably squish another another

598
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:43,530
little bit today so I still got a little

599
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:45,809
bit of work ahead of me but let's get a

600
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:48,890
little quick gab out of the mothership

601
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:48,889
Minnie shall we

602
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:55,210
my time twenty seconds heated and I

603
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:59,858
usually leave it for between 50 and a

604
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:02,079
minutes of cooldown that also depends on

605
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:05,318
how high you have the torch so the torch

606
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:11,920
isn't super high right now almost twenty

607
00:35:05,318 --> 00:35:14,019
second heat up there we go and I'm gonna

608
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:34,329
have to run and get q-tips in between

609
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:38,199
this because my Buster's there's one

610
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:44,670
right there perfect all right we've got

611
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:44,669
a 45 second 50 that sounds about right

612
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:12,579
got some DC glass cleaner for those

613
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,980
times that you hit it a little bit hot

614
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:18,789
not that that was too hot it cleaned out

615
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:24,579
quite beautifully with the DC there it

616
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:31,059
is nice and clean as a whistle we got a

617
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:35,230
beautiful Pattie I think that that was a

618
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:36,759
successful little run and long Peaks

619
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:39,400
pure pressure you guys can go check them

620
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,900
out of peer pressure comm might be gold

621
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,119
peer pressure comm I know their

622
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,430
Instagram is gold peer pressure I'll put

623
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,630
it on the video so it's correct no

624
00:36:45,429 --> 00:36:48,909
matter what and I'll also have it in the

625
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:50,920
comment section and yeah thanks for

626
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:53,849
watching bubble man bubble man's world

627
