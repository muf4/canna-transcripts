4
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:10,559
church that we did today so I thought I

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,879
would give you a quick little show of an

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,759
incredible piece that flab 421 dropped

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,960

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,320

00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,240
beautiful things about this uh Dosa

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,199
we've got this perfect opal in the

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,559
marble on the front it's got this

13
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,000
incredible kind of Mossy green color

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:34,439
with the crushed opal and the rainbow

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,238
cane um really an incredible

16
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,799
chubbler it's got a real deep deep pull

17
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:41,000
to it for the amount of water that's in

18
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,878
there and I've got the denail set in

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,600
with the direct injection quartz Bowl

20
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:50,960
we're going to hit a little bowl

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,079
of the sweet skunk so let's get a let's

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,920

23
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:01,920

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Mothership

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:36,040
damn let me count the ways on how that

26
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:38,399
was an incredible awesome hit

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,600
one the size of the hit was great but

28
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,759
the pipe takes the dab no matter what

29
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:47,599
you put through this thing I swear it

30
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,519
just it pulls with such ferocity that it

31
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,399
really is and for such a small down stem

32
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,599
on the thing I'm not sure exactly how he

33
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,799
nailed it but this is a winner two
