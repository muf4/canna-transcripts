and raised in Japan you know like a

52
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,719
normal Japanese guy and while I was in

53
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,439
there like I had like uh you know like

54
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,560
basic drug education from you know

55
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,639
Elementary School to high school like

56
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,519
once per year but the drug education

57
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,799
system is like pretty but there you know

58
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,920
everything is like mixed up H cocaine

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,480
weed everything like the same that's

60
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:39,158
what our government like told us well

61
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:41,238
but after you know uh graduated from the

62
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:43,199
high school I actually went to Hawaii

63
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,400
for like studying you know for like

64
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:49,359
Community College and I took one class

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,400
it's a it's like a social science and

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,319
there's a one topic from the textbook

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,239
and it was like a not the difference so

68
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:59,280
you know like some things are like

69
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,680
consider as like differently in other

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,039
country and there was an example and

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,480
that was like that was the weed so I

72
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,759
learned about weed in the class and you

73
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:13,639
know I have like interest

74
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,560
so well I did like doing research by

75
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,598
well mostly like just Googling about the

76
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,039
Cannabis and I found out it can be like

77
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:23,199
used like medicinal too as a medicinal

78
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,519
purpose too so I went to Street and buy

79
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,959
you know both like small pocket of

80
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,840
cannabis from the guy well it was kind

81
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,438
of sketchy guy but it was actually

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,080
cannabis and I brought back to my D Tree

83
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:39,479
and used it for the first time and I you

84
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,760
know that's why I realized I could

85
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:45,919
realize like the Cannabis isn't that bad

86
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:48,280
like as our government told us what I

87
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,318
found about the light and you know after

88
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,199
I graduate the college I I went back to

89
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:57,479

00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:09,200
was like California and at that time

94
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,158
actually medical poose was like uh

95
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:15,280
completely legalized in state of

96
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:18,319
California so I took medical license and

97
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,959
I was uh I was studying about journalism

98
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,759
in the university in California so I set

99
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,160
up the blog and you know I started tell

100
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,240
the story about cannabis and you know

101
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,280
like tourists of

102
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,720
cannabis well

103
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,000
and after that after I graded from

104
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,560
University I went back to Japan again

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,399
and I you know started working as an

106
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,319
office worker again but eventually I got

107
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:48,519
bald and you know I wanted to develop my

108
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:52,240
vog my blog thing

109
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:55,038
so uh so after that you know I wanted to

110
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,199
develop my blog so and I wanted to know

111
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:00,319
glow we like how to grow we so that

112
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,759
people can use it in Japan

113
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,159
because every resources are like in

114
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,360
English

115
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,560
mostly so I actually went back to

116
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,120
California again and there's a school

117
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,720
like teaching about how to grow cannabis

118
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,280
and like off uh local laws in cannabis

119
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,880
and the school name is like oakam

120
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:24,038
University so I went there and you know

121
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,360
learned a lot about cion and I brought

122
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:28,318
back the info you know I spent there for

123
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,639
three months and I went back to Japan

124
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,560
again and brought back the info from the

125
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,759
oom and I translated a lot of info about

126
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,319
growing

127
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,960
stuff and you know while I was and after

128
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,280
that uh while I was doing my web blog

129
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:46,839

to keep doing this web blog things

135
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,079
because providing info is like really

136

important part of like legalizing

137

little bit because I know a little bit

206
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:16,039
about the Japanese culture and I know

207
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:19,159
how tightly wound it can be and I got to

208
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:20,838
ask you like you know on top of the fact

209
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:24,240
like you're you're putting a lot aside

210
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,079
to promote this plant I mean is it not

211
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,039
sort of an extremely

212
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:32,199
intense energy or feeling to sort of

213
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,159
embarrass or get in trouble in the

214
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,120
Japanese

215
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,360

216
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,959

217
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,240

220
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:49,639
those are those not things that are

221
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,519
extra sensitive in the Japanese

222
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:55,600
culture oh yeah it's a very very well

223
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,360
it's con like pretty bad things to do

224
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,440
you know follow the passion for that

225
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,240
definitely definitely

226
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,120
what do your parents think about all

227
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:10,120
this well first of all I mean you know

228
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,159
my mother my mother want me to stay

229
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,919
outside Japan but because of that you

230
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,000
know because of that this boy learned

231
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:22,039
about cannabis and you know right now

232
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,559
keep smoking it but she is like

233
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,879
understandable understandable right now

234
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:29,159
she thinks it's okay you know because I

235
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,200
provided a lot of info and books written

236
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:34,078
in in English or something and I

237
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,200
translate it for her so now she

238
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:39,039
understands everything though well isn't

239
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,360
that the power of this intense plant and

240
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,159
the and the intensity of understanding

241
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,320
it in each language you know when my

242
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:49,319
friend Paulo approached me to do an

243
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,839
online course for the Brazilian people

244
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,360
you know I never really I was like well

245
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,040
don't they have the internet don't they

246
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,039
have access to all this information and

247
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:57,519
he said you know they they really don't

248
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,039
because all the information is in

249
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,839
English and there's not a lot

250
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:07,439
in Portuguese and so I went and did a

251
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:09,880
lot a class that is all in Portuguese um

252
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,519
for extractions and whatnot but uh it

253
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:15,759
sounds like we might have to do one for

254
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,839
the Japanese uh uh culture well because

255
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,399
this is very important work that you're

256
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,560
doing you know and the fact that you've

257
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,839
got governments down on you and you've

258
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:27,838
got like a whole almost the entire you

259
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,360
know country of Japan like leaning

260
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,959
towards you saying hey you know don't do

261
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,959
this I mean to put you in jail for 40

262
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:39,719
days as just the first kind of warning

263
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:42,159
is that's incredible to me man that is

264
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,879
like that is a long time to put someone

265
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,319
into a jail right hasn't even been

266
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:50,120
charged with a

267
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,000
crime I didn't have anything you know

268
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,560
not a gram of weed I was just providing

269
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,200
aall but they came so let's talk about

270
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:00,199
that I guess in a sense while you were

271
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,040
in Japan you sort of owed it to yourself

272
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,040
to make sure while you were sharing this

273
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:08,278
information that you didn't have big

274
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:11,240
bags of weed sitting around no yeah so

275
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,958
just how illegal is cannabis in Japan

276
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,440
for our audience if you get caught with

277
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,838
a gram or you get caught with say half

278
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,639
an ounce what are the repercussions of

279
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,800
such a thing well if someone possess

280
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,959
like a cannabis even though if it's like

281

284
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,800

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,679
20,000 and if you grow it and sell it

289
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,120

290
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,319

304
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:33,679
yeah actually we have like a you know

305
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:37,399
organization grp like NPO but you know

306
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:39,799
the progress It's not going well not yet

307
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,799
not yet and it's been like the the

308
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:44,039
organization has been doing like for

309
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:46,359
more than decades I guess definitely

310
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:49,799
more than decades but still we're in

311
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,039
this you know situation well what is

312
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,240
what is something that the viewers of

313
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,879
hash church and the panelists for that

314
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,320
matter cuz I don't know if you know this

315
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:00,240
about us but uh we're kind of big

316
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,320
proponents of cannabis plant we really

317
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,079
like to stick our nose in where it

318
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,680
somewhat doesn't belong and kind of get

319
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:10,278
things accelerated so if there was a way

320
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,919
that hash Church panelists hash Church

321
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:15,159
audience could potentially accelerate

322
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,879
these groups H how could we do that what

323
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:18,919
are the names of these groups where can

324
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,278
we find these groups can we support

325
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:23,399
these groups with information with

326
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,600
monetary donations what what are the

327
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,639
things we can

328
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,360
do well first for the organization like

329
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,519

in the morning so that's good skunkman

372
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,039
Sam welcome to the room we're just

373
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,759
talking to Karu who's a Japanese

374
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,719
cannabis activist who had to flee Japan

375
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,399
so that they wouldn't continue to lock

376
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,199
them up they locked them up for for 40

377
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,958
days just for translating grow

378
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:38,278
information for the people in Japan in

379
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:41,399
Japanese so he's now in uh Mexico

380
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:43,600
City uh yeah I guess still promoting as

381
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,559
much as you can and still getting your

382
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,000
Vlog up or your blog up on uh and to the

383
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:52,278
Japanese people are the government is

384
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,759
the government there fighting that is

385
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,919
there a way for them to shut your um

386
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,240
sites down or your information from

387
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,439
getting to the people

388
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,279
it's a very difficult I used to you know

389
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,038
I used to receiving the email I used to

390
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:09,639
receive the email from like Japanese

391
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:13,599
police but now it's no more because I

392
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:16,400
you know I did something for the blog to

393
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:19,240
maintain I cannot tell about like

394
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,839
exactly what I did but you know so I

395
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,439
think it's safe now but still if I go

396
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:27,958
back to Japan they can still like arrest

397
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,960
me I'm pretty sure about this yeah I

398
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,880
would be very worried myself and I don't

399
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,079
think it would be like you getting home

400
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,080
and and you know a week passing I think

401
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,918
it would probably be at the airport as

402
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,279
you were entering the country which is

403
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,720
just the worst after a long flight I

404
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,519
mean don't get me wrong it sucks pretty

405
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,200
bad when you're sitting at home enjoying

406
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,200
a Netflix special with your girl and

407
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,720
they kick the door down too but after

408
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,240
that 13-hour flight to get to your

409
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,079
country your country the country that

410
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,919
should literally be potentially building

411
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,199
a statue of you at one point in time

412
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,880
because you're sharing information that

413
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,679
is going to help the people of the

414
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,600
country there's just no doubt about it

415
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,720
last time I checked every single person

416
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,480
in Japan had an endoc canabo system and

417
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,400
the last time I checked cannaboids

418
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,960
regulate all biological functions

419
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,280
through that system so it would seem as

420
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,038
though you are doing the good work as uh

421
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:23,720
John Belushi and Dan akroy said in the

422
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:26,440
movie uh Blues Brothers we are on a

423
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,360
mission from God whether you believe in

424
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,600
God or not I feel that you are

425
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:33,839
definitely on a higher Mission and when

426
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:36,839
your friend who's in the chat right now

427
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:39,158
um mentioned that you uh had an interest

428
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:43,079
on on coming and and sharing your story

429
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:45,120
I was 100% for it I know that everyone

430
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,439
uh in the audience is asking what can we

431
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,199
do to help we love the church thanks for

432
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,200
everything you do for cannabis and the

433
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,558
people that use it we are so far ahead

434
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,880
of where you are at right now that

435
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,558
sometimes we forget a little bit because

436
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,320
we've been in this fight for so long and

437
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,119
we acquired all of these different

438
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,000
freedoms from medical and recreational

439
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,199
and being able to have you know a

440
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,640
licensed and regulated framework that

441
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,519
allows us to engage in this you know

442
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,960
this plant that we love so much we

443
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:16,079
sometimes forget that there's still

444
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,640
people rotting away in cages and there's

445
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,879
still people that are being you know

446
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,520
attacked by governments and uh it's

447
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,200
something we have to spend a little more

448
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:27,480
time kind of here on hash Church in

449
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,279
particular going backwards a little bit

450
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,798
and uh you know helping out some of

451
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:35,200
these places that um that aren't

452
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:37,440
California or that aren't Colorado or or

453
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,440
um Canada uh for that matter you know

454
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,720
we've got to uh we got to kind of make

455
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,440
sure that we make the international play

456
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,400
here positive for for all countries

457
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,679
involved and I think Japan is a very

458
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,679
good one because you know it seems to

459
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,440
have an incredible culture an incredible

460
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,360
people but in this one aspect they just

461
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,720
seem to have gotten this really really

462
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,479
wrong so I for one thank you kyou uh for

463
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,558
doing the work that you're doing and I

464
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,558
ask again if there's anything I can do

465
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:10,798
perhaps what we need to do is we need to

466
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:13,119
get some of um this group that you were

467
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,759
talking about in Japan I think someone

468
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:19,158
translated the the the name uh something

469
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,919
about canabo share the real info with

470
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:23,880
the Japanese clinical Association of

471
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,240
cannaboids so there's another one I'm

472
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,120
not sure if you're familiar with that

473
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,880
one but it would be great the same way

474
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:33,798
you have been translating in

475
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,919
information into Japanese from our

476
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:38,519
groups it would be amazing if you could

477
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,240
translate some of what they have into

478
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,359
English for our group so that we can

479
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,558
understand a way to to maybe engage with

480
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,759
these groups a little bit more and to uh

481
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:50,000
help these groups a little bit more just

482
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,000
an

483
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,480

487
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,200
stunning to hear that that kind of

488
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:11,440
government interference with a healing

489
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,200
plant is still going on um it's it's

490
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,720
good to be reminded of how far we've

491
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,400
come in some parts of the world and how

492
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,240
far we have to go in other parts of the

493
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,640
world uh do you think do you think or

494
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,798
anyone else on in the group think that

495
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:29,159
the recent changes at the UN where they

496
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,119
found that um

497
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,240
the that cannabis does not belong in the

498
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,558
schedule of controlled substances and

499
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,159
have recommended that changes be made in

500
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:39,798
laws across the country the world on

501
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,120
that is that do you think that will make

502
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,759
any difference in

503
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:47,359
Japan uh so you're asking me like a

504
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:51,158
because of like uh rescheduling the drug

505
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:53,879
schedule uh does that affect us like how

506
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:57,000
do you think well the the UN has an

507
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,919
international a treaty that covers uh

508
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,278
all countries are supposed to be signat

509
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:05,559
to it I guess that determines how

510
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:08,159
everyone's going to respond to drugs and

511
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:11,599
cannabis has you as you said as it used

512
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,559
to be that it was linked with heroin and

513
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,199
uh some of the other drugs that are more

514
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:20,879
problematic if you will

515
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:24,159
um so yeah I don't know how

516
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,799
much I know in the United States the UN

517
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,120
convention on drugs once had a lot of

518
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:29,639
meaning it doesn't seem to have a lot of

519
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:32,719
meaning at the moment we'll see how it

520
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,000
plays out but uh I was just wondering if

521
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,919
uh if you you have any sense if that

522
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,200
might make a difference to the Japanese

523
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,679
authorities well that's very difficult I

524
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,080
mean not a lot of people knows that you

525
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,038
know like ruring things and actually it

526
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:52,839
seems like it didn't have like any

527
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:55,519
impact on us you know and the thing is

528
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:59,599
like we like our government is like

529
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:02,639
thinking of creating new crime for like

530
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:06,038
use age of cannabis which we didn't use

531
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,440
to have it so I have no idea you know

532
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:11,480
like that whole world is kind of toward

533
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:15,720
to like legalization but now we are like

534
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:19,440
making it new one so so it it seems like

535
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:23,000
it didn't you know uh affect like in a

536
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,159
good way about the risk aduring things

537
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,919
did I did I answer you correctly I'm

538
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:28,919
sorry if I didn't get your question like

539
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,080
correctly no you you got the question

540
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:36,000
it's it's my sense that um it's not

541
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:40,119
clear if any effect will come from this

542
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,720
new finding by the UN um but I I view it

543
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:46,359
as exciting news uh in terms of the

544
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,079
whole world and its view on cannabis but

545
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:51,319
yeah I realize every Juris every country

546
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:54,399
every jurisdiction has a different

547
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:56,200
version of uh and prohibition is still

548
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,519
running strong in many parts of the

549
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,600
world so yeah again thanks for coming in

550
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,879
Kuru thank you thank you thanks BOS May

551
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:07,439
uh way what you bring up is true because

552
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,799
now every nation has to weigh in on what

553
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:15,360
the UN has done and uh Kayo I I think

554
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:17,599
this is a uh definitely an arrow uh in

555
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,359
your quill that you can fire there in

556
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,480
Japan because medical marijuana is now

557
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:25,918
internationally recognized um I want to

558
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,360
thank you I'm a uh I'm a former teacher

559
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:33,320

cannabis Warrior so thank you very much

562
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,679
for your hard work and your

563
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:43,240
dedication as you know it comes with

564
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,720
great risk and sacrifice as you are

565
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,319
finding out and I it absolutely

566
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:52,919
frustrates me to hear uh Japan continue

567
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:58,558
to push this type of prohibition when

568
00:24:52,919 --> 00:25:02,038
there are or were up to 10 uh Growers

569
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,639
I'm aware of that grow cannabis in Japan

570
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:07,079
traditionally hemp for

571
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,240
kimonos I saw a thing not too long ago

572
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,079
and they showed the women who actually

573
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,200
would peel apart the hemp with their

574
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:16,199
teeth and their teeth are completely

575
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,960
worn down from separating the fibers

576
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:23,399
from the ligant from uh you know

577
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:26,519
individual fibers so it is such a uh

578
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:28,319
traditional crop in the sense of going

579
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,599
back thousands of years and still using

580
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:35,398
used for traditional uh ceremonial

581
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:38,759
kimonos to this day so how

582
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:41,678
does the Japanese culture wave the

583
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:46,119
prohibition when they know there is

584
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:48,960
traditional use or have they been so

585
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:51,199
given so much misinformation that the

586
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,159
traditional Japanese are not aware of

587
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:58,399
their traditional hemp usage and

588
00:25:53,159 --> 00:26:00,720
cannabis usage uh we aware about like T

589
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:03,319
use of the hemp and cannabis plants of

590
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,480
course we know that but not a lot of

591
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:09,079
people you know and some of us like like

592
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,480
just forgot about that like once we have

593
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:14,398
it once we you know live with the plant

594
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,319
because you know there's a religion it's

595
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:18,678
a particular religion from I think it's

596
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,720
from Japan but it's called Shinto like

597
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,640
you said we use the plant I mean like

598
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,200
for the spiritual reason and like

599
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,679
traditionalism but you know we forgot

600
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,679
about that completely after got banned

601
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,120
yeah after the plant got banned from uh

602
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:38,480
by you know the United States yeah so

603
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,479
that's

604
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,759
interesting well keep up the good work

605
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,720
and the hard fight because we respect

606
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,038
what you're doing that's how it started

607
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,319
off in Canada originally Canada had a

608
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,158
Prohibition on any information and

609
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:55,879
that's how Mark hemry got famous

610
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:58,880
originally was the uh High Times case

611
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,000
originally importing High Times Marcus

612
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,760
yeah he was importing books that weren't

613
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
allowed he just thought that was the

614
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,679
most ridiculous thing ever he was just

615
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,079
like what do you mean we you can't have

616
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,200
these books like what what is this like

617
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,240
Nazi Germany that we're burning books

618
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,000
now and he honestly couldn't wrap his

619
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,038
head around it and this was like it had

620
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,720
to have been the 80s and I think I'm not

621
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:24,319
sure if the book thing happened after or

622
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,240
before but another thing he did that

623
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,439
really like got in the craw of the

624
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,319
Toronto people the Ontario people people

625
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,840
were he they would do these garbage

626
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:37,519
strikes and then he would go out and

627
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,439
hire scabs with his own money and trucks

628
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,398
to go pick up the garbage so that it

629
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,278
wasn't just sitting around all nasty and

630
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,599
disgusting which is what the garbage men

631
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:48,599
want so they can get paid more money but

632
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,359
he wasn't having it he was like you know

633
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:52,199
what you can get paid more money another

634
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:55,319
way you don't have to put all of our

635
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,600
people at risk by allowing garbage to

636
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,240
sit for weeks on end and so that was

637
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:03,319
another thing that he did he always

638
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,679
liked to do things that Society sort of

639
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:06,960
told him you know you're not allowed to

640
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,559
do this and of course he's gotten

641
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,640
himself into a bunch of hot water over

642
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:13,200
it over the years but yes he definitely

643
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,640
was importing High Times and some other

644
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,038
books that at his bookstore um in London

645
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,559
Ontario I

646
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:22,200
believe where he was yeah he was selling

647
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,398
these high times and some other books

648
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,558
that he you know that that that Canada

649
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,798
had a law against which was kind of

650
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,720
unbelievable that just one guy sort of

651
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,200
pushing that you know and then

652
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,720
eventually he would start his own

653
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,000
magazine you know like eventually he

654
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,399
would you know I I just think that he

655
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,759
was standing behind High Times thinking

656
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:43,639
that you know like I'm gonna help these

657
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,519
guys and we're GNA push this and then he

658
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,799
kind of slowly realized I don't think

659
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,480
High Times is the group to do this I

660
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,558
don't think these are these aren't the

661
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,360
Cannabis Warriors I thought they were so

662
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,158
then he started his own cannabis

663
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:59,278
magazine cannabis culture uh and I think

664
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:01,600
that magazine went for about 15 plus

665
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,798
years and uh it was pretty good it was a

666
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:06,558
pretty good magazine over the years well

667
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:08,759
it was a Seed Catalog with content over

668
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,558
time it was that's how we funded the

669
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:13,599
entire thing it had a 20page Seed

670
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:16,879
Catalog but funny enough you know like

671
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:19,319
photos that High Times scoffed at buying

672
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,640
from me in particular my macro

673
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,398
photography they just thought people

674
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,640
didn't want to see that which is

675
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:26,599
hilarious because it's kind of all it's

676
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,278
what all people want to see nowadays

677
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:31,918
with macro photography but Mark was the

678
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:34,159
first magazine out of all of them to

679
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,759
purchase uh my macro photographs and

680
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,919
he'd buy them like 20 30 40 photos at a

681
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,000
time whereas you know High Times was

682
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,320
just like n we don't want those and then

683
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,079
eventually you know weed world and red

684
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,519
eyee and all these other magazines sort

685
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,240
of uh ought up to the to to to those

686
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,038
types of photos but Mark was a little

687
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,240
bit ahead of his time in in that uh in

688
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:58,278
that way didn't he get the Sunday

689
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,640
shopping opened up as well those old

690
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:03,000
blue laws I think he did that as well

691
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,559
exactly the whole Christianity like oh

692
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
we're at church on Sundays and he's like

693
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,119
well guess what not everyone's a

694
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,759
Christian like not everyone goes to

695
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:11,359
church on Sundays like some of us want

696
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,278
to go to the mall on Sundays because we

697
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,599
work on Mondays we're not going to be

698
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:18,159
able to do our shopping till like Friday

699
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,199
afternoon if we don't go on Sunday so

700
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,480
yeah he was uh he's been a stickler for

701
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,798
a long time always getting people to

702
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,599
react that's Mark's specialty he also

703
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:30,038
had some incredible varieties that he

704
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:35,278
offered I remember the Kong specifically

705
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:38,079
KO n uh uh it's like a an offspring of a

706
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,839
big bud Cross or something but uh I

707
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:43,079
remember seeing like almost 2 liter

708
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:45,720
bottle colas off that variety like when

709
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:49,079
I was younger growing it and it always

710
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:52,519
stuck my mind that he always represented

711
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:54,638
this this uh exactly what what was it

712
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:59,519
you know the the story you know that you

713
00:30:54,638 --> 00:31:01,959

714
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,759

00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,759

722
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:26,319
individuals have a hard time accepting

723
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:27,679
um and believing in sometimes I know uh

724
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,798
it's something I've struggled with over

725
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,798
the years years and I finally cracked

726
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:34,240

I hope you have found traditional

754
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:46,558
Japanese have embraced what you are

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,839
doing and believe in what you were doing

756
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:53,079
so how big is the group that you have

757
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:54,558
there in Japan how small was it and

758
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:57,158
where is it

759
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:59,398
today well those well first all thanks

760
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:02,679
for you know telling me like a lot of

761
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:04,918
stuff like that means a lot to me and

762
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,120
the organization is like keep decreasing

763
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:10,278
the members actually because you know

764
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:12,798
like it was like a it it's been doing

765
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:15,359
like more than decades and you know some

766
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:19,879
of the members like I used to be patient

767
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:22,839
of like severe sick severe severe

768
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,960
illness but you know those people like

769
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:28,359
eventually have passed away like a lot

770
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,120
so members are like getting the GL

771
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:33,398
so we are like forming I think like new

772
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,479
me new groups or something you know

773
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:38,119
that'll be definitely better for

774
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,679
legalizing stuff it'd be great if we

775
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:42,759
could somehow make them bilingual groups

776
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:44,440
and have them be Japanese and English

777
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:46,798
because it would be great if we could

778
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,480
somehow get some of our information and

779
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,720
perhaps you're the conduit that we can

780
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,639
do that through you know perhaps we can

781
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,120
feed great information to you help back

782
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:59,719
you up on in on your fight with this and

783
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:02,199
uh yeah just sort of get the the caliber

784
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,600
of information that uh that no

785
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,679
government can deny we have information

786
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:09,440
that cannot be denied uh there's ways of

787
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,398
painting these governments into Corners

788
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,760
particularly with children who require

789
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:16,239
these medicines catastrophically ill

790
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,000
children in particular there's very few

791
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,279
governments that want to stand against

792
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,800
that they're they have no hard hard time

793
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,359
like oh hippies and long hair dudes with

794
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,159
tie-dye shirts they'll stand against

795
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:27,719
those guys all day long but when it

796
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,800
comes to a little girl having SE

797
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,799
seizures and suddenly not having

798
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,240
seizures I mean you got to be a

799
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,519
heartless heartless you know demon to

800
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:40,959
not feel empathy in such a situation and

801
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:43,960
uh you know Wade is someone that could

802
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,679
help a lot with stuff like that again

803
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,519
myself everyone on the panel here we we

804
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,320
are I mean I don't speak alone when I

805
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:55,358
say we are available to you

806
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,280
CaRu K I also in the chat I posted

807
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:00,358
um a group that I work with

808
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,839
pardon me I'm a combat veteran I served

809
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:04,358
in the

810
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:06,440
military and a bunch of US veterans got

811
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:09,119
together recently and we published our

812
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:12,240
first white paper called the green paper

813
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,838
and I put a link to it in the chat so if

814
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,159
you open it up it's a piece of

815
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,719
information that you can use the

816
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,519
original part

817
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:24,838
of the uh

818
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:26,800
1993 uh submitt by patient zero here in

819
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:29,358
the United States which is Robert

820
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,680
Randall he is the gentleman who sued the

821
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:36,078
United States and won the right to

822
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:40,279
actually receive cannabis grown by the

823
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,720
United States federal government uh and

824
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,400
it's a fascinating piece of literature

825
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,838
that was submitted to the Clinton

826
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,920
Administration back in the day that's

827
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:51,480
how far going back to

828
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,559
1993 we have not moved forward in the

829
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,519
United States but please take this

830
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,480
information because the back end of it

831
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:01,480
is also what Wade was speaking to uh one

832
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,639
of our veterans Michael crowz and

833
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,079
another group actually changed the law

834
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:08,239
internationally so the back end of it is

835
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,440
the submitt uh with the World Health

836
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,919
Organization and United Nations

837
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:17,000
information regarding that recent change

838
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:20,000
on December 2nd 2020 so uh take that

839
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,079
information and spread it translate it

840
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,920
uh it's there as an educational tool uh

841
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:26,720
to help and a shout out to my veterans

842
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,318
Action Council brothers and sisters much

843
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,118
love

844
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:33,800
thanks for providing that info I just

845
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:35,838
checked the link there thank you another

846
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,280
link that I just put up to chat uh first

847
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:41,199
of all very very nice to meet you uh

848
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,480
wait a second let me practice my

849
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:47,399
Japanese [ __ ]

850
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:51,358
MIM that's really good thank you nice to

851
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,880
meet you too very nice to meet you so um

852
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,960
so Professor wanabi is a very very

853
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,358
famous researcher in the area of CBD and

854
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,440
how it's metabolized in the liver and

855
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:03,199
has published very very important

856
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,400
research in this

857
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:10,318
area um I I don't know if he is a

858
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,160
proponent of cannabis but I could tell

859
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:15,079
you that their research group has

860
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:18,838
published very important papers on how

861
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:23,560
CBD is metabolized in the liver so maybe

862
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:26,480
uh a way to sort of embrace the medical

863
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:29,358
uh aspects of cannabis is to get support

864
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,960
within the Japanese universities and

865
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:33,598
perhaps Professor wanabi is a is a place

866
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,760
to

867
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,880
start excellent idea Mark uh leading him

868
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,920
to any type of professors that have

869
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,760
published

870
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,639
papers that is you know you want to back

871
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,119
yourself up with as much stuff that's

872
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:51,639
already being done by respected members

873
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,160
of the Japanese community and you want

874
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:55,598
to back yourselves up I would be

875
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:58,078
creating relationships with those people

876
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,599
science is an International Lang anguage

877
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,880
and actually there is there is uh the uh

878
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,440
Japanese bulletin of pharmaceutical

879
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,318
Sciences is a very very important

880
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:15,039
topnotch peerreview journal in this

881
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:16,960
field and um uh in my area of chemistry

882
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,759
and natural products chemistry some of

883
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,599
the most important work and Nobel

884
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,359
prizewinning chemistry has come out of

885
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,800
Japanese researchers I I've met one

886
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:31,318
Japanese Professor uh Prof Professor

887
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:34,519
noori who won a Nobel Prize but in this

888
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:38,358
area in canabo I think Professor

889
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:40,358
wanabi had uh many other students who

890
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:43,199
worked for him and they're now working

891
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:45,838
at other institutions and so I think

892
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:49,399
what you see is that if you can get with

893
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:51,799
him and try to find out his network of

894
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,800
canabo research that's going on

895
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:58,079
currently in Japan it might be a way for

896
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:02,240
uh the Japanese culture to embrace the

897
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:05,280
medical aspects of what canabo can do

898
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:09,199
the other important one in Japan is Dr

899
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:13,160
shama who I met several times at icrs

900
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:16,719
meetings and uh let me tell you he he of

901
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:20,799
course he also made one mistake he

902
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:24,239
thought CBD was the precursor for THC

903
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:28,039
but he figured it out later and uh he

904
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:33,000
also was one of the first ones to put

905
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:34,639
uh the synthes for THC into tobacco

906
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,519
roots

907
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:42,838
and feed the uh medium with CBG and it

908
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:44,880
transformed it he was the first one in

909
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,400
the world to do

910
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,480
this so we'll make a point on getting a

911
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,599
list of all these different names and

912
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,639
and papers just in case you don't know

913
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,680
some of them Karo you may know all of

914
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:57,920
them I'm not sure what level you're at

915
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,919
in your um in your

916
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,920
uh absorbing of knowledge at this point

917
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,720
but we'll put everything we can together

918
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,200
and get it sent off in an email so you

919
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:09,078
have links and and full names and stuff

920
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:11,919
so you can uh you know I think it's an

921
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:15,599
ex excellent idea to to lean into

922
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:18,838
science aspect of it it was Professor it

923
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,559
it was Professor Wan Abi's lab that

924
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:24,199
published that very

925
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:29,440
controversial finding of CBD converting

926
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:31,000
into THC in in synthetic gastric juice

927
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,880
and that was a very controversial

928
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,920
article because it implied that

929
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,960
potentially you can orally take CBD and

930
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,838
in in the gut it would that where it's

931
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,440
acidic it could turn into THC and they

932
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:48,199
actually identified I think four

933
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,318
metabolites from from their work but

934
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:52,799
then there was follow-up work and Ethan

935
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:55,079
Russo actually commented on some

936
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,400
following papers because they didn't

937
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:01,160
they weren't able to see any elevated

938
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:04,000
levels of THC in the bloodstream of

939
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:05,799
patients that were administered CBD only

940
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,440
but I think there were some flaws to

941
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:12,640
that study and I don't think that that's

942
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:16,200
fully uh fully uh uh uh understood but

943
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:19,679
it was Professor wanabi first paper in

944
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:22,719
this area that caused a lot of research

945
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:25,118
and concern in the area and so his paper

946
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:29,000
is highly cited and it's a very very

947
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:31,318
important paper for for what what it

948
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,639
represents so people in the chat are

949
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:37,480
asking if they do cannabis marches in

950
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:39,559
Japan is there ever anything like that

951
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:44,039
yes we have actually kind of as much in

952
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:46,759
Japan uh it's uh it's it happens like

953
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:50,679
may definitely yeah usually it happens

954
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,560
May and it's in like Tokyo Shibuya so

955
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,799
it's not you know we in like under the

956
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:57,559
pandemic right now so probably uh it's

957
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,920
difficult to travel but if you guys have

958
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:02,318
like opportunity you know please go

959
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,639
there and like join the March uh the

960
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:09,400
March like uh welcomes you like anyway

961
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:12,000
so would it be good advice when you're

962
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,039
visiting Japan at the Cannabis March to

963
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,358
probably not have any cannabis on you

964
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,199
well I definitely not recommend you

965
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,838
having something you

966
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:23,598
know yeah I do know I think I'll be

967
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,519
eating gummies before I go out for that

968
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,559
one definitely well you can definitely

969
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:31,519
smell like you know some somewhere but

970
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,400
then I not have it with you it's such a

971
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:36,440
crazy thing this whole prohibition of

972
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,880
this plant like this plant is loud it's

973
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,000
like it's the equivalent of it just

974
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,838
going

975
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,239
hey hey I'm over

976
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:47,318
here and you're just trying not to like

977
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:50,199
heat yourself out back in the day now

978
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:53,119
apparently that day is today in Japan

979
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:55,439
but for us it was 20 plus years ago you

980
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,838
know like on fish tour down in the US

981
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,639
where they were like having B oculars on

982
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:01,558
the buildings next to the parking lots

983
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:03,159
looking down at people and they have

984
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:04,960
these guys in the crowd that kind of

985
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:06,598
look like hippies but they're actually

986
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,318
narcotics officers and they're trying to

987
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:11,240
bust people EA project called dude and

988
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:13,800
we're all just like potentiating our

989
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:17,279
stereotypes and burning weed and big

990
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,280
bags of weed and eating psychedelics and

991
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,280
oh my goodness what were we thinking I

992
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,880
think well that that that's funny K I

993
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,319
wanted to ask you this as I was

994
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,519
listening to you uh uh speak before is

995
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:31,079
that you know uh and Marcus will agree

996
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:34,838
with me that part of uh the Cannabis

997
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:37,559
culture has evolved around music and

998
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:39,639
certain music genres and one of the

999
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,880
things that that I'm you know connected

1000
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:44,519
with is the Grateful Dead and and that

1001
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,119
kind of morphed into fish which is you

1002
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:49,440
know kind of like where Marcus and I

1003
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:52,720
have common musical roots and it's funny

1004
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,760
because in Japan there are Grateful Dead

1005
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:57,558
cover bands and there are fish cover

1006
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,400
bands in Japan

1007
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:03,400
so I'm wondering if there's like a

1008
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:08,039
little micro cannabis culture around

1009
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:10,400
those bands that play the music that we

1010
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:12,759
listen to and Associate cannabis with oh

1011
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:17,480
there's John

1012
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:19,040
Fishman this is from like 93 or

1013
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,199
94

1014
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:25,558
Syracuse yeah look at

1015
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:29,558
that so K is there any um uh scene

1016
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:32,800
around those those cover bands that

1017
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:35,880
bring cannabis around I I don't know

1018
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,960
well there's like a very famous hip-hop

1019
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,160
unit I mean group in Japan you know uh

1020
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,960
they look pretty scary they look pretty

1021
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:47,318
like a gangster type like Japanese

1022
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:50,199
Gangsta type but actually actually those

1023
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:52,880
guys like promoting like cannabis in a

1024
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:55,759
good way in a you among like younger

1025
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,800
Generations us so I mean we we still

1026
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,040
have hope we still have for that yeah

1027
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,440
but hey so regarding oh sorry sorry for

1028
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:06,079
like staring M topic but regarding the

1029
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,519
uh science is like a universal language

1030
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:12,160
like that's what Mark says right you

1031
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:14,239
just mentioned but we know like there a

1032
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,199
science but like too much propaganda

1033
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,318
from the government you know that

1034
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:22,318
brainwashes us so I want to know like

1035
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:24,920
how we can stop that because our

1036
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:27,119
government keep telling like once you do

1037
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,800
it once you smoke cannabis you will

1038
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,039
[ __ ] up like whole life and you will

1039
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,960
have like a you know tendency to kill

1040
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:37,838
someone and you'll be baren that's what

1041
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,400
you know our government is teaching us

1042
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,519
how do we think like how can we stop

1043
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,039
that what do you guys think I mean if I

1044
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:46,838
can you know beg you like for the

1045
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:49,960
otherwise I'm begging you to teach me

1046
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:53,078
that it's what you're doing it's exactly

1047
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,000
it's information right right the the

1048
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:56,960
brainwashing happens the most

1049
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,480
effectively when there's no Al

1050
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,039
alternative information flow when it's

1051
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,159
just the narrative is being controlled

1052
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:07,079
100% it's really easy to brainwash

1053
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:09,358
people whatever you feed them they'll

1054
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:12,640
basically swallow but the minute you

1055
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:14,639
start putting other streams into that

1056
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,679
you know that knowledge that's not

1057
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:19,440
controlled by them which is why they're

1058
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:22,039
so strict with you sharing information

1059
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,880
they put you in jail for 40 days without

1060
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:27,400
charging you they flexed on you so hard

1061
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,358
they said this is how powerful we are we

1062
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,680
could put you away for 10 years if we

1063
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,000
actually charge you so you better stop

1064
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,679
what you're doing in so many words you

1065
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,400
know so it's people fighting that energy

1066
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:42,318
and and really you know countries like

1067
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:46,240
Thailand which had extremely

1068
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:48,960
extremely strict cannabis laws just 10

1069
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,439
years ago it was another country you

1070
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,679
could serve 10 years in prison for

1071
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,880
getting caught with with hashish or or

1072
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:58,318
with cannabis in any amount over you

1073
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,920
know like five for 10 grams or something

1074
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:03,159
absurd like that so um the fact that

1075
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,920
they're even considering it in Malaysia

1076
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:07,960
I believe which had the like death

1077
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,519
penalty or life in prison Zero Tolerance

1078
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:13,358
signs all over the airport like nobody's

1079
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:16,239
business like we have no problem hanging

1080
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,799
you these are extreme perspectives and

1081
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,959
Views and those narratives are

1082
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,440
controlled by controlling the

1083
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,519
information so really what you're doing

1084
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,559
you know sacrificing and moving away

1085
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:29,559
from your friends and family to live in

1086
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,319
Mex me so you can continue to translate

1087
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:33,280
and share this information at the risk

1088
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:35,239
of maybe never being able to go back to

1089
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,319
your country without potentially serving

1090
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:41,358
jail time that's a real thing man what

1091
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:44,440
you're doing is is serious and uh we're

1092
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:47,558
all standing here behind you saying

1093
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,720
great job this is important work um and

1094
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:52,160
the Japanese people deserve this plant

1095
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:54,239
as much as anyone on this planet uh

1096
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:56,480
these are crimes against humanity that

1097
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:58,479
these governments are are perpetrating

1098
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,119
keeping plants like this from people

1099
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,880
that are so healing medicinal and

1100
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:06,079
preventative let

1101
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,400
alone the pharmaceutical industry

1102
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,720
couldn't come up with something like

1103
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,280
this if they tried a drug that works for

1104
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:13,679
like 80% of your ails and the side

1105
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:18,000
effect is

1106
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:20,358
Euphoria oh my God I'm not sure what the

1107
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,358
problem

1108
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,318
is hey the you know the the the other

1109
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:28,279
aspect we talked about the science and

1110
00:48:25,318 --> 00:48:30,960
the academics and again and you know

1111
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,880
Japanese culture and Japanese science

1112
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,720
has contributed so much in the in the

1113
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,960
landscape and the architecture of what

1114
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:40,159
we know today but there's the other

1115
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,358
thing that Japan has excelled in which

1116
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:45,519
is business you know and one of the

1117
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:48,920
major instrument

1118
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:51,280
manufacturers that sells a whole Suite

1119
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:54,639
of instrumentation to do cannabinoid

1120
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,160
measurement tpine measurement uh heavy

1121
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:59,199
metal measurement and everything if you

1122
00:48:57,159 --> 00:49:02,199
could basically use it in a cannabis

1123
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:05,598
analytical an laboratory

1124
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:07,679
shimadzu sells it so there's a big

1125
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,240
Japanese company that sells

1126
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:12,078
instrumentation all over the world and

1127
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:14,118
they you know what they're one of the

1128
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,039
instrumentations that companies that

1129
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:18,400
said we're going to embrace this

1130
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:22,199
opportunity and they renamed their

1131
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,240
hlc the Cannabis analyzer they renamed

1132
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:25,439
it you know so I mean they're totally

1133
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:27,959
embracing this Market they have

1134
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,039
brochures up on their website and you

1135
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,798
know that in some highrise in Tokyo

1136
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:35,119
they're counting all their money that's

1137
00:49:32,798 --> 00:49:37,119
coming in from all the instrumentation

1138
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,519
that they're selling into the Cannabis

1139
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,680
industry so I think between the science

1140
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:44,679
and the academics and the business side

1141
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:47,919
of things hey they can't play this game

1142
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:50,440
that cannabis is bad anymore right

1143
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,000

government pension investment fund or

1167
00:50:54,519 --> 00:51:01,239
something so they

1168
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,639
actually bought a lot of stocks from

1169
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:06,118

to like cannabis market like Canabis

1171
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:13,559

1179
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:35,880

1240
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:08,078

like multiple times a day and he does

1305
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,079
not here I'll meet I'll see you later he

1306
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,240
does not live close he's literally like

1307
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:59,640
over an hour away from where I live like

1308
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:01,879
an hour and 20 minutes even so one day

1309
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:04,879
the global pandemic will end and we'll

1310
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:08,280
be able to get back to um seeing each

1311
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:10,480
other in person not every day but I miss

1312

the masters of rosin and for the legends

1317
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,358
of hash and just all of those things are

1318
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,720
just so much fun I miss going to the

1319
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,239
island of J

1320
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:31,719
Jamaica I miss all my Jamaican friends

1321
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:34,479
and listening to ree music and making

1322
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:36,358
hash Outdoors Under the Sun you know

1323
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,719
like worrying about the ice melting and

1324
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:41,318
kind of trying to find a shady area

1325
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:43,519
that's a hot country man I'm telling you

1326
00:57:41,318 --> 00:57:45,000
uh water hash is not the most intuitive

1327
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:47,280
thing especially if you want to make it

1328
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,440
in the jungle a two-hour hike in you

1329
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,200
don't think about this but have you ever

1330
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,559
thought about how hot you can get

1331
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:56,960
carrying

1332
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:58,720
ice I have and let me tell you it's very

1333
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,440
hot unless you're Wally duck from

1334
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:03,639
Australia who's used to plus 45 Celsius

1335
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,639
in the summertime and he just carries

1336
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:09,038
the the ice on his head like it's

1337
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:11,159
nobody's business it it impressed all my

1338
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:14,680
Jamaican friends let me tell you while

1339
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:14,679
the rest of us got soft

1340
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:21,679
fast Johnny

1341
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:23,719
knows yeah it was definitely a lot of

1342
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:27,118
fun these are places we should be

1343
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:29,439
linking up don't you think Sam well I

1344
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,720

1348
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:44,719

1350
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:50,558
up so I hope to see some of you uh there

1351
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:54,358
uh needless to say because that is very

1352
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:57,400
exciting news uh but Koo I was wondering

1353
00:58:54,358 --> 00:59:00,279
um you're in meico now and of course

1354
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:04,240
things are working on changing there in

1355
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:06,720
Mexico so is there anything from uh that

1356
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:09,838
you can use from what Mexico is doing to

1357
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:11,759
change its laws to help you with what

1358
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:14,759
you're doing in

1359
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,119
Japan well I'm thinking like you know

1360
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,559
like getting the industry like it's not

1361
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:23,200
like legal yet to sell or buy or

1362
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:25,440
anything yet until next year so but if I

1363
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:28,318
get into like this industry and you know

1364
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:31,000
like be a guy you know like uh giving

1365
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:33,318
back to the community from what I got

1366
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,440
you know probably I can like promote

1367
00:59:33,318 --> 00:59:38,558
like using cannabis like uh having

1368
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:41,280
passion for cannabis use or like growing

1369
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:44,240
or selling you know that's gonna like

1370
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,359
make a difference like if I do it I can

1371
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:48,479
still be a normal guy I can still be a

1372
00:59:46,358 --> 00:59:50,519
good guy this is what I'm doing in

1373
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:54,000
Mexico you know so that I can you know

1374
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:56,838
tell this isn't bad to like old not old

1375
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,159
but you know like Japanese people

1376
00:59:56,838 --> 01:00:01,798
that's what I'm thinking right now by

1377
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:04,358
the way no the reason to go to Mexico is

1378
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,358
Mexican

1379
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:14,798
food well stay out of

1380
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:18,039
jail I always like the cheap kilos of

1381
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:21,038
wwan herb but that's just

1382
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:22,920
me I'm always making hash wherever I go

1383
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:25,280
so being able to buy some nice cheap

1384
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:28,039
kilos of some actually beautifully grown

1385
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:32,319
cannabis throw them in the bag wash them

1386
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:34,480
up that's uh that just makes sense

1387
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:36,880
Marcus the other day Wade and I were in

1388
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,000
a clubhouse room talking with a a

1389
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,838
dentist who I think lives right on the

1390
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:46,440
border in Mexico who's having difficulty

1391
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:49,838
um getting like high CBD oil without

1392
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:53,119
having to pay through the nose to to get

1393
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:55,480
what epid dialects so she was asking

1394
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:59,559
Wade for some hints on you know how to

1395
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:01,798
make a home CBD remedy for um for for

1396
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:03,559
for epileptic children well she'd have

1397
01:01:01,798 --> 01:01:05,239
to access the cultivars first and

1398
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:07,079
foremost then it's just a matter of

1399
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:09,318
growing them she's got the advantage of

1400
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:10,798
the sun being so close to the equator

1401
01:01:09,318 --> 01:01:12,519
it's probably not going to have a hard

1402
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:14,880
time yeah I forget what she said wait if

1403
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:17,079
she had access to hemp but I thought she

1404
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,880
did and I she was looking for how you

1405
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:22,920
would make it at home I

1406
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:25,440
think rosin is the maybe fastest easiest

1407
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,798
way and then with rosin you can dilute

1408
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:30,519
it out to ATT tenture or whatever it is

1409
01:01:27,798 --> 01:01:30,519
that you want to

1410
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:38,358
deliver yeah uh true that Sam uh her

1411
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,000
situation is she didn't have access to

1412
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:42,719
large quantities of

1413
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,480
material uh and yeah cultivar selection

1414
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:49,118
was a bit of an issue as well um I I

1415
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,559
pointed her to uh a few places where she

1416
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:52,400
might be able to find seeds that would

1417
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:55,278
be appropriate for children with

1418
01:01:52,400 --> 01:02:00,200
epilepsy and uh and yeah walked her

1419
01:01:55,278 --> 01:02:02,079
through some basic uh home scale type

1420
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:05,278
production

1421
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:08,519
techniques um because again U at this

1422
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:10,358
point uh the market there she just

1423
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:13,639
didn't did not have access to large

1424
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:13,639
quantities of material at this

1425
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,400
point that sucks I hate hearing that I

1426
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:21,759
hate that there's never a shortage of

1427
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:25,240
people growing thousands of acres for

1428
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:27,079
the gray Market to smuggle and ship and

1429
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:30,679
do all these things it would just be

1430
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:32,720
good if if if that was taken care of it

1431
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:36,000
really really I don't I don't know if

1432
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:37,639
you've heard mark But the uh federal

1433
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:43,278
government and state government has

1434
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:45,838
reported an 80% reduction in get uh

1435
01:02:43,278 --> 01:02:49,239
smuggling marijuana from Mexico to

1436
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:51,599
America that got seized in other words

1437
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:55,000
homegrown has pretty much replaced the

1438
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:57,119
market except for uh a small amount well

1439
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,278
they still grow they just don't export

1440
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:01,519
it to America anymore anymore it goes

1441
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:04,039
the other direction it's like even in

1442
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:06,038
colia they export their weed to other

1443
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:09,640
countries and they're also going to

1444
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:11,200
allow for uh individual plants too so

1445
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:14,318
you'll be able to grow your own I'm

1446
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:17,159
aware of yes yeah Alice was saying in

1447
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:19,440
the room the other day that the only you

1448
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:22,318
know large quantity cannabis that they

1449
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:25,000
have access to in Brazil is brick brick

1450
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:26,440
weed and that sounds like what used to

1451
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,358
come from Mexico

1452
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:30,039
so maybe it's going from Mexico down to

1453
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:34,519
Brazil

1454
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:37,079
now got to go somewhere or colia hey

1455
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:39,038
what what are the prices of cannabis and

1456
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:42,079
hash in

1457
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:44,319
Japan oh that's pretty expensive uh I'm

1458
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:47,200
not I don't know much about like hash

1459

peace out Johnny B Peace

1475
01:04:27,798 --> 01:04:34,358
please 50 bucks a gram hash must be like

1476
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,639
I I don't even

1477
01:04:34,358 --> 01:04:40,838
know 250 oh it got to be way more than

1478
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:42,838
150 dude it takes like five grams of

1479
01:04:40,838 --> 01:04:45,599
weed to make a gram of

1480
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:48,318
hash yeah if it's good

1481
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:52,079
weed if it's bad weed it could take 10

1482
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:53,920
grams thatd be a $500 gram of hash

1483
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:57,640
imagine what six-star bubble hash would

1484
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,639
sell for in Japan

1485
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:04,639
yeah you're gonna be rich like pretty

1486
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:06,720
quickly but it's illegal though yeah no

1487
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:09,759
doubt holy that's seriously illegal I'll

1488
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:11,679
tell you the price of products in

1489
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,599
different countries where it's illegal

1490
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:15,358
sort of leans towards just how illegal

1491
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:19,880
it

1492
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:23,558
is and uh wow $50 a gram for weed so

1493
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:26,240
let's do the math on a pound of cannabis

1494
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:30,480
I I know people who used to move Tai

1495
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:33,838
weed to Japan you know like uh multiple

1496
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:36,519
kilos of Tai weed at a time and it was

1497
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:39,119
selling for you know a 100 bucks a tie

1498
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:43,278
stick back back in those days when they

1499
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:46,960
were costing 50 cents in Bangkok and uh

1500
01:05:43,278 --> 01:05:51,798
what's really crazy is they told me the

1501
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:56,240
only trouble in Japan was that all their

1502
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:59,719
customers uh were Japanese mostly

1503
01:05:56,239 --> 01:06:04,639
and uh they had a tendency when they got

1504
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:07,318
busted to roll on who delivered it to

1505
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:12,879
them so that business ended pretty quick

1506
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:15,798
I'm guessing uh yeah but it had a big uh

1507
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,640
price to pay if there was problems well

1508
01:06:15,798 --> 01:06:20,480
that's

1509
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:24,400
$22,700 for a pound of cannabis sold at

1510
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:26,440
$50 a gram oh you're muted kuu if you

1511
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,000
had something to say yeah I muted no I

1512
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:31,679
just got surprised like you know that's

1513
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,278
a lot of money a lot of money and it out

1514
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:36,519
least I mean I sell like 50 USD but you

1515
01:06:34,278 --> 01:06:39,400
know it's like a minimum and you don't

1516
01:06:36,519 --> 01:06:43,239
know what you're GNA get you know so

1517
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:46,039
people are paying more exactly exactly

1518
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:48,639
depending on quality as well as you know

1519
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:50,880
accessibility but it still shows that

1520
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:53,278
prohibition doesn't work and that

1521
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:57,079
cannabis is still there cannabis is

1522
01:06:53,278 --> 01:07:00,960
still grown there I mean even uh quietly

1523
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:03,240
so do hydroponic companies sell uh

1524
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,838
knowing that people are growing cannabis

1525
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:07,278
or is it just kind of kept quiet

1526
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:10,038
underground like it used to be in the

1527
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:12,000
United States we used to talk Tomatoes

1528
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:13,920
we couldn't talk cannabis or

1529
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,559
specifically to the grow shop so we

1530
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:19,318
would talk tomatoes so a lot of tomato

1531
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:21,559
Growers uh yeah we have tomato Growers

1532
01:07:19,318 --> 01:07:23,798
and actually there's like a shops for

1533
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:27,440
like hydronic things I mean like

1534
01:07:23,798 --> 01:07:30,079
generally like growing things

1535
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:33,079
but well that was like I think that was

1536
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:35,798
like a few years ago but gr shop like

1537

01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:47,480
equipment to their customers and now

1541
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:51,039
he's like uh I think he got charged some

1542
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:53,838
kind of crime because he is pushing

1543
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:55,839
someone to grow we over there so just

1544
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:58,199
selling equipment it's like a very very

1545
01:07:55,838 --> 01:08:01,078
very Risky Business these days in Japan

1546
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:03,519
he was he was cultivating

1547
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:06,559
cultivators uh I'm not sure like he was

1548
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:09,358
C cultivating but you know he just

1549
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:12,119
supplied equipment yeah no I mean like

1550
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:14,960
you know how you can grow tomatoes what

1551
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:18,319

1552
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:21,920
cultivators he was creating creating

1553
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:24,798
cultivators so yeah sense now I I one of

1554
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:27,039
my mentors Ron hickey who um owned a

1555
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:29,039
hydroponic store in Winnipeg after he

1556
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:30,560
had just done six years in prison for

1557
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:33,119
growing cannabis where I'm from

1558
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,120
originally used to be pretty harsh uh

1559
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:37,039
with its laws against cannabis as well

1560
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:38,798
and they put my friend in jail for a

1561
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:40,920
very long time he did a six year and

1562
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:43,719
then he did a five year so he did 11

1563
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:45,520
years in a federal prison for uh for

1564
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:47,079
cannabis we have to get Ron on here one

1565
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,319
time to tell some of his stories he'll

1566
01:08:47,079 --> 01:08:51,158
blow your minds you just won't even he's

1567
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:53,440
like him and skunkman Sam could go on

1568
01:08:51,158 --> 01:08:56,158
with each other for hours I'm certain

1569
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:57,798
but uh yeah he had a hydroponic store

1570
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:59,439
and when I was very young I went into

1571
01:08:57,798 --> 01:09:01,759
his store and I was like Hey like I'm

1572
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:03,798
trying to grow some tomatoes and he's

1573
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:05,479
just like tomatoes e why don't we just

1574
01:09:03,798 --> 01:09:07,960
talk about what I know we're talking

1575
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:09,318
about weed and then he was just like

1576
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:11,759
took me down to the basement of his

1577
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:14,920
Hydro shop and just basically like

1578
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:17,079
started to educate me on you know herb

1579
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:19,119
and how to grow it and how to how to

1580
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:21,278
take care of it and how to love it and

1581
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:24,000
you know how to cure it and all of these

1582
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:26,080
different things that uh I just really

1583
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,119
would probably not be who am today

1584
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:29,960
without all of that mentoring from him

1585
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:31,640
in the early days taking me around to

1586
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:34,719
all these different grows that he had

1587
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:37,079
built and yeah it was a very unique

1588
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:39,600
times we'll have to uh have to get Ron

1589
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:41,198
on hash church one of these days but

1590
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,600
look what you've done look what You'

1591
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:46,599
have created and look at this tool that

1592
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:49,600
you've created and kro this is a Now new

1593
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:52,838
tool that you and your Japanese act

1594
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:55,719
activists can now share this information

1595
01:09:52,838 --> 01:09:58,119
and go to Every Apple Store and

1596
01:09:55,719 --> 01:10:00,158
everything and post this video on those

1597
01:09:58,119 --> 01:10:02,760
little videos so that people when they

1598
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:05,079
walk by see and go wait who's that

1599
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:08,280
Japanese person speaking about CA

1600
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:10,198
cannabis in Japan you know come on

1601
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:12,880
people we need to spread this knowledge

1602
01:10:10,198 --> 01:10:15,198
far and wide and by every gorilla means

1603
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:17,840
necessary so that this man and what

1604
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:19,678
they're trying to do there can uh break

1605
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:22,319
through those barriers because somebody

1606
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:25,840
was in chat earlier saying does any type

1607
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:28,799
of cannabis talk in Japan is crazy talk

1608
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:31,640
to those in the older generation so

1609
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,440
these are ways or hopefully or what ways

1610
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:37,800
would you suggest to break through the

1611
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:40,960
woolful ignorance of the older Japanese

1612
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:45,119
person watching this today Carol well

1613
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:50,679
for old Japanese person oh my

1614
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:53,279
God I have no idea but uh definitely

1615
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:55,440
they care about like their health right

1616
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:58,759

1618
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:04,920
like people in Japan majority is like

1619
01:11:02,279 --> 01:11:06,519
older people so we need to like grip

1620
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,800
their hearts like definitely for

1621
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:12,000
changing the laws so definitely talking

1622
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:14,760

01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:39,439
it's like a not like Japanese like

1653
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,839
English like people can't understand

1654
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:44,799
English too sometimes sometimes not a

1655
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,840
lot of people though so yeah just

1656
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:50,719
pushing us please push

1657
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:54,159
us give me a lot give us like a lot of

1658
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:57,039
pressures are pharmaceutical cannabis

1659
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:59,079
products available in Japan by

1660
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:03,560
prescription from a

1661
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:06,319
doctor uh I don't think so well we used

1662
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:08,719
to have that we used to have like a

1663
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:11,840
medicine made with cannabis I don't know

1664
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:13,960
what it's called but but we have we had

1665
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,360
that before but right now I don't think

1666
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:20,079
anyone used

1667
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:23,039
that do you think it is possible it's

1668
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:25,279
kind of interesting because one of the

1669
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:27,279
really big Japanese Pharmaceutical

1670
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:30,399
companies I can't remember the name

1671
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:34,198
right at this moment uh invested huge

1672
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:38,519
amounts of money into GW

1673
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:41,158
Pharmaceutical okay and uh so it's it's

1674
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:45,760
funny that the straight pharmaceutical

1675
01:13:41,158 --> 01:13:50,279
companies in Japan are investing in new

1676
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:53,320
and and by by GW Pharmaceuticals they're

1677
01:13:50,279 --> 01:13:55,399
talking about grown from plants not

1678
01:13:53,319 --> 01:13:59,039
synthetically made in a laboratory or

1679
01:13:55,399 --> 01:14:02,238
anything so it it's funny how they can

1680
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:06,439
play both sides of the uh

1681
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:09,519
line K is it possible for a Japanese

1682
01:14:06,439 --> 01:14:12,599
patient who has tried everything

1683
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:15,639
pharmaceutically and it does not work is

1684
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:19,440
there a way for them to petition their

1685
01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:21,960
government to import cannabis or a

1686
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:25,719
natural pathic medicine from another

1687
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,960
country like Canada or Israel or the

1688
01:14:25,719 --> 01:14:30,520
Netherlands per se this is something

1689
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,840
we're trying here in the United States

1690
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,440
since the program that I talked about

1691
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:38,319
earlier with Robert Randall is only down

1692
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:40,079
to currently one patient so soon that

1693
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:42,920
will be no more patients here that

1694
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:47,000
receive even medical marijuana so is

1695
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:51,480
there a way for a patient to go through

1696
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,800
your medical system to petition to then

1697
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:56,039
petition your the Japanese government to

1698
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:59,360
then import that that medicine and

1699
01:14:56,039 --> 01:14:59,359
therefore break that

1700
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:05,440
stereotype

1701
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:09,840
well you ask me is there any way right

1702
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:12,238
but I am not sure if we can do that even

1703
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:17,000
like if people like you know petition

1704
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:19,638
for it I don't think it's GNA happen but

1705
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,119
this helps definitely this this may help

1706
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:24,039
a lot you know like we had like this guy

1707
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:27,039
like who has like a cancer and he was

1708
01:15:24,039 --> 01:15:29,679
like a stage four he was actually using

1709
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:31,719
using like cannabis for himself you know

1710
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:34,719
he grow by himself

1711
01:15:31,719 --> 01:15:37,359
or uh well he grow it he grew it for

1712
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:40,000
himself but after he got arrested for

1713
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:42,880
like possess of cannabis he stopped

1714
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:46,279
using it he couldn't use it right

1715
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:49,239
because he was in the jail so we know

1716
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:53,960
that we know that story but still you

1717
01:15:49,238 --> 01:15:56,718
know we B the can ofis plan so it's very

1718
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:58,480
I think it's very diff go if even if

1719
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,760
people like a lot of people like from

1720
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:03,079
outside

1721
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:06,000
Japan ask for that like do some petition

1722
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:06,000
for that

1723
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:13,039
so well I don't know wait I don't I'm

1724
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:15,560
not sure like if I as uh gave you answer

1725
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:18,000
correctly but you you answered as best

1726
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:19,520
as you can you're just not sure and I

1727
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,679
understand one of the things that we

1728
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:24,400
used here in America was what you're

1729
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:25,840
talking about is using patients

1730
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:29,960
testimony

1731
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:32,159
uh as a arrow B basically telling people

1732
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:35,039
look at this person at this age who is

1733
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:37,119
using this cannabis and using their

1734
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:39,399
heartstrings tugging on the heartstrings

1735
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:41,800
showing them that this person could have

1736
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:43,759
gotten youth so the person you are

1737
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:46,320
speaking toward are they considered a

1738
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:48,760
hero in Japan or are they considered an

1739
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:50,639
outcast because they were using medicine

1740
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:55,320
and were arrested for

1741
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:57,440
it uh the person is Outcast right now

1742
01:16:55,319 --> 01:17:00,559
yeah

1743
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:03,079
well some people in Japan like trying to

1744
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,400
like well actually there's a film about

1745
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:07,800
him but you know not a lot of people

1746
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:09,279
like interested in it somehow I mean

1747
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,039
it's so sad

1748
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:14,960
though can you reference that film so

1749
01:17:12,039 --> 01:17:17,679
that we could be educated on it so sure

1750
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:19,960
we could share it so people could also

1751
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:23,319
take this and use it as a tool to

1752
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:26,039
educate other Japanese people sure sure

1753
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:28,679
sure I me I'm going to share the link in

1754
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:31,319
the chat

1755
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:35,880
here and we can share that in the

1756
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:39,799
Facebook yes sir bub yep thanks is is

1757
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:43,920
there any um difference around hemp

1758
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,920
versus cannabis in

1759
01:17:44,639 --> 01:17:50,000
Japan sorry background noise uh so is

1760
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:53,279
there any difference Yes actually we I

1761
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,479
mean there's a licensed Farmer for hemp

1762
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:58,439
actually we have it but it's really

1763
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:00,519
difficult to get the license and I don't

1764
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:02,879
think like a lot of people can get it

1765
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,159
these days and the difference between

1766
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:09,279
hemp and cannabis

1767
01:18:05,158 --> 01:18:11,519
uh we still use the hemp for like making

1768
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:14,399
something like clothes and stuff and we

1769
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:18,600
still consume like

1770
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:21,799
hempies for like Health Care item I

1771
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:24,440
don't know but I mean lately lately like

1772
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:25,840
CBDs are like getting popular in Japan

1773
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:29,198
so you

1774
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:32,119
know it's kind of getting better about

1775
01:18:29,198 --> 01:18:34,439
this but you know Still Still Still

1776
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:37,679
people do not not a lot of people do not

1777
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:41,158
know like hemp and the Cannabis is like

1778
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:44,880
the same plant you know but is is the

1779
01:18:41,158 --> 01:18:47,000
definition still um a cannabis variety

1780
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:51,480
with less than

1781
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:53,719
.3% weight THC so so so think of it

1782
01:18:51,479 --> 01:18:55,238
think of it like this if you grow an

1783
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:59,039
acre of that

1784
01:18:55,238 --> 01:19:00,399
at 3% and let's just use a round number

1785
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:03,000
because it's easy to understand the

1786
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:07,359
division say we get a th000 pounds of

1787
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:11,679
dried plant material from that

1788
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:14,439
acre that's three pounds of THC per

1789
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:17,760
acre right right right so that's that's

1790
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:19,638
a lot of THC to be growing in a country

1791
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:23,679
that can you can get in a whole lot of

1792
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:27,480
trouble for for THC what happens to that

1793
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:30,158
THC in that hemp that's grown in Japan

1794
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:33,439
it's got to be going somewhere

1795
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:35,719
right guess so I guess so they B it

1796
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:38,238
destroy the flowers immediately do they

1797
01:19:35,719 --> 01:19:40,760
get 500 bucks a gram no no no no no no

1798
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:44,238
wait wait wait so when they extract it

1799
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:47,320
there's THC comingled in the extract

1800
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:50,879
with CBD you can't just burn it they're

1801
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:52,479
not extracting they're using it for hemp

1802
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,159
I'm talking about the hemp flowers in

1803
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:58,399
Japan they they burn the flow and then

1804
01:19:55,158 --> 01:20:02,559
they use the uh fiber uh for traditional

1805
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:04,439
kimonos and other Shinto spiritual uses

1806
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:06,840
uh but there as far as I'm aware because

1807
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:09,319
this is from an article a few years back

1808
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:12,400
that I had read specifically on these

1809
01:20:09,319 --> 01:20:14,279
handful of women who are uh they're

1810
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:16,359
traditional craft people which as we

1811
01:20:14,279 --> 01:20:19,439
know craft people in Japan are have

1812
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:22,039
their own elevated status so they're as

1813
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:23,919
stated there's only one particular grow

1814
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:26,679
and it's a traditional way that they

1815
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,639
harvest and it follows their tradition

1816
01:20:26,679 --> 01:20:30,279
but I I was aware that they just cut the

1817
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:31,920
tops and burn it I understand what

1818
01:20:30,279 --> 01:20:33,119
you're talking about specifically you

1819
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,880
know scientifically I was just

1820
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:38,960
referencing specifically that regional's

1821
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:42,440
growth because even the the game uh

1822
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:45,760
ghost of tsushima which I play on

1823
01:20:42,439 --> 01:20:47,759
playstation uh 4 in certain areas where

1824
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,880
you go on the island there's traditional

1825
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:54,039
hemp growing uh in the game because it

1826
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,960
was traditional to Japan so it's there

1827
01:20:54,039 --> 01:20:58,158
it continues to be there but

1828
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:00,480
unfortunately as KO was saying there's

1829
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:02,719
so much misinformation now that the

1830
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:06,198
traditional Japanese doesn't know that

1831
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:10,600
they're even the same plant

1832
01:21:06,198 --> 01:21:14,079
correct it is correct it is correct

1833
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:17,280
yeah if you look in the chat you'll see

1834
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:20,319
uh an article I posted about uh

1835
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:22,960
traditional this was a half an hour ago

1836
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:28,599
and I also posted one about an interview

1837
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:31,399
with Dr uh shyama who uh was a Pioneer

1838
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,400
in cannabis

1839
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:36,800
chemistry interesting that a country

1840
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:41,099
that was so against cannabis would have

1841
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:42,400
so many chemistry Pioneers in chem in

1842
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:45,159
[Music]

1843
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:47,559
cannabis and a thousand thousands of

1844
01:21:45,158 --> 01:21:48,599
year history of using cannabis just in

1845
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,840
different

1846
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:56,520
circumstances

1847
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:56,520
right yeah fascism sucks

1848
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:01,238
but thankfully we have Warriors like her

1849
01:21:59,719 --> 01:22:04,239
out there who are actually working

1850
01:22:01,238 --> 01:22:06,559
toward changing it and we need more more

1851
01:22:04,238 --> 01:22:09,158
like you doing what you're doing so that

1852
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:11,560
we can break down the barriers so that

1853
01:22:09,158 --> 01:22:13,638
you know many years from now people

1854
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:15,719
won't know what you had to deal with

1855
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:18,159
because it's wrong it's a shame that you

1856
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:21,158
are you are shamed out of your own

1857
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:24,198
country for doing what is historically

1858
01:22:21,158 --> 01:22:27,079
part of its tradition so do do you know

1859
01:22:24,198 --> 01:22:29,678
[ __ ] jaanese citizens that sit in jail

1860
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:32,760
today because they used cannabis and

1861
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:35,119
they're in there for a long time yes I

1862
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:37,760
mean there's a lot a lot a lot like a

1863
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:39,479
lot of people still like got caught

1864
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:42,760
because of like possess or you know

1865
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:45,439
growing it definitely a

1866
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:47,920
lot I see like news article like every

1867
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:51,399
day like someone got caught you

1868
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:53,960
know how about any friends of yours a

1869
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:57,599
friend of mine I don't think I have you

1870
01:22:53,960 --> 01:23:01,480
know I have no one I probably my friends

1871
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:03,159
are like okay somehow but yeah well

1872
01:23:01,479 --> 01:23:05,879
again when you consider the business

1873
01:23:03,158 --> 01:23:08,359
aspects if people are getting in trouble

1874
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:10,719
and people are getting busted there's a

1875
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:12,639
bunch of people making money off that

1876
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:14,639
and the people who make money off that

1877
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:17,159
are the testing companies because now

1878
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:20,359
people have to piss into a bottle and

1879
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:23,000
all the attorneys and the courts and I

1880
01:23:20,359 --> 01:23:25,960
don't exactly know how prison is handled

1881
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,479
in uh Japan but certainly here in the

1882
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:31,840
United States there's lots of industries

1883
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:34,399
that benefit from Cannabis prohibition

1884
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:37,239
and and and they need cannabis to be

1885
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:39,799
illegal in order for their businesses to

1886
01:23:37,238 --> 01:23:42,599
thrive and they don't want the laws to

1887
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:45,279
change which again is quite

1888
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:46,880
hypocritical Koto is there a possibility

1889
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:48,639
one of the things that we found is a

1890
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:51,639
powerful tool which you may have seen at

1891
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:54,880
oaksterdam University is Chris Conrad

1892
01:23:51,639 --> 01:23:58,119
and Mickey Norris created a uh a

1893
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:00,520
prisoners educational campaign where

1894
01:23:58,119 --> 01:24:03,559
they would actually compile the names

1895
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:05,800
and pictures and the stories of those

1896
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:08,760
who have been arrested here in the

1897
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:11,639
United States and then they made it into

1898
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:13,360
a wall that would travel around so they

1899
01:24:11,639 --> 01:24:15,279
would just take a little travel wall and

1900
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:18,158
where they would go they would put the

1901
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:21,039
faces so that people could see the faces

1902
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:23,359
of these people and know their names and

1903
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:26,279
know their stories and know why they're

1904
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:28,639
in jail and and for how long they're in

1905
01:24:26,279 --> 01:24:32,039
jail we found that was a great

1906
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:34,560
educational tool to make people aware of

1907
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:36,880
the Injustice because it puts a face to

1908
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:39,760
the issue it's no longer just about the

1909
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,960
issue here are hundreds of faces with

1910
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:45,079
stories that could be your brother your

1911
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:48,000
sister your cousin your nephew you know

1912
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:52,000
we found these were very effective tools

1913
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:56,679
so you might consider start building a

1914
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:58,800
database of those and then also uh then

1915
01:24:56,679 --> 01:25:01,079
making a mirror back to Japan and say

1916
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:03,440
look at your sons and your daughters

1917
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:06,279
that you have put in jail over this

1918
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:08,519
plant and this is what and then add up

1919
01:25:06,279 --> 01:25:10,198
all their years so you can see that

1920
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,719
there's hundreds of years there that

1921
01:25:10,198 --> 01:25:15,000
people are serving all over a simple

1922
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:17,279
plant that is part of your tradition

1923
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,880
it's shameful and you should use that

1924
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:22,399
education uh potentially if you want

1925
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:25,118
that is a tool that you could use to

1926
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:29,039
shape to show them the Ingus that

1927
01:25:25,118 --> 01:25:31,439
traditional Japanese are experiencing

1928
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:33,399
today that sounds very good that sounds

1929
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:35,960
Prett good we have to tell the story

1930
01:25:33,399 --> 01:25:39,079
about you know the people got caught

1931
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:41,920
about just producing or growing cannabis

1932
01:25:39,079 --> 01:25:44,439
that sounds nice I mean one of the

1933
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:48,319
things where we even know about how

1934
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:51,279
harsh Japanese laws are today is because

1935
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:54,840
a musician Paul McCartney got busted

1936
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:57,639
many many years ago with a lot lot of

1937
01:25:54,840 --> 01:26:00,679
cannabis and he spent and he did time in

1938
01:25:57,639 --> 01:26:03,760
Japan so we are well aware of the

1939
01:26:00,679 --> 01:26:05,920
injustices just from him alone but he

1940
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:08,480
got off light because he was a celebrity

1941
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:11,920
if he was traditional Japanese he would

1942
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:13,439
still probably be in jail today yes yeah

1943
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,880
that happen that happens yeah that's

1944
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:19,599
possible he's a celebrity that's why he

1945
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:21,679
was okay but normal people like us like

1946
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:25,960
me I don't think so I don't think I can

1947
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:25,960
get out like that soon

1948
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,960
not for that much cannabis because

1949
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:30,840
wouldn't he caught it with like a

1950
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:34,319
quarter pound or something or a pound of

1951
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:36,719
weed it was a it was significant Mark do

1952
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:38,880
uh Dr sheldone do you remember what uh

1953
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:41,439
he got busted with or how much it was

1954
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,118
wasn't it wasn't like an

1955
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:46,079
ounce no it was just his personal stash

1956
01:26:44,118 --> 01:26:49,000
in his suitcase it was quite

1957
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:52,600
embarrassing how how little it

1958
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:54,920
was which tells you the tolerance level

1959
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:57,560
you know just even head stash is against

1960
01:26:54,920 --> 01:27:01,480
the law you know

1961
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:04,960
yeah well he he he he manned up he did

1962
01:27:01,479 --> 01:27:08,879
his time and the other thing was that uh

1963
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:11,639
he didn't ask one of the uh uh stage

1964
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:15,359
crew or anybody else to carry it for him

1965
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:17,679
I mean he he was a man about it and uh

1966
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:20,079
if I remember right though part of his

1967
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:23,639
plea agreement and how it helped him get

1968
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:26,198
out early was he made an anti-drug uh

1969
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:28,039
promo for the Japanese government I

1970
01:27:26,198 --> 01:27:31,919
think

1971
01:27:28,039 --> 01:27:31,920
so that sounds about

1972
01:27:36,198 --> 01:27:40,439
right well we've given him a lot of

1973
01:27:38,439 --> 01:27:46,439
things to think about and you know again

1974
01:27:40,439 --> 01:27:46,439
just the the hypocrisy that's to

1975
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:52,279
Japan you know I mean this is this

1976
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:54,440
happens everywhere you know and what

1977
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:58,920
what can they learn I think you said at

1978
01:27:54,439 --> 01:28:01,799
at&amp; is like where we were like 23 24

1979
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:04,199
years ago maybe in some states you know

1980
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:07,800
certainly California and Colorado were a

1981
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:10,158
little more Progressive and other states

1982
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:14,000
but you know if you just look at the The

1983
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:17,679
Greening of the US map in the last you

1984
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:20,238
know 25 years you could see that you

1985
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:23,760
know the the the train has left the

1986
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:25,479
station and there's no turning back and

1987
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:27,039
we were talking about this on clubhouse

1988
01:28:25,479 --> 01:28:30,959
the other day with Michael bakus he

1989
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:34,920
thinks it's very important that the un's

1990
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:37,800
treaty has now what Dlisted am I saying

1991
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:39,199
this right uh aten they've removed

1992
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,800
cannabis from

1993
01:28:39,198 --> 01:28:44,799
their four it was a schedule four which

1994
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:47,639
mean it had no medicinal use and it was

1995
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:50,520
re removed from that on December 2nd

1996
01:28:47,639 --> 01:28:54,840
2020 so now for the first time in the

1997
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:57,400
world since this the uh 40s Etc medical

1998
01:28:54,840 --> 01:29:00,800
marijuana is legal across the world and

1999
01:28:57,399 --> 01:29:04,519
countries can use this un Charter to

2000
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:06,639
show that is now legal internationally

2001
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:09,199
medically and that changes the

2002
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:11,440
financials the changes like banking it

2003
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:13,599
changes it changes the way the world

2004
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:16,559
Works according to can when it deals

2005
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,679
with cannabis right I mean is is is is

2006
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:22,679
is that real and will we end up seeing

2007
01:29:18,679 --> 01:29:24,719
that at the consumer level in time but I

2008
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:27,399
mean we haven't even seen the DEA is

2009
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:29,439
still in denial uh and has not even put

2010
01:29:27,399 --> 01:29:31,638
out a statement regarding it because the

2011
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:34,359
rest of the world looks to the DEA as

2012
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:36,520
kind of the uh ruling party because

2013
01:29:34,359 --> 01:29:38,639
they're the ones that usually have the

2014
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:41,880
outside influence that comes into

2015
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:44,920
countries with you know military etc etc

2016
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:47,719
so uh their Silence has been absolutely

2017
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:50,440
deafening so these are moments where

2018
01:29:47,719 --> 01:29:53,279
countries are seeing like uh you know

2019
01:29:50,439 --> 01:29:55,719
Mexico and others are being emboldened

2020
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:58,399
by this change change internationally

2021
01:29:55,719 --> 01:30:02,679
and I think Koo can actually take this

2022
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:04,799
into uh Japan and educate them on the

2023
01:30:02,679 --> 01:30:07,840
laws of change and what you thought you

2024
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:10,560
knew is no longer what we know and

2025
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:13,679
because it is medically accessible it is

2026
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:16,880
now against international law for Japan

2027
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:18,719
to possibly prosecute I don't know I

2028
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:21,319
these are things that individual

2029
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:24,560
countries now have to exercise and find

2030
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:26,759
out at the international level but uh we

2031
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:29,639
are seeing other countries as stated

2032
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:32,600
being very International International

2033
01:30:29,639 --> 01:30:35,600
countries make the final legal decision

2034
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:38,719
that can it's absolutely the way it is

2035
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:42,840
they can follow the UN suggestion or

2036
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:45,158
they can say screw you un and uh

2037
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:48,560
continue to put them in the electric

2038
01:30:45,158 --> 01:30:50,960
chair if they if they have a Single Seed

2039
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:54,000
but there there already has been

2040
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,800
importation of cannabis from country to

2041
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,679
country that's already been happening

2042
01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:01,760
kind of around the language of the

2043
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:06,440
existing treaty I think the change in

2044
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:07,480
the treaty now makes that compliant you

2045
01:31:06,439 --> 01:31:10,919
you

2046
01:31:07,479 --> 01:31:12,919
can at Mark it's always been for medical

2047
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:15,960
use not for

2048
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:19,319
recreational International

2049
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,920
Trade right okay yeah I mean I don't

2050
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:24,399
know how you make the distinction when

2051
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:27,840
it's just bulk material so well like if

2052
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:30,839
I stub my toe that's

2053
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:33,480
medical no I I I get that but I mean if

2054
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:37,480
you're talking about importing whether

2055
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:39,238
it's finished goods or or or oil or or

2056
01:31:37,479 --> 01:31:42,198
or biomass I don't think you would be

2057
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:45,000
doing that but I think it would be uh

2058
01:31:42,198 --> 01:31:48,799
you know finished package Goods done in

2059
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:51,279
a a white label you know facility in a

2060
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:54,400
place where labor is

2061
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:56,840
inexpensive being exported to the you

2062
01:31:54,399 --> 01:31:59,638
know Market that has the money I.E

2063
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:02,000
Western Europe and and the United States

2064
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:05,600
eventually it's probably decided by both

2065
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,600
the exporter and importing country how

2066
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:10,920
it is because I've heard of it going in

2067
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:14,159
bulk to Germany for example from Canada

2068
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:18,079
that's right yes and and eventually

2069
01:32:14,158 --> 01:32:20,879
Japan so I I think like maybe like 10

2070
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:23,000
years from now Japan will will catch up

2071
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:25,679
with the rest of the world that you know

2072
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,920
this is an inter ational commodity

2073
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:31,480
similar to I guess tobacco in that you

2074
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:34,079
know respect uh it's grown it's

2075
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:36,799
processed it's made into products and

2076
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:39,279
people in all countries want them and

2077
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:42,159
and and there shouldn't be laws that

2078
01:32:39,279 --> 01:32:45,719
would discriminate against

2079
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:47,559
access uh only and and it's interesting

2080
01:32:45,719 --> 01:32:50,000
that you say medicinal I mean again I

2081
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:51,960
don't know how how would they how would

2082
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,319
they be able to control that would they

2083
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:56,198
be able to control that down to the

2084
01:32:53,319 --> 01:32:58,399
retail there probably has to be a doctor

2085
01:32:56,198 --> 01:33:03,238
script you probably have to buy it from

2086
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:07,198
a pharmacy or a supplier of a pharmacy

2087
01:33:03,238 --> 01:33:10,000
or it's it's Prof professional like

2088
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:12,559
every other pharmaceutical drug you

2089
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,880
buy right well that's what we have in

2090
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,679
Pennsylvania is totally medical and

2091
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:21,560
that's what we have is cards and it's

2092
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:24,480
good to dispensary yada but I mean what

2093
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:26,800
yeah I yeah I I I I just wouldn't know

2094
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:29,399
how they would keep it if some states

2095
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:31,119
are like recreational and medical how

2096
01:33:29,399 --> 01:33:34,039
would they segregate and they'd have to

2097
01:33:31,118 --> 01:33:37,158
it would have to be I I I honestly don't

2098
01:33:34,039 --> 01:33:40,198
know I know here in Holland if you have

2099
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:45,519
a doctor's prescription you can buy

2100
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:48,279
bedan weed from Bar's otchs and uh if

2101
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:51,400
you want to travel to other countries in

2102
01:33:48,279 --> 01:33:55,079
Europe with your medicine it's legal

2103
01:33:51,399 --> 01:33:58,158
under the shaning agreement so you you

2104
01:33:55,079 --> 01:34:00,000
contact the office of medicinal cannabis

2105
01:33:58,158 --> 01:34:03,000
and they write a letter explaining

2106
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,840
what's going on and you can do it

2107
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:09,960
legally hey Mark uh in in Massachusetts

2108
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:12,360
uh the CCC requires a certain threshold

2109
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:15,840
uh for recreational and medical to be

2110
01:34:12,359 --> 01:34:19,880
held at all times behind uh in back a

2111
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:22,600
house so um when you come in there's a

2112
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:24,600
different register system that is

2113
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:27,800
accounted for

2114
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:30,079
for recreational as there is for medical

2115
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:33,199
and you see different um sales

2116
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:35,719
associates for those specific lines and

2117
01:34:33,198 --> 01:34:37,960
uh there's a different menu there's

2118
01:34:35,719 --> 01:34:40,279
could be things on the medical menu that

2119
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:43,560
may not be available on the recreational

2120
01:34:40,279 --> 01:34:45,399
menu and uh there's a different dosage

2121
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:49,080
requirement as well in state of

2122
01:34:45,399 --> 01:34:50,920
Massachusetts you can't have uh above

2123
01:34:49,079 --> 01:34:53,359
five milligrams per

2124
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:55,840
dose so if you have a gummy let's say it

2125
01:34:53,359 --> 01:35:00,198
can't be above 5 milligrams per per that

2126
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:03,119
dose now you can put uh you know 25

2127
01:35:00,198 --> 01:35:05,000
recreational side Colin yeah on the W on

2128
01:35:03,118 --> 01:35:08,399
the recck side now on the medical side

2129
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:10,719
it could be I think it goes up to 100 or

2130
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:14,000
TW or 100 milligrams or something you

2131
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:15,198
could you could get in there um but uh

2132
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,238
but what's interesting about that is

2133
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:19,519
that when you move over to tinctures the

2134
01:35:17,238 --> 01:35:22,599
sky's a limit like you as much as I

2135
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:24,719
could fit in there I could yeah so what

2136
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:28,000
a bunch of meaningless

2137
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:30,118
[ __ ] well kind of it just it falls

2138
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,479
the black quick in terms of the rules

2139
01:35:30,118 --> 01:35:34,039
because you're like wait I I'm

2140
01:35:31,479 --> 01:35:36,519
restricted really heavily here but over

2141
01:35:34,039 --> 01:35:37,800
here like it's free range you know like

2142
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:40,639
you know you can you can really

2143
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:42,440
formulate for instance uh you know for

2144
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:45,880
the medical side in a in a particular

2145
01:35:42,439 --> 01:35:49,039
way that is um a lot more sophisticated

2146
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:50,760
so it's it's um you know it encourages

2147
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:53,000
people to actually have a medical card

2148
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:55,760
you save money like in any state over

2149
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,319
the taxes is you know there there's

2150
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,800
benefits but well you save money by

2151
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:02,679
going to the gas station and getting

2152
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:05,039
yourself some Delta eight gummies and

2153
01:36:02,679 --> 01:36:07,359
Delta Delta eight cartridges and and

2154
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:09,600
then you're all set I guess and that's

2155
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:12,198
what you think cannabis is and the

2156
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,960
Cannabis unfriendly environments you

2157
01:36:12,198 --> 01:36:15,839
know yeah that's that's a diff that's a

2158
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:18,600
totally different one but but I think

2159
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:21,639
that's how we deal with it um you know

2160
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:24,079
I've dealt with it in in this state um

2161
01:36:21,639 --> 01:36:27,000
and I think that's to your point point I

2162
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:28,800
think there's there's in non-cannabis

2163
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,279
Friendly States you know you have your

2164
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:32,760
your Delta eights and you have your gas

2165
01:36:30,279 --> 01:36:34,880
station buys and that's shaping their

2166
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:37,639
knowledge and their uh understanding of

2167
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:40,840
where where you know cannabis is for

2168
01:36:37,639 --> 01:36:43,600
them but you know we we have thresholds

2169
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:45,800
and I would imagine when PA does its

2170
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:48,920
thing to go wreck it's going to be

2171
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:50,880
similar um you know that that's what

2172
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:53,719
I've seen I how does California deal

2173
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:55,279
with it currently ATN do you guys have

2174
01:36:53,719 --> 01:36:56,920
these thresholds are you guys dealing

2175
01:36:55,279 --> 01:37:01,519
with any of that kind of stuff or is it

2176
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:06,000
just simply this is rck and this is

2177
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:08,719
medical how does it you know is it even

2178
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,719
a thing out

2179
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:15,440
there yes but at the end would be a

2180
01:37:12,439 --> 01:37:18,198
better one to answer that

2181
01:37:15,439 --> 01:37:20,879
question I'm sorry what was the

2182
01:37:18,198 --> 01:37:22,519
question uh what were you drinking no

2183
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:24,840
I'm just

2184
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:26,400
joking coconut water sorry my wife was

2185
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,520
asking I was having a conversation with

2186
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:31,319
my

2187
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:32,960
wife uh I was asking uh you know in the

2188
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:35,439
in the state that I've been operational

2189
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:37,600
in there was thresholds for recreational

2190
01:37:35,439 --> 01:37:41,359
and medical that you had to kind of

2191
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:43,800
abide by do you in

2192
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:47,000
doses you know everything from dosing

2193
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:49,960
and then all the way to the amount that

2194
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:53,560
you have for retail like there has to be

2195
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:56,359
a certain threshold to account for

2196
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:58,960
patients versus recreational patients if

2197
01:37:56,359 --> 01:38:01,238
you will there has been a distinction IE

2198
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:03,560
for Edibles in California but for the

2199
01:38:01,238 --> 01:38:06,399
most part for the flower and everything

2200
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:08,599
else it's pretty uh just normalized over

2201
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:10,879
the counter but uh there are

2202
01:38:08,599 --> 01:38:14,239
availability of thousand milligram

2203
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:16,679
options for medical specifically in

2204
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:20,000
California uh but again these are just

2205
01:38:16,679 --> 01:38:22,679
arbitrary madeup numbers decided by

2206
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:26,198
somebody out of fear uh same thing of

2207
01:38:22,679 --> 01:38:29,118
the 0 3% THC and hemp and they're GNA go

2208
01:38:26,198 --> 01:38:31,399
away don't you think ATN it should

2209
01:38:29,118 --> 01:38:34,158
because what I use is different than

2210
01:38:31,399 --> 01:38:36,399
what you use and my medical use

2211
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:38,839
especially for somebody who is going

2212
01:38:36,399 --> 01:38:41,519
through a severe medical situation it

2213
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:45,480
needs to be a higher dose we have found

2214
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:47,719
uh to be effective and we found once uh

2215
01:38:45,479 --> 01:38:50,559
the laws changed in 2018 there was a

2216
01:38:47,719 --> 01:38:53,039
whole thawath of edible and edible

2217
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:55,960
options we lost in California because

2218
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:58,679
they were in the higher level of

2219
01:38:55,960 --> 01:39:01,800
THC and you have to also understand that

2220
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:04,359
all these products prior were made by

2221
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:06,560
patients for patients because there were

2222
01:39:04,359 --> 01:39:09,000
not a product on the market that met

2223
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:11,960
their medicinal need so there were a

2224
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:15,000
thousand milligram Edibles there were

2225
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:15,840
you know exceedingly large THC amounts

2226
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,719
that

2227
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:22,279
unfortunately recreational users found

2228
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:25,880
out by accident or had adverse reactions

2229
01:39:22,279 --> 01:39:29,198
Etc but those medical users still Pine

2230
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:33,000
and wish they could have access to those

2231
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:35,479
older higher THC Edibles and what we

2232
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:38,198
have seen here in the United States KO

2233
01:39:35,479 --> 01:39:40,519
is we have a push back by politicians

2234
01:39:38,198 --> 01:39:44,158
and one of our oldest politicians Diane

2235
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:49,560
Feinstein here in California is pushing

2236
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:51,920
to lower THC limits uh below a man-made

2237
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:54,679
threshold she has no understanding of

2238
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:56,679
what I use Etc but me and my other

2239
01:39:54,679 --> 01:40:01,000
veterans all use high

2240
01:39:56,679 --> 01:40:03,840
THC uh Edibles medibles uh I use

2241
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,079
concentrates because it helps me with

2242
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,719
the various symptoms of my

2243
01:40:05,079 --> 01:40:09,559
post-traumatic stress disorder and my

2244
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:12,198
Gulf War syndrome so for me it is very

2245
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:14,800
helpful and useful whereas if a normal

2246
01:40:12,198 --> 01:40:18,000
person who had never experienced THC

2247
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:21,159
ingested what I ingest on a day time it

2248
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:23,639
would be Beyond uncomfortable so there

2249
01:40:21,158 --> 01:40:25,679
has to be a balance and what col is

2250
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:28,560
speaking to is there is not a balance

2251
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:30,840
here domestically and in each one of our

2252
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:33,480
states we're dealing with current

2253
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,639
prohibitions to lower THC limits we

2254
01:40:33,479 --> 01:40:37,759
dealt with it last year in California

2255
01:40:35,639 --> 01:40:40,079
and we were able to get that away

2256
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:42,440
however right now in Florida and in

2257
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:47,039
other states they're actively trying to

2258
01:40:42,439 --> 01:40:49,198
push lower th3 C thresholds out of fear

2259
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:51,719
so even though we have moved things

2260
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:54,238
exponentially here K we still have

2261
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:56,480
politicians and those that either

2262
01:40:54,238 --> 01:41:00,198
benefit or want to benefit from this

2263
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:01,718
prohibition continuing to use lies

2264
01:41:00,198 --> 01:41:03,678
outright

2265
01:41:01,719 --> 01:41:06,279
misinformation and

2266
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:08,399
confusion and using these kind of a

2267
01:41:06,279 --> 01:41:10,559
downtime by being quiet about it in

2268
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:13,638
their states trying to do it quietly so

2269
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:16,480
that they don't get the push back or the

2270
01:41:13,639 --> 01:41:19,359
yell from the community at large which

2271
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:22,359
of course Florida is trying to uh

2272
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:25,598
mobilize but the politicians changed the

2273
01:41:22,359 --> 01:41:27,719
laws quicker sometimes then then the

2274
01:41:25,599 --> 01:41:30,440
populist can educate themselves on the

2275
01:41:27,719 --> 01:41:33,399
law sorry that may sound confusing but

2276
01:41:30,439 --> 01:41:37,039
we've just have a great push back and we

2277
01:41:33,399 --> 01:41:39,118
need to be constantly diligent even here

2278
01:41:37,039 --> 01:41:43,238
right now so that uh because right now

2279
01:41:39,118 --> 01:41:46,000
it's Kevin sbet and smart who is the uh

2280
01:41:43,238 --> 01:41:48,479
largest uh anti-prohibitionist uh

2281
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:51,198
organization currently going they are

2282
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:54,359
actively going around pushing Colorado

2283
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:57,079
uh Florida Etc to so they've created an

2284
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:59,039
organization a prohibitionist Koo that

2285
01:41:57,079 --> 01:42:01,279
are going out to push lies and

2286
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:03,880
misinformation to change the laws

2287
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:06,399
currently because we have been so

2288
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:09,199
effective in changing the laws now they

2289
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:13,118
want to make up lines in the sand to say

2290
01:42:09,198 --> 01:42:16,158
oh well above 15% THC is now the danger

2291
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:19,799
and is now the big spooky evil Boogeyman

2292
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:23,359
which is not the case yes THC can be AB

2293
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:26,079
abused yes people cannot handle High th

2294
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:28,920
C but we can't lump everybody into the

2295
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:31,158
same use because we the medical people

2296
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:33,079
are going to suffer so we the medical

2297
01:42:31,158 --> 01:42:34,920
people are going to be the ones with the

2298
01:42:33,079 --> 01:42:36,840
loudest [ __ ] you know we're not going to

2299
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:39,679
take this we have to fight it and we

2300
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:43,079
have to go back out to our Educators and

2301
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:44,880
to our uh constituency our politicians

2302
01:42:43,079 --> 01:42:46,719
and make them aware that this is a lie

2303
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:49,400
this is manipulation and you're being

2304
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:51,039
manipulated so the work still needs to

2305
01:42:49,399 --> 01:42:53,839
be there right now because the laws are

2306
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:56,158
changing this week in Florida and as

2307
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,480
well as they're trying to in Colorado so

2308
01:42:56,158 --> 01:42:59,879
people if you're watching and you're in

2309
01:42:57,479 --> 01:43:02,039
those States get active find a local

2310
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:03,800
organization get a petition call your

2311
01:43:02,039 --> 01:43:06,519
constituency make them aware to

2312
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:09,440
challenge these laws that they do not

2313
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:12,360
deserve to be happening sorry it's 2021

2314
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:15,079
but shit's still

2315
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:18,399
happening can't sit on our asses and do

2316
01:43:15,079 --> 01:43:23,158
nothing people get active yeah I'd like

2317
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:25,879
to jump in and um uh take take it back

2318
01:43:23,158 --> 01:43:28,799
back over to Japan and I was thinking

2319
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:31,920
about ways that you might be able to

2320
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:34,800
create messaging to change public

2321
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:36,960
perception so that people more fully

2322
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:39,679
understand what cannabis could be doing

2323
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:44,840
for folks and and you observed that the

2324
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:47,880
Japanese culture is heavily uh

2325
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:49,920
uh there's a lot of folks who are

2326
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:51,639
elders and there's a number of

2327
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:54,158
conditions that many Elders are subject

2328
01:43:51,639 --> 01:43:59,560
to that cannabis can be very helpful for

2329
01:43:54,158 --> 01:44:02,359
arthritis comes to mind um uh certainly

2330
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:05,159
cancer uh and some of the effects of

2331
01:44:02,359 --> 01:44:06,960
cancer treatments and in the same way

2332
01:44:05,158 --> 01:44:11,118
that uh I think it was ET Yen who

2333
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:13,359
suggested that you put together a a wall

2334
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:16,639
if you will of photographs of people who

2335
01:44:13,359 --> 01:44:19,238
were in jail over cannabis you could

2336
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:22,359
also do the same thing about educating

2337
01:44:19,238 --> 01:44:25,000
folks around persons who are dealing

2338
01:44:22,359 --> 01:44:27,679
with a condition like arthritis or

2339
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:30,599
epilepsy and that it might be a benefit

2340
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:34,039
for their condition because it does work

2341
01:44:30,599 --> 01:44:35,960
it's it's really uh it's part of why I'm

2342
01:44:34,039 --> 01:44:37,639
so fervent about my love for this plant

2343
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:39,960
is I've seen over the years what it can

2344
01:44:37,639 --> 01:44:42,440
do for so many different people in so

2345
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:44,319
many different situations that have to

2346
01:44:42,439 --> 01:44:46,359
do with their health and their sense of

2347
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:51,759
well-being and their

2348
01:44:46,359 --> 01:44:54,920
their Joy of living if you will uh so

2349
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:56,960
um yeah that's just a thought and

2350
01:44:54,920 --> 01:45:00,239
personalizing

2351
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:02,760
personalizing an issue like cannabis

2352
01:45:00,238 --> 01:45:06,118
prohibition is what changes people's

2353
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:08,119
minds because it opens their heart to

2354
01:45:06,118 --> 01:45:10,839
understand the predicament of the folks

2355
01:45:08,118 --> 01:45:14,559
around them not everyone enjoys full

2356
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:16,719
health for whatever reason but uh

2357
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:19,440
personalizing things helps people open

2358
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:22,000
their minds and that opens their hearts

2359
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:23,638
and that's how you change people's

2360
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,000
perceptions of this

2361
01:45:23,639 --> 01:45:28,520
plann thank you I would also suggest

2362
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,158
utilizing and reaching out to your

2363
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:32,320
veterans there are veterans who have

2364
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:34,839
served in international conflicts around

2365
01:45:32,319 --> 01:45:37,920
the world and we have found that

2366
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:39,840
veterans voices because we use cannabis

2367
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:42,480
because uh we have tried every other

2368
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:44,679
pharmaceutical use out there and we have

2369
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:46,839
not found the help that we have found in

2370
01:45:44,679 --> 01:45:49,239
cannabis as well as other psychedelic

2371
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:51,639
plants uh again cannabis is more of a

2372
01:45:49,238 --> 01:45:54,678
pallative for the day-to-day but we also

2373
01:45:51,639 --> 01:45:57,159
know that uh mushrooms as well as other

2374
01:45:54,679 --> 01:45:59,440
psychedelics are very helpful for

2375
01:45:57,158 --> 01:46:01,479
dealing with the post-traumatic stress

2376
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:04,000
uh that people have experienced so do

2377
01:46:01,479 --> 01:46:07,238
not for neglect the veterans voices

2378
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,599
because they are very strong because uh

2379
01:46:07,238 --> 01:46:11,638
[ __ ] Japan loves and respects its

2380
01:46:09,599 --> 01:46:13,520
Warriors of which you are one but those

2381
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:16,159
who have served in combat hold another

2382
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:18,440
special uh eye in

2383
01:46:16,158 --> 01:46:20,960
their uh they're held on their own

2384
01:46:18,439 --> 01:46:23,238
pedestal so to say so don't forget to

2385
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:25,399
actually uh lean on them as well well

2386
01:46:23,238 --> 01:46:28,839
because they will speak up because they

2387
01:46:25,399 --> 01:46:30,719
have used and want to use cannabis so

2388
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:33,960
and they love their

2389
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:37,639
mushrooms Japanese people love

2390
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:40,760
mushrooms so again there's history

2391
01:46:37,639 --> 01:46:43,840
here and you guys love your records too

2392
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:46,880
man incredible there used to be the most

2393
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:51,199
incredible uh record collections ever in

2394
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:54,000
the world in Japan and uh you you must

2395
01:46:51,198 --> 01:46:56,000
know what I'm talking about uh so you're

2396
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,800
really lucky to have that as well that

2397
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:01,158
culture is thick thank you thank you

2398
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:04,079
guys oh sorry go ahead what what does I

2399
01:47:01,158 --> 01:47:09,000
mean uh are psychedelics uh mushrooms

2400
01:47:04,079 --> 01:47:10,960
LSD as illegal as uh as in psilocybin

2401
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,479
mushrooms are they as illegal as

2402
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:16,520
cannabis in Japan or are they more

2403
01:47:13,479 --> 01:47:20,238
tolerated well it's illegal right now

2404
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:22,920
it's illegal yeah but we I don't know

2405
01:47:20,238 --> 01:47:25,079
back then like more than two decades ago

2406
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:28,319
it was like legal I mean we didn't have

2407
01:47:25,079 --> 01:47:31,079
like any rules like consuming mushrooms

2408
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:34,479
but one actor from Japan like got

2409
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:39,118
panicked after he ate mushroom and did

2410
01:47:34,479 --> 01:47:41,598
something crazy [ __ ] and now it's banned

2411
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:45,799
yeah leave it to one guy to mess it up

2412
01:47:41,599 --> 01:47:49,319
for everyone else totally man I think a

2413
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:53,000
lot of they should name the law after

2414
01:47:49,319 --> 01:47:56,679
him I I think a lot of law around drugs

2415
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:00,840
has to do with fear of how people might

2416
01:47:56,679 --> 01:48:02,960
misuse them and meantime out of fear we

2417
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:07,039
miss all of the potential benefit and

2418
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:12,039
opportunity for healing and uh acting

2419
01:48:07,039 --> 01:48:12,039
sanely about the world I mean

2420
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:20,480
hello yeah governments want to control

2421
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:22,519
people uh governments should be in

2422
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:24,479
service to the people but in fact it

2423
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:27,760
seems seems to be more about wanting to

2424
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:31,079
control people in the way people think

2425
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:36,480
um it's a public misconception of this

2426
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:39,800
one guy who had a mystical event right I

2427
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:39,799
me what a

2428
01:48:40,439 --> 01:48:45,559
shame somebody said the gentleman

2429
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:49,400
actually ate mushrooms and ran into a

2430
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:49,400
store naked asking for his

2431
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:56,039
mother was she working there or for or

2432
01:48:53,479 --> 01:48:57,559
what that was probably the most exciting

2433
01:48:56,039 --> 01:49:01,599
thing that happened to all those

2434
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:03,920
Spectators all day that was what a

2435
01:49:01,599 --> 01:49:07,159
wonderful

2436
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:09,520
thing humans do the craziest [ __ ]

2437
01:49:07,158 --> 01:49:12,519
especially on

2438
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12,520
psychedelics

2439
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:22,800
yes very true mark As Art link letter

2440
01:49:17,039 --> 01:49:22,800
always said drugs do the darnest things

2441
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:31,920
what's going on did I miss something

2442
01:49:29,439 --> 01:49:33,839
funny you guys are smiling uh yes we

2443
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:36,599
were talking somebody posted in chat

2444
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:38,920
that the there was a famous Japanese

2445
01:49:36,599 --> 01:49:41,440
actor and what happened is he he uh

2446
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:44,118
stripped off his clothes and ran into a

2447
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:47,439
store uh asking for his mother and

2448
01:49:44,118 --> 01:49:49,799
apparently that was the uh the negative

2449
01:49:47,439 --> 01:49:52,158
reaction whereas most people if they saw

2450
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:54,560
a famous star naked they would all be

2451
01:49:52,158 --> 01:49:56,960
mushrooms were legal up to that point

2452
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:59,000
and then this happened to this guy and

2453
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:02,439
now mushrooms are

2454
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:05,198
illegal so talking about dumb [ __ ] we've

2455
01:50:02,439 --> 01:50:07,279
done on uh on uh psychedelics which I

2456
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:09,198
know none of us have ever done anything

2457
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:11,238
out of the ordinary in any psychedelics

2458
01:50:09,198 --> 01:50:14,919
in any way shape or form right ladies

2459
01:50:11,238 --> 01:50:14,919
and gentlemen no no no

2460
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:23,119
no I'm old enough muted Marcus we can't

2461
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:25,319
hear you I said thank God we grew up in

2462
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:28,238
a time that didn't have cell phones and

2463
01:50:25,319 --> 01:50:31,319
cameras in everyone's like pocket like I

2464
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:33,279
have to be honest like I'm really happy

2465
01:50:31,319 --> 01:50:35,118
that the technology exists and I can

2466
01:50:33,279 --> 01:50:37,319
engage with you guys and it's all but

2467
01:50:35,118 --> 01:50:40,238
I'm like the timing of It Came perfect

2468
01:50:37,319 --> 01:50:43,479
for me I did not need this [ __ ] when I

2469
01:50:40,238 --> 01:50:46,839
was like 16 17 18 years old let me tell

2470
01:50:43,479 --> 01:50:48,959
you record when I was I think it was 16

2471
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:52,199
the last time I had health class in high

2472
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:55,960
school and they had like the the scary

2473
01:50:52,198 --> 01:50:58,519
drug video for us I remember when they

2474
01:50:55,960 --> 01:51:01,840
got when it got to the LSD part they

2475
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:06,000
showed a woman at a party and the party

2476
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:09,840
had like 60s mod music playing and know

2477
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:13,158
like typical typical acid kind of 60s

2478
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:15,920
party and she she took and they said on

2479
01:51:13,158 --> 01:51:17,759
LSD you have illusions that things

2480
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:19,639
aren't the way they see you know and

2481
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:21,760
next thing you know she's on the balcony

2482
01:51:19,639 --> 01:51:24,000
wanting to kill herself wanting to jump

2483
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:26,880
off the balcony and trying to scare

2484
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,920
people to think oh if you take this

2485
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:30,840
you're going to find the balcony at the

2486
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:32,440
party and you're going to Teeter on the

2487
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:34,639
edge of it they don't show her jumping

2488
01:51:32,439 --> 01:51:37,198
off but you know it's just an you know

2489
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:40,239
reenactment what a terrible vibe to pre-

2490
01:51:37,198 --> 01:51:42,198
promote you know it got even better for

2491
01:51:40,238 --> 01:51:44,198
us in Louisiana they showed this woman

2492
01:51:42,198 --> 01:51:46,879
the dangers of LSD and they showed us

2493
01:51:44,198 --> 01:51:49,879
this movie and this woman jumps out of a

2494
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:52,000
second story window and lands on the

2495
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:54,719
ground and starts taking the the glass

2496
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:58,359
and starts cutting her arms up and the

2497
01:51:54,719 --> 01:52:00,560
dangers of LSD so yeah they've uh

2498
01:51:58,359 --> 01:52:03,799
they've used some shocking awe needless

2499
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:05,599
to SC maybe we saw the same video I just

2500
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:07,560
I just turned my head away when that

2501
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:10,279
when that it's a real bringdown when

2502
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:14,560
you're at an acid party and some woman

2503
01:52:10,279 --> 01:52:14,559
does that I mean I don't know what to

2504
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,760
say yeah start at the ground floor first

2505
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:23,719
don't don't go out at the second we were

2506
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:25,880
at a we were at a drive-in movie theater

2507
01:52:23,719 --> 01:52:27,679
at an all night showing they first

2508
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:29,440
showed the Pink Floyd movie and then at

2509
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:33,118
midnight showed the Grateful Dead movie

2510
01:52:29,439 --> 01:52:34,839
so we had two back-to-back movies at a

2511
01:52:33,118 --> 01:52:36,920
drive-in remember drive-in movie

2512
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:39,360
theaters they were so much fun you'd be

2513
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:41,560
able to bring lawn chairs and just a

2514
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:45,118
cooler full of beer and all your friends

2515
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:47,719
in the trunk and uh yeah it was just it

2516
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:50,158
was so safe and nobody could really get

2517
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:52,599
hurt we you know it was just it's like

2518
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:55,279
an environment like a Grateful Dead show

2519
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:57,840
like it was so much fun they've made a

2520
01:52:55,279 --> 01:53:00,279
comeback lately due to

2521
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:02,880
co they're kind popping up all over the

2522
01:53:00,279 --> 01:53:04,719
country where aten just to talk about

2523
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:07,719
that for a second because I'm seeing

2524
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:10,439
more and more announcements of festivals

2525
01:53:07,719 --> 01:53:13,078
happening and I guess you know maybe

2526
01:53:10,439 --> 01:53:15,839
hert immunity and the vaccination rate

2527
01:53:13,078 --> 01:53:18,679
of the general population is just

2528
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:22,679
getting to the point where I guess live

2529
01:53:18,679 --> 01:53:24,920
music is making its return which is a

2530
01:53:22,679 --> 01:53:27,520
wonderful thing because it's part of our

2531
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:30,359
culture well I said earlier there is

2532
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:33,119
going to be a emerald Cup this year Tim

2533
01:53:30,359 --> 01:53:35,078
announced it during the uh finishing of

2534
01:53:33,118 --> 01:53:38,479

2535
01:53:35,078 --> 01:53:40,719
2020 competition so we will be in person

2536
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:43,238

2537
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:45,599
others hopefully and get some hugs in

2538
01:53:43,238 --> 01:53:48,359
person because I'm vaccinated I I'll be

2539
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:51,800
there I'll go [ __ ] yeah because I'm

2540
01:53:48,359 --> 01:53:53,359
judging again so I look forward to it

2541
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:55,119
I'm just going to be wandering around in

2542
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:58,158
the

2543
01:53:55,118 --> 01:53:59,759
crowd have you guys all gotten uh uh

2544
01:53:58,158 --> 01:54:02,279
vaccinated yet has anyone gotten

2545
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:04,840
vaccinated here I got my first shot a

2546
01:54:02,279 --> 01:54:07,719
couple days ago oh congratulations fine

2547
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:10,760
so far my next one's du April

2548
01:54:07,719 --> 01:54:12,760
6th I I got my first and second shot

2549
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:16,199
because uh in California we got us

2550
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:18,719
designated as a uh emergency uh

2551
01:54:16,198 --> 01:54:21,359
Personnel so we were 1A so we were part

2552
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:23,960
of the initial push awesome I had my

2553
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:26,639
second shot three weeks ago so I'm fully

2554
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:28,920
immune and I am beyond ready and happy

2555
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:31,118
to uh see people and still wearing my

2556
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:32,599
masks being responsible I don't want to

2557
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:34,639
why don't we take a quick poll in the

2558
01:54:32,599 --> 01:54:36,440
chat just because we got what like 400

2559
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:39,719
people watching have you guys gotten

2560
01:54:36,439 --> 01:54:42,078
your shots yet I'm just curious I mean I

2561
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:43,800
can't wait to get my shot we're in line

2562
01:54:42,078 --> 01:54:46,359
I guess we'll be notified when they

2563
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:49,119
become available or so to speak or we

2564
01:54:46,359 --> 01:54:50,880
have to go somewhere to get them but um

2565
01:54:49,118 --> 01:54:54,198
yeah I think the faster we get on the

2566
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:56,520
other side of this hopefully be uh I

2567
01:54:54,198 --> 01:54:58,598
wish I wish people were willing to try

2568
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:01,280
and look at getting

2569
01:54:58,599 --> 01:55:03,119
healthier uh in the way they are looking

2570
01:55:01,279 --> 01:55:05,000
at getting shots and I'm not against

2571
01:55:03,118 --> 01:55:08,238
anyone getting a shot I personally won't

2572
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:11,118
be getting it um but I do like the idea

2573
01:55:08,238 --> 01:55:12,598
of people increasing the the caliber of

2574
01:55:11,118 --> 01:55:14,960
their immune system and getting

2575
01:55:12,599 --> 01:55:17,520
healthier and eating better foods and

2576
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:20,198
consuming better Beverages and just sort

2577
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:22,320
of uh just taking better care of

2578
01:55:20,198 --> 01:55:23,919
themselves you know like we there's

2579
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:25,439
definitely something to be said for some

2580
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:28,000
of what we've learned during this I

2581
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:30,118
think another thing is that you know we

2582
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,639
realized when Co started when they

2583
01:55:30,118 --> 01:55:34,479
started telling us we got to protect the

2584
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:36,719
the our elderly Community you know

2585
01:55:34,479 --> 01:55:38,559
because they're more at risk and I

2586
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:40,560
thought well what about when we were

2587
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:42,760
killing them with influenza for the last

2588
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:44,400
like several hundred years like a lot of

2589
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:45,920
people died from influenza and

2590
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:47,598
guaranteed they got that [ __ ] from their

2591
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:49,639
family members or the little girl at

2592
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:51,119
school who gave it to the little boy who

2593
01:55:49,639 --> 01:55:54,279
came home and gave it to his mom who

2594
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:56,158
gave it to her mom and then you know so

2595
01:55:54,279 --> 01:55:57,800
I think it's a neat idea maybe in

2596
01:55:56,158 --> 01:56:00,039
certain months that we do are a little

2597
01:55:57,800 --> 01:56:02,199
bit more protective I'm like not I can't

2598
01:56:00,039 --> 01:56:05,840
even imagine that we pick these months

2599
01:56:02,198 --> 01:56:07,839
like February and November and you know

2600
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:09,840
to go and do these huge cannabis

2601
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:12,279
Gatherings smoke a bunch of things

2602
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:14,560
together get the Cannabis Cup cough damn

2603
01:56:12,279 --> 01:56:16,800
near die I mean I called it the plague

2604
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:19,960
one year I got it in Spain and it was no

2605
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:21,800
[ __ ] joke but uh I think those things

2606
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:24,520
have been really good for me and for you

2607
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:26,679
know listen and for those who are really

2608
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:28,679
excited to get the vaccine you know I

2609
01:56:26,679 --> 01:56:30,279
would fight for your right to get it and

2610
01:56:28,679 --> 01:56:33,520
I would hope that you would fight for my

2611
01:56:30,279 --> 01:56:36,279
right to say I'll

2612
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:39,159
pass yeah don't but you know the irony

2613
01:56:36,279 --> 01:56:40,840
is of course my mom went to get hers and

2614
01:56:39,158 --> 01:56:42,879
she got the Johnson and Johnson this

2615
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:44,960
week Unfortunately they test her the

2616
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:49,159
same way same day and she is actually

2617
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:51,840
positive for covid so uh I am in the

2618
01:56:49,158 --> 01:56:54,519
midst of yeah hoping and feel positive

2619
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,719
so uh much love to my mom and I hope

2620
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:59,400
she's healing well and uh I hope she

2621
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:01,039
gets through this because she's 79 and

2622
01:56:59,399 --> 01:57:03,279
her caregiver who was watching her

2623
01:57:01,039 --> 01:57:05,719
brought it home to her unfortunately

2624
01:57:03,279 --> 01:57:07,078
there in Texas so uh I love your mom I

2625
01:57:05,719 --> 01:57:09,158
hope you're feeling better and I hope

2626
01:57:07,078 --> 01:57:11,799
you get past this and anybody else who's

2627
01:57:09,158 --> 01:57:14,198
dealing with it all the best and if you

2628
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:16,320
have the availability you know get the

2629
01:57:14,198 --> 01:57:18,879
vaccine if you don't want to that's your

2630
01:57:16,319 --> 01:57:21,238
choice but I'm one of those I'm proud to

2631
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:23,239
have gotten it I'm happy I have it and

2632
01:57:21,238 --> 01:57:26,078
um yeah it's your

2633
01:57:23,238 --> 01:57:28,759
choice but I love science and you you

2634
01:57:26,078 --> 01:57:31,679
got to remember folks that even if you

2635
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:36,199
get the vaccine you can still get

2636
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:39,239
another variant of covid again so uh

2637
01:57:36,198 --> 01:57:41,399
it's it's it's probably going to prevent

2638
01:57:39,238 --> 01:57:46,158
you from getting sick very sick and

2639
01:57:41,399 --> 01:57:47,960
dying but uh the vaccine is not the

2640
01:57:46,158 --> 01:57:49,960
Silver Bullet that's going to cure all

2641
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:54,439
the problems

2642
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:56,760
we we we as long as this so many people

2643
01:57:54,439 --> 01:57:59,000
have this it will keep mutating and

2644
01:57:56,760 --> 01:58:05,800
making different variants we got to get

2645
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:05,800
the population down to z00 Z less less

2646
01:58:08,279 --> 01:58:13,639
less well that is the that is the key I

2647
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:15,759
think the key is to also be able to have

2648
01:58:13,639 --> 01:58:18,319
like sane conversations not that I want

2649
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:19,800
to go into a big conversations but you

2650
01:58:18,319 --> 01:58:22,319
know when you ask that question it

2651
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:25,239
turned into the standard internet like

2652
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:27,118
getting a vaccine equals idiot or the

2653
01:58:25,238 --> 01:58:28,638
other version was Oh I thought there was

2654
01:58:27,118 --> 01:58:30,118
a lot of intelligent people in here

2655
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:32,760
until I saw them say they weren't going

2656
01:58:30,118 --> 01:58:35,880
to get the vaccine it's easy to have a

2657
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:38,840
conversation about vaccines without

2658
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:40,960
dropping the vibe down to name calling

2659
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:43,440
and sort of high school

2660
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:45,399
arguments we always think we're right in

2661
01:58:43,439 --> 01:58:48,158
our decisions that's the whole reason we

2662
01:58:45,399 --> 01:58:50,719
make our decisions but don't be so

2663
01:58:48,158 --> 01:58:52,598
afraid to have conversations and maybe

2664
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:55,078
discover you know someone else's

2665
01:58:52,599 --> 01:58:58,679
perspective we're not force in forcing

2666
01:58:55,078 --> 01:59:00,880
anyone to take or not take um but it is

2667
01:58:58,679 --> 01:59:03,078
interesting how hard it is for that

2668
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:06,199
concept to survive in this day and age

2669
01:59:03,078 --> 01:59:09,279
in this world the concept of allowing

2670
01:59:06,198 --> 01:59:11,399
both to uh hold space

2671
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:12,960
simultaneously oh my goodness you mean I

2672
01:59:11,399 --> 01:59:14,879
have to stand on the on the edge of the

2673
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:17,198
fence instead of choosing which side the

2674
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:19,880
grass is greener it's not greener on

2675
01:59:17,198 --> 01:59:22,879
either side it's an illusion put there

2676
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:24,760
by the fence so get on get on the fence

2677
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:27,319
and don't be so fervent in your belief

2678
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:29,039
or at least be more kind when you uh you

2679
01:59:27,319 --> 01:59:31,479
know discuss with someone on the other

2680
01:59:29,039 --> 01:59:33,679
side of that fence rather than right to

2681
01:59:31,479 --> 01:59:36,559
name calling two seconds after you asked

2682
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:39,800
that question mark it was just oh I'm

2683
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:41,480
sorry to have it's not your fault it's

2684
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:45,039
not your fault unfortunately it's the

2685
01:59:41,479 --> 01:59:47,118
fault of the reactors who immediately go

2686
01:59:45,039 --> 01:59:50,000
there and it's it is a very natural

2687
01:59:47,118 --> 01:59:52,439
human thing to go to that level but um

2688
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,319
you don't have to what happened to basic

2689
01:59:52,439 --> 01:59:56,719
human tolerance we used to tolerate each

2690
01:59:54,319 --> 01:59:58,439
other I accepted you for who you are the

2691
01:59:56,719 --> 02:00:00,679
freak that you are the freak that you're

2692
01:59:58,439 --> 02:00:03,198
not you know but for some reason

2693
02:00:00,679 --> 02:00:05,279
tolerance has been lost in accepting of

2694
02:00:03,198 --> 02:00:07,039
other people's opinions so what if

2695
02:00:05,279 --> 02:00:08,639
people disagree with you everybody has

2696
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:11,359
the right because they've had their

2697
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:13,440
experiences and it is not my right to

2698
02:00:11,359 --> 02:00:14,920
tell anybody anything except I will

2699
02:00:13,439 --> 02:00:17,879
fight for your right to say whatever the

2700
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:22,118
[ __ ] you want you know freedom of

2701
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:24,319
speech that's it in a nutshell

2702
02:00:22,118 --> 02:00:26,839
oh my goodness I was just going to say

2703
02:00:24,319 --> 02:00:30,118
scientifically I put vaccinations in one

2704
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:32,159
of the you know buckets of you know huge

2705
02:00:30,118 --> 02:00:36,078
advancements that medical science has

2706
02:00:32,158 --> 02:00:39,238
made over the years and you know I've

2707
02:00:36,078 --> 02:00:41,479
vaccinated all my kids I I've been

2708
02:00:39,238 --> 02:00:45,078
vaccinated I'd like to think that the

2709
02:00:41,479 --> 02:00:47,439
covid vaccine would be just another of

2710
02:00:45,078 --> 02:00:51,359
the regimen of vaccines that you know

2711
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:52,839
you normally get you know like against

2712
02:00:51,359 --> 02:00:56,639
polio

2713
02:00:52,840 --> 02:01:00,480
which again we've all but wiped out uh

2714
02:00:56,639 --> 02:01:03,039
smallx small pox right in fact I live

2715
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:06,638
close to Jennersville where Dr Jenner

2716
02:01:03,039 --> 02:01:10,599
actually developed the uh smallpox uh

2717
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:13,118
vaccine during a revolutionary war um

2718
02:01:10,599 --> 02:01:15,159
but I I think that another thing just

2719
02:01:13,118 --> 02:01:17,679
talking about the internet reaction is

2720
02:01:15,158 --> 02:01:19,679
like yeah it's like part of having a

2721
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:22,158
discussion is opening up your mind to

2722
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:24,679
learning and as soon as you get like

2723
02:01:22,158 --> 02:01:27,118
this partisanship that happens in either

2724
02:01:24,679 --> 02:01:29,800
a politics discussion or a vaccine

2725
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:32,319
discussion or whatever there discussion

2726
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:34,440
where there's two sides like that yeah

2727
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:36,840
it just takes things into a completely

2728
02:01:34,439 --> 02:01:39,638
unproductive area Marcus and I

2729
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:41,880
appreciate you policing the uh the chat

2730
02:01:39,639 --> 02:01:43,960
to let people know that you know we

2731
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:47,000
should try to keep these discussions

2732
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:50,118
civil like it we Clubhouse room that you

2733
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:52,039
know everybody has their own opinion and

2734
02:01:50,118 --> 02:01:54,118
I'm just sharing you know again as a

2735
02:01:52,039 --> 02:01:56,118
parent and as a person what I've done in

2736
02:01:54,118 --> 02:01:58,519
my life that doesn't mean it's the right

2737
02:01:56,118 --> 02:02:01,118
thing for everybody else to do but you

2738
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:03,360
know again scientifically I look at the

2739
02:02:01,118 --> 02:02:06,479
developing or I look at the development

2740
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:08,039
of the vaccine for the co virus as as

2741
02:02:06,479 --> 02:02:11,399
being just a

2742
02:02:08,039 --> 02:02:14,719
unbelievable technical achievement and I

2743
02:02:11,399 --> 02:02:16,319
understand how these mRNA V uh uh

2744
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:17,840
cocktails work and I just think it's

2745
02:02:16,319 --> 02:02:20,158
just beautiful there's great science

2746
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:23,400
that underpins it I think it's totally

2747
02:02:20,158 --> 02:02:25,679
safe it's safer than most of the things

2748
02:02:23,399 --> 02:02:29,039
that we normally do on a regular basis

2749
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:33,158
so uh and remember that vaccines don't

2750
02:02:29,039 --> 02:02:35,319
save lives vaccinations do and it's all

2751
02:02:33,158 --> 02:02:37,479
about just getting that you know level

2752
02:02:35,319 --> 02:02:40,639
of the virus completely suppressed and

2753
02:02:37,479 --> 02:02:44,238
if you need help with a vaccine so so be

2754
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:48,000
it so there I said my thing sorry about

2755
02:02:44,238 --> 02:02:50,319
that I'm gonna leave and thank Sam for

2756
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:53,118
uh having the Cat in the Hat wearing a

2757
02:02:50,319 --> 02:02:56,279
mask in our meeting

2758
02:02:53,118 --> 02:02:59,439
uh for a while because I every time I go

2759
02:02:56,279 --> 02:03:02,559
out so thank you Sam it's only because I

2760
02:02:59,439 --> 02:03:07,638
don't want to get a computer virus there

2761
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:07,639
you go exactly practice good safe

2762
02:03:08,238 --> 02:03:13,638
practices well it's time for a bong rip

2763
02:03:10,679 --> 02:03:15,920
I think it's uh a little after 11: I was

2764
02:03:13,639 --> 02:03:18,880
actually only going to go till 11: today

2765
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:21,239
because I'm uh watching my son today and

2766
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:22,960
my wife is away he's been very patient

2767
02:03:21,238 --> 02:03:24,919
on the other side of the door but maybe

2768
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:26,599
we can chat a little bit more maybe for

2769
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:28,719
another 25 minutes well the other thing

2770
02:03:26,599 --> 02:03:31,000
I wanted to bring up Marcus not to keep

2771
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:33,480
on commanding conversation here but I

2772
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:37,800
thought it was really interesting that

2773
02:03:33,479 --> 02:03:39,718
Biden let a few people go who had uh who

2774
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:41,960
were using I guess they had pass

2775
02:03:39,719 --> 02:03:44,920
marijuana use or whatever cannabis use I

2776
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:48,679
saw that yeah and that's just so weird

2777
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:51,840
because you know his vice president had

2778
02:03:48,679 --> 02:03:53,920
admitted to smoking weed so it's like

2779
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:56,639
where do you draw the line right so I

2780
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:59,480
mean it's just Again part of this

2781
02:03:56,639 --> 02:04:02,520
hypocrisy that still exists car in our

2782
02:03:59,479 --> 02:04:06,039
country is that association with this

2783
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:08,199
plant means something to some people but

2784
02:04:06,039 --> 02:04:10,559
something completely different to a

2785
02:04:08,198 --> 02:04:12,879
different segment of the population and

2786
02:04:10,559 --> 02:04:16,119
these politicians who try to play both

2787
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:18,199
sides of the fence try to plate and try

2788
02:04:16,118 --> 02:04:20,279
to do what they can to S to stay in the

2789
02:04:18,198 --> 02:04:23,078
middle of these issues so they could

2790
02:04:20,279 --> 02:04:24,639
maximize their political support and I

2791
02:04:23,078 --> 02:04:28,479
just thought that that was just a

2792
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:30,960
completely you know bad move Joe don't

2793
02:04:28,479 --> 02:04:33,759
dismiss people for weed smoking holy

2794
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:37,359
[ __ ] didn't they I thought they recently

2795
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:38,880
had a shortage of computer coders for

2796
02:04:37,359 --> 02:04:42,279
the government because they couldn't

2797
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:44,679
find people that didn't smoke weed right

2798
02:04:42,279 --> 02:04:46,439
yeah the the FBI yeah the FBI having

2799
02:04:44,679 --> 02:04:48,399
problems finding people all the good

2800
02:04:46,439 --> 02:04:50,198
ones anyway this is just wrong this is

2801
02:04:48,399 --> 02:04:52,198
like you know they're talking about

2802
02:04:50,198 --> 02:04:54,839
pushing this thing through Congress and

2803
02:04:52,198 --> 02:04:56,919
they got a democratic Congress yet this

2804
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:59,119
is what you know the guy doing over at

2805
02:04:56,920 --> 02:05:01,960
the White House this is a total move

2806
02:04:59,118 --> 02:05:04,799
that totally backfired I know Jen saki's

2807
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:07,399
on video talking about it trying to back

2808
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:11,239
step on it but you know what bad move

2809
02:05:07,399 --> 02:05:13,399
Joe wrong I like it is is a lot of

2810
02:05:11,238 --> 02:05:16,598
people I know wouldn't have voted for

2811
02:05:13,399 --> 02:05:21,238
Biden except if the choice was Biden or

2812
02:05:16,599 --> 02:05:23,159
Trump so they had to support Biden same

2813
02:05:21,238 --> 02:05:26,319
on top of that you can't forget that

2814
02:05:23,158 --> 02:05:28,759
when uh the the Obama Administration

2815
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:31,359
came after my dispensary it came out of

2816
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:33,800
the vice president's office which was of

2817
02:05:31,359 --> 02:05:35,639
course Joe Biden so I understand the

2818
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:37,920
choice that we had he was a guy who

2819
02:05:35,639 --> 02:05:39,880
tried to forcefully evict me and

2820
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:42,679
successfully did but then I sued him and

2821
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:45,840
won and beat him in federal court so you

2822
02:05:42,679 --> 02:05:47,719
know uh I understand the fight and it's

2823
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:50,039
more of to make you aware people that

2824
02:05:47,719 --> 02:05:52,880
the fight is still ongoing and yes he is

2825
02:05:50,039 --> 02:05:54,399
a staunch prohibitionist and it's really

2826
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:58,078
I I agree with you it it's rather

2827
02:05:54,399 --> 02:06:00,000
surprising Mark Dr Mark that um you know

2828
02:05:58,078 --> 02:06:01,759
Kamala gets the pass as his vice

2829
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,800
president you know because well and

2830
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:06,239
there's probably dozens of other people

2831
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:08,079
ATN right there's got to be dozens of

2832
02:06:06,238 --> 02:06:10,319
other people who are either in the

2833
02:06:08,078 --> 02:06:12,880
administration or in the support organiz

2834
02:06:10,319 --> 02:06:15,000
it's like okay pass all those people

2835
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:20,118
right and they live in a city where it's

2836
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:21,800
legal it's [ __ ] legal in DC so

2837
02:06:20,118 --> 02:06:23,719
prohibit people from using something

2838
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:26,320
that's legal in their own City it's just

2839
02:06:23,719 --> 02:06:30,078
and you got to you got to remember that

2840
02:06:26,319 --> 02:06:32,639
Biden truly in his heart still believes

2841
02:06:30,078 --> 02:06:35,279
marijuana is a gateway drug it's really

2842
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:38,199
that simple that's part of the core of

2843
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:40,479
his belief and why we have to be

2844
02:06:38,198 --> 02:06:43,319
especially Vigilant now people and why

2845
02:06:40,479 --> 02:06:46,279
you have to plug in and be active is we

2846
02:06:43,319 --> 02:06:49,359
have uh we have access via Cala but

2847
02:06:46,279 --> 02:06:51,639
we've got a block by the president so uh

2848
02:06:49,359 --> 02:06:54,479
you know already Camala is already

2849
02:06:51,639 --> 02:06:56,520
started to backtrack so we we looked at

2850
02:06:54,479 --> 02:06:58,638
some uh political bait and switch

2851
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:00,559
already happening but this is the reason

2852
02:06:58,639 --> 02:07:03,000
why you have to stay plugged in locally

2853
02:07:00,559 --> 02:07:04,920
like in Florida and Colorado where you

2854
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,399
know you got to change these laws before

2855
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:09,078
they start spreading other states

2856
02:07:06,399 --> 02:07:10,399
because Kevin SED is isn't stopping to

2857
02:07:09,078 --> 02:07:12,399
sleep at night he's going to sleep

2858
02:07:10,399 --> 02:07:15,679
tomorrow and wake up and go to your next

2859
02:07:12,399 --> 02:07:19,359
state and start passing these laws until

2860
02:07:15,679 --> 02:07:20,840
you change his mind and make him stop

2861
02:07:19,359 --> 02:07:23,158
which means we've got to go into all

2862
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:25,679
these states where he's going and stop

2863
02:07:23,158 --> 02:07:28,000
him otherwise he's going to push and and

2864
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:30,000
then go around and tout with his Flags

2865
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,760
oh look we just changed Colorado and

2866
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:35,880
Florida into 15% THC you need to do the

2867
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:38,239
same thing otherwise you're a bad State

2868
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:39,960
and uh we need to start naming and

2869
02:07:38,238 --> 02:07:42,319
shaming these people and calling them

2870
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:44,679
out for this [ __ ] prohibition for

2871
02:07:42,319 --> 02:07:46,279
what it is but it's you who are watching

2872
02:07:44,679 --> 02:07:49,239
that have to do this there's only a few

2873
02:07:46,279 --> 02:07:50,880
of us here but it's your voice it's it's

2874
02:07:49,238 --> 02:07:52,839
whether you're going to tolerate this or

2875
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:54,400
not which hopefully you're not and

2876
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:56,199
hopefully you're activating your friends

2877
02:07:54,399 --> 02:07:58,638
and make them aware of all this and

2878
02:07:56,198 --> 02:08:01,000
plugging into local Regional or state

2879
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:03,279
chapters and affecting this change and

2880
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:05,679
using your voice and sending emails to

2881
02:08:03,279 --> 02:08:07,960
your constituency and writing letters on

2882
02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:09,599
their behalf or making phone calls

2883
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:11,399
because for every person who calls

2884
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:13,159
represents from anywhere from a 100 to a

2885
02:08:11,399 --> 02:08:16,598
thousand people here in the United

2886
02:08:13,158 --> 02:08:19,558
States Koo so it's very important for

2887
02:08:16,599 --> 02:08:21,800
their constituency here to call and make

2888
02:08:19,559 --> 02:08:23,520
people aware because Joe Biden is not

2889
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:25,360
going to stop if he's kicking people out

2890
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:27,599
of his office just imagine what he's

2891
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:28,960
going to do to the rest of us so you

2892
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:32,078
know

2893
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:34,520
um work get to work people nothing's

2894
02:08:32,078 --> 02:08:36,799
changed just the person in charge but

2895
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:40,000
the prohibition is still the same so

2896
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:42,960
yeah Kevin sabot Kevin sabot had a had a

2897
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:45,840
clubhouse room and in order to get into

2898
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:48,319
the room you had to check that you

2899
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:50,639
weren't going to ask any ridiculous

2900
02:08:48,319 --> 02:08:52,799
questions and I guess somebody who came

2901
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:55,599
into our room later on right you

2902
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:58,000
remember this Colin um was saying that

2903
02:08:55,599 --> 02:09:00,119
he got up on the stage and started

2904
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:02,359
challenging Sabbat and was immediately

2905
02:09:00,118 --> 02:09:05,719
thrown out of the room but yeah there

2906
02:09:02,359 --> 02:09:10,000
was a room full of like three 400 people

2907
02:09:05,719 --> 02:09:13,840
listening to his unoriginal Reefer

2908
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:16,920
Madness you know campaign and it's just

2909
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:20,360
amazing that he still has a [ __ ]

2910
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:22,920
audience you know 3 400 people in his

2911
02:09:20,359 --> 02:09:24,639
Clubhouse listen this [ __ ] unbelievable

2912
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:26,199
and why does he have a voice is because

2913
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:28,719
not enough you who are watching are

2914
02:09:26,198 --> 02:09:32,519
speaking up and shutting down his voice

2915
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:35,359
he is being allowed to act out openly in

2916
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:36,960
this vacuum because none of you you lazy

2917
02:09:35,359 --> 02:09:38,839
people are sitting back and letting him

2918
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:41,239
get away with this are you well if you

2919
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:43,400
did you got thrown out of the room no no

2920
02:09:41,238 --> 02:09:44,759
no in the clubhouse but you can go to

2921
02:09:43,399 --> 02:09:46,479
these states where they're actually

2922
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:48,920
challenging and he's actually going into

2923
02:09:46,479 --> 02:09:51,879
these State houses he's been in the UN

2924
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:54,480
my friends Michael prow and Amy K and

2925
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:57,279
Robert Kowalski are all in the UN and he

2926
02:09:54,479 --> 02:10:00,000
was there actually pushing those lies

2927
02:09:57,279 --> 02:10:01,599
and misinformation whereas this handful

2928
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,238
of activists here in the United States

2929
02:10:01,599 --> 02:10:05,800
were actually representing the United

2930
02:10:03,238 --> 02:10:07,479
States that's how few of you care that's

2931
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:08,760
how few of you are paying attention

2932
02:10:07,479 --> 02:10:10,678
that's how a few of you are actually

2933
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:12,000
getting involved there's a handful of

2934
02:10:10,679 --> 02:10:14,158
people and I know them personally who

2935
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,158
are changing things at the UN you could

2936
02:10:14,158 --> 02:10:17,839
be doing that too but you don't care

2937
02:10:16,158 --> 02:10:20,558
enough to do anything you rather sit

2938
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:24,360
backy Chen it's not that simple Kevin

2939
02:10:20,559 --> 02:10:27,800
sabot makes a business out of it it's a

2940
02:10:24,359 --> 02:10:30,598
business of for-profit that he does this

2941
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:33,480
for so of course he's motivated because

2942
02:10:30,599 --> 02:10:37,119
he's got the mindset and he wants to

2943
02:10:33,479 --> 02:10:40,759
make the money so uh you know we would

2944
02:10:37,118 --> 02:10:43,759
kind of look down at cannabis people who

2945
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:48,880
were doing it for the money but I say go

2946
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:52,599
for it if if we've got you know can C

2947
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:55,480
smother him with truth you you know then

2948
02:10:52,599 --> 02:10:57,679
less people will believe his lies we can

2949
02:10:55,479 --> 02:10:59,919
never stop it completely because there

2950
02:10:57,679 --> 02:11:02,960
always is people like

2951
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:04,880
this very good point absolutely you're

2952
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:06,920
right he is making money off of it so

2953
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:09,118
let's go hit him where it hurts where

2954
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:11,279
he's trying to change it yeah well isn't

2955
02:11:09,118 --> 02:11:13,198
it funny the argument that he always

2956
02:11:11,279 --> 02:11:16,439
makes which where he

2957
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:17,839
parallels big tobacco big tobacco is

2958
02:11:16,439 --> 02:11:21,399
going to come in and

2959
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:23,920
doah right well what's big tobacco

2960
02:11:21,399 --> 02:11:26,558
already done you know bit of plague on

2961
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:30,000
society with this thing called you know

2962
02:11:26,559 --> 02:11:34,039
nicotine and and tar that's cancer

2963
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:37,238
causing come on now it's it's

2964
02:11:34,039 --> 02:11:42,519
like it's pot calling the kettle

2965
02:11:37,238 --> 02:11:45,039
black it's really a nicotine delivery

2966
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:48,400
system I just wonder how much he's

2967
02:11:45,039 --> 02:11:51,960
funded by the tobacco companies I know

2968
02:11:48,399 --> 02:11:54,719
he's funed I know he F really a lot

2969
02:11:51,960 --> 02:11:57,239
by the alcohol companies right yes but

2970
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:59,319
I'm not sure who funds him anymore

2971
02:11:57,238 --> 02:12:02,678
because the tobacco companies are

2972
02:11:59,319 --> 02:12:06,679
starting to buy into Canabis companies

2973
02:12:02,679 --> 02:12:09,359
so they don't want to call their kettle

2974
02:12:06,679 --> 02:12:12,440
black no actually they just showed up

2975
02:12:09,359 --> 02:12:15,799
bigly actually a couple of weeks ago uh

2976
02:12:12,439 --> 02:12:18,719
the Alcohol Tobacco uh Lobby has already

2977
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:20,840
put together their own group and are

2978
02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:23,480
already lobbying for change here in the

2979
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:25,679
United States and Brinks uh the big

2980
02:12:23,479 --> 02:12:27,919
truck uh Bank people are are part of

2981
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:30,960
that group so uh there's already been

2982
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:33,078
reintroduction of the safe Banking Act

2983
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:34,880
here in the United States so that you

2984
02:12:33,078 --> 02:12:36,719
know maybe someday I'll actually have

2985
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:39,319
access to a bank as opposed to being

2986
02:12:36,719 --> 02:12:41,760
kicked out of the 38 that I've been

2987
02:12:39,319 --> 02:12:43,639
kicked out of up to this point so you

2988
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:46,320
know these are those are the realities

2989
02:12:43,639 --> 02:12:48,760
we deal with currently K here in the

2990
02:12:46,319 --> 02:12:51,719
United States is uh financial

2991
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:54,360
institutions will still work for for

2992
02:12:51,719 --> 02:12:58,719
prohibition and those like me have also

2993
02:12:54,359 --> 02:13:02,118
been caught by the IRS through the um

2994
02:12:58,719 --> 02:13:05,118
the tax code 280e a year after of course

2995
02:13:02,118 --> 02:13:06,679
I beat my case uh won my case against

2996
02:13:05,118 --> 02:13:09,679
the federal government then of course

2997
02:13:06,679 --> 02:13:11,760
they hit me with this tax code 280e

2998
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:14,599
which basically makes it impossible for

2999
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:17,119
you to write off any of your expenses so

3000
02:13:14,599 --> 02:13:19,039
there is still uh ways that people can

3001
02:13:17,118 --> 02:13:21,920
make your life very uncomfortable even

3002
02:13:19,039 --> 02:13:26,118
though we have laws in state that allow

3003
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:27,920
for it but uh yeah we have to uh stop uh

3004
02:13:26,118 --> 02:13:30,238
these anti- prohibitionists because

3005
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:32,639
they're not going to stop and that's why

3006
02:13:30,238 --> 02:13:35,558
we have to be eternally Vigilant with

3007
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:39,000
our Crusade because uh they are as well

3008
02:13:35,559 --> 02:13:41,159
because as as Sam said they are

3009
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:43,840
financially tied to that reality and

3010
02:13:41,158 --> 02:13:46,039
funded by others in realities that don't

3011
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:49,480
like the reality we're trying to

3012
02:13:46,039 --> 02:13:51,880
supplant with the one that we see and

3013
02:13:49,479 --> 02:13:55,078
Biden is not going to change his mind

3014
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:57,880
I'm telling you the guy is a dinosaur we

3015
02:13:55,078 --> 02:14:01,840
we need to get somebody who more

3016
02:13:57,880 --> 02:14:06,279
cannabis friendly and uh a Democrat uh

3017
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:09,440
maybe a liberal whatever I I I I I just

3018
02:14:06,279 --> 02:14:12,679
know that Biden is not our guy he never

3019
02:14:09,439 --> 02:14:14,719
was I got a good idea Biden is also not

3020
02:14:12,679 --> 02:14:16,599
hash Church material we need to be

3021
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:19,039
talking about something much more

3022
02:14:16,599 --> 02:14:21,480
elevating than Jo if Biden wanted to

3023
02:14:19,039 --> 02:14:24,319
come on has church I would beg you to

3024
02:14:21,479 --> 02:14:27,319
let him on but he it's never going to

3025
02:14:24,319 --> 02:14:29,158
ask so don't worry I just don't even

3026
02:14:27,319 --> 02:14:31,679
really feel the conversation is worth

3027
02:14:29,158 --> 02:14:33,598
going much deeper into personally I feel

3028
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:35,559
that uh you know the people that are

3029
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:38,679
listening would much rather hear us talk

3030
02:14:35,559 --> 02:14:41,119
about you know processing hash or

3031
02:14:38,679 --> 02:14:43,199
growing cannabis or getting it to

3032
02:14:41,118 --> 02:14:45,439
express itself or explaining chemistry

3033
02:14:43,198 --> 02:14:49,118
about it or hearing more from cyu about

3034
02:14:45,439 --> 02:14:52,078
the activism aspect of it anything but

3035
02:14:49,118 --> 02:14:55,279
um but but American

3036
02:14:52,078 --> 02:14:58,319
politics that's just uh me you're

3037
02:14:55,279 --> 02:15:00,359
probably right Marcus damn it sorry I

3038
02:14:58,319 --> 02:15:02,399
brought that up again that's that's two

3039
02:15:00,359 --> 02:15:05,639
strikes against

3040
02:15:02,399 --> 02:15:07,359
me damn it well we could talk about

3041
02:15:05,639 --> 02:15:09,800
something that we do have a deep

3042
02:15:07,359 --> 02:15:12,078
appreciation for uh different from Joe

3043
02:15:09,800 --> 02:15:14,599
Biden anyway we could talk about the

3044
02:15:12,078 --> 02:15:16,719
Cannabis and the hash well actually both

3045
02:15:14,599 --> 02:15:18,440
of those things are the reason why I

3046
02:15:16,719 --> 02:15:21,078
can't come and hang out with you right

3047
02:15:18,439 --> 02:15:23,919
now Marcus and I would love nothing more

3048
02:15:21,078 --> 02:15:26,679
than get on a plane tomorrow and hang

3049
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:28,800
out with you for like a week and and the

3050
02:15:26,679 --> 02:15:31,559
reason why I can't do that is because a

3051
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:34,480
there's this stupid [ __ ] pandemic and

3052
02:15:31,559 --> 02:15:36,480
B our [ __ ] government's [ __ ] up so

3053
02:15:34,479 --> 02:15:38,959
you know yeah you'd be would you have to

3054
02:15:36,479 --> 02:15:41,158
do uh quarantine if you came back from

3055
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:43,039
Canada I don't think I yeah I think I

3056
02:15:41,158 --> 02:15:45,238
have to pay some kind of fine or some

3057
02:15:43,039 --> 02:15:48,158
[ __ ] like that it's like it's all [ __ ]

3058
02:15:45,238 --> 02:15:49,479
up dude like I can't come yeah it sus

3059
02:15:48,158 --> 02:15:51,519
you have to get I think there's

3060
02:15:49,479 --> 02:15:53,879
permission that you can get but if you

3061
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:56,159
came here you'd have to be on in

3062
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:59,159

3073
02:16:18,439 --> 02:16:23,479
long time actually it's kind of crazy

3074

02:16:28,559 --> 02:16:32,719
what's up yeah it's it's too bad we're

3078
02:16:30,559 --> 02:16:35,398
not able to do stuff like that because

3079
02:16:32,718 --> 02:16:38,079
uh I have done more than I've almost

3080
02:16:35,398 --> 02:16:40,558
ever done like even in the last 20 years

3081
02:16:38,079 --> 02:16:45,079
I feel like I've done more in the last

3082
02:16:40,558 --> 02:16:47,039
two here at with Embark and Whistler

3083
02:16:45,079 --> 02:16:49,679
Technologies and no one's really been

3084
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:51,559
able to kind of see it it's just been

3085
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:52,599
you know and i' we have't really been

3086
02:16:51,558 --> 02:16:56,000
like

3087
02:16:52,599 --> 02:16:57,960
um flexing on Instagram and stuff you

3088
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:00,120
know just little bits here and there but

3089
02:16:57,959 --> 02:17:01,959
we're not like operating like a post

3090
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:04,319
every single day it's like more like

3091
02:17:01,959 --> 02:17:06,558
once every three weeks or something

3092
02:17:04,318 --> 02:17:10,398
really slow not not gaining a lot of

3093
02:17:06,558 --> 02:17:12,398
traction on that but um but doing doing

3094
02:17:10,398 --> 02:17:14,679
things that would be would be fun to be

3095
02:17:12,398 --> 02:17:16,799
able to share and hopefully once all of

3096
02:17:14,679 --> 02:17:18,159
this is over we'll uh we'll be able to

3097
02:17:16,799 --> 02:17:21,599

3098
02:17:18,159 --> 02:17:24,478

3107

playing with like Lego Darth Vaders and

3108
02:17:44,239 --> 02:17:48,239
stuff and he's like kind of knows the

3109
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:50,359
story and we were talking about it

3110

uh

3112
02:17:51,558 --> 02:17:57,638

did it with my first two kids and it was

3119
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:12,920
amazing and now I have this other

3120
02:18:10,879 --> 02:18:15,039
opportunity that almost feels like he

3121
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:17,799
should be my grandchild that this you

3122
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:20,160
know like 12 years later but indeed he's

3123
02:18:17,799 --> 02:18:22,000
my child and uh we're going to we're

3124
02:18:20,159 --> 02:18:23,879
going to do it again again probably the

3125
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:27,398
last time I'll do it with my own child

3126
02:18:23,879 --> 02:18:29,839
and the next time it'll be a grandchild

3127

exactly what was going on as it was

3134
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:49,880
going on was mindboggling numbing in the

3135
02:18:48,239 --> 02:18:53,638
sense of trying to explain there's this

3136

of knowledge is and what they're doing

3184
02:21:02,079 --> 02:21:07,600
uh is exponential and of course they've

3185
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:10,240
been so in the underground uh world

3186

doing it for so many decades their

3187
02:21:10,239 --> 02:21:15,079
breadth of knowledge is exponential so

3188
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:17,680
we need more Dr marks we need more

3189

part of like what we're what the rest of

3231
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:12,319
my family does so um I'm sure that every

3232
02:23:09,318 --> 02:23:14,278
uh panelist gets that from their spouse

3233
02:23:12,318 --> 02:23:16,719
but uh yeah this Clubhouse thing is

3234
02:23:14,279 --> 02:23:19,079
really it's been a lot of fun those

3235
02:23:16,719 --> 02:23:21,000
rooms take on a life of their own uh

3236
02:23:19,079 --> 02:23:23,760
there's a lot of animated performers in

3237
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:26,159
there and for a while that room only got

3238
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:27,920
down to like about six people seven

3239
02:23:26,159 --> 02:23:30,680
people I'm like hey maybe we should let

3240
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:34,120
this thing go and in like an hour later

3241
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:36,479
it blew up to like about 40 people again

3242
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:38,640
so yeah there's a lot of people hungry

3243
02:23:36,478 --> 02:23:40,239
for the knowledge that we got and it's

3244
02:23:38,639 --> 02:23:43,398
so interesting to hear Michael and

3245
02:23:40,239 --> 02:23:45,840
Mojave and um everyone else this fell

3246

3249
02:23:50,920 --> 02:23:55,520
killer to hear you know their knowledge

3250
02:23:53,159 --> 02:23:55,520

3251
02:23:57,318 --> 02:24:03,879

3252
02:24:01,159 --> 02:24:07,359
uh cannabis Pharmacy the Practical guide

3253
02:24:03,879 --> 02:24:10,519
to medical marijuana is a key book of

3254
02:24:07,359 --> 02:24:13,439
information and uh yeah I ran into him

3255
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:15,920
oddly enough Dr Mark in Maui I was just

3256
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:19,479
at Maui one time and then I

3257
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:21,359
like bakas he's like etn yeah so you

3258
02:24:19,478 --> 02:24:22,719
know he's just amazing he was actually

3259
02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:24,960
in there for well you guys have the same

3260
02:24:22,719 --> 02:24:27,358
hair do don't you oh yeah yeah yeah we

3261
02:24:24,959 --> 02:24:29,519
had to step into the shade for sure

3262
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:32,200
absolutely way too much Sunshine he was

3263
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:34,079
there for a medical marijuana convention

3264
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:36,560
on the island that I was unaware of so

3265
02:24:34,079 --> 02:24:38,600
then I went and popped over and chucked

3266
02:24:36,559 --> 02:24:41,039
out you know what was going on there and

3267
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:43,079
talked to the yeah Marcus he would be a

3268
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:45,920
great guy to get on you know he can

3269
02:24:43,079 --> 02:24:48,559
break down and and he he gets really if

3270
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:51,398
you follow him on Instagram he's been

3271
02:24:48,559 --> 02:24:57,239
posting these um

3272
02:24:51,398 --> 02:25:00,599
these groups of strains based on uh

3273
02:24:57,239 --> 02:25:02,639
tpine uh uh prevalence I I don't want to

3274
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:04,720
butcher it but I've only looked at them

3275
02:25:02,639 --> 02:25:08,398
like really quickly but if you look at

3276
02:25:04,719 --> 02:25:10,398
it it'll have like a list of the tpin

3277
02:25:08,398 --> 02:25:13,799
and then like groups of different

3278
02:25:10,398 --> 02:25:16,239
strains that we all know um and and how

3279
02:25:13,799 --> 02:25:19,000
they're grouped based on the tpine

3280
02:25:16,239 --> 02:25:20,680
prevalence and the tpine profiles of

3281
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:23,398
those he's really just done some

3282
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:26,279
fantastic work and he's a creative guy

3283
02:25:23,398 --> 02:25:27,840
and he's really bubbly and fents he he

3284
02:25:26,279 --> 02:25:29,840
would be great to get on hash Church

3285
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:32,600
Mark we can get

3286
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:34,719
him yeah on top of that yeah he has his

3287
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:37,318
own company I think it's called perfect

3288
02:25:34,719 --> 02:25:40,478
but he was also the consultants for Maui

3289
02:25:37,318 --> 02:25:43,680
grown which are uh basically seed to

3290
02:25:40,478 --> 02:25:46,478
sale and has done amazing things with

3291
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:48,359
that dispensary there so yeah I I would

3292
02:25:46,478 --> 02:25:50,519
second bringing him yeah I don't have a

3293
02:25:48,359 --> 02:25:52,279
copy of his book I'm going to get a copy

3294
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:54,880
I heard his book is really good and he

3295
02:25:52,279 --> 02:25:56,960
said he's writing a new edition but

3296
02:25:54,879 --> 02:25:59,239
again with this thing it just keeps on

3297
02:25:56,959 --> 02:26:02,358
getting there's so much information I

3298
02:25:59,239 --> 02:26:06,600
mean I'm sure it beomes extremely

3299
02:26:02,359 --> 02:26:09,120
volumous to reduce it down to just a a a

3300
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:11,760
book right I mean it becomes difficult

3301
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:13,560
heed and updated it a few times already

3302
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:16,398
so yeah he's doing it even more so

3303
02:26:13,559 --> 02:26:17,559
because he is one last time I saw him

3304
02:26:16,398 --> 02:26:21,000
he's like yeah I'm going through about

halfway through so he is a researchers

3307
02:26:24,639 --> 02:26:30,719

3308
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:33,520
and bring it back to you I mean you have

3309
02:26:30,719 --> 02:26:35,438
