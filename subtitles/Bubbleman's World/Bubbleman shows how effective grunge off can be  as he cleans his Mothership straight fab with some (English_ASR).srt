1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:05,359
hey guys bubble man here I'm just

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,679
gearing up for my trip to the cin

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,879
tomorrow and I have decided to clean out

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,879
my mother ship so one of the ways I

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,118
clean the mother ship is with a product

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,920
called grunge off um I don't always use

7
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:18,359
isoprenol sometimes when I'm in a rush

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,439
I'll throw the isopropanol in and give

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,279
it a shake I used to use rock salt but I

10
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,920
don't really find it necessary as much

11
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:26,839
anymore but uh yeah I use uh I use this

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,160
little product here called grung it's

13
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:30,678
great little product um I know there's a

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,520
product similar to to it that's

15
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:34,679
available um it's an oil that you can

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,320
buy at Home Depot this is a you know a

17
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,840
smaller more expensive version that's

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,159
sold to the Cannabis Community but it's

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,280
a friend of mine that owns a company and

20
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,319
I like to get support so uh we check our

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,719
friend off if you get a chance um it's

22
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,399
reusable so you know right off the bat

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,840
um I'm going to take this this little

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,799
bit that we've got in the B I'm going to

25
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,879
pour it I'm going to pour it right back

26
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:02,078
into the

27
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:05,079
bottle this stuff is um very very um

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,439
soapy even when it's dirty um it's still

29
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:09,239
very soapy and that sort of keeps it uh

30
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,959
even if I have like a little spill just

31
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,798
there it really keeps it

32
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:15,599
from um like when ISO spills it becomes

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,400
very

34
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,478
sticky so there's step one empty the

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,280
grunge off now this this bong was quite

36
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,879
dirty you can still see some of the

37
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,079
resin that's left over but it has

38
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,118
stripped the majority of the of the

39
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:31,158
resin out of it I'll turn my hot water

40
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:33,959
tap on and then we're merely just going

41
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,520
to run the hot water through the bong

42
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,189
clean out the grunge off and the bong

43
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:57,748
should be about 99% clean

44
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:57,748

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,549
so

46
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,549
[Music]

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,169
all right a couple of quick

48
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,169
[Music]

49
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:19,680
rinses okay so usually give the outside

50
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,959
of the bong a bit of a wipe down with a

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,840
cloth after I've grunged it off I find

52
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,159
that the grunge off going to be very

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,250
slippery stuff don't really want to

54
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,400
leave it on

55
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,039
[Music]

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,480
there there's a few little marks on the

57
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,079
inside of the down stem which I'll be

58
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:37,199
able to clean out nicely but you can see

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,959
the grunge off a pretty darn nice job

60
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,959
didn't it so there's a little shout out

61
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,680
to the grung off people that's a great

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,439
product that works I've reuse this

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,360
personal bottle of grung off 100 plus

64
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,189
times and it just keeps working so great

65
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,370
product Richard keep up the good

66
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:55,370
