00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,199
hey everyone welcome to Bubble man's

3
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,320
world uh just a quick little shot today

4
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:31,320
a shout out actually that I wanted to

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:34,039
give to uh TGA genetics subcool and Jill

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,280
um I've known subcool and Jill for 10

7
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:39,399
plus years Jill even probably closer to

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,679
the 15 year mark where I used to speak

9
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:46,198
with her on true Stoners back in the day

10
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:48,159
when toxic and was toy and stepp and

11
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:49,558
wolf that whole crew we used to chat it

12
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,558
was one of the first can of chats that

13
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,640
I'd ever been on and we made friends and

14
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,119
I stayed friends with Jill uh throughout

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,439
her breakup with Jack and through her

16
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,839
getting together with sub and I just

17
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,518
thought it is one of the best things

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,640
that ever happened to her was getting

19
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:08,798
together with Sub sub and her have done

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,840
great things in the community if you

21
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,400
watch their their Twitter feeds or their

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,960
Instagram or Facebook feeds they're

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,920
constantly feeding the poor and giving

24
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:21,438
away toys and things to kids with a uh

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,040
you know lack of opportunity or disease

26
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,359
um they're really just generally really

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,118
good people and basically recently they

28
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,799
sent me a gift they sent me this t-shirt

29
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:32,078
which I was very happy to uh see that it

30
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:35,280
was was at least 50% hemp as well as

31
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:37,279
organic cotton and then they sent me um

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,439
three sets of seeds which I'm actually

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,399
quite excited about here um here's a

34
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:45,319
10pack uh subcool seeds the

35
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,599
science of dank and this particular

36
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,879
strain is the space bomb so yeah pretty

37
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,519
excited to uh try out the space bomb and

38
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,399
read a little bit about it I'm not

39
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,640
really too sure on the background of a

40
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,399
lot of these particular newer genetics

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,399
but he sent me the space bomb he spent

42
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,718
sent me the the time rack which I'm

43
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:09,520
actually really uh uh excited to try as

44
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:11,878
well and he sent me the Jack Skellington

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,360
which is a killer queen cross with a jtr

46
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,399
Jack the Ripper I'm going to go out on a

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,440
Lim and say super excited about trying

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,879
all three of these I'm going to be

49
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,840
cracking these in the next couple of

50
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,159
days sub I know you sent them out quite

51
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,759
some time ago but I only just released

52
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,799
uh received them today so I wanted to

53
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,000
say thank you both to you and Jill thank

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,959
you to TGA genetics I've got an astro

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,560
boy sitting right here for the uh just

56
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,878
for the smell I thought when I do a

57
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,080
video for sub and Jill I really want to

58
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:42,239
have that that Astro Boy uh sitting in

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,400
the background there so I was also going

60
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,759
to do a nice

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,840
rip because well that's what we do in

62
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:54,079
this community here we have a 120 Micron

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,239
uh F melt watermelon as I bang the plant

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,200
and uh going into the denail hitting at

65
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,480
about

66
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,479
750° into quartz

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,519
all right well I for one am very excited

68
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,519
to get these seeds going I will keep you

69
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,000
all posted with macro photographs and

70
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,680
video updates I'm going to be collecting

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,519
uh specific fenos in the female range

72
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,239
but I'm also going to collect the males

73
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,480
and save that pollen and who knows what

74
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,719
we will uh will see one day it's just

75
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,479
it's fun to do all this stuff it's fun

76
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,199
to grow cannabis it's fun to play with

77
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:44,959
the Cannabis breed a little bit cross

78
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,479
some

79
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,080
strains extract those resin glands

80
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:51,679
separate them into

81
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,640
microns experiment with how you use them

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,360
whether you're using them internally or

83
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,798
inhaling through smoke or vaporization

84
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,959
it's all just such a great wonderful

85
