the next tragedy may be that of your

170
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:31,589
daughter two generations later

171
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:35,250
Valerie Carell runs the women's alliance

172
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:37,950
for medical marijuana or when to supply

173
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:43,429
medicine to the sick she wanted others

174
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:46,430
to benefit as she had done well there's

175
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:46,429
Kathy

176
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:54,049
on the coast of California she lives in

177
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:56,748
Santa Cruz Hillary black who runs the

178
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:59,838
compassionate Club in Vancouver has come

179
00:10:56,749 --> 00:11:01,790
south to hear her story as we were

180
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:07,100
driving back after a long afternoon and

181
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:09,048
the hot springs a plane began to fly

182
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,939
toward us we thought we might need to

183
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:13,458
make an emergency landing we pulled off

184
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:15,618
the side of the road but he simply made

185
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:18,138
a quick turn around the lake and came

186
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:22,009
back following us most like the plane

187
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:25,100
was harassing you yeah yes it was and it

188
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:29,209
turned out that he was he was being

189
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,709
playful that's what he said and so he my

190
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,188
girlfriend saw him in the rear view

191
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,798
mirror

192
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:35,838
and even that's a plane you can't hear

193
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:37,818
it until it's really overhead or beyond

194
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,519
you and by the time I heard her scream

195
00:11:37,818 --> 00:11:43,488
or gasp and looked up the belly of the

196
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:47,389
plane was here and our carb lifted off

197
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:49,129
the ground and it rolled wet 365 feet

198
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:51,649
and we were both round from the car Oh

199
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:54,740
No yeah and it left me with a brain

200
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:57,679
trauma and grandma epilepsy sometimes as

201
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,778
many as five seizures a day

202
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:04,278
I went through a long regime of many

203
00:11:59,778 --> 00:12:06,320
different drugs and I was unable to find

204
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:10,399
a medication that would control the

205
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,440
seizures and I lived in this vacuum of a

206
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,679
drugstore and really felt like I lived

207
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:19,220
underwater

208
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:21,559
what ensued was a deliberate effort to

209
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,660
try to find an alternative of course we

210
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:26,000
didn't know of any but I had still been

211
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:28,730
receiving at that time medical journals

212
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,490
and periodicals and Mike was reading

213
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,930
through one and read that laboratory

214
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:37,490
induce seizures and rats had been

215
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:39,489
controlled with marijuana now we looked

216
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,470
at each other and we thought this

217
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,649
chemists be I mean this is - was it BT

218
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,480
simple when we were first arrested here

219
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:49,639
we were growing five plants and the

220
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,199
truthfully I was stunned and I was the

221
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,399
first person in the state of California

222
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:54,939
to challenge the law and medical

223
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,528
necessity knowing what I knew I wasn't

224
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,959
very well going to say I'm guilty of a

225
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:01,338
crime

226
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,679
shortly after our arrest there was a

227
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:05,360
signature gathering to put a medical

228
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,549
marijuana initiative just to get the

229
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,759
pulse of Sanders County how people felt

230
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:17,059
about it and it won 77.1% so I thought

231
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,889
that meant a public national statement

232
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:20,359
hurray I'm the first person in the in

233
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:24,039
the United States can legally grow

234
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,568
marijuana a year and one month later

235
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:28,250
they showed him again and came again and

236
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:31,698
they took our plants and we were livid

237
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:34,698
and we decided that at that time we

238
00:13:31,698 --> 00:13:37,099
would file a suit against them and go

239
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:39,109
completely public and make the statement

240
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,480
that we were going to start not only

241
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,190
growing it again but an organization to

242
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,170
give it away to teach people who are

243
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,880
seriously ill with glaucoma with

244
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:49,159
epilepsy with multiple sclerosis

245
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,480
permanent works mm-hmm and so we're

246
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:52,159
getting together we're gonna get

247
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,589
together and we're gonna continue to use

248
00:13:52,159 --> 00:14:01,698
it yeah Leslie is Nathan's mother thank

249
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:04,029
you so much one of the many people

250
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:08,448
Valerie supplies I'm not finished

251
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:10,100
much nathan 17 now and he had a couple

252
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:12,799
of seizures when he was young about six

253
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,389
years old and went on medication for two

254
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:17,120
years and didn't have any more seizures

255
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:19,930
and then on his 13th birthday he had

256
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,929
another seizure and

257
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:26,938
and then the nightmare began and the

258
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:30,269
seizures came more and more in frequency

259
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:31,889
and we would try one medication and it

260
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,239
wouldn't have an it wouldn't have any

261
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:36,178
effect on him and we try another

262
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:38,160
medication and there was no stopping the

263
00:14:36,178 --> 00:14:40,169
seizures they were increasing and

264
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,269
increasing when things would get really

265
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:43,649
bad he would have a grand mal he'd be up

266
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:46,169
for an hour and then he'd fall down

267
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,089
again and have another grand ma he would

268
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:50,778
maybe bite his lip maybe by this tongue

269
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:55,259
maybe smash his head on the way down and

270
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:58,379
maybe be eating and choke on his feet we

271
00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:00,959
wound up going to UCSF epilepsy center

272
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,999
when our local doctors or the

273
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,888
neurologists in the area felt like there

274
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:08,040
was nothing else that they could do for

275
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:09,629
him so they basically said the only

276
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,879
thing we can think of doing to help him

277
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:13,649
at this point is to actually separate

278
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,600
the right hand side of his brain from

279
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:20,009
the rest from the left hand side which

280
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,019
is a rather large surgery and and we'll

281
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:23,369
get back to you on that and they turned

282
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:25,019
around to walk out of the room and I

283
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:26,759
said no way you're not walking out of

284
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,399
the room he can't have a life like this

285
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,438
anymore

286
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,999
he spoke about killing himself and to

287
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:35,668
hear your child say that he doesn't want

288
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:36,540
to live anymore I can't tell you what

289
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:40,139
that feels like

290
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:41,759
I used to visualize this all getting

291
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,230
into a car and just driving off the

292
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,850
cliff together because I couldn't figure

293
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:48,899
out any other way to make the whole

294
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:53,040
nightmare stop just prior to that I had

295
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:55,379
heard about Val and medical marijuana so

296
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,418
we had just started cooking up in soy

297
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:00,449
milk with it and giving Nathan a little

298
00:15:57,418 --> 00:16:03,088
bit and what we were finding right away

299
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:04,769
was that he was sleeping and his

300
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:07,199
appetite was starting to return because

301
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:09,808
some of the side effects of the seizure

302
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,359
medication are just outrageous he wasn't

303
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:13,708
eating he wasn't sleeping and if you

304
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,480
don't sleep and you don't eat you have

305
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,488
more seizures so it was like this

306
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,259
vicious vicious cycle that we couldn't

307
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:20,939
get off of with him so when they said

308
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:22,918
increase the medication I said thank you

309
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:26,188
very much and hung up the phone and I

310
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:28,619
increased the milk they called back

311
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:29,879
again in two weeks and said how's he

312
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:32,790
doing I said he's not having any

313
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,740
seizures they said oh good that last

314
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:36,839
increase in the medication must work I

315
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,269
said I never did it I never did the last

316
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,910
medication increase I increased his milk

317
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:44,699
so they giggled they thought that was

318
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:48,689
very interesting and they wound up

319
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:50,400
calling it mother's milk we have kept

320
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,840
him on this milk now it's been almost

321
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,149
two years that he has not had any

322
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,009
seizures we feel strong enough to try

323
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:57,840
and start getting him off of some of the

324
00:16:56,009 --> 00:17:11,849
other medications and that's what we're

325
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:16,430
trying to do the meeting of Wham members

326
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,429
is an occasion to establish community

327
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:27,629
now with proposition 215 valerie Corral

328
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,200
has the support of the state of

329
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:34,110
California Californians who needed

330
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,660
marijuana for medical purposes had the

331
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:38,399
right to use it and to obtain it and

332
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,320
that if it was recommended by a

333
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,769
physician and determined that someone's

334
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,909
health required the use of marijuana for

335
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:47,309
alleviation of pain and suffering that

336
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,800
that was illegal and permitted use of

337
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:55,109
marijuana I was wondering how the

338
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:56,700
muffins are doing up a little you know

339
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,869
survey seen how they're doing everything

340
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,430
I was wondering if you guys were all

341
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:01,199
willing to fill that out for a little

342
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,180
figure out what I'm doing wonderful

343
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,830
tonight they're wonderful yeah it's

344
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,830
great am i smiling

345
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:17,909
[Applause]

346
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:20,398
under federal law the growing and

347
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:22,409
distribution of marijuana still brings

348
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:25,558
with it the risk of arrest and

349
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:28,320
imprisonment local support is no

350
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:30,898
guarantee the City Council and Santa

351
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:33,928
Cruz did pass a resolution in support of

352
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:35,398
the activities of wham and the reason we

353
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:41,009
did so is because the people of our

354
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:43,768
community support this can grow enough

355
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:45,089
in here to last all of the people that

356
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:46,349
you take care of for the whole year

357
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:47,668
that's how we do it if you guys

358
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:49,858
guaranteed for a year

359
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,659
Wow that's wonderful as much as one can

360
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:55,048
guarantee and it's all outdoor which is

361
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:57,600
far superior right that's great yeah

362
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:59,819
it's totally organic pretty much

363
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,009
marijuana growing outdoors is pest free

364
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:03,628
so we don't need to use pesticides

365
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:04,919
removing like that one of the things

366
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:07,048
that we do in our organization is are

367
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,778
very stringent about our membership if

368
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:12,690
we don't maintain our squeaky-clean

369
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:14,909
image it can discredit the whole

370
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,649
movement in a way so every organization

371
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:18,509
that's in the state now has to have

372
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:22,709
certain standards that they that they

373
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:25,919
have to live up to mm-hmm Suzy has an

374
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,950
advanced and painful cancer I am an

375
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:33,080
incorporating member of when as an

376
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:35,909
organization signing the papers for

377
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:39,118
incorporation and seeing them come back

378
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:43,950
except it was you know for someone who

379
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:47,699
has a fatal disease this was it this was

380
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:51,210
this was medical marijuana I was the

381
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,340
first my thumbprint is on the history of

382
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,749
Khaleda state of California the history

383
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:56,970
of the United States

384
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:59,788
it's Systema ting it sometimes surprises

385
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:02,278
me I can drive a car and I can run an

386
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:04,079
organization and bring a whole bunch of

387
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:06,778
people and friends of like mindedness

388
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,808
and spirit together and I can do it

389
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:10,950
because I use marijuana

390
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:12,778
it's remarkable I couldn't believe it

391
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,460
either I said I really couldn't when I

392
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:16,648
first realized that it would controls my

393
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,298
seizures I didn't believe it not fully I

394
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,709
wanted to but I really couldn't fully

395
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:22,918
believe it and I can do it myself

396
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:28,169
this is the first organization to ever

397
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:30,389
do this and we come from such a really

398
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:33,960
compassionate place it's incredibly

399
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:37,108
inspiring for me you guys make my dream

400
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:41,879
closer you know I can't see it alive in

401
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:42,598
material with fresh inspiration from

402
00:20:41,878 --> 00:20:51,598
Santa Cruz

403
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:53,398
Hillary is back in Vancouver organizer

404
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:56,519
of the compassion club as well as a

405
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:59,548
member of it the club consists of people

406
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:03,710
from all parts of society all financial

407
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:06,480
brackets we have about 400 members now

408
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:09,139
and building you know we're registering

409
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,139
people every day

410
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,909
good I'm good

411
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:20,259
I'm just curious though you know I have

412
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:22,179
actually osteoarthritis if I came in and

413
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:24,099
asked you for some with you would you

414
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,710
prescribe it what we require is a

415
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:28,329
document of diagnosis which is just

416
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,278
something from a doctor in that states

417
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:33,339
what your medical condition is but if he

418
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:35,950
were to simply sign a form saying yes

419
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:38,470
david has osteoarthritis with nothing

420
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,179
about what he sees recommends would that

421
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,409
be sufficient would be sufficient there

422
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:44,048
are a lot of doctors that are very

423
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:46,299
fearful so we have had to just accept

424
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:48,639
documents of diagnosis for conditions

425
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:53,019
that we know absolutely cannabis does

426
00:21:48,640 --> 00:22:01,390
help with Gregg has the muscle spasms of

427
00:21:53,019 --> 00:22:03,190
multiple sclerosis I remember the first

428
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,080
time that you came into the club the

429
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,210
thing that made you stop shaking the

430
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:11,379
most was just when star just put her

431
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:15,179
hands on your shoulders if if I had a

432
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,179
beautiful woman

433
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:27,259
yeah this way you don't shake it

434
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,420
we roll the joint for him once and I

435
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,100
think any three finds a really good pot

436
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,080
two kinds of hash and a whole bunch of

437
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:54,059
oil on it good and not actually

438
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:59,460
completely stop it's very dramatic

439
00:22:54,059 --> 00:23:02,460
in effect already yeah marijuana is

440
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:06,390
versatile it calms severe muscle spasms

441
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:10,650
and in glaucoma it delays the onset of

442
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:13,890
blinds I love this this one's done five

443
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:16,920
or ten percent I'm lucky my doctor said

444
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:19,020
I'm lucky I still have vision right so I

445
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,750
don't know if it's marijuana or not but

446
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,720
it's been it's working so I don't I just

447
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:27,690
do not say okay I quit I find a good for

448
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,370
repairs also and for sleeping them for

449
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,970
many things we have a lot of research

450
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:37,139
that we want to do but it all depends on

451
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:38,519
having a consistent supply which at this

452
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,290
point we don't because we're not growing

453
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:46,220
first um so where do you go

454
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:49,289
there is about ten people and they are

455
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,600
excellent growers it all works on a

456
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:54,409
friend basis so that they bring me the

457
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,629
pot and I distribute it and I

458
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,710
this is all for the compassion club

459
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,450
police in Vancouver have said they're

460
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,680
not going to bust them so if they're

461
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,660
gonna leave them alone they need to

462
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,430
supplied from somewhere and I just don't

463
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,980
think they should have to pay $3,200 a

464
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,600
pound for something that you can grow to

465
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,099
mean hydroponic marijuana I've grown on

466
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,109
a big scale he can grow it for the same

467
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:17,119
amount as hydroponic tomatoes and they

468
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:17,119
retail for three three dollars a pound

469
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,000
Jim wake fir'd is suing the federal

470
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:24,179
government

471
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,839
he needs a legal supply of an essential

472
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,470
medicine

473
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:31,139
the fact is it's been helpful in dealing

474
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:34,200
with the side effects from the AIDS

475
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,350
drugs I was on my drug regimen was so

476
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,690
strict I had to be up at 8:00 every

477
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:42,059
morning I couldn't go to bed before

478
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:48,029
midnight because I had the dose at each

479
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:51,659
time which meant I could never sleep in

480
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:57,180
or ever go to bed early and that went on

481
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:59,310
for two years John good Hugh is Jim's

482
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:01,440
doctor I'm going to show you for example

483
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:04,589
what one of my patients who does use

484
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,420
marijuana and who basically has had a

485
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:09,509
tremendous improvement in his immune

486
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:12,150
functioning since starting this

487
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:13,829
treatment but could absolutely not

488
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,950
tolerate the side effects without

489
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:20,039
marijuana now he takes this one is

490
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:22,799
called Crixivan or indinavir and it has

491
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:25,079
to be taken every eight hours simple go

492
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:28,319
three times a day no every eight hours

493
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:30,960
and on an empty stomach he then has to

494
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:34,230
take two of these which are called

495
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,470
xerath or d40 and they have to be taken

496
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:39,960
close to every 12 hours

497
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:45,720
and taking with this other drug which is

498
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:48,150
called 3tc which is also taken twice a

499
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,669
day and use it with food to prevent

500
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,740
Knology okay so we've now got three

501
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:56,250
doses without food

502
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,500
two doses with food and he also takes

503
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:02,130
this drug which is a particularly nasty

504
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:07,048
drug in terms of side effects this one

505
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:09,210
is called vitex or DDI the problem is

506
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:09,990
each and every one of these drugs has

507
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,860
side effects

508
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:18,089
this one 3tc not bad d14 not bad

509
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:22,558
Crixivan DDI tremendous nausea and in

510
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:27,689
many people total loss of appetite

511
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:31,048
especially with with this smoke will

512
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:34,230
marijuana so unique in that it is so

513
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:37,408
easy for the patient to control the

514
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:39,900
administration of their own dose you

515
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:41,400
have two puffs of a joint if it's

516
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,288
controlled your nausea or if it

517
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,710
stimulates your appetite great go ahead

518
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:49,859
if not have another two puffs so within

519
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:53,279
minutes you can have given yourself the

520
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:55,349
appropriate dose of medication and in in

521
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,779
that aspect it's far superior to

522
00:26:55,349 --> 00:27:01,319
anything else that I would have to offer

523
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:04,859
them and I have a joint before lunch and

524
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:07,200
I have a joint before dinner and if I'm

525
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:10,788
having a beautiful night I'll have a

526
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,919
third joint between dinner and dessert

527
00:27:10,788 --> 00:27:17,119
because I gotta put 20 more pounds on

528
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,120
this scrawny little body

529
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:24,009
the mystery of marijuana lies in its

530
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:28,470
complexity the synthesis of one

531
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:31,690
component THC forms the drug Marinol

532
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,370
nobody knows why marijuana works so well

533
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,190
as an anti-nausea agent and as an

534
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:37,750
appetite stimulant and this is evident

535
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:40,090
when you look at the clinical outcome

536
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:44,609
when you try to use now alone or Marilyn

537
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:49,329
or Marin all the effects are prolonged

538
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:55,329
12 15 18 24 hours people will remain

539
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:57,609
completely intoxicated most people find

540
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:59,798
it extremely unpleasant the anxiety and

541
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:03,158
the paranoia that goes along with it all

542
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:06,819
I remember is one experience of Marin

543
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:11,080
all that went on for seven hours of

544
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:14,980
nausea waves and waves of nausea and

545
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:17,230
puking and of course I've never put

546
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:23,259
Marin all in my body again or I will I

547
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:25,870
ever Donald Abrams surprised the

548
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:29,319
establishment by proposing a study of

549
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:32,079
the whole plant we've been trying since

550
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:34,658
1993 to conduct a study or design a

551
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,298
study to investigate whether smoking

552
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:39,100
marijuana is useful in patients with HIV

553
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:42,250
infection and at the same time whether

554
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:44,500
it's safe it's been difficult certainly

555
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:48,329
to obtain a legal source of marijuana

556
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:52,210
and to get funding to conduct the study

557
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:55,019
could this illegal drug be beneficial

558
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:57,069
the comments that we ultimately got were

559
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:58,929
comments that were concerned about why

560
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:03,069
we would even consider studying such a

561
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:04,330
toxic substance so there was also one

562
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:06,278
reviewer and these were going to be

563
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:08,439
patients with AIDS wasting who was

564
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:10,960
concerned that if we stimulated appetite

565
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,360
and patients started to eat too much

566
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,819
they might develop high blood fats and

567
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,378
hardening of the arteries now this is

568
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:19,418
not something that patients with AIDS

569
00:29:17,378 --> 00:29:22,089
really have the luxury of worrying about

570
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:23,799
so I was concerned about whether my

571
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:27,069
peers that were reviewing this were

572
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:29,470
really peers for some reason this

573
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:32,138
emotional political charge

574
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:36,129
is very present and makes it very

575
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:42,459
difficult for science to go on in the

576
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:44,859
midst of all that politics Kent barrage

577
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,889
and Terry Robinsons are studying

578
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:50,878
addiction focusing on a chemical called

579
00:29:47,888 --> 00:29:53,589
dopamine it's release in the brain

580
00:29:50,878 --> 00:29:56,138
measures the importance of every

581
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:58,798
pleasant stimulus it could be food or

582
00:29:56,138 --> 00:30:02,788
sex or drugs

583
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:05,168
rats have the same dopamine system

584
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:09,000
self-administered heart drugs release

585
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:12,278
dopamine but they also change the brain

586
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,869
cells in the dopamine system normally

587
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:20,019
look like this but hard drugs cause them

588
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:24,008
to grow become sensitized and send an

589
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:27,099
exaggerated message as far as we know

590
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:29,409
drugs like marijuana don't produce this

591
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:31,689
neural sensitization which may account

592
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:35,519
for why animals will readily self

593
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:38,440
administer THC it might account for why

594
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:42,609
people who use marijuana really aren't

595
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:46,960
characterized as compulsive drug takers

596
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:52,979
or drug seekers most sophisticated drug

597
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:57,340
researchers now believe that cannabis is

598
00:30:52,980 --> 00:31:01,139
place as a drug of addiction is down at

599
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:05,939
the bottom of the list with coffee

600
00:31:01,138 --> 00:31:08,069
cannabis is a truly remarkably non-toxic

601
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,320
truck well

602
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:13,769
take the place of a lot of prescription

603
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:19,019
drugs it'll take the place of value

604
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:26,029
it'll take the place of xanax it will

605
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:26,029
take the place of tylenol aspirin

606
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:34,559
relieve migraines it's just a world good

607
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:38,659
like if I fail to not want dinner some

608
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:42,210
night tired or don't feel like really a

609
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,920
dinner my wife turns around and looks at

610
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,850
me honey maybe you better have a

611
00:31:43,920 --> 00:32:04,590
cigarette marijuana may be a better

612
00:31:46,849 --> 00:32:08,219
marijuana to possess and grow marijuana

613
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:10,349
is illegal as Terry Parker found out the

614
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,940
judged against me is with Co cultivation

615
00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:14,219
and possession for the purpose of

616
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,769
trafficking I developed up love see at

617
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,200
four years of age it's growing it

618
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:21,990
because so I simply with my budget I

619
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,809
don't cannot afford the price marijuana

620
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:26,400
stre is is today and I think much more

621
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:29,299
convenient for myself to grow my own

622
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,300
medicine

623
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:38,319
at his trial Terry was represented by

624
00:32:35,108 --> 00:32:39,848
Aaron Harnett we structured the case

625
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,999
both the Crown attorney and I in such a

626
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:45,968
way that we agreed with the obvious and

627
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:49,088
spent our time in a quasi scientific

628
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:51,729
inquiry putting some of the best minds

629
00:32:49,088 --> 00:32:53,528
in the area up on the stand and and we

630
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:56,669
were educating ourselves as well as the

631
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:56,669
judges the trial went on

632
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,850
Valerie was a tremendous witness it was

633
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,220
my good fortune to be able to travel to

634
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:06,709
Toronto and to testify in this most

635
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:10,130
incredible case and really how are you

636
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:12,920
really a mark case yes truly and because

637
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:16,760
of its bearing unconstitutionality mmm

638
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:18,800
which is for morale we wanted a remedy

639
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:20,569
fashioned that would help a whole range

640
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,759
of people who have a medical need for

641
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:24,789
marijuana and the judge agreed with us

642
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:29,720
and he actually declared that law

643
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:32,750
invalid for all of Canadians and and

644
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,460
tinkered with it a bit to allow Terry

645
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,650
and people like Terry to be able to

646
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,440
possess and grow marijuana for medical

647
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:42,500
purposes tonight Terry Parker can smoke

648
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,779
a joint legally and illegally makes

649
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,970
legal history but the federal government

650
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:49,250
has since appealed the verdict we've

651
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,440
relegated to the courts the difficult

652
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:54,529
policy decisions that Parliament seems

653
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,000
unwilling to tackle if they can blame

654
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:58,309
the courts and say well it's those crazy

655
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,009
judges who made it legal not us then

656
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:03,279
that might get them off the hook and and

657
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:06,230
so long as as sick people are being

658
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,849
stupidly prosecuted then that is the

659
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,789
courts role to step in and make sure it

660
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:13,880
stops the unchanging official view of

661
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:17,389
marijuana conveniently obscures more

662
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:23,090
serious problems RCMP constable Gila

putter on Vancouver's east side anybody

664
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:27,410
who abuses any substance has got some

665
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,150
serious underlying problems should be

666
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:32,599
dealt with by a medical practitioner a

667
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:34,639
counselor an educator but simply

668
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:36,440
arresting incarcerated punishing

669
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,579
somebody is counterproductive it's only

670
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,409
going to make the problem worse

671
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:44,289
maybe that's wishful thinking it's hard

672
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:45,699
to enforce an unreasonable law a lot of

673
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:47,170
kids on the steps are smoking some of

674
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:48,639
them might be smoking marijuana still

675
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:51,190
the place where they're picked up for

676
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,839
that certainly the officers that I work

677
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,940
with are not particularly concerned

678
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,250
about anybody in possession of a small

679
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,480
amount of marijuana or consuming it for

680
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:01,539
their own purposes I think where the

681
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,130
concern is trafficking to young people

682
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:05,650
and possession of the schools that type

683
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:08,019
of thing people that I encounter who

684
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:11,019
used cannabis whether a small or large

685
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:14,739
amount or generally quite passive easy

686
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:17,159
to deal with and I really can't remember

687
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:22,029
ever having a problem with anybody

688
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:24,789
marijuana is not nearly as harmful as

689
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:26,800
alcohol tobacco or any of the opiates

690
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,779
marijuana is particularly for

691
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,190
recreational and medicine medical uses

692
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,850
relatively harmless

694
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:39,750
in Santa Cruz there's the same divide

695
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:42,809
between federal and local attitudes the

696
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:44,460
implementation of proposition 215 is now

697
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,389
challenged as being in violation of

698
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,210
federal law

699
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:52,889
so we have something of a crisis here in

700
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:57,329
in California they basically threatened

701
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:59,730
us with license revocation if in fact we

702
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:04,199
recommended it we went to court

703
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:05,969
and in fact the court agreed that we

704
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:08,849
really had the freedom to at least

705
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:10,469
recommend it if not prescribe it we're

706
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:13,650
going to do what we can to follow the

707
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:15,389
law at times it's difficult because it

708
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,840
doesn't answer all the questions about

709
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:20,609
who can provide marijuana who can grow

710
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,579
at how much can they grow

711
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:29,670
there's many unanswered questions but we

712
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:32,150
will do our best to follow 215 Kathy got

713
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:36,300
caught up in these unanswered questions

714
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:38,309
marijuana relieves her arthritis the

715
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,190
cops wind up coming to my house and I

716
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:46,199
had one little marijuana plant growing

717
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:48,150
and they busted me in my own home they

718
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:49,349
took everything they took my plant they

719
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,490
took my tray

720
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:57,029
they took my marijuana everything and

721
00:36:53,489 --> 00:37:00,599
you know and then I had court and this

722
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:04,290
was before I was involved in Wham and

723
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:08,699
they find me they were gonna send me to

724
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:10,980
diversion which is a drug school where

725
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:12,750
they tell you how bad you are and they

726
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,360
show you films about drug use and all

727
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:18,179
that kind of stuff and when I went to

728
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,519
the hearing the judge looked at me

729
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:22,259
and it's seeing obvious deformity and he

730
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:26,340
looked at the DA and said well maybe she

731
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:30,650
doesn't want diversion you know there's

732
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:34,068
he said nothing

733
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:38,858
in Santa Cruz it's nothing in Tulsa

734
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:38,858
Oklahoma it's 92 years in jail

735
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,860
[Music]

736
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:47,470
in Oklahoma City people are gathering

737
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:50,349
for a rally to protest will Foster's

738
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:52,889
sentence like Kathy he was using

739
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:55,839
marijuana to ease the pains of arthritis

740
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:58,029
the police raided his house looking for

741
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:02,200
amphetamines on a tip from a

742
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:04,540
confidential Informer I mean he's a he's

743
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:05,739
a medical marijuana use he's not one of

744
00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:07,000
the people who's just partying around

745
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:09,369
they didn't even find any

746
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,130
methamphetamine it's a day meg Foster

747
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:14,559
will never forget so as I put my hand on

748
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:17,769
the doorknob to disengage it the door

749
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:20,409
just exploded inward I fell backwards

750
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:23,170
onto my five-year-old daughter and

751
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:26,849
knocked her onto the floor and there was

752
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:30,010
this very large man with no badge

753
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:33,400
dressed and what I think of as a biker

754
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:37,870
attire harley-davidson t-shirts the high

755
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:46,139
metal boots with a very large gun in my

756
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:46,139
face and at my head and I'm sorry

757
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:53,650
it's frightened me badly very badly I

758
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:58,599
don't think I've ever been that scared I

759
00:38:53,650 --> 00:39:01,000
had no idea who these people were and my

760
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:08,440
daughter is screaming leave my mommy

761
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:10,559
alone and I think that was the hardest

762
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,559
part

763
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:19,039
they searched everything there were 60

764
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:21,539
plants in the basement and approximately

765
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:25,469
half a dozen of them were about a foot

766
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:27,900
tall had really just started to bed the

767
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:29,159
rest of them were saplings you know 2 3

768
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,260
inches at the most

769
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:36,329
I wanted a plea bargain of 12 years in

770
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:40,380
and if will gets 12 years in then I get

771
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:45,690
five years in or I can take their deal

772
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:47,730
and testify for the state against him it

773
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:52,490
seems so unconscionable for me to do

774
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:55,409
that I felt like I would be betraying

775
00:39:52,489 --> 00:40:03,959
but somebody had to be here to raise

776
00:39:55,409 --> 00:40:06,509
these children so I took their deal meg

777
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,389
and will agonized over their decision

778
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:12,440
but the only way for make to remain free

779
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:17,639
to care for the children was to testify

780
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:20,480
against her husband so will refused the

781
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:23,219
plea bargain and opted for trial by jury

782
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,099
by an arbitrary decision of the court

783
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:30,149
the evidence of medical necessity was

784
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:35,429
disallowed he was given a mandatory 92

785
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:36,990
years they took him in and that's the

786
00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:40,460
last time I was with him when he wasn't

787
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:43,919
behind a bar behind a fence or whatever

788
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:45,869
in less than 30 seconds my entire life

789
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,289
was ripped apart

790
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:54,940
it's a long five-hour drive to see him

791
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:57,519
I got 70 years for cultivation I got 20

792
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:00,880
years for having that marijuana in the

793
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:03,539
presence of a child I got two years for

794
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,539
possession with intent

795
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:38,608
they put you in prison hoping that your

796
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:41,130
family will forget about you your

797
00:41:38,608 --> 00:41:43,769
friends will forget about you you don't

798
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:50,160
get to see your kids grow out kind of

799
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:51,719
kind of hard they don't want people to

800
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:55,889
have people that care on them on the

801
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:58,679
outside had their signs there's

802
00:41:55,889 --> 00:42:00,750
marijuana here actually I have more

803
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:03,019
access to drugs in here than I did on

804
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,019
the outside

805
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:23,710
if you want to sign clinker on one side

806
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:26,050
all the DV agency district attorney's

807
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:29,650
assistant district attorneys the people

808
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:33,070
who who build jails who guard prisoners

809
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:36,460
there's a lot of personnel and money

810
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:39,670
involved in this now the US government

811
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:43,329
has spent countless millions of dollars

812
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:46,000
trying to establish the toxicity which

813
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:48,639
would justify this prohibition which has

814
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,530
led to the arrests of 11 million mostly

815
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:58,289
young Americans I want them to stop

816
00:42:53,530 --> 00:43:00,570
harassing and jailing and fining and

817
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:05,570
brutalizing

818
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:08,850
sink brothers and sisters for us it was

819
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:12,930
it was no other choice this just wasn't

820
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:16,769
another choice a lot of the drugs that

821
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:20,399
we're worrying is have a significant

822
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:22,590
advantage in decreasing suffering in

823
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,860
medical marijuana which is very very

824
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:28,440
safe is one of the principal herbs that

825
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:31,470
I ought to be able to use in order to

826
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,570
help my patients you take a crock pot

827
00:43:31,469 --> 00:43:35,250
and mix up some green stuff with some

828
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,080
white stuff and you give it to him and

829
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:39,269
suddenly he's not having seizures he's

830
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,039
eating he's laughing maybe a little bit

831
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:46,139
too much at first but he was laughing

832
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:48,599
again patients we don't want to be

833
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:55,589
criminals we want to say supply it's

834
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:56,849
natural just leave us alone and then

835
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:59,370
when you're finally adjusting the

836
00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:00,539
medicine you're also ingesting your own

837
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:16,779
love for yourself

838
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:16,779
