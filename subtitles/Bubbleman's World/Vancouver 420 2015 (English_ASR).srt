00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,100

plant day in and day out who have love

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,700
for this plant and who are forwarding

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,590
the education and the pushing of a

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,239
legalization of being allowed to use

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,520
this plant whether medicinally

12
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,179
recreationally preventative or even

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,590
industrial like clothes and other

14
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:55,649
industrial applications that cannabis

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,050
obviously has pretty exciting day today

16
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:03,000
I've got D 420 K's in the house Johnny

17
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:04,768
B's got a booth down at the art gallery

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,599
where cannabis culture will be setting

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,540
up with many many booths there's usually

20
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,789
bands and comedians and speakers

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,860
activists and of course a lot of

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,259
cannabis a lot of edibles a lot of

23
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,890
concentrates so I figured we'd start off

24
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,930
the day I've got got a little blue

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,969
satellite bubble hash from the interior

26
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,820
from a good friend of mine I've got a

27
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,719
little bit of D for 20 K dry sift last

28
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,149
of the gift

29
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,920
Oh G cush that's always a pleasure and

30
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,030
then of course I've got a little of

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,019
Horatio's distilled dilemma Deen so his

32
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:43,379
newest product the raw raw and I figure

33
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:45,500
what we'll do is well maybe well we'll

34
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:48,298
have a little dab a little variety of

35
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,069
all of them I've got the Swiss perc as

36
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,549
well as the straight fab both with

37
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:56,039
bangers on them and yeah why don't we

38
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,850
have a DAB alright so I've got my

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,860
dabbers right here I've got the hive and

40
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:09,229
the skillet tool

41
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:09,229
I figure probably a good start be too

42
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:21,108
put a little of the D limonene on to the

43
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:26,658
hive it's the Ripper dip that into the D

44
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:30,349
420k dry set and that's just great there

45
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:31,699
we go and then what do I wake and bake

46
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:34,039
with we got Swiss perc

47
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:37,759
we got straight fab I think we Ghost

48
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:42,370
Whisperer its sorta seems to me like the

49
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:45,699
OG unit oh this isn't good

50
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,700
there we go

51
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:55,310
all right so yeah we're gonna hit the OG

52
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,310
the Swiss perc

53
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:06,090
my torch food might be on the its last

54
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:08,730
legs and this actual little banger is

55
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,229
from the Davin ater dabba nadir sent

56
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:13,139
this little banger out with the unit

57
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:17,068
when he sent it and that's quite a nice

58
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:20,639
little unit German courts not as thick

59
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:23,310
as my DC glass but I find the DC glass

60
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,799
ones are so thick that it is a bit of a

61
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,569
challenge to heat up with my little

62
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,640
creme brulee torch I'm not one of these

63
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:31,289
huge torch guys that has the big power

64
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,539
shot or whatever else I just got the

65
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:35,129
little baby ones and I find that the

66
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,949
sometimes the smaller courts bowls a

67
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,340
little easier to light up happy 4/20

68
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:40,339
everybody

69
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:10,419
very nice beautiful little combination

70
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:13,679
there I think the next one what we're

71
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:13,679
gonna do is we're gonna go for a dunk

72
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:21,759
we'll go straight fab right to dunk this

73
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:24,009
actually a nice little pile of bubble

74
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,300
house right here be bringing this down

75
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:33,849
to 420 today and see if I can't share

76
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:35,590
some bowls with some people so yeah this

77
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,270
bowl right off the bat is much thicker

78
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:41,310
gonna take a little bit longer to heat

79
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:41,310
up and that's okay

80
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:52,209
we'll get it working pretty excited

81
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,388
today that I'm gonna try and get up to

82
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:58,000
John's a para el room that he rented and

83
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:02,379
set up my camera on the tripod and I

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,750
want to get from 417 - about 425 and

85
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:08,040
show you guys what it looks like in

86
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:12,040
Vancouver 120 thousand plus people

87
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,050
sparked a spliff or a bowl or a dab all

88
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,910
simultaneously it is really quite

89
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,430
something to be a part of if if you've

90
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,370
never done it I urge you to go down and

91
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,600
hang out in your cities 420 gallery you

92
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,579
don't have to be the biggest supporter

93
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,490
of cannabis to go down and show your

94
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:30,668
support and it always is helpful because

95
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,069
the face of cannabis is the many faces

96
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:35,289
there is no stereotype of a cannabis

97
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:36,879
user there's many many many faces of

98
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,490
cannabis and so it's important that all

99
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,610
the faces get out and represent here we

100
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,610
go

101
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:14,069
hmm Wow really nice taste on that

102
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,329
particular hashed blue satellite and I

103
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,620
believe there might even be some sweet

104
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:19,199
tooth in there as well a couple of

105
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,660
breeders Steve strains something that I

106
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,759
haven't seen come across my desk in some

107
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,320
time I've seen the grapefruit and I've

108
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,259
seen the sweet skunk obviously it's in

109
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,060
my garden but I have not seen blue

110
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,509
satellite or sweet tooth for some time

111
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,579
so I've got about 50 55 grams of it here

112
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:37,259

113

00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:23,329
session going on I just got this from

549
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:27,799

551
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:34,250
gonna turn these bad boys on first time

552
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:37,119
they've been turned on all together all

553
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:39,619
those are on except that perfect

554
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:41,329
we'll see what temperature they've got

555
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:43,130
it set to I'm guessing that's around six

556
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:49,489
or seven hundred degrees as it usually

557
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:51,800
is and yeah we've got the setup to this

558
00:57:49,489 --> 00:57:56,839
Marcelle piece here with the drop down

559
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:59,240
we've got the nectar collector here set

560
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:01,460
up first time I've ever tried one and

561
00:57:59,239 --> 00:58:03,979
then we've got the Marcel Debbie

562
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:10,250
mothership fab egg with the drop down

563
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:12,199
and the nudie nail titanium new titanium

564
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:15,679
nail and then it's also they sent us

565
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:17,419
their ceramic inserts so if there's a

566
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,339
bunch of ceramic inserts for the

567
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,619
titanium nail and then they sent us one

568
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:24,260
sapphire so I'm guessing we're gonna

569
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:27,529
bust out the Sapphire because sapphires

570
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:29,390
are super nice and should be exciting

571
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:31,640
these guys are climbing up there at two

572
00:58:29,389 --> 00:58:35,509

578
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:50,360
time down there I'm sure yeah it was a

579
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:52,309
hot popping day a good April 4:20

580
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,650
yeah well I've been with flalf pretty

581
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:57,949
much the whole day I was with roll for a

582
00:58:54,650 --> 00:59:00,349
little bit as well and we were earlier

583
00:58:57,949 --> 00:59:02,389
we were at lunch and my manager actually

584
00:59:00,349 --> 00:59:04,099
one of my employees not my manager she

585
00:59:02,389 --> 00:59:06,289
called me and said she would bring some

586
00:59:04,099 --> 00:59:08,329
stuff down for 4/20 and I asked her was

587
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:10,250
there a package from Dean ale and of

588
00:59:08,329 --> 00:59:11,989
course this triple-threat Dean ale

589
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:15,110
showed up the ninja nail with the red

590
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:17,479
gold and green Dean ale all three of

591
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:19,070
them in the one case so we thought we

592
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,530
would like them all up we have three

593
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:24,490
whips and they also sent me from Dean

594
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:27,860
ale one of the new nectar collectors

595
00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:29,239
with the D mail whip addition which

596
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:32,140
anyone that's ever used the nectar

597
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:36,889
collector can definitely confirm that

598
00:59:32,139 --> 00:59:38,480
having it always be hot is ideal so I'm

599
00:59:36,889 --> 00:59:40,009
not sure if you guys have seen this unit

600
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,679
before but it's the unit that you just

601
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:44,690
literally dip right down into your

602
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:46,239
product either in a glass dish or I

603
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:48,460
guess I've heard people doing it on

604
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:52,539
Slick's and stuff and then we have the

605
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:55,570
new titanium nail with the sapphire

606
00:59:52,539 --> 00:59:59,769
insert so why don't we just drop that in

607
00:59:55,570 --> 01:00:01,570
there boom the nail is unseasoned but

608
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:04,090
the Sapphire is good to go and we're

609
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:06,670
gonna be hitting off the sapphire so I

610
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:10,750
guess we've got some some limonene here

611
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:12,909
and some this was it rosin that I

612
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:15,070
pressed on him yeah it was from here

613
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:17,469
nope nope that was a different one that

614
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:19,840
was under Russell yeah this is from 120

615
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:22,509
and that's from 45 all right and then

616
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:26,230
we've got more of the lho right here

617
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:28,690
we've got some of the Terps from that's

618
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:30,849
from from amok she concentrated she

619
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:33,190
concentrates exactly didn't want to make

620
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:34,989
a mistake on that well what should we

621
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:37,450
start out with boys should we do should

622
01:00:34,989 --> 01:00:38,859
we all do know that later yes I was

623
01:00:37,449 --> 01:00:41,618
gonna say lho with the nectar collector

624
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:43,090
I've never used a nectar collector I've

625
01:00:41,619 --> 01:00:47,820
always been sort of interested in one

626
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:51,570
you mind bringing mine Indies thank you

627
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:51,570
let's pick it up for you

628
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,849
he did the whole morning he did the

629
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:02,288
whole night

630
01:01:00,849 --> 01:01:10,269
he didn't I didn't know it was gonna go

631
01:01:02,289 --> 01:01:14,009
in lines that was awesome that was very

632
01:01:10,268 --> 01:01:18,608
well you're a beast you're a machine

633
01:01:14,009 --> 01:01:19,869
thank you he did the whole I didn't know

634
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:22,150
I was like are we doing I'm like

635
01:01:19,869 --> 01:01:25,180
compared to a DAB what's happening here

636
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:27,309
there's these impartial lines in read is

637
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:31,798
it called lines now is that wait a

638
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:33,849
minute yeah that's what you drew out

639
01:01:31,798 --> 01:01:36,338
maybe it's the way the nectar collector

640
01:01:33,849 --> 01:01:42,249
so is this how they felt in the 70s when

641
01:01:36,338 --> 01:01:44,739
someone passed is only it well I guess

642
01:01:42,248 --> 01:01:46,659
in a 420 special scenario well I said

643
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:49,449
I'd never be doing lines but I guess

644
01:01:46,659 --> 01:01:52,058
here I am lho lines they're gonna do

645
01:01:49,449 --> 01:01:54,478
Dean L nectar collector collab yeah I'll

646
01:01:52,059 --> 01:01:54,479
hit it up

647
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:12,949
all right going off that track but 70%

648
01:02:10,909 --> 01:02:15,558
of the way there I'll expect don't go

649
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:18,949
for the line that's really nice food I

650
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:21,829
have to I have to say that is a real

651
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:24,559
nice experience he concentrates in the

652
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:26,690
house with us he's not on camera but I

653
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,680
think he'll have to be trying this too

654
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:33,139
as soon as the camera turns off

655
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:36,618
absolutely you see it there mm-hmm

656
01:02:33,139 --> 01:02:41,259
excellent well that is quite a little

657
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:44,719
unit I like it there it is there it is

658
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:49,039

659
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:52,009

660
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:53,449
stand right how gnarly is that these are

661
01:02:52,009 --> 01:02:56,179
very similar to the kind of stands that

662
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:59,900
this piece is on but with all that I

663
01:02:56,179 --> 01:03:02,028

01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:16,489
coming on the stand would be my name is

669
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:18,108
the [ __ ] you wouldn't even he's going

670
01:03:16,489 --> 01:03:19,338
back for more I'm just check it's one of

671
01:03:18,108 --> 01:03:20,808
those weird things where I'm like do

672
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:22,670
what do I do - I know right - right

673
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:25,609
right to the you could like take the

674
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:27,199
glob put it right on here on your was

675
01:03:25,608 --> 01:03:31,278
doing it inefficiently we would see

676
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:33,680
reclaim just firing up this but that's

677
01:03:31,278 --> 01:03:38,150
strange because I know my dad limits

678
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:39,948
when it comes to doin lines but then I

679
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:44,809
started doing swirls and dancing with it

680
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:47,349
and too much for sure

681
01:03:44,809 --> 01:03:49,609
well what's weird is I didn't come up

682
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:51,588
yeah and it's thick at the front so if

683
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:53,929
you come there cuz I'm not trying to do

684
01:03:51,588 --> 01:03:55,009
if you do have that line you'd be happy

685
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:58,038
happy camper

686
01:03:55,009 --> 01:04:00,309
half a line you know it's 4:20 just do

687
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:02,660
half a line Horatio

688
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:04,999
well gotta say that's my first hit off

689
01:04:02,659 --> 01:04:06,379
an actor collector really stoked that I

690
01:04:04,998 --> 01:04:08,568
didn't have to deal with the torch and

691
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:12,579
that you know three unique beautiful

692
01:04:08,568 --> 01:04:17,190
pieces all hooked up to a D nail

693
01:04:12,579 --> 01:04:20,469
showing the you know the sort of

694
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:23,470
versatility the versatility yeah yes no

695
01:04:20,469 --> 01:04:25,750
it's really good and I gotta say like

696
01:04:23,469 --> 01:04:29,919
I'm Jerry impressed with the nectar

697
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:32,170
collector turn that around so that cable

698
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,030
stays yeah that was religious I think

699
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:36,309
the d-mail attachment is what would make

700
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:37,450
the unit as opposed to trying to like

701
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:39,340
heat it up and get her temperatures

702
01:04:37,449 --> 01:04:42,039
where I couldn't do that I wouldn't have

703
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:45,390
gone for the second hit that was at I

704
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:46,980
mean I just I'm actually impressed for

705
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:51,389
whom

706
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:51,389
never mind the line getting in greeley

707
01:04:53,280 --> 01:05:00,930
about to put some rosin to work well I

708
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:00,929
figure yeah we've got three rips here

709
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:09,760
three rips of the rosin and yeah I think

710
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:11,620
if Dave just puts his head on one side

711
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,420
of the sapphire and I don't mind on

712
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:15,849
another side and you'll we'll all three

713
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:16,180
have a nice fresh sapphire red Mexico

714
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:19,889

716
01:05:19,889 --> 01:05:22,889
handy

717
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:33,380
beautiful Scott Debbie Marcel Braun

718

very nice flavor to it yeah well the

725
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:57,289
Sapphire always said no matter what you

726
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:59,150
hit off the sapphire it seems to hit the

727
01:05:57,289 --> 01:06:01,400
nicest through this off burning though

728
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:03,980
so I apologize you must time that's okay

729
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,690
best to to off you know you got yourself

730
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:07,610
a nice hotel room and the last thing we

731
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:11,030
want to do is find ourselves getting

where the cruise ships come in we're

735
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:18,139
literally in the middle of downtown

736
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:20,480
Vancouver probably in one of the most

737
01:06:18,139 --> 01:06:22,309
desirable areas that you could spend a

738
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,860
night or two if you come to the city to

739

[Music]

753
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:39,769
shape of the nail some reason I thought

754
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:45,170
it'd be like a straight line yeah hit to

755
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:47,809
my lungs yeah it's well it reminds me of

756
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:51,530
a very small piece time I hit those

757
01:07:47,809 --> 01:07:54,139
really small pieces if he cut out most

758
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:57,350
of the oxygen and don't take too big of

759
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:59,150
a rip we got many Carl setters a little

01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:59,510

782
01:09:57,738 --> 01:10:01,368

784
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:12,309

785
01:10:06,948 --> 01:10:13,549
Phoenix reticello air trapped

786
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:16,429
ridiculousness

787
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:18,920
with a drop down in Edina which is truly

788
01:10:16,429 --> 01:10:20,630
something I've never even even when you

789
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:25,069

790
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:27,730
interesting yeah so chuck is old-school

so we push it off I think we should

793
01:10:34,449 --> 01:10:38,829
finish it then I think we should dump

794
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:40,899

795

831
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:43,558
Marcel Branca

832
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:44,969

833
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:46,590
this pipe you know yeah we've taken

834
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:49,020
we've been around with it it's been

835
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:51,210
around in the water he shows up it comes

836
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:55,860
around with Whistler you mostly and I

837
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:57,179
just happened to be there except they're

838
01:12:55,859 --> 01:12:58,288
not they tend to be traveling to the

839
01:12:57,179 --> 01:13:00,000
other side

840
01:12:58,288 --> 01:13:01,639
but yeah if you wanted to drive this

841
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,649
[ __ ]

842
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:06,750
she's a purty beast I have beautiful

843
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:11,819
pictures of this type of bow an eye on

844
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:13,800
the dock one of my favorite photos ever

845
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:15,988
is that one just with me sitting on your

846
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,529
boat oh yeah dude romantic a bad shot

847
01:13:15,988 --> 01:13:19,408
yeah

848
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:22,340
a man in his glass that's my personal

849
01:13:19,408 --> 01:13:24,839
title for that photo just in my own mind

850
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:26,639
just Dave sitting there so chill on the

851
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:30,739
back of the boat with that pipe kind of

852
01:13:26,639 --> 01:13:30,739
like on a side and it's not just like

853
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:56,420
ice with the right nature's really nice

854
01:13:48,569 --> 01:14:01,038
I must say that's really surprising

855
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:04,559
it's some pink cooked

856
01:14:01,038 --> 01:14:06,809
rosin from my garden and then Renee

857
01:14:04,559 --> 01:14:09,210
chirps the chicken feed you just dip it

858
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:11,340
in yeah yeah she concentrates made the

859
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:13,288
trips from Renee from my garden so

860
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:15,900
everything is pretty much from my garden

861
01:14:13,288 --> 01:14:19,979
except the Turks that you know Mick aza

862
01:14:15,899 --> 01:14:26,238
Jeff's it's attempts zip dubs ends in

863
01:14:19,979 --> 01:14:26,238
Moscow and they are bad

864
01:14:41,689 --> 01:14:48,869
big lake I know there's a big push for a

865
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:53,489
small glass like convenient I don't know

866
01:14:48,869 --> 01:14:56,640
whatever but big chunky bubbler pieces

867
01:14:53,489 --> 01:15:00,960
this is a [ __ ] single - man [ __ ] you

868
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:03,030
but of course there's like a liter of

869
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:06,210
water in here that's another people

870
01:15:03,029 --> 01:15:09,539
things people don't really realize how

871
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:13,109
much water is in a pipe like this a huge

872
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:15,269
volume of water for stabilizing it like

873
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:17,969
is it more sturdy of a pipe when waters

874
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:20,760
in it than when it's dry like is that a

875
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:22,560
part of the natural balance that every

876
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:27,659
big chugging pipe like there's a leader

877
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:31,320
leader in half technique so for example

878
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:34,920
yeah these two also this one has no

879
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:38,549
water in it but this is leather and lace

880
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:40,819
by Marcel Braun and Jason Lee we've had

881
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:40,820
it on

882
01:15:43,829 --> 01:15:49,658
still like such a wonderful chuggy pipe

883
01:15:47,229 --> 01:15:51,309
yeah old-school as well yeah but not you

884
01:15:49,658 --> 01:15:52,389
know still like there's there's still a

885
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:54,039
decent amount of water in there we're

886
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:56,170
not here oh it's a beautiful base on

887
01:15:54,039 --> 01:15:59,198
this thing like this one which is a dyke

888
01:15:56,170 --> 01:16:04,690
row and right aligned Marcel and Dale

889
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:06,189
summers this one it takes you know you

890
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:14,769
put in a water to there it's not much

891
01:16:06,189 --> 01:16:16,809
it's like and it's not even maybe five

892
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:18,190
ounces but and the hit on them are just

893
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:19,480
so good there's just something for me

894
01:16:18,189 --> 01:16:21,279
and it's you know maybe it's just my

895
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:26,889
purpose you know Marcel's straight up

896
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:28,238
yeah that's more salt Dale so I don't

897
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:30,219
bring that one out very much it's been

898
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:36,689
sitting around you know almost of these

899
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:40,079
just are sort of in the Volvo yeah you

900

901
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:51,650
it's an older it's an older one anyway

902
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:54,659
