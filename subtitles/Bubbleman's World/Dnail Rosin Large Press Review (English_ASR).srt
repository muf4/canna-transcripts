00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,198
hey guys welcome back to Bubble man's

3
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:28,320
world and I'm finally getting around to

4
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:30,920
play around with the large size press uh

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,640
Rosen press from denail uh you've seen

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,760
the one with the 5x5 plate it's about

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:41,359
that size well this one is the 15 in by

8
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,960
15 in so it's a fairly large unit um

9
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:47,198
it's definitely going to give you a lot

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,439
more area to process a lot more material

11
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:51,399
um I'm not going to go and O do an

12
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,839
overboard review on it today I'm really

13
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:58,000
probably going to focus mostly on hash

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,920
as it's outside and I'm not really

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,439
confident in the whole for butt it's

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,118
very simple you can take a piece of

17
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,920
parchment or you can use an oil slick

18
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,640
and I'm wondering if oil slick is going

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,719
to get in touch with denil and there are

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,040
if they're going to make oil slick pads

21
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,840
in the 5 in x 5 in as well as in a 15in

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,080
x 15 in cuz it would be wonderful just

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,840
to slide that right in there put all

24
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,679
your buds down or your hash your

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,799
envelope however you're going to press

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,439
simply put another one over top and give

27
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,520
it your 10-second press but I do want to

28
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,158
talk a little bit about uh you know

29
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,200
getting this machine getting it out of

30
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,520
the box it's extremely heavy so I really

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,399
would want to warn you guys that uh if

32
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,719
you have any back issues or you have any

33
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,640
sort of uh alements that could be

34
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,560
increased by moving something heavy

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,280
please get help with this unit it is

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,159
awkward uh it's got the top piece here

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,040
that screws down to lower the plate and

38
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,920
because it's not tight because of course

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,360
you need leeway for the plates to move

40
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,000
up and down you get this sort of motion

41
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,359
in the unit so you want to be careful

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,759
with that um once it is on you should

43
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,239
understand that these top and bottom

44
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,560
plates get very hot I've got it at about

45
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:12,079
120 degrees Celsius right now which is

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,878
around 245 to 250 Fahrenheits uh there's

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,400
a whole variety of temperatures that you

48
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:17,239
can use with this unit and I'll talk

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,800
about that a little bit but uh first I

50
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,920
want to really discuss um you know the

51
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,879
getting this out of the box and and

52
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,559
starting to get it working so let me

53
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,560
just turn my phone off and make sure we

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,680
don't get interrupted there so like I

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,479
said you're going to want to figure out

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,480
the perfect distance uh with my smaller

57
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,639
unit because this unit I could literally

58
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,079
close it right right to the bottom and

59
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,839
there's a space here uh about an inch or

60
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,760
two at the back of the unit and it

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,360
allows us a little bit of leeway uh if

62
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,199
we're not getting enough of a press and

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,239
you can

64
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,039
see I'm getting a really good press on

65
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,680
this one so it's it's good enough I

66
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,560
don't need to lower it anymore um it's

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,599
got the two units so here's one of the

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,239
problems that you're going to have with

69
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:59,639
this unit if you're using it at a at a

70
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,599
small house and you're not actually at a

71
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:04,958
car commercial processing facility is

72
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:07,719
the power uh it takes a lot more power

73
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,199
than the smaller unit and uh for example

74
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:12,000
the smaller unit I can plug both sides

75
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,798
into one extension cord and plug it into

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
a plug well with this one if you plug

77
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,640
both of these even onto the same circuit

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,560
in your house you'll most likely blow uh

79
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,119
blow the fuse which I did a couple of

80
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,598
times trying to figure out I have one

81
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,039
plugged in over here with an extension

82
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,479
cord and I have one plugged in uh Fair

83
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:33,959
distance over there so it is much

84
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,438
uh a little bit more um work to figure

85
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,280
out how to get this thing to work you

86
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:38,719
know it might not be a problem for many

87
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,120
of you you might have it all set up with

88
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,199
your power and you've got this plug here

89
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,080
and that plug there and they're on

90
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,399
different circuits perfect uh but do be

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,360
do pay attention to that because it's

92
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,799
something that happened to me um also

93
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,159
like I said very heavy you're going to

94
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,560
want to find out where you want to put

95
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:56,318
this thing and pretty much leave it

96
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,079
there so yeah we've got uh our

97
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:02,280
temperatures up to temperature um I was

98
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:04,959
thinking of of using the oil slicks uh

99
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,598
at pads but you know I think I'm going

100
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,280
to press a good chunk of hash for this

101
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,959
and really sort of uh utilize the

102
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,039
surface area that we have to go with

103
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,319
because you know it's it's the amount of

104
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,399
hash increased isn't the problem on the

105
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:22,079
5x5 I can keep putting more and more and

106
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,359
more and what's what's the problem is is

107
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,800
how far the rosin the

108
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,199
resin excretes out of the hash when

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,918
pressed uh with that little ex amount of

110
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,680
heat it pushes further and further out

111
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:34,519
and what I was Finding was as I started

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,720
going

113
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:39,758
over around 3 or 4 grams I was able to

114
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,120
push the rosin right to the end of the

115
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,800
parchment paper on the 5x5 unit the

116
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,199
small denail press this being the large

117
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,319
denail press I don't think we're going

118
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,400
to have that problem um I guess we could

119
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,038
probably just get right to it so I've

120
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,758
got myself a pressing screen and this is

121
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:57,199
a a pressing screen that's already been

122
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,960
used uh to collect bubble hash and I

123
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,400
found it uh laying around and it was a

124
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,918
little bit dirty

125
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,399
uh and what I did was um it's simply cut

126
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:07,399
in half and I've had the um the piece

127
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,120
removed from the from the edge which is

128
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,560
the rim the the blue uh Rim that went

129
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,120
all the way around there and uh

130
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,000
basically what I did was because it was

131
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,399
very sort of not holding together I just

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,279
folded the end up and I stuck it in the

133
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,599
press and closed it for about 2 seconds

134
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,439
and now you can see that this is nice

135
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,919
it's staying it's staying closed and I

136
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:29,079
so I did it to both ends uh and what it

137
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:30,478
did is is it allowed me to make a little

138
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,399
pouch

139
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,519
uh basically what I'll do once I get a

140
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,679
lot of the bubble in there I'll fold the

141
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:39,198
third side over much like just like that

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,240
I'll have my envelope and I'll be able

143
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,960
to lay it down uh nicely in the

144
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,240
parchment in fact why don't we even get

145
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:50,560
that to go

146
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,280
down just like that there we go it's

147
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,199
actually quite efficient for you know

148
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,239
using none of the pressure whatsoever

149
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,199
just the uh the little bit of heat

150
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,600
that's coming out of

151
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,600
there oh not quite enough

152
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,598
there couple seconds out to do it so

153
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,198
yeah that gives me a nice big unit here

154
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,800
nice big filter bag now you can pick up

155
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,160
these screens right now as blotting

156
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,639
screens pressing screens Rosen screens

157
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,919
we sell them at fresh head.com or bubble

158
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,519
bag.com and of course I share a lot of

159
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:23,000
information with you guys and I'm never

160
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,918
going to be uh uh more happy than if you

161
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,680
if you turn around and support uh

162
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,918
support what I'm doing by supporting my

163
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,680

165
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,478
dollar bang for your buck and uh yeah so

166
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:37,598
you can pick those up what I'm going to

167
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:40,399
do is I'm having my manufacturer develop

168
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:42,038
these small bags like this um we're not

169
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,879
quite sure how we want to do it whether

170
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:45,719
we're going to make them fold in stays

171
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,079
whether we're going to sew them all up

172
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,800
we'll figure out what's going to happen

173
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:54,879
but I want them to come in uh 1 G 5 G 10

174
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,400
G 100 G potentially even 500 G envelopes

175
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,279
and then I also want to have special

176
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:02,318
ones for uh cannabis flowers uh they

177
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,959
won't be quite like a a pouch but maybe

178
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:09,000
more like a tube I found some good luck

179
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,079
in pressing with a tube uh of of screen

180
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,720
I wrap it all up and fill it up with a

181
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:14,758
ground up herb and I've been getting

182
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,479
some decent returns and uh don't get me

183
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,879
wrong after today when you see this and

184
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,038
you're saying oh what about the flowers

185
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,879
are you going to press flowers I will do

186
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,120
some flowers I'll make a little second

187
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,720
review on this for flowers this is the

188
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,598
uh denail large Rosen press uh hash

189
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,080
review so that's what we're going to do

190
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,719
got some beautiful bubble has here uh it

191
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,198
was a gift from a friend these are

192
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,319
breeder Steve strains and uh it's very

193
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,560
gooey and gummy Uh nice quality presses

194
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,439
together good I'd give it about a four

195
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,879
star maybe a three uh in its melt

196
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:50,959
category it was grown Outdoors um a

197
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,199
greenhouse Dash uh field uh and

198
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,918
basically it produced a a very lovely

199
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,639
profile of resin it just wasn't able

200
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:01,240
with the with a Canadian sun to get that

201
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,519
powerful enough boost uh to really push

202
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,639
it over the five and six star uh level

203
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,240
but that's not going to be a problem for

204
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,840
us today we do have the ability to

205
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,879
unveil quality so that's what we're

206
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,959
going to do for you I'm going to take

207
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,080
some of this actually let me go get the

208
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,680
scale because I know you guys are going

209
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,918
to want to know the

210
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,759
amounts all right so I grabbed the scale

211
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,758
grabbed another little dish I am not

212
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:28,080
even sure how much is here it's got to

213
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:30,560
be 40 or 50 g total here I'm not sure if

214
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:34,799
we're going to run it all but but uh

215
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,320
yeah this is about 40 g 40.3 g it's got

216
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,359
a real lovely smell to it think there's

217
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,360
some Blockhead and some sweet skunk and

218
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,080
maybe

219
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,480
some some Plum some some nice varieties

220
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,800
from Steve over the years that these

221
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,800
guys are growing and it's you know it

222
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:51,799
really it really is nice

223
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,360
bubble just not quite at that level for

224
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,519
the bubble connoisseur you know great

225
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,600
stuff for making coconut oil extracts

226
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,200
great stuff for

227
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,759
um all different forms of metes and even

228
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,200
uh the addition of a Remo style

229
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,919
supercharged joint you know great stuff

230
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,519
for such a thing it's not going to melt

231
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,120
up and plug uh plug your whole unit

232
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,200
let's see how much of this we can get

233
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:22,720
into our

234
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,720
little our little our little unit here

235
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,000
well looks like it all went in pretty

236
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,278
nice get that

237
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,958
up yeah that's real

238
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:48,159
lovely so I guess the best bet is to

239
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:52,039
sort of get it all

240
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:55,278
even so it's there's no empty spots in

241
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:55,278
the packet

242
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,159
all

243
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,639
right a little little bit of a hand

244
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:12,879
press

245
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,759
and let's see we got the Mother Ship I

246
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,480
guess we'll wait till we press some of

247
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,720
this loveliness and then we'll have a

248
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,720
little a little a little

249
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,160
dab

250
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,040
so let me get

251
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:31,319
this open to the

252
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:33,240
desired size these uh dils are very much

253
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,920
the size of the parchment paper so it

254
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,919
becomes quite

255
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,700
convenient

256
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,959
D all right there's

257
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,560
[Music]

258
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:56,439
one see if we can't feed that in it

259
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,759
becomes a bit of a a funny thing when

260
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,959
you start playing around with this

261
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:03,120
parchment that it starts rolling like

262
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:04,099
that so it actually becomes the smallest

263
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,600
bit of a

264
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,959
[Music]

265
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,800
challenge to get it

266
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,958
in and then get it

267
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,399
straightened which I just apply the

268
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,479
smallest amount of heat I don't want to

269
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,679
apply too much and put uh any sort of

270
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,000
ripples in the in the material but you

271
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,278
might as well get the machine working

272
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,480
for

273
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,039
you and uh this is just one of the

274
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,519
things that I find is very convenient

275
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,799
about it that that little bit of prep

276
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,240
and heat I mean it's basically a large

277
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,240
iron so you put yourself in a situation

278
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,399
where if something's rolled off if if

279
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,839
your screen won't close well I mean one

280
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,600
of the things I found amazing with these

281
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,760
screens is if I take the smallest amount

282
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,120
of rosin and I clip it on each corner I

283
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,679
I didn't have to do it with this because

284
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,078
there was actually resin present on this

285
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:52,399
screen already so the minute I just

286
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,719
heated it up the slightest bit that

287
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,879
resin warmed up and sort of became uh

288
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,800
like a glue that's holding my screen

289
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,759
together and I definitely uh that's

290
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,240
about the only only kind of glue I don't

291
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,958
mind

292
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,200
personally so let me just get one more

293
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:10,039
piece of this cut off for you

294
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,959
guys and I'm using unbleached part

295
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:14,838
parchment

296
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:17,039
paper this is another uh issue that many

297
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,440
people have been discussing uh we've

298
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,198
been discussing it on hash Church all

299
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,839
the different sort of footprints and the

300
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:24,078
sort of different things that can be

301
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,959
present in all the different products

302
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,879
pay attention be conscious you know

303
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,958
learn if you learn something it's okay

304
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,399
to uh admit that you didn't know it

305
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,799
before and that now you're going to do

306
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,600
your best to uh to try and keep things

307
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:38,000
as safe as possible and that's you know

308
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,079
from the example of saying use using a

309
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,399
very bleached uh parchment paper not

310
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:45,759
really the best

311
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,440
idea um especially with the heat

312
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,639
transfer you don't want to be

313
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,199
transferring uh something like

314
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:56,320
bleach

315
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:59,919
so I think we got these about sorted out

316
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,079
here all right nice big size there

317
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:05,159
get them semi ready like I said I'm

318
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:07,719
going to give just a little bit of a

319
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,278
press and I know this table's probably

320
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,879
making you guys nervous with the

321
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,720
mothership and

322
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,480
the and the denail Press it's got a tiny

323
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,199
little bit of motion but I promise you

324
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm paying very careful attention uh so

325
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,919
I've got this organized uh so when I

326
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,760
press it I showed you a little earlier

327
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,679
there's four screws four Springs on each

328
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,679
side and you know you could get this to

329
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:30,958
a point where it becomes so difficult to

330
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,599
to to Clos that it's actually close to a

331
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,638
danger especially if you do get it

332
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,720
closed when you open it back up the

333
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,079
whole unit will tend to PO uh jump up

334
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,000
like a like a little frog so be careful

335
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:44,120
about that as well um I have a good

336
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,399
maximum pressure going uh but I

337
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,519
certainly wouldn't uh you know suggest

338
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,360
to people that uh that they go too far

339
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,240
with the pressure um I think that the

340
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,959
safer units will be the pneumatic

341
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,399
presses the hydraulic presses that have

342
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:02,439
you know either air or hydraulic that

343
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,799
allow to get that much more

344
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,279
pressure uh when you when you close it

345
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,758
and some of these units work with a

346
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,919
single button or two buttons that you

347
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,360
push together so quite a nice uh uh

348
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:17,319
alternative so here we go my single

349
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,839
largest press of rosin ever uh 40 G of

350
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,560
bubble hash and what we're going to do

351
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,160
is we're going to get this in here

352
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,078
first nice big thing in

353
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:31,838
there and then

354
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:31,838
we'll let's see what we can do here with

355
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,198
this all right there we

356
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:44,439
go get this one on top of

357
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:48,719
that my first time actually doing this

358
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,720
but it seems to be okay

359
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,799
working all right guys we got this on

360
00:14:52,519 --> 00:15:00,039
the 10sec timer let's give it a

361
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:02,639
shot here we go

362
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:07,838
you can hear it sizzling beautifully

363
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:10,360
seven six five four three two one boom

364
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,399
you feel that boom snap up when it pops

365
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,480
up all right so let's check that

366
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:19,480
out Oho

367
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:22,120
yeah that is just lovely try to hold

368
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,839
that up for you guys to see it's really

369
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,440
quite

370
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,959
something boom and I would say that that

371
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,959
why don't I slowly start collecting it

372
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,039
and we want to make sure because we're

373
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:40,279
outside in the in the wind here that

374
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,399
none of this blows away of

375
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:44,720
course

376
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,198
so now this is a fair amount of Ros and

377
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,680
what I think I'm going to do is uh I'll

378
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,679
collect it off camera I don't want you

379
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:52,039
hearing the sticky ticky tacky I will

380
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:54,159
give you a few options for how you can

381
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,078
clean this up uh you can put these in

382
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,159
the

383
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,159
freezer get that out of there actually

384
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:03,159
while it's still nice and warm that's

385
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:08,480
one good idea actually to do if you

386
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:11,559
can uh get your packet moved away from

387
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,680
the resin God is that beautiful look at

388
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:17,198
this guys you see that really beautiful

389
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,599
I don't have the most amount of room

390
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:21,439
here so I'm going to have to put this

391
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,199
over here for now I can tell that

392
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,240
there's still lots more gooey goodness

393
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:29,599
left in there so I probably haven't

394
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,759
gotten quite my 50% but

395
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,680
man I got to show that to you guys

396
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:39,560
again there's a nice big driet of

397
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:41,559
rosin and you can see uh I will of

398
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,399
course take some macro photographs of

399
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:47,278
this I know you guys appreciate the

400
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:49,240
macro photographs and uh well you know

401
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,240
what I think I'm going to do is I think

402
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:57,278
I'm going to put this right

403
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,029
here and go for another shot this time I

404
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,278
use a single piece

405
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:02,078
[Music]

406
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:05,880
all right so let's try this

407
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:08,159
again grab this gooey Ooey packet of

408
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,079
goodness slap it right down into the

409
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,519
middle actually got a wasp floating

410
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,798
around the rosin right now he looks

411
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:17,959
quite interested in this process he's

412
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,480
probably like all of you he's been

413
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,880
watching the internet he's been paying

414
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,759
attention to the hype and he wants to

415
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,039
know should I get a rosin press all

416
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,038
right

417
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:34,160
so there we go go press down on that bad

418
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,319
boy I've got the 10-second timer set

419
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,320
which is very cool uh it just counts

420
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:42,480
down the minute the actual unit hits

421
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,480
that was 10 seconds give it a few more

422
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,200
shots

423
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Booyah all right and not to

424
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:56,918
disappoint she squeezed out another

425
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,919
great amount

426
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,599
so I'm going to clean clean these up

427
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,880
real quick all right guys so I'm going

428
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,439
to share a little bit of this with you

429
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,600
just cuz uh it's easy and quick uh I

430
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,519
went and found a marble Slinger pendant

431
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,279
that he did years ago for me actually

432
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,079
this is the bubble man marble Slinger

433
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,200
pendant and uh I just you know I've seen

434
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:19,399
people doing it with the GL uh the glass

435
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,960
online and I knew it would be easy but

436
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,360
I'm not sure if you can see this middle

437
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,240
section here how it's this really light

438
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,879
it's the greasy stuff that's usually the

439
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,839
hardest to pick up well this is picking

440
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,960
it up absolutely

441
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:36,759
simplistically so if you've got any

442
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,038
glass I can show you right here the the

443
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:41,480
shape isn't even that important I could

444
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,319
easily uh move the glass uh at an angle

445
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,519
and use more if I want but I'm finding

446
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,119
that the edge is quite efficient but

447
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,639
watch the speed in which I can pick this

448
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,639
rosin up

449
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:08,038
I think if I had a frame holding this

450
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:08,038
Rosen paper down I could do things even

451
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:12,678
faster tiny little piece broke free

452
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:26,038
there all right well that is very

453
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:28,440
rewarding how well that cleaned the

454
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:30,879
parchment uh even still I can go over it

455
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,200
and grab those last little remnants and

456
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,799
basically clean this parchment up to a

457
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,720
like new substance nice little bit of

458
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:41,000
rosin sitting on there why don't we move

459
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,798
into uh our second

460
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,480
sheet fold this one out of the way as we

461
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,000
will be using it again and I want to get

462
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,120
the stickiness that's on the back of

463
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,919
this unit onto the front of this unit so

464
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:58,319
here we have a beautiful uh really

465
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,880
really nice results for this particular

466
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,240
bat

467
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,240
let me

468
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,279
get God the feeling of this is just

469
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,558
incredible I wish I could describe it

470
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:18,079
picking up literally grams if not an

471
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,839
ounce or more of of rosin off of the

472
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,960
sheet I mean wellow this is probably at

473
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,558
10 gam and the other one was maybe five

474
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:28,000
G and eventually we could uh we could

475
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:30,440
get up to the Ounce at a shot we'll see

476
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,240
what happens we still have more uh

477
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,558
ability to press what we have as well so

478
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,558
we'll see what happens with

479
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:42,720
that just go across

480
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,038
this front of the page here now I think

481
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,120
the best way to remove this rosin will

482
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:52,319
be to hold uh I'll probably hold the

483
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:55,839
glass uh much like this and then just

484
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:58,599
heat it up so uh the rosin can drip off

485
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,000
onto uh or maybe I'll even crack it off

486
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:03,079
once it's cold I don't know either or

487
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,400
that's a really nice uh chunk of rosin

488
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:09,960
right there and that's only the first

489
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,278
two complete so let's see what we got

490
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,278
over

491
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,480
here oh that just looks

492
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,759
great doesn't that look

493
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:28,400
great in the

494
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,400
sun all right so

495
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,679
cleaned up uh a lot nicer this time

496
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:36,400
around still a little bit of resin on

497
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:37,960
the edge of this uh of this guy here but

498
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,559
um you can see here how in the center

499
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,200
it's cleaned up really really nice not

500
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:45,558
leaving too too much rosin on the one

501
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,038
side of the parchment but leaving a very

502
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:49,038
nice amount on the other side

503
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:59,079
so all right I'm kind of getting almost

504
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:01,759
too much rosin on here now it's starting

505
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:06,079
to get a little bit tacky for

506
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,079
me grab the last little bit of

507
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:16,519
this oh yeah this is getting way tack

508
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:20,120
you're going to have to change change my

509
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:23,440
format change my technique I'm now doing

510
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:26,079
the the quick pull which is uh what I

511
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,880
usually do uh when it's not working the

512
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,038
wiping technique sometimes when you go

513
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,240
to wipe

514
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,679
you're just not going to get the love

515
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,599
that you're looking for that's not a

516
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,000
problem change it up real quick and you

517
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:42,558
can be just as efficient uh with your

518
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,159
cleanup now imagine if I used a small uh

519
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:48,000
titanium you know Dabber to try and pick

520
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:50,480
all this up that is a lot of rosin as

521
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,359
you can see it is now completely covered

522
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,319
the

523
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:57,199
pendant

524
00:22:53,319 --> 00:23:00,200
so let's see what we can do

525
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,600
here get a little bit more here this

526
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,720
other side was not cleaned as as well as

527
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:06,480
I would have liked it to be I did take

528
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,440
just a few macro photographs of the

529
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,038
rosin to give you an idea of the

530
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,679
quality let's get that

531
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:18,158
closed and there we go there we

532
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:20,679
go a nice chunk of rosin by anyone's

533
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,960
standards all right guys so uh I've been

534
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:27,600
collecting I got just over 13 G uh here

535
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,480
you can see it's uh quite thick I'm

536
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,319
going to press it out in a few seconds

537
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,519
here I'll get it flattened out so it

538
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:36,319
looks like a nice big uh half ounce that

539
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,400
it is uh we used 40 G you know I forgot

540
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,319
that the hash we used was a lower grade

541
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,240
than my uh the stuff that I'm using my

542
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,399
fourstar that usually gives me about 50

543
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:49,319
to 55% this stuff actually gives me uh

544
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:56,600
closer to 33 to 35% return uh we've got

545
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:58,439
13 G so far I just pressed uh a third

546
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:01,038
let's get that open oh wow that's cra

547
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,720
cracking off very

548
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,879
cool uh this is a small batch I don't

549
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,798
think there's much more than maybe a

550
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,400
gram or two there uh what I have done is

551
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:11,079
I and I want to talk about a little bit

552
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,720
while uh before I finish the review here

553
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:17,519
is the the act of collecting um I did go

554
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,159
and grab my little bubble man uh pendant

555
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,879
I know they also have these big stamps

556
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,600
that people are using glass stamps with

557
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,919
a large glass bottom that you can just

558
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:28,439
sort of do this too uh great idea uh if

559
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,600
you don't have access to that um and in

560
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,080
particular if you've already pressed

561
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,558
your material a few times and you're

562
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:34,119
getting towards the end of the press and

563
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,720
you're leaving it a little bit longer

564
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:39,759
excessing more heat um you can end up

565
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,240
getting a material that comes out a lot

566
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:46,759
less stable than the original batches

567
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:49,120
this is very stable very hard uh very

568
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:51,278
thick the last little batch here that

569
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,839
came out was a little less than stable

570
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,919
uh I can still get it collected uh if I

571
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,720
have a trick up my sleeve so what I have

572
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,120
done is I brought one of these uh cold

573
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,558
freuds it's a for paramedics actually

574
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,119
reusable hot and cold compress and it's

575
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,918
been in my freezer and what I do with

576
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:12,439
this is um how I like to collect with

577
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:14,600
this is simply uh I use a Dabber for

578
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,720
this particular batch and I don't leave

579
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:19,119
it on this thing because it'll get so

580
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,640
cold that as you start collecting it

581
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,359
exactly what it's doing it just starts

582
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,200
cracking uh and flicking the stuff away

583
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:30,199
so what I do is literally move that out

584
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,240
of the way get your thing back onto your

585
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,240
paper and once you've cooled it a little

586
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,839
bit then you can go and do some

587
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,200
collecting and now it's just picking up

588
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,599
like uh nobody's business beautiful

589
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,440
beautiful pickup job so don't be too

590
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,719
tripped out if you end up with a sappy

591
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,120
material you've been you've been

592
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,079
pressing hard uh and you can't collect

593
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:50,319
it you might think that you can put it

594
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,158
in the freezer uh get it all Frozen and

595
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,678
then try to collect it I find it that is

596
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,600
a little a little more difficult than

597
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,159
the Simplicity of using a cold plate

598
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,599
underneath something cold underneath

599
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:01,039
even frozen peas for God's sakes uh just

600
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,678
something that you can put underneath to

601
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,519
give it that little bit of cold so uh

602
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,000
when you go back to collect it uh you

603
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,879
don't have any problems this is

604
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,319
collecting really nice just collected a

605
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,039
whole chunk of that parchment right

606
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,000
there nice little

607
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:19,759
dab Mountain Man dab maybe not not me

608
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,038
not me dab but uh I you know I don't

609
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,798
have a problem with people doing huge

610
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,558
dabs I mean why not if that's if that's

611
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:28,398
what you do and that's your thing then

612
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:30,599
uh you know that's fine I uh I'm good

613
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:32,479
with that I personally like to take uh

614
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,480
many many dabs throughout the day uh

615
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,319
more efficient in size than you know

616
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,839
giant large huge grams but dude I

617
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:41,359
straight up applaud those that want to

618
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:44,000
have fun and are blasting uh uh big

619
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,038
monster rips uh through their rigs good

620
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,480
for you so I'm going to have to get back

621
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:51,759
onto this coolness here just for a

622
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,599
little bit and it just gives me just the

623
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:57,119
tiniest bit of cold and lets me collect

624
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:58,759
the resin without uh without it greasing

625
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,239
up and wanting to stay behind on the

626
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:05,720
parchment paper uh I'm just using a a

627
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:07,720
task Rock uh Highly Educated uh Dabber

628
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,880
and carb cap to pick this up right now

629
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,919
and uh mostly what you do is you collect

630
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,200
the resin on top of itself so as it

631
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,720
starts building uh you can you can

632
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,960
actually just start rolling it much like

633
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,079
a ball and the minute it starts getting

634
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,759
too tacky just go right back over to

635
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:25,558
your cold plate or your you know

636
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,359
whatever you have that's giving you that

637
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:29,839
access to immediately a different

638
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:32,839
temperature because this stuff is very

639
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:35,959
very sensitive to temperature changes

640
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:38,918
all right so there we got half of that

641
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,360
done get another side I'm suspecting

642
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:44,200
this will be at least a couple of more

643
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:48,719
grams get us uh up to 15 grams for uh

644
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,278
for the total uh return on 40 G of uh

645
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,600
you know pretty pretty nice bubble like

646
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:56,200
I said it wasn't melt it was definite no

647
00:27:52,599 --> 00:28:00,000
melt but uh the really nice flavors uh

648
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,720
well grown just not grown to that final

649
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,558
fruition that uh you know us as the hash

650
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,839
lover as the connoisseurs uh like to see

651
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:09,359
but what a beautiful thing that rosin is

652
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,918
what a beautiful thing that denail has

653

done to come out with these modified

654
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,480
t-shirt presses with denail standards

655
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,840
denail customer service and uh you know

656
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,120
hopefully sooner than later we'll be

657
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,879
supplying them with some pressing

658
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:24,599
screens if not please you know it's

your social media is um how we get out

678
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,000
there my social media only takes me to

679
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,080
you but you take me to the rest of the

680
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
world so much appreciated I'm going to

681
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:16,558
continue here collecting this last

682
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,159
little bit I'm going to have to uh go

683
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,720
through my macro photographs I didn't

684
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,640
take as many as you guys probably would

685
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,399
have liked but I got a nice three or

686
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,440
four that can show you the quality of

687
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:27,518
what was pressed here uh maybe I'll

688
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,200
throw in a little I guess the Melt video

689
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,399
is not as exciting with rosin because it

690
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,640
it's it's an oil it's not a hash so once

691
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,079
you've created it as an oil of course

692
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,919
it's going to have a melt factor of

693
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,720
seven star because well oil is a

694
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:42,679
material that melts every time every

695
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,399
single time in fact I've never seen oil

696
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:50,080
in my life but didn't

697
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:50,079
melt so there we go

698
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:57,839
collected another couple of jebs we get

699
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:59,439
that on the scale real quick we'll take

700
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:03,000
a a final

701
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,038
dab let me get the denail on

702
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,759
here that brought

703
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,519
over always nice to have a oil slick to

704
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,398
put your pipe down I hate that sound of

705
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:14,278
putting the pipe down on uh on something

706
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:15,918
that's uh a hard substance that you

707
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:18,119
haven't uh that you're not paying

708
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,200
attention to and it gives that that hard

709
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,518
that sound that glass sound that you put

710
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,440
down so shout out to oil slick for

711
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:26,679
hooking it up uh saving bongs one bong

712
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,519
at a

713
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:31,278
time all right all right so obviously

714
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:32,960
for a process like this the less heat

715
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,000
the better I'm just heating up the uh

716
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,038
tip of the

717
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,480
um all right let's see what we got

718
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:42,480
here what's the final number going to

719
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:50,359
be final number is

720
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:54,159
13.9 13.9 so let's have a dab of it

721
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:54,158
because I'm sure it's wonderful

722
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:05,519
oh yeah nice long elongated let's see

723
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:09,480
make sure we're up here

724
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,720
300 well let's just collect that all up

725
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,558
and we'll wait a few more seconds for

726
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,000
that to get up to

727
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:18,879
temperature God it looks like beautiful

728
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,679
bubble uh bubble rosin I should say uh

729
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,000
the bubble hash was a variety of 120

730
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:25,240
Micron through 73 so there was 73 uh 90

731
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,359
Micron and

732
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:31,359
120 present in that bubble hash we

733
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:34,918
squeezed it through a 25 micron screen

734
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:37,638
uh all 40 gram of it and uh well we

735
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,880
ended up with uh so far 13 G I think I'm

736
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:41,519
going to be able to squeeze a couple

737
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,799
more grams out just by giving uh what

738
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,519
I'll probably do is I'll open this up

739
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,200
I'll remove it from the large screen

740
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,278
that it's in and I'm going to fold it

741
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,278
upon itself to get it a little bit

742
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:55,079
thicker I'll put it in a separate size

743
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:58,038
screen and I'll squeeze that through and

744
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:00,199
see if I can't get anything more so here

745
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:00,200
we

746
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:29,520
go yes I like

747
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:32,839
that I'm going to turn this guy off here

748
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,960
[Laughter]

749
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:38,038
here want to thank you guys for watching

750
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,919
if you guys have any questions please uh

751
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:42,119
comment in the comments below I'll try

752
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,759
to answer as many as I can I do miss

753
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:46,759
some comments here and there but uh all

754
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:49,638
in all a great unit just a few key

755
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:51,158
things to keep in touch uh in mind don't

756
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:54,759
plug them into the same circuit in your

757
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,399
house or your your uh commercial Place

758
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,359
make sure you don't tighten the unit so

759
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:01,119
hard that when you go to close close it

760
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:03,558
it's barely able to open uh we don't

761
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:06,038
want to see that and otherwise just uh

762
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:07,519
you know keep your temperatures down uh

763
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:11,398
experiment you can experiment with

764
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,519
temperatures as low as 90 Celsius uh and

765
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:16,638
go up to uh or 80 Celsius for that

766
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,319
matter and go up to 120 130 celsus now

767
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:21,879
in Fahrenheit that's going to be around

768
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:24,359
190 Fahrenheit uh upwards or 180

769
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,200
Fahrenheit upwards to around

770
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,479
250 personally what I find is when I'm

771
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,519
uh extracting from hash I like to keep

772
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,440
my temperatures a little bit lower and

773
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,558
when I'm extracting with uh cannabis I

774
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,720
usually keep them a little bit higher

775
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:41,359
however for this experiment I actually

776
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,200
pressed this at the temperature that I

777
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:47,918
normally press cannabis at it was around

778
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,880
245° F little bit warmer than usual uh I

779
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,200
do have some of this hash that I'll be

780
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,760
able to compare to the uh rosin oil I

781
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,519
should say I have some uh that I made

782
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,879
some time ago and I'll compare it I'll

783
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,200
compare compare the colors I'll compare

784
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,480
the tastes uh see if uh the tarpine

785
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,480
profile was that greatly affected uh by

786
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,599
the excess Heat and the only thing I'd

787
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,519
really add is that if you get yourself a

788
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:13,358
little laser temperature and you close

789
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:15,838
this up and you get you're at say 250°

790
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,358
fah uh and you pull the thing out like

791
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,440
right away and hit it with the

792
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:23,159
temperature you'll notice that the oil

793
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,440
itself is going to be closer to around

794
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,919
90 to

795
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:32,918
120° Celsius so uh sorry not Celsius but

796
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:35,000
Fahrenheit 100 150 tops so it's all

797
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:36,679
interesting we're learning every day uh

798
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,079
I definitely want to hear from you guys

799
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,280
and if you have any more questions like

800
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,359
I said just answer them in the comments

801
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,639
and uh yeah that was uh the denail

802
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:49,598
review we ended up with just over 13 gam

803
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,919
um half ounce made it in a very short

804
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,039
time compared to the video I did with

805
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:56,000
d420 K and uh the how I'm going to leave

806
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:58,320
you is

807
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,079
simply by pressing out this little bit

808
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,640
of rosin that we have here and showing

809
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:07,560
you uh what it looks like uh you know

810
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:10,199
not in a giant Puck so let's see if we

811
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:12,759
can't it's interesting to learn how to

812
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:15,399
uh how to work with this stuff as well

813
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,240
like after you know for me not having

814
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,400
worked with uh oil for so so long and I

815
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,279
I know a lot of you consider this stuff

816
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,119
to be hash but I really still call it

817
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,119
oil I'm not sure if uh that's very

818
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:30,240
important or not the aspect of uh

819
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,920
whether or not we're going to be calling

820
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,319
this oil or hash but I'm old school I go

821
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,599
with uh what the old school guys were

822
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,039
saying and when I see Robert conel Clark

823
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:42,079
uh explaining the differences between

824
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:43,480
oil and hash in um in hashish it just

825
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,400
leads me to believe that there are

826
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,559
indeed um some differences between oil

827
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,559
and

828
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:57,559
hashish all right there we go guys

829
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,239
give thanks for the Ros and press uh

830
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:09,960
really appreciate uh the kindness of

831
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:11,959
denail sending these out for me to test

832
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,280
and uh you know so far the the small

833
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,318
unit I've absolutely loved it uh I love

834
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,519
the ability to CL plug it into the same

835
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:20,279
plug uh but this unit is a whole

836
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,719
different ball game you really could see

837
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,480
how you could get your production game

838
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:26,919
on with one of these things and uh see

839
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,960
if we can't get this open here it's so

840
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,960
nice to have this cold uh pack here

841
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,199
because you just you give this a little

842
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,880
a little press just to uh you know get

843
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,879
it get it a

844
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:43,279
little

845
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,079
woooo I want to get that bottom half a

846
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,480
little cooler top half removed real nice

847
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,720
but that bottom half Is Still Still

848
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,719
Holding On just a little

849
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,880
bit there we

850
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,800
go all right guys

851
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,760
thanks for watching Bubble man's world I

852
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,760
will leave you with the

853
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,800
rosin hey guys so I turned the unit back

854
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:17,880
on um I had my 13 plus Gams I was doing

855
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,480
the math it just didn't seem like enough

856
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,240
what I realized is I hadn't shown you

857
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,920
what the hash looked like on the inside

858
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,679
of the screen and I sort of wanted to

859
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,200
show you guys that so when I opened it I

860
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,960
noticed that uh right away a lot of it

861
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:34,559
looked very like almost this palish tan

862
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,039
color almost uh not white but whitish

863
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:37,318
and it sort of shows that oh

864
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:39,559
everything's almost out of here but when

865
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:41,480
I opened it further in the inside

866
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:44,078
trapped between the two layers of very

867
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,039
very dry material uh was still what I

868
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,640
would consider a decent amount of resin

869
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:52,759
so I turned the unit back on I just

870
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:56,318
literally did another press which uh you

871
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:59,440
can see right here is uh is decent

872
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:59,440
substantial even

873
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:04,639
oops I'm getting some problems here with

874
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,680
this

875
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,400
parchment I'm going to have to open it

876
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:10,000
up again with the co with the help of

877
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,680
the cold

878
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,559
so always best to not forget this thing

879
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:18,799
it's uh it's extremely

880
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,639
convenient so yeah sometimes if that

881
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,240
stuff's not opening properly this looked

882
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,639
really greasy I did have to use a little

883
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:26,199
bit of excess heat to get at it but uh I

884
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:28,639
suspect there's another couple of grams

885
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:30,239
there at least a gr and if I were to

886
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,719
press it maybe one or two more times I

887
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,639
could squeeze another gram out each time

888
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:36,439
just having to use more pressure I did

889
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,239
press it off camera but I had tightened

890
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,960
it even more you should have seen the

891
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,799
way this thing kicked up when I uh

892
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,480
lifted it up it felt uh like I won't be

893
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,119
doing that again going to open it up

894
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,760
just a tiny little bit on the back here

895
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:50,599
and

896
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,440
uh last little bit

897
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:55,318
of the

898
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,838
way better to be safer than Sor I

899
00:38:55,318 --> 00:39:00,400
suppose that came off quite nice so you

900
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,759
see another big nice press through the

901
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,880
XL uh the thing about that's really nice

902
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,319
about this is that I would have be hard

903
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,000
set to do this in my smaller unit uh I

904
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:11,679
was nowhere near uh you know 40 G I was

905
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,880
pressing four and five grams and it was

906
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,159
already starting to uh oh yeah that's

907
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,200
starting to feel better now it's

908
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:20,039
starting to feel a lot less sticky than

909
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:23,199
it's been there is a couple of sticky

910
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:25,639
spots in each middle uh and we'll get to

911
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,799
those let's see if we can't clean this

912
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:30,039
up nice and quick this stuff just turns

913
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,760
to shatter almost immediately uh upon

914
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:34,759
the contact with the cold in larger

915
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,040
amounts it'll stay together yeah now

916
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,640
it's just shattering we'll just take it

917
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:43,838
off and put it on the oil slick a little

918
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:46,199
bit picking it up here with the

919
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,838
uh Highly

920
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:50,199
Educated

921
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,599
gabber this why I was rolling it around

922
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:53,279
and then it gets to a point where all of

923
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,960
a sudden it won't roll anymore and it's

924
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,720
uh you know the the power of the oil

925
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,000
overtakes

926
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:03,639
uh the the weakness of the parchment so

927
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,358
just be careful and be patient as I said

928
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:08,318
that a piece of rosin just jumped up

929
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:10,559
onto my

930
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,519
wrist but yeah be patient in your

931
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,880
collection this is actually quite a bit

932
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:16,119
I'd say this is going to be another

933
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,720
couple of grams so I'm feeling better

934
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:21,358
about that already I've gotten my

935
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:22,559
returns up uh in the 30 percentile 30 to

936
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,679
35

937
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:29,639
anyway and uh that is a lot better so

938
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:33,000
never jump the gun and throw your your

939
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:34,480
end product away always always well it

940
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,519
doesn't take a brain surgeon to believe

941
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,199
when you when you open it up and you see

942
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:39,679
that it's gummy and sticky this is not

943
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:41,480
what it's supposed to look like so for

944
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:42,960
people that don't know that that's

945
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,719
something that you can learn of value

946
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,119
right here in right now uh when the

947
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,679
material is done hash in particular it

948
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,079
really won't have any stick left to it

949
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,078
uh you'll be able to you'll be able to

950
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:54,839
know that you got everything out and as

951
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:56,800
long as you're doubting and you're

952
00:40:54,838 --> 00:41:00,239
thinking I don't think I got everything

953
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,400
out you probably didn't so uh go with

954
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:05,479
that and uh get back to your press and

955
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,480
uh give it another shot each time like I

956
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,280
say you can experiment around with the

957
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,800
different amounts of heat that you're

958
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,760
using the amounts of pressure that

959
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,800
you're

960
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,839
using all right so I did bring the ra

961
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,839
the rosin is over

962
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,720
here kind of wouldn't mind finding out

963
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:24,719
what the excess extra is that we got on

964
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:29,960
here all right

965
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,680
right actually I don't need to do that I

966
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,119
never have in the past I've always just

967
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:37,960
closed it it's the beauty of rosin and

968
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,519
just pulled them pull the

969
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,559
pin usually twist it a few times just so

970
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:44,838
it doesn't hold on to a lot of excess

971
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:49,838
but there we go let's see what we got

972
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:51,679
there two G 1.9 G so that was a good

973
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,239
press you know leaving that behind could

974
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,239
have uh well would have been

975
00:41:54,239 --> 00:42:00,000
detrimental this is another great way to

976
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:03,519
clean uh Raw rosin up using itself as

977
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,639
the main clean you got rosin on the

978
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,318
sides of your parchment paper you can

979
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:11,400
clean it up pretty good like

980
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:11,400
this let's see what we got

981
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,760
here all

982
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,760
righty beautiful

983
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,599
beautiful get that back in there this is

984
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,720
too hot right now but eventually once I

985
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,359
turn this uh uh back down uh you know

986
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:36,399
quite a bit like uh it really only needs

987
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,960
to be warm rather than hot uh and I just

988
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,240
will give it another little press and

989
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,159
turn it into one solid piece but I think

990
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:46,759
for now we really are going to have to

991
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,759
hit another batch of rosin see how that

992
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,000
goes all

993
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,160
right loosen this a little bit

994
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:04,679
there we go fairly hard you can always

995
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:06,639
lower it and and raise it with this

996
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:09,318
piece here but obviously not when you're

997
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:09,318
in the middle of a

998
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,078
press there we

999
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:23,239
go here we go

1000
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:25,599
again get that on the on the cool plate

1001
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:28,118
and I suspect this is uh really getting

1002
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,359
down to it now maybe a gram there maybe

1003
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:32,720
a half gram every little bit helps I'm

1004
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,880
certainly not going to say no to it I

1005
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,879
will continue to collect this and once

1006
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,079
I've got it collected uh next we're

1007
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,960
going to open up the packet uh the

1008
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,800
screen uh envelope and we'll uh we'll

1009
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,880
see if we can't show you what's inside

1010
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,240
over a/ ounce 15.5 G I added all the

1011
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,680
extra right here it was actually a

1012
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:54,039
little bit more than I thought I was

1013
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,318
going to get but the part I really was

1014
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:59,199
interested in doing with you guys is

1015
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:02,440
showing you what's in in here so um you

1016
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:04,558
can tell uh close up I'll bring it to

1017
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:07,318
you uh you can see that there's a little

1018
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,079
bit of resin here but for the most part

1019
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:11,400
the screen is actually fairly clean

1020
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:13,359
there's some here as well and this is

1021
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,358
old resin that was on there earlier that

1022
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:16,920
I mentioned so if we flip it over to the

1023
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,960
other side we got the same thing we got

1024
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,760
these two Center batches and that's

1025
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,639
where the resin was really feeding out

1026
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,079
but you could see that the rest of the

1027
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:27,679
screen maintained quite a beautiful

1028
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,559
Clarity so these two little spots in the

1029
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,679
center tell me that there's the tiniest

1030
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:33,200
bit more resin for me to acquire but I

1031
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,719
did want to kind of open this up a

1032
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:39,598
little bit and show

1033
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:41,558
you what is inside of here so you can

1034
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,240
see how that little bit of resin that I

1035
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:45,760
put on there at the start really closed

1036
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:48,078
that up nicely and that was a a little

1037
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,119
bit of bubble Ingenuity I love to hear

1038
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,200
what you've done with bubble uh I've

1039
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:53,519
done a few varieties of funny things one

1040
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:56,318
time I got myself out of a locked

1041
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:59,358
bathroom in Jamaica using bubble and

1042
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:01,358
some other things so there it is that's

1043
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:03,480
what it looks like right there you can

1044
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:06,159
see towards the

1045
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,920
edge that it's quite done and then as

1046
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:09,879
you go into the

1047
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,440
middle right you go into the middle and

1048
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,880
you can see there's still some resin in

1049
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,280
there there's still some good gooey

1050
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,519
goodness so I'm going to continue on

1051
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,400
pressing this um uh it's not going to be

1052
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:22,400
part of the review I will let you know

1053
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,160
in the comments section but uh I've

1054
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,720
already gone overboard on this video and

1055
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,000
extended it longer than I thought I

1056
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:30,879
would by coming back and doing the rest

1057
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,880
but uh there you have it guys denail

1058
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,440
press large in the house um I got to

1059
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,880
give it uh I got to give it a couple of

1060
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,599
thumbs up for certain it's definitely an

1061
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,000
a uh efficient unit if any of you

1062
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,160
realized the last time d420 K and I did

1063
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,280
a video uh where it was turning uh you

1064
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:53,078
know the half ounce into uh uh or an

1065
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,440
ounce 30 gr into a half ounce uh that

1066
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:57,519
was a much nicer bubble uh that took us

1067
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,000
almost 3 hours using hair straighteners

1068
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:00,159
two of us we both ended up kind of

1069
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,838
giving ourselves a little bit of a

1070
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:04,480
shoulder injury on it it was kind of

1071
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:06,199
ridiculous so if you're finding yourself

1072
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,400
with a with an injury due to a hair

1073
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:10,759
straightener uh this unit is definitely

1074
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,760
going to be for you so thanks for

1075
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,359
watching Bubble man's world everyone and

1076
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,920
uh we will look forward to seeing you

1077
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:17,920
all next time

1078
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:30,979
