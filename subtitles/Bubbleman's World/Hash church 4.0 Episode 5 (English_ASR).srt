30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,960
first time at skunkman Sam's apartment

31
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,280

32
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,559
a nice dinner so thank you Sam for that

another a nice little chat and the other

36
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,078
day when I was thinking about what we

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,040
were going to chat about for whatever

38
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:47,359
reason it came to me that we are not an

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,880
industry we are a community and that was

40
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,519
sort of the conversation starting point

41
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:54,158
I thought that we would have uh this

42
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:57,478
morning I know it'll head in a whole

43
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:01,240
variety of directions but uh yeah we are

44
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,959
not a an just an industry we are also a

45
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:05,759
community and a lot of the people who

46
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,639
are in the room right now really have

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,439
fought for that Community um more than

48
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,518
more than more than most so hats off all

49
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:17,840

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,800
so many years ago sort of the yeah uh

53
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,360
the kind of the Awakening part of the

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,560

59
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,639
little

60
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:50,959
hat well I think a lot of us are

61
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:53,158
Community but I think the industry is

62
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,039
you're surfing and growing stronger and

63
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:57,759
stronger only some of those have

64
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:01,199
community links to be honest sure

65
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:04,560
because that's any corporate State ah

66
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:07,199
there you go where's my red hat got my

67
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,719
frian cap of freedom and liberty

68
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:14,000
going

69
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:16,439
nice well you know it's the it's a

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,318
corporations sometimes talk about family

71
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:22,799
but it's mostly a conversation right and

72
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:25,158
uh a lot of things are changing in the

73
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,680
world that we live corporations are

74
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:29,919
driven by profit if they don't profit

75
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,719
they cease to exist

76
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,839
Community doesn't have to profit it just

77
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,719
has to

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,080
survive and Valerie you were the example

79
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,519
early on of those that fought strong

80
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,840
combined with patience and fought hard

81
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,759
to survive you were the leader to us

82
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,000
that were the dispensaries you were out

83
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,878
there showing compassion and we wanted

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,039
to reflect that as well and some of us

85
00:03:53,878 --> 00:04:00,318
did and carried that reflection as we're

86
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:03,359
aware that Community um was over grown

87
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:06,719
needless to say by those propers who

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,760
didn't necessarily seem or have the same

89
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,239
ideals that you and others instilled in

90
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,479
Us in compassionate giving to those that

91
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,840
were less fortunate than us that were

92
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:21,519
able yeah well thank thank you thank you

93
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:24,359
I appreciate that you know I think uh

94
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,319
well I probably would be just a few

95
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,759
years out of prison had it not been a

96
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:32,199
community that we uh were all part of

97
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:35,720
you know um Wham was something that was

98
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,720
uh driven by

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,720
a the fruit of it came through the the

100
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,879
community itself and really recognizing

101
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,560
that so many great things happen with

102
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,319
the effort of a lot of people like this

103
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,199
movement you know I really joined a

104
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:54,918
movement that was already well and well

105
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,240
ins sconed in this in this our worldwide

106
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:59,439
Community you know our worldwide can

107
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,720
cannabis Community marijuana back when

108
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:05,079
we the

109
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,720
marijuana so I I I've just been pretty

110
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:12,038
lucky so and get to hang out with all of

111
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,320

112
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:16,478
not only were you lucky you you you

113
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,719
fought for that change and push for that

114
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:22,199
change and worked at a which was most

115
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,360
important you worked at a local level

116
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,720
you worked within your region of your

117
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,600
state and everyone rallied around you

118
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,080
when they saw what the what you were

119
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,080
doing and why you were doing it there

120
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,959
were little of us that were like no what

121
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,399
they're doing is wrong no you were

122
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,439
taking patience and making sure that

123
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,399
they contributed at one point or another

124
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:46,360
to the growth Pro processing or

125
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:49,000
harvesting of this plant which was an

126
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,439
example that many of us were not aware

127
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,360
is something that could be done but you

128
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,079
went there and you said no this is how

129
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,560
it can be done and when they mess with

130
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,240
you you fought back I mean when they

131
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,680
tried to rage all people people blocked

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,439
the roads I mean there's a lot of real

133
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,360
drama to the history that a lot of

134
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:13,639
people here have lived and you were a

135
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,160
saint to us on a hill showing us how to

136
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,120
do it right and not only that you would

137
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,759
take us in and you would say okay this

138
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,840
is how it should be done you're doing

139
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,400
this wrong you should be doing it this

140
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,560
way and you mentored us as well and

141
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,679
kicked us in the ass so we're also

142
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,519
humbled and thanks for that

143
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,439
yeah I'd like to jump in and add to what

144
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:40,279
Jan was saying um I I think it was the

145
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:42,680
first time uh the feds rated you Valerie

146
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,719
I was I been living in San Francisco for

147
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,800
a number of years at that point and had

148
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,520
kind of heard about your work but was

149
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,800
not really aware of the extent and the

150
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:56,959
compassion that you brought to that work

151
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,000
and honestly um the news coverage of

152
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,198
that event that first bust that you

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,839
experienced down there that that Jan was

154
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,400
just referring to served as a model for

155
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:10,560
my I created a series of collectives and

156
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:12,159
co-ops uh that up till today it's still

157
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,280
the model that I work with thank you

158
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,360
Valerie you set a high standard that uh

159
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:21,359
I'm deeply grateful for so thank you I

160
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,038
appreciate that I didn't do it alone H

161
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,520
you know Mike worked with me at we don't

162
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:28,519
work together now but it was all built

163
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:31,878
you know built from the strength of many

164
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,758
and that's what really is uh one of the

165
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:35,520
it's it's Elemental it's key well it's

166
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,680
key to our our conversation today

167
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:41,038
Community right so we start our families

168
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,079
are our first community and then we

169
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:48,519
build from there relying on each other

170
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:50,399
and and uh not nobody co-opting the

171
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:53,680
working cooperatively but nobody

172
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,079
co-opting the uh the ownership and you

173
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,240
know everything changes this is 30 years

174
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,240
later and it's really it's wild to watch

175
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,960
it I'm glad to see a lot of what's

176
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,759
happened um especially freeing the

177
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:11,318
freeing the plant freeing freeing the

178
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,360
the people of course anything that's

179
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,479
this inviting and magical and has the

180
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,840
opportunity to create a lot of Revenue

181
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:21,719
is going to be co-opted

182
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:24,239
by you know by the the corporate state

183
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,800
by corporations by industry create an

184
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,720
industry around it that's just the way

185
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,960
it is this is we live in a in a very com

186
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,399
commercial

187
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,278
competitive capitalistic world problem

188
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,559
with capitalism is that it you know I

189
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,599
say this a lot it only measures profit

190
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,879
in one way but there are many ways to

191
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,399
measure profit and I think the balance

192
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:47,559
comes when we begin to see beyond the

193
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,480
narrow scope of financial profit and

194
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,278
that we realize that people's happiness

195
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,080
is part of that profit profit people

196
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:56,159
that work people who benefit from all of

197
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,440
those things are profit and they they

198
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,799
aren't necessarily commercialized but if

199
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,399
we could you know if they whatever if it

200
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,240
could be figured a way to commercialize

201
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,399
that and make money off of it probably

202
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,879
would work better for for an industry

203
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:13,720
but nef said about that that's just

204
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,439
a that's one of the frailties of C of a

205
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,680
one-dimensional

206
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,760
system oh that's not a one community

207
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:23,120
community is like love you've got to

208
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:26,399
give more than you take it's also the

209
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,039
way you make healthy soil you give more

210
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,919
than you take yeah you're right you open

211
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,240
your hand to give something before you

212
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:35,838
know it's

213
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,399
full right it's that's interesting Sam

214
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,800
you give more than you take because

215
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,519
capitalism is pretty much the opposite

216
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:44,599
where you take more than you give and

217
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,278
you can definitely see those two systems

218
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,159
are at I mean cannabis has shown us so

219
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,919
beautifully how those two systems are at

220
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,679
odds with one another particularly

221
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:56,799
because they removed cannabis for so

222
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:59,000
long from that system of you know legal

223
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,199
profiteering and capitalism and all of

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,679
that of course you know many of us used

225
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,360
cannabis I I certainly one of the first

226
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,278
things I learned about cannabis before I

227
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,079
knew of its medicinal properties before

228
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:12,120
I knew of all the magical things that it

229
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:13,719
could do what it what I noticed and that

230
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,440
this was you know I didn't realize at

231
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,320
the time but it was really because of

232
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
the prohibition of cannabis that it

233
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,040
allowed me to remove myself from the

234
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,640
slavery of a wage job I figured out

235
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,199
cannabis in a very unique way um I

236
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:30,639
wasn't trying to like you know make

237
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,959
money so badly or whatnot but what I

238
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,958
figured out was like I figured out a way

239
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:38,000
to monetize enjoying being with my

240
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:40,799
friends by getting them something that

241
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,559
they seemed unable to find on their own

242
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,599
at least to the caliber of which my old

243
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,879
factory was allowing me to find because

244
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,759
I had this heightened sense of smell and

245
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:53,879
taste and I used that to go out and and

246
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:56,078
really curate great cannabis and and

247
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,799
find people who took this plant a little

248
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,719
more serious than others and that was

249
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,799
really my first experience I mean

250
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,879
obviously I SP to join I was 14 years

251
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,719
old I had the time of my life and it

252
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:09,240
slowly moved into this oh wow like I can

253
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,399
kind of monetize this and so it's a

254
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,200
strange a strange tension that we find

255
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,799
ourselves in now especially with the

256
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,120
situation here in Canada with the

257
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:20,240
situation down in California with so

258
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,679
many lifelong people kind of getting

259
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,600
pushed out of this ability to use

260
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:28,120
cannabis to monetize their life and it's

261
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,079
it's sad it's a bummer I I don't really

262
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,639
know how to feel about it I don't love

263
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:35,239
the idea that it's just moved over to a

264
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,560
different group yet I understand that

265
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,879
everything else in the world is like

266
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,838
that and it's uh I find myself

267
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:45,078
questioning it constantly like here I am

268
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,959
in this legal regulatory framework of

269
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:50,319
cannabis and I I I I remember what it

270
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:54,399
was like I remember my friends serving

271
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,240
10 plus years in prison I remember guns

272
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,078
I remember dogs being shot and children

273
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,799
being taken away and when I remember

274
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:04,000
those those things I think well it's way

275
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,559
better than it was like it's way better

276
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,919
than it was but then I hang out with

277
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,439
younger people who are like oh they're

278
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,199
taxing us this and they're doing this

279
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,839
and they're crushing our business and

280
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,600
that's terrible too but not quite to the

281
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,120
level of what a lot of the people in

282
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,000
this room experience by you know being

283
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,198
arrested for basically being a habitual

284
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,519
florist well and providing and taking

285
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:28,919
that risk by doing so and that's

286
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,078
something that we always realize that it

287
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,679
was just about money that there had to

288
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:35,599
be compassion and always attached that

289
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,319
there were always going to be people who

290
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,278
could not afford cannabis people that

291
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,278
were going to be surprised you've just

292
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,919
got cancer and now you have to figure

293
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:47,720
out how to deal with re regimen to get

294
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:51,000
healthy and you hear about this cannabis

295
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,759
and it just again it reminds us of that

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,278
human element that the the it's still

297
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,278
done one to one I mean as much as I love

298
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:00,198
going on Capitol Hill a few weeks ago

299
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:03,159
and trying to to to affect change at a

300
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:06,359
national level it still requires that

301
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:08,240
one onone somebody coming in and says hi

302
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,800
I just found out I have stage four

303
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,480
breast cancer I need help and that's

304
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:16,319
where all of us here have been involved

305
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,360
because we weren't thinking of

306
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,639
necessarily about the money as much as

307
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,360
this human is hurting and needs help and

308
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,120
we've all found ourselves healing

309
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,680
through the Cannabis so we kind of all

310
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,039
took it upon ourselves to then help and

311
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:33,599
do what we we can to risk our freedoms

312
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,879
to help other people because again this

313
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,040
was still very much a gray area what

314
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,600
what Valerie was doing was

315
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,719
legal but what we as dispensaries were

316
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,519
doing we didn't have the legal right and

317
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,440
we had to actually work illegally to

318
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,198
actually change the laws at the state

319
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,800
level so that we could finally be

320
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:56,120
accepted and not necessarily be continue

321
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:59,519
to be prosecuted but somewhere in that

322
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,159
situation The Compassion been lost we

323
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,000
continue to do it at Berkeley Patients

324
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,719
Group we still give away free cannabis

325
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,039
every week to those that are that that

326
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,839
have established the need and

327
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:14,319
unfortunately as the industry is grown

328
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:18,680
The Compassion is shrunk and we need to

329
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,519
remind the uh industry of the compassion

330
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:25,120
that Valerie and others established and

331
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,560
weighed for us to continue to follow

332
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,399
because as we know the cancer rates have

333
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,359
gone from 1 and three to one and two in

334
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,639
the past couple of decades which means

335
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,879
there's going to be a long need for many

336
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:41,159
decades uh for humans to require the the

337
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:43,198
need for medical cannabis and um

338
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,759
everyone on here has made sure that is a

339
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:48,078
uh possibility and I am humbled and

340
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,480
thank to call you family at some

341
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,599
point you know I think one of the things

342
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,759
that we're we're looking at most most

343
00:14:52,600 --> 00:15:00,360
assuredly is with the pharmaceutical

344
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:02,000
Industries move toward um or

345
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,159
absconding with with can I'm going to

346
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,799
say absconding with medical because when

347
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:10,879
can when cannabis is created into it's

348
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,599
not that it isn't a medicine but when

349
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,439
it's created into a pharmaceutically

350
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,720
owned medicine we won't be able to

351
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,880
supply medicine we'd be doing we'd be

352
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:24,160
practicing medicine without a license so

353
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:27,000
our the idea that I mean it will become

354
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,039
privatized it will become a commodity

355
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,078
that a a physician have to approve it'll

356
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,078
be U

357
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,078
pharmaceuticalization as far as people

358
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,519
supplying or offering from one to

359
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:08,359
another that is um not that we can't do

360
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:10,799
it on the down low the way we probably

361
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,399
all started right I mean I know we did

362
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:19,198
we started on the down low um

363
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,759
and moving away from these these in

364
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,120
industrializing and

365
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:28,159
pharmaceuticalization these things move

366
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,120
us further away from the unity of

367
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,759
building family of being present with

368
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,600
one another and when we aren't present

369
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,680
with one

370
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,560
another we miss the connection of each

371
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:43,039
other's eyes of observing one another's

372
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,559
suffering of being able to lend a hand

373
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,799
in whatever way that is and someday it's

374
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,638
going to be me it's going to be

375
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:52,318
everybody you know there's we're mortal

376
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,919
and and so as we serve ourselves as an

377
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:56,958
industry serves us it's as important to

378
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:59,278
serve each other and everybody's at the

379
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:02,039
job of service everybody has a commodity

380
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,439
to sell if you're in the in business and

381
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,959
and it's all the same thing I mean the

382
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:10,558
the service industry is this huge thing

383
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:15,120
it's life you know we just get kind of

384
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:16,678
mucked up in what we in our needs hey

385
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,558

incredibly wonderful to see you Wade

391
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,280
Valerie ATN Mark it's been a while as

392
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:40,720
well and of course Marcus all the

393
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,558
love to you all thank you so much for

394
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,519
being here this morning feel super

395
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:49,519
honored and um talking about

396
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:52,119
Compass I just think that this is this

397
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,960
is where the most important thing that

398
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:56,959
we can really talk about in humanity

399
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:00,200
what no matter what Corporation or What

400
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,319
entity or what family or what religion

401
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,480
or what socioeconomic group that you're

402
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:08,639
in when we talk about compassion we're

403
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,000
talking about a very humanistic quality

404
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,240
just like what Valerie said this one

405
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,359
on-one and unfortunately you know the

406
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,798
big education the big Pharma they come

407
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:22,798
in to try to take that away and when we

408
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:26,119
don't have compassion anymore we

409
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:28,839
lose what it is that we came in here to

410
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,399
begin with you know I know that I

411
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,558
entered into cannabis because of

412
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,200
compassion from the very beginning and

413
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,119
although there's lots of different sort

414
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,480
of sharks along the way that want to

415
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:42,119
take us out of

416
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,759
compassion you know I feel like when it

417
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:47,759
is me and I am making those last breaths

418
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,919
on my deathbed with my friends around I

419
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:53,079
just want to know that I continued on

420
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,038
with compassion because then you know

421
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:57,158
it's just not worth living my life

422
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,440
honestly unless we're doing it in a way

423
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:01,039
that is connecting with other human

424
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,880
beings and this wonderful amazing

425
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,879
Collective Consciousness that we have

426
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,000
that we often forget about the power of

427
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,520
it it's almost interesting that you know

428
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,240
modern medicine goes down to places like

429
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,839
South America places like the Amazon and

430
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,640
they go and they try and take those

431
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:20,000
compounds out of the forest and makes a

432
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,799
synthetic version they kind of do that

433
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,839
to us like as a human population we're

434
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:28,400
like the rainforest medicine makers of

435
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,079
the of of the people realm and then they

436
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,519
come in into our people and they try and

437
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,839
fragment us and isolate us and isolate

438
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:36,720
our things and just doesn't work as well

439
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,038
so give thanks that there's still people

440
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,000
like us in the world and that there's

441
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,599
still intact environments for us to

442
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
learn from and uh you know there some

443
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,279
people out there that just don't go

444
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,558
along with everything and I think that's

445
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,918
a positive thing and I wanted to say one

446
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:56,119
thing um just to share with everybody

447
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:57,400
this morning um is that uh speaking of

448
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,558
uh large

449
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,679
corporations that are trying their

450
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:04,240
hardest to make things non-comp

451
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,519
passionate is that we got a letter

452
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,519
dragonfly Earth medicine got a letter

453
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:11,079
from the Environmental Protection Agency

454
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,759
and this would be our our nutrient

455
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:17,240
company a cease and assist on uh

456
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,839
dragonfly Earth medicine

457
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,679
because

458
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,759
Nettles

459
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:27,080
Alfalfa and kelp are now going to be

460
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:29,798
listed as a pesticide so if you are to

461
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:31,399
be using them in any new nutrient that's

462
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:34,960
not a synthetic

463
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,360
NPK then you are to be registered with

464
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,079
pesticide EPA and they told us that

465
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,678
they've been watching us for over two

466
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,359
years and they said if we use the word

467
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,600
healthy

468
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:49,479
biodynamic anything having to do with

469
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:53,199
plants well-being at all then we're

470
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,960
stepping into the pesticide area and

471
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,080
fertilizer era and I want to let you all

472
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,640
know sort of what Josh was saying is

473
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,038
that they have taken all of our

474
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,640
education that we've been doing for the

475
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,279
past couple of years and they're

476
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,278
integrating it for self to

477
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,678
own so very interesting and very much so

478
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:15,440
along the lines of what we're talking

479
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,840
about today and uh we're dealing with it

480
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,440
we're getting through it because that's

481
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,839
what we do this is just another

482
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,759
roadblock and we're really good at

483
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:29,158
roadblocks so um three o'clock road

484
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:32,079
block three o'cl road block yeah it it's

485
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,600
just you know we we have micronized

486
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,558
herbs with bacteria found all over the

487
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:38,319
Earth and micronized L fungi and they're

488
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,558
actually trying to stop that from going

489
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,678
into people's

490
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:44,558
Farms simply because going to a

491
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,320
Wikipedia page as simple as that and

492
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,278
just saying what does Nettles do in a

493
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,079
you know in a in a garden environment

494
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:52,720
you can't just copy what's online you

495
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:54,079
know say off a Wikipedia you know

496
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,440
whether you'd want to do that or not but

497
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,399
just I'm CH just talking about the

498
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,320
Simplicity aspect of it it's mindblowing

499
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,720
that this is the danger of compelling

500
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,759
speech when you compel

501
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,759
speech you create a very very dangerous

502
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,919
environment and this is compelling

503
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,720
speech because now they're controlling

504
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,038
what is a pesticide and changing that

505
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,038
language and moving the goalposts and

506
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,798
and affecting and creating this obstacle

507
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:24,400
for you guys I have zero doubt that the

508
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,519
tension that this creates will turn that

509
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,919
obstacle into well you guys will turn

510
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:30,519
that obstacle into an opportunity

511
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,799
because you're on the right side of this

512
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:34,918
and they're clearly uh on the wrong side

513
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:38,038
of this sorry for cutting you off

514
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:40,320
joh um M I think what we were just gonna

515
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:44,640
say is that it just goes along with this

516
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:48,319
long line of the people and the

517
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,720
community continuing in compassion and

518
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:53,278
them finding out that that's a popular

519
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,480
game over and over again they find out

520
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:59,880
that togetherness is a popular game and

521
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:03,159
they want to own it but we know that you

522
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,679
know love will win because just like you

523
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,400
know if there's only love and fear we're

524
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,600
really interested in staying in the love

525
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,720
and we'll just let them Define and take

526
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,519
care of fear and pretty soon they're

527
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,519
going to tell us that love needs to be

528
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,240
listed under as a pesticide as well

529
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,839
because health and biodynamics and

530
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,679
everything is but that's okay the

531
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:25,158
positive thinking thing come on come on

532
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,159
there's no statistics and it actually

533
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,640
just like you said Marcus as soon as we

534
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:32,440
got it it was an incred incredible

535
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,320
opportunity for us to look at all kinds

536
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,159
of things we really have taken it on as

537
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,839
an unbelievable opportunity and like I

538
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,919
had said before we've been moving into

539
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,759
plant medicine and I've been doing a lot

540
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,120
of therapy sessions with people that

541
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:49,599
have been

542
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:53,000
absolutely

543
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:56,519
mindblowing I mean wow the healing that

544
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,079
can happen with plants is we all know

545
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:02,158
that but now that we're stepping in to

546
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:03,759
something yes exactly giving thanks

547
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,679
giving thanks for

548
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:09,480
that um yeah so it's given us

549
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,120
opportunity to look at other things and

550
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,038
cannabis has opened the door for all of

551
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:17,158
the other plant medicines and all of the

552
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:19,400
entheogens so as she opens up the door

553
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,799
we all just need to walk through and

554
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,440
remember that love guides the way energy

555
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:26,038
never goes the way it just moves to

556
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,240
another area I just wanted to mention

557
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:32,440
too that I I do not believe that all

558
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,359
corporations intrinsically are evil I

559
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,360
mean a lot of them certainly are their

560
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:42,319
sharks but you got to remember that some

561
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:45,678
of the uh corporations like the owner of

562
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:50,200
Patagonia he gave his entire company in

563
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:54,240
Fortune to help companies that will

564
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,480
fight climate change and help

565
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,960
sustainability so I

566
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,759
mean yeah

567
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,440
good things can be done talking about

568
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,599
corporations I think that it's really

569
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,480
important we're talking about like

570
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:10,519
public you know ones that are associated

571
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,480
with big government associated with

572
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:14,079
lobbyists we're not you know when we're

573
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,120
talking about a corporation like

574
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,720
Patagonia they do not have lobbyists

575
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:20,558
they do not have people that are trying

576
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,960
to continue to talk about you know how

577
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:25,759
they can shut down people so they can

578
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,759
make their way

579
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:32,158
up a little bit different right it's a b

580
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,679
Corp or Patagonia is a b Corp and

581
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,520
they're they're principled uh in a

582
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,278
different Foundation right so and and

583
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,679
you could be a borp and not really be

584
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:45,159
principal I think it's you know it's

585
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:49,120
endemic it's you know the the the kind

586
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:53,640
of uh it's the new Conquering the way

587
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:56,479
that that uh one culture is conquered by

588
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,799
NE where you you tear down the temple

589
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,000
and build the church and

590
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,759
we see I hope that's not too vague of a

591
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,319
of a metaphor

592
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:11,000
but I see this as happening um in many

593
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:15,480
cultures and what's happening with the

594
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,919
plant with plants now we're science now

595
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,319
I mean I love to be able to have access

596
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,200
to Scientific data and information and

597
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:26,398
I'm I feel very fortunate to live in a

598
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,240
time when I am able to do that and I

599
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:33,879
also see that one of the issues that

600
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:37,120
appears to be arising is again the the

601
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:40,320
dismissal or the removal of the shaman

602
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:42,558
or the teacher from the process so we

603
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:45,398
have a medicine or we have a

604
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:48,960
claim and a claim that we associate with

605
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:51,199
it and then you know how did it even

606
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,079
become how was it even discovered that

607
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,120
it was a medicine it wasn't in a

608
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:59,119
Laboratory um it was through messaging

609
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:01,879
from the plant connection with nature

610
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:05,239
and that kind of Exquisite uh

611
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:08,919
opportunity uh that we have to be to

612
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,558
deeply listen and be uh taught because

613
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,240
we're all we're all you know we get I

614
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:15,038
get confused sometimes thinking that I'm

615
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,319
teaching something when really I'm you

616
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:22,200
know just listening and being able to

617
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:26,240
hear what I'm being able to listen more

618
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,399
deeply and and listen to some truth some

619
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,640
information so I think I think it's it

620
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:35,599
really a danger it's a it's more than

621
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:37,640
co-opting and it's when your goal when

622
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:40,158
you have a goal if you go toward the

623
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,000
goal the things that are in your

624
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,720
way can be pushed aside or will be

625
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,798
pushed aside and we have to look at that

626
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,159
in our own lives and as we reflect on

627
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:54,359
the ways that it is happening around us

628
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:59,799
we're you know we're oppressing our own

629
00:27:54,359 --> 00:28:02,798
Planet at a great cost but we're also

630
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:05,480
evolving um such as we started off we

631
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:08,759
could not be we had to all be not for

632
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,759
profits but we could not

633
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,360
get Corporation and that's a full

634
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,439
vetting cycle that is making sure that

635
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,759
you have diverse you hire diversity

636
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,720
you're paying fairly and all that so

637
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,519
there's even in the corporate world

638
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,839
there are things like beneficial

639
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,558
corporations which are the standards now

640
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,759
we lost that when the government

641
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:44,158
forcefully evicted us at to lay off 50

642
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:47,919
people therefore putting us below that

643
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:51,000
70 or 75 person threshold they needed to

644
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:54,159
have beneficial corporations but it also

645
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,599
shows the need that even in the the new

646
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,278
beneficial Corporation there are even

647
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:01,678
limits that there need to low to be more

648
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:04,599
accessible to everyone because I would

649
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,759
love to continue to still be but I due

650
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:09,240
to the industry itself and its collapse

651
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:09,240
I can no

652
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:28,200
long possible as an example but I mean

653
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,158
Valerie you led by example and everybody

654
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,480
kind of way from that we've tried to

655
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,278
lead by example by still compassionate

656
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,880
giving and people have gone completely

657
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:39,319
away from that so we also have to be

658
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,399
these stewards and reminders to people

659
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,798
that the job is not done and there is

660
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:47,000
still much more work to

661
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:50,798
do I think the division that human

662
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,558
beings tend to create naturally can be

663
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:57,119
really viewed at both ends of life in

664
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,918
the birth and in the death of a human

665
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,639
being and when you look at that you know

666
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,480
when Valerie's talking about connection

667
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,320
and how this connection has been lost in

668
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,798
the pharmaceuticalization of cannabis

669
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:09,918
well look at the pharmaceuticalization

670
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,879
of births and the the lack of connection

671
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,600
that's there of course very important

672
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,399
something goes wrong a hospital is an

673
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,480
amazing Place uh to be able to be a an

674
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,038
emergency room for for something that's

675
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,240
going wrong with the with the mother or

676
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:24,839
the baby but just that disconnect of how

677
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,038
different it is when you have a home

678
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:28,918
birth with a midwife and you have that

679
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,359
eye to eye connect and you don't have

680
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,559
anyone sort of controlling the other

681
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,359
person and and trying to be like I'm the

682
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:38,000
guy here that's doing this and you see

683
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,918
it in our in the way we die as well and

684
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,480
the way people die in hospital beds

685
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,960
versus you know having death Gatherings

686
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,200
where people are actually taking you

687
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,278
through your death and then you can see

688
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,960
how it affects everything in between and

689
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:52,759
I'm sure you know it's there's this

690
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,079
there's always this tension and I

691
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:57,079
somehow think that it's part of The

692
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:59,960
Human Experience because we're not here

693
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:02,038
to be the same thing we're here to have

694
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,558
our Free Will and to have these

695
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:07,398
experiences both sides of the coin have

696
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,839
to exist and in that tension and I don't

697
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:11,959
really know how to put this into words

698
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:15,158
but I feel that the value of life can be

699
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,798
found in that tension you know the

700
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:20,039
tension between life and death the

701
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,960
tension between one person's uh Vision

702
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:23,839
versus another person's Vision I'm sure

703
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,319
Dr Mark you could get into metaphors of

704
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,720
chemistry and how all sorts of magic

705
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:32,000
happens in the tension of

706
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,319
chemistry um it's just it's a really

707
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
interesting thing how we're constantly

708
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,638
creating division naturally it's like oh

709
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,720
this side wants to do it this way well

710
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:42,918
we want to do it this way and you know

711
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,839
Josh sort of spoke upon it earlier it's

712
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,720
good that we exist but you know in the

713
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,798
in the words of of one of my neighbors

714
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,240
Heather this 80 plus year old woman she

715
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:54,879
said well it's all love Mark isn't it

716
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,079
it's all love so don't worry about it

717
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,559
it's all love on both sides even the

718
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:02,519
side that you think isn't love it's love

719
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:06,278
too just from a different perspective so

720
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:09,679
there's my sort of flaky love uh um I

721
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:12,919
think that that's all I Marcus I love

722
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,200
that because I feel like also what's

723
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:16,320
happening

724
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,880
with you know what happened with

725
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:24,759
cannabis we saw that anything that has a

726
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:27,919
nature connection is something that can

727
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:31,798
be looked at and can be attacked sign

728
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:34,320
science is definitely very helpful but

729
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:36,839
unfortunately science likes to say that

730
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,960
it's more important than nature

731
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:42,959
sometimes science likes to say hey I've

732
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,679
got it more figured out even than nature

733
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,679
does whereas nature never goes back and

734
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:51,120
says oh that was the wrong experiment

735
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:54,080
you know we didn't have it right but

736
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:56,439
science is always you know redoing it oh

737
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:58,398
10 years later that that wasn't totally

738
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,240
right or and I'm not going to throw the

739
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,239
baby out with a bath water because I

740
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,720
feel like it's you know science is

741
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,519
really important but I feel like we're

742
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,440
going more towards the technical side of

743
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,480
science more the mechanism side of

744
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:17,720
Science and and demonizing a a lot of

745
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,200
what Nature has to show us and nature

746
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,679
has to guide us one thing that's

747
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,200
becoming incredibly impar with that is

748
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,600
while I think that Maps is incredibly

749
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,480
helpful in pushing forward plant

750
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:34,918
medicine and what they're doing I'm also

751
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:37,399
incredibly concerned because it's taking

752
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,080
a lot of the science side of it so you

753
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:42,798
go into an office you put something over

754
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,519
your eyes you listen to a certain music

755
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,720
you have this

756
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,880
incredible which people say is you know

757
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:54,079
like a near-death experience or like a

758
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:57,080
birth experience it's it's that

759
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:59,798
lifechanging that then you take the mask

760
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:01,319
off and you go to work the next day

761
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:05,000
nature is not

762
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:07,158
involved but but PS sorry excuse me go

763
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,918
apologize no go ahead Val I want to hear

764
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:12,200
it go ahead

765
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,158
it's everything is like that whatever

766
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:17,319
our experience that awakens I just want

767
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,679
to back up the thing with maps like in

768
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,760
order to bring these experiences to

769
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,720
people there are certain safeguards

770
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,079
within the context of the scientific

771
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:29,239
community and they're there for that's

772
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:33,000
the way our they've socially been built

773
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:35,838
it doesn't doesn't uh uh in any way

774
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,559
change our experiences with psychedelics

775
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:44,000
or um we still have those opportunities

776
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:45,918
um to use them and I see why that you

777
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,918
know I think we can all see why there

778
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,719
are problems somebody

779
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,759
might you know flip out have a better

780
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,918
experience may have heart attack these

781
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,880
kinds of things can rarely can't but

782
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:59,960
they can happen and guidance is a really

783
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,240
important tool having the teacher the

784
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:06,159
connection between the shaman or the the

785
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:08,399
guide and the intention of our

786
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:11,000
journey but I think it's true with

787
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,480
everything you know like I'm I'm

788
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,800
sometimes surprised I'm like did anybody

789
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,800
get not anybody but I working with

790
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,320
people in in cannabis like did they ever

791
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,680
get high like I mean did they what

792
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,880
happened to the experience what happened

793
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:28,159
to that piece that changed us or opened

794
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:32,720
our hearts or

795
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:34,358
or you know what is it that that we lose

796
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,118
when we walk away from the experience

797
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:38,719
because we walk away from an experience

798
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:41,079
it lasts for an instant it opens or

799
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:44,118
changes Us in some way then what what do

800
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:47,720
we take with us from that so I see that

801
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:52,480
that's um um that's just part of the

802
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:52,480
problem but it does not in any way

803
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,358
change I think the need for science

804
00:35:55,639 --> 00:36:00,318
science is going to take it to people

805
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:03,358
that we you know in Dubai it's going to

806
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:05,759
take it to people all around the world

807
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:08,358
that would no in no other way have an

808
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,400
opportunity or may not have

809
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:14,318
another experience it I do totally agree

810
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,880
with you Valen I think it's a really

811
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:21,039
important part but I think the concern

812
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,440
that I have in this is that these are

813
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:26,159
plants that come from nature they have a

814
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,639
message of Nature and when therapist or

815
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:31,078
the men is only another human being

816
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:34,920
taking nature out of the factor as a

817
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,599
mentor as a teacher when you when I work

818
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,358
with people and I'm working on plant

819
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:43,200
medicine I could hum for a half an hour

820
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:45,159
looking at a leaf and downloading nature

821
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,919
and downloading what it feels like to

822
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:50,399
lie on the ground and I'm just and I

823
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,760
have a concern that if we take nature

824
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,838
out of the picture as nature I mean as

825
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,400
as a mentor in this as a teacher as an

826
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:01,440
expansive knowledge then we're only

827
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,358
looking towards another human being who

828
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,240
is incredibly limited and I feel like

829
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:09,239
that's where the clinical setting yes it

830
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:12,559
may bring it to more people but I feel

831
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:14,759
like it's lacking and I feel like if we

832
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:17,279
could at least go to where the plants

833
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,200
are grown in the ground and get out of

834
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,640
the clinical setting maybe we need to

835
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:26,358
bring the clinicians out to Nature more

836
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:29,000
something has got to happen where nature

837
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:31,279
is I I mean and sometimes I go through a

838
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,239
whole six-h hour plant medicine therapy

839
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,200
session with something we don't talk at

840
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:38,199
all because nature is downloading

841
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:40,960
everything that that person needs to do

842
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:43,279
by just simply going on a walk right and

843
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,720
I feel that if we're gonna juice people

844
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,640
up with plant medicine and they're going

845
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,759
to go to these incredible psychedelic

846
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,639
spaces and they're going to be really

847
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,599
looking at why they're here they're

848
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,480
going to look be looking at their soul

849
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:56,720
path they're going to have an

850
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,800
understanding I feel like if nature is

851
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:02,559
not involved in that conversation and

852
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,119
that guidance then that person is

853
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:07,078
severely missing out on the potential

854
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,280
possibilities of where they could where

855
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:13,480
they could go well well they're just

856
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:16,400
missing out on that possibility it's not

857
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,838
one doesn't negate the other so not

858
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,039
everybody would be comfortable laying on

859
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,119
the ground in the forest and not not

860
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:23,880
everybody can access it somebody who's

861
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:26,680
paralyzed is going to have a hard time

862
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,358
doing that people won't necessarily

863
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,279
people who are sick who can't get out of

864
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:33,078
bed there are me I guess what I'm trying

865
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,000
to say is I fully agree with you and

866
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:38,440
that's one path and there are eight

867
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,639
billion of us and or so and and there

868
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,480
are eight billion

869
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:47,159
ways to leave behind whatever it was and

870
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,039
open to A New Path and I think that

871
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:53,199
that's one of our one of the things we

872
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,199
want to do is to stay open

873
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:59,078
to stay open to the other Pathways

874
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:02,199
because

875
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:03,720
what I think is happening is um that

876
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:05,559
door is getting shut I mean lots of

877
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:07,838
people are taking off and doing iasa

878
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:09,279
Journeys and connecting and this is you

879
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:12,358
know it's remarkable what's happening

880
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,920
today it's really quite remarkable and

881
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:18,358
does it have to be in I mean I think

882
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,400
there are great grave issues that arise

883
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:22,880
when we remove the teachers remove the

884
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,599
shamans when we take the take the

885
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,440
institutionalize the the the gift the me

886
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:30,000
the medicine

887
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,000
and

888
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,760
yet I I believe the more the more

889
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Pathways we open the more opportunities

890
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,720
for people to have the experience to

891
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,358
carry it to carry both their intention

892
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:46,838
and the

893
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:48,239
outcome it only broadens and it broadens

894
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:50,519
our language and it broadens our

895
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,559
connection with one another and it gives

896
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:57,920
a chance you know

897
00:39:52,559 --> 00:40:01,039
like how how amazing can we be well

898
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,559
well get in traffic and see how amazing

899
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:06,400
you are and and that's where it you know

900
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:09,960
what we take from our experience and

901
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,480
what we give I think the room for others

902
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,960
to have theirs experience is one of the

903
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,280
keys that I hope we don't erase I hope

904
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,960
we don't miss and I and I mean I would

905
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:24,400
fully agree with you that that's

906
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,960
remarkable healing and you're people are

907
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,960
very fortunate to be able to be in

908
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,159
your in your service with your with you

909
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,720
serving their needs and attending to

910
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:41,000
them and that's a pretty sweet that's a

911
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:42,559
very sweet and beautiful gift but not

912
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,920
everybody can get to you and you really

913
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,799
don't want everybody to get to you I

914
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,720
mean I don't think that's my opinion I

915
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,800
like a small community because I can be

916
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:57,039
have I can be more at peace with who I

917
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,599
serve yeah and and it is true it's hard

918
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,559
to reach every and the people that we

919
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,280
are reaching now are the people who are

920
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:08,480
working with other people to you know

921
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,160
give them another look at what a healing

922
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,679
session can look like what it feels like

923
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:16,039
outside of walls what it feels like

924
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,078
without you know something over your

925
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:20,239
eyes and just being internal and

926
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,920
Gathering what Nature has to offer and

927
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:25,479
it is changing the way that they're

928
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,800
looking at their sessions is changing

929
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,679
the way that they are making their

930
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,640
clinics and it is changing the way that

931
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:37,000
they're seeing patients so you know the

932
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:39,039
the more that we can have influencers

933
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,760
and people that are working with other

934
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:44,480
people understand the power of the

935
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,760
mentorship of Nature and the power of

936
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,358
nature as the shaman um then I think

937
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,680
that we've got a much better opportunity

938
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:54,559
to reach those you know 80 million

939
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:57,519
people on the planet or whatever eight

940
00:41:54,559 --> 00:42:01,279
billion people on the planet so we're

941
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:04,719
eight billion versions of nature we're

942
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:07,480
eight billion versions of evolution

943
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:11,838
we're not eight billion versions of

944
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:14,039
Petri dishes but we do well yes and no

945
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:16,279
okay because we are nature is science

946
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:18,119
and if we take it back think of this

947
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,519
first of all you guys might be

948
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,400
forgetting how Savage nature is do you

949
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:24,559
know that the wild the beasts in Africa

950
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,838
give birth Twice first they give birth

951
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,680
for the Lions to consume their baby's

952
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:30,599
Liv as they're coming out of the vaginas

953
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,558
of the wilderbeast live it's the most

954
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:34,359
Savage thing you've ever seen and then

955
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:35,960
they give birth a couple of months later

956
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:37,960
and those are the ones that actually

957
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,880
succeed the the the bloodline of the

958
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,079
wilderbeast because the Lions damn near

959
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,640
consume all of the first born of these

960
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:49,359
wilderbeast so science our our ability

961
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:52,598
to create and discover has allowed us to

962
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:54,400
remove ourselves from the food chain we

963
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:57,599
used to be a part of that food chain and

964
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,519
let me tell you it was super Savage like

965
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,318
there's you cannot imagine we thought it

966
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:05,079
was bad when the DEA were hunting us

967
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:07,159
down with guns it was worse when lions

968
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:09,240
and tigers were hunting us down with

969
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:10,519
their teeth and eating Us Alive forget

970
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:13,799
about putting you in a cage they were

971
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:16,280
just consuming you whole and so that and

972
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,480
and if we're if we're in all nature well

973
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,200
then our science is a part of nature as

974
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,318
well you know that that like we think

975
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:26,239
about this think about the ability to

976
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:28,599
even use the medicine you guys are using

977
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:32,199
for healing right now without science

978
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:34,519
science created that medicine you know

979
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:37,439
the the tools of science help transform

980
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:40,199
nature we're not we're not diminishing

981
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,880
Nature by science or Nature by any mean

982
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:47,159
go ahead I was just gonna say basically

983
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:50,200
that like melium grows in an

984
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:52,759
isopropyl hooded stainless steel

985
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:54,799
environment that shows that nature lives

986
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:59,119
in all environments we can all be

987
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,920
enhanced or gifted by every part of life

988
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:05,280
totally understand that everyone's

989
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:09,119
invited life is amazing that's why we

990
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,760
have fractals and the mandal BR you know

991
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,280
Theory and all these things that show

992
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,280
that there's a NeverEnding

993
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,359
possibility I love uh connecting with

994
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,440
nature whenever possible let's just

995
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:22,239
leave it at that well and I also think

996
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,318
that the conversation of the will to

997
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:28,078
Beast you know eating us with their big

998
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:31,239
teeth that's nature but human beings

999
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:35,079
that are sort of killing each other to

1000
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:39,118
become a higher position I feel like

1001
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:42,359
maybe that's a little bit out of it it

1002
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,480
just it feels like competition has taken

1003
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:48,799
over natural intuition and I think that

1004
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:53,400
we are out of balance with science being

1005
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,720
looked at more as the thing rather than

1006
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,039
I think we're just a little bit out of

1007
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,558
balance I think nature is equally as

1008
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:01,519
important as science because we've

1009
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:04,319
created and we're natural beings but at

1010
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:06,920
the same time science has just taken the

1011
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,920
main news it's on the front page science

1012
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:12,639
science science so people are forgetting

1013
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,358
that we can learn so much from nature so

1014
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:17,759
we're just trying to continue to be a

1015
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:20,199
loud voice for nature because science

1016
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,079
has such a main spot right now and if

1017
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:24,598
you sence the study of nature science is

1018
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:26,519
the study of nature you can't have

1019
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:28,240
science with you can't have it without

1020
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:30,960
nature

1021
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,519
I agree we studi I agre the cannabis

1022
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,400
plant we're part of the Cannabis

1023
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:38,559
Community the cannabis plant doesn't

1024
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,240
express the same type of diversity in

1025
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,880
its cannabinoids synthetically as it

1026
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:46,199
does organically in a regenerative

1027
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,039
setting why would everyone be going into

1028
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:51,318
the Earth with their cannabis not just

1029
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:54,639
because the bills are high in an indoor

1030
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:58,519
setting the Cannabis is different when

1031
00:45:54,639 --> 00:46:01,879
it grows in the soil with rocks and

1032
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:04,480
crystals and spring water and every wow

1033
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,800
that plant's different complete

1034
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,000
different plant than an aeroponic setup

1035
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,800
or a hydroponic setup I don't need to

1036
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,760
know anything else at that point I'm

1037
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,720
like a plant 22,000 chromosomes there's

1038
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,839
very little different between us you

1039
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:23,759
know and by saying that it's not trying

1040
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:26,119
to say that 100% we're from nature we

1041
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,920
use electricity I it's not like I it's

1042
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:29,519
nice to not have to go down the rabbit

1043
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,079
hole of like well hey what about this

1044
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:35,838
and that like it's fine everything else

1045
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,480
is happening it's awesome it's just odd

1046
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,440
in the last three years that the

1047
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:44,318
Nature's side of life has been demonized

1048
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,960
it's the way it is ostracized Witch Hunt

1049
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:48,920
whatever you want to call it can't

1050
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,480
travel can't live there's not an actual

1051
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:55,200
equal playing field so it's kind of it's

1052
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:57,400
kind of just sure life's happening now

1053
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,719
let's hear let's hear from a scientist

1054
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:03,519
right I know we all think we're you want

1055
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:03,519
me to speak Mark is that what you're

1056
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:11,480
saying yes yes to all of that because I

1057
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,199
honestly believe the the universe is

1058
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:19,760
perfect I truly truly believe this and

1059
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:22,558
any people who can't see it you know I I

1060
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:26,000
I feel sorry for you but the universe is

1061
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:28,319
truly perfect but Sam how much assd did

1062
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
you take to see that was it like aund

1063
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:34,838
hits like 200 hits no it was only it was

1064
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,838
only 50 50 hits

1065
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:43,000
inshine know this was an acid

1066
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:46,199
trip for him to come to the conclusion

1067
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,318
that that it's it's perfect uh he's on

1068
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:50,639
the assumption that the universe is

1069
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:52,599
finite and if we know anything from

1070
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:59,078
Einstein we know that the universe is

1071
00:47:52,599 --> 00:48:01,599
ever expanding so um uh uh I'll quote uh

1072
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:04,480
Einstein and saying that my sense of God

1073
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,680
is my sense of wonder about the universe

1074
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:10,838
so let me just chime in from the science

1075
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,960
point of view for a second and say well

1076
00:48:10,838 --> 00:48:16,000
okay science

1077
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,760
is Marcus science of living things

1078
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,440
science of nature is biology there's all

1079
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:24,680
other kinds of of of disciplines and

1080
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,679
science but it's so think of it this way

1081
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:30,879
so humans are naturally in inquisitive

1082
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:33,199
right we want to learn about ourselves

1083
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,480
and our environment so we're all

1084
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:39,159
scientists but we're not all paid

1085
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,639
scientists right so just there's a few

1086
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:43,558
of us who are paid the rest of you we're

1087
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:46,039
all scientists and we're all building on

1088
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:48,400
the knowledge and we all stand on the

1089
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:50,759
shoulders of the people who've come

1090
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,960
before us that have you know leted us

1091
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,240
down this this path and so let me go

1092
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,440
back to the EPA for a second too so

1093
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:01,598
that's interesting that you guys got a

1094
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:04,760
notification from them but remember that

1095
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:08,160
theoretically the EPA which was started

1096
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:10,680
uh uh in 1970 by the Nixon

1097
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,440
Administration uh was there to basically

1098
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:14,919
protect the environment right and make

1099
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:18,679
sure that you know people weren't just

1100
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:22,440
making really big piles of waste or

1101
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:25,440
pollution or somehow damaging the

1102
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,960
environment where yes like it or not

1103
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,960
food is grown in industrial ways and the

1104
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,639
Environmental Protection Agency makes

1105
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:37,838
sure that you know things that are sold

1106
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:41,838
into agriculture have no uh longlasting

1107
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:44,119
impact in the environment and um while

1108
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:48,759
it's true that like what you the sort of

1109
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:50,760
like the living soil approach is is less

1110
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,760
uh impactful on the environment as

1111
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:57,640
taking advantage of the natural

1112
00:49:52,760 --> 00:50:00,160
organisms and using Mother Nature's Own

1113
00:49:57,639 --> 00:50:02,719
biopesticides if you will in fact you

1114
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:06,118
know the EPA for several years now has

1115
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:10,159
had a category called bio pesticides and

1116
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:13,039
if you look at the various regulations

1117
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:16,039
um right there are there are no

1118
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:18,960
commercial products right now uh whose

1119
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:21,960
registration covers the use on hemp or

1120
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:25,079
cannabis or very very few and the reason

1121
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,720
why is because the onus is back on the

1122
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:31,599
people who own that Reg ation for that

1123
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:34,118
active to run all of the trials to make

1124
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,720
sure that the application rate of their

1125
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:37,960
product on that Agricultural Product

1126
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:39,879
whatever it is doesn't have to be

1127
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,798
cannabis could be anything Tomatoes

1128
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,400
strawberries anything whatever you're

1129
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:48,039
applying to that has the efficacy that

1130
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,760
you claim it does so it kills fungus or

1131
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:53,798
keeps insects away or whatever but it

1132
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:56,319
also has to be shown to be safe by the

1133
00:50:53,798 --> 00:50:58,838
time that produce gets to the market

1134
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:01,838
that you know either it's been

1135
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:04,440
photolytically or hydrolytically uh

1136
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,798
decomposed to the point where whatever

1137
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,639
metabolites from that treatment that's

1138
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:12,079
left on those strawberries or string

1139
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:14,798
beans or lettuce is all below the point

1140
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,720
at which there is no effect on human

1141
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:19,358
health and if there is effect on human

1142
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:22,558
health they don't get a registration in

1143
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:25,358
that market so so now add cannabis to

1144
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,240
this so in order for a company to show

1145
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:29,920
to get an EPA

1146
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:31,519
registration on anything from uh

1147
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,318
Insecticide

1148
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,679
Fungicide anything that you want to

1149
00:51:33,318 --> 00:51:37,838
apply to cannabis you'll have to have

1150
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:40,598
that data package you'll have to have

1151
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:43,719
that data package to bring to the EPA

1152
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:46,480
and now you're bringing you know uh

1153
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:48,159
regardless of cannabis being you know I

1154
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,119
guess federally illegal I guess right

1155
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:54,960
now that's Up For Debate since you know

1156
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:57,358
hemp has now been made legal through the

1157
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,000
through or low THC cannabis which is

1158
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,838
Industrial Hemp has now been made legal

1159
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,199
and certainly there are companies that

1160
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:07,599
are going after that market meaning that

1161
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:10,239
they are developing crop protection

1162
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,960
chemicals and you'll be happy to know

1163
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:14,439
you guys that again you guys have been

1164
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:18,199
Pioneers in this area and that people

1165
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:21,798
are taking your lead but now again it's

1166
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:25,039
a business they're investing Millions

1167
00:52:21,798 --> 00:52:27,239
into developing that safety package and

1168
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:31,000
to know that when you brew that that te

1169
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:34,719
or when you use that living soil product

1170
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,199
on cannabis at that rate that it doesn't

1171
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:40,519
affect there's no residuals there's no

1172
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:43,558
runoffs that poisons you know Water

1173
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:45,880
Supplies there's no I don't know I mean

1174
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,920
they go through this whole environmental

1175
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:50,519
analysis and that's what the EPA is

1176
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,720
supposed to do right it's Environmental

1177
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:56,519
Protection Agency they're there using

1178
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:58,919
our tax dollars to supposedly protect

1179
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:01,400
our environment so I'm not just coming

1180
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:05,480
down as being pro EPA what I'm saying is

1181
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:08,318
that we and you guys especially need to

1182
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,960
we need to work with them so they can

1183
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:13,960
properly regulate the use of these

1184
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,559
products in commercially grown cannabis

1185
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,119
because let's face it or not I you guys

1186
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:22,480
were talking about corporations before

1187
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:24,079
and I know uh Sam has dealt with large

1188
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,480
corporations I've dealt with large

1189
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,240
corporations that's how I built my

1190
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,960
resume and got all those things on the

1191
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:33,159
wall I mean ultimately at the end of the

1192
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:35,318
day this is a money-making business

1193
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:38,000
where people are in the business to

1194
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:40,400
basically make a profit and either

1195
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,119
return that profit to their shareholders

1196
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,639
or their investors or whatever I mean

1197
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:47,400
that's just corporations that's just

1198
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:49,558
free enterprise and like it or not

1199
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,200
that's what we got we can't really do

1200
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:54,280
anything to stop it so you might as well

1201
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:56,439
just get used to it there's big

1202
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,960
companies that provide everything for

1203
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,280
from the gasoline we put in our cars to

1204
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,838
the fast food hamburgers if that's what

1205
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,798
you choose to eat to e everything if

1206
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:10,000
there is a market for something and

1207
00:54:06,798 --> 00:54:13,280
something wants to be bought and Delta 8

1208
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,719
THC is a perfect example of this where

1209
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,079
there's a market where cannabis is

1210
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:21,118
illegal in certain States so what do

1211
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:23,359
they do well I turn this CBD into

1212
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,200
something that can get people high and

1213
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:27,759
now you can go to websites or gas

1214
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:30,318
stations or bodegas and get all kinds of

1215
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:34,440
you know products that are made outside

1216
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:37,639
the regulatory uh framework that most uh

1217
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:40,039
cannabis uh uh uh operations are are

1218
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:42,358
having to live on there I say that I'm

1219
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:44,880
living in Vermont guys this is new we

1220
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:49,798
moved from Pennsylvania to Vermont and

1221
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:52,720
Vermont went recreational yesterday was

1222
00:54:49,798 --> 00:54:54,920
first time I've lived in a state that's

1223
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:57,798
turned from medical to

1224
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:01,039
recreational and I got a big joint to

1225
00:54:57,798 --> 00:55:03,000
smoke here on camera so we can celebrate

1226
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,279
it but you know it's just really cool

1227
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,400
what's happening up here there's a lot

1228
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,240
of innovation Vermont's kind of like the

1229
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,519
humble to the east a lot of great

1230
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:12,959
Growers a lot of really dank weed up

1231
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:14,838
here in these mountains and I'm living

1232
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,159
on Lake Champlain which is really kind

1233
00:55:14,838 --> 00:55:20,039
of cool I look out and see sailboats go

1234
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:22,279
by that's kind of cool but um just to go

1235
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:25,639
back to science just and I'll end there

1236
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:27,760
is that you know again anytime you learn

1237
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:29,400
something you're being a scientist when

1238
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,760
you learn something new and you're

1239
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,000
expanding your knowledge over something

1240
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,880
doesn't have to be scientific it could

1241
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,559
be you know just a quicker way to get to

1242
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,720
work or it could be you know gee if I

1243
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:43,960
stirred my coffee more it wouldn't be so

1244
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:47,000
sweet at the bottom you know just little

1245
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:49,519
realizations like that you're you're

1246
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,440
learning new things and as you learn new

1247
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:54,358
things to you're basically being a

1248
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,838
scientist so we're just explorers those

1249
00:55:54,358 --> 00:56:00,279
of us who are paid scientists have to

1250
00:55:56,838 --> 00:56:03,239
explore right at the current Frontier on

1251
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:05,000
what's known and what's not known and we

1252
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:08,558
all know people have been asking for

1253
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,760
years and I think part of my attraction

1254
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:13,640
uh here on church right has always been

1255
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,760
the science and the research and gez

1256
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:18,400
what what can we do to really push this

1257
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,119
thing forward holy [ __ ] folks be careful

1258
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,960
what you wish for this is what the end

1259
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:24,960
of prohibition looks like I'm getting a

1260
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,358
faculty position here at the University

1261
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,720
to study the use of canono to treat

1262
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:33,719
traumatic brain injury I mean I I I have

1263
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:37,000
to pinch myself to understand that you

1264
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:39,558
know when we were out doing smoking

1265
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,318
really dank California weed and eating

1266
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:43,519
mushrooms on the parking lot out at the

1267
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:47,279
Grateful Dead shows that we were ahead

1268
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:48,719
of our time back in the 70s and 80s and

1269
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,920
you know those of us who followed the

1270
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:53,279
dead around I mean it was just so

1271
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:56,358
[ __ ] cool because that was just like

1272
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,599
this Flash in time that existed and we

1273
00:56:56,358 --> 00:57:00,759
Traverse this Millennium right I think

1274
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:02,760
most of the people here right that's

1275
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,440
really [ __ ] cool I have one kid born

1276
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,839
in one Millennium another kid born in

1277
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,679
another Liv I was alive during Jerry

1278
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:12,199
Garcia's lifetime really really

1279
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:15,078
important for me anyway so you know it's

1280
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:16,759
um it's at the end of the day we're all

1281
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:19,318
scientists we're all

1282
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:22,039
Explorers and you know there's nothing

1283
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:24,318
wrong with being inquisitive and wanting

1284
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:25,480
to learn more about your environment or

1285
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:26,920
what you're smoking or what you're

1286
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,559
growing and

1287
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,559
totally agree I think that that's really

1288
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:34,480
awesome Mark I think that you know what

1289
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:37,680
you're saying is true and inquisitivity

1290
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,960
is awesome and I love you of course um

1291
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:42,038
but you know as far as the EPA one thing

1292
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,318
that I did want to say is I think that

1293
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:48,960
we could entrust in more of these

1294
00:57:45,318 --> 00:57:52,279
overiding sort of Corporations or

1295
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:55,358
fractures of the government if their

1296
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:57,960
track record was more accountable when

1297
00:57:55,358 --> 00:58:00,199
we look at the EPA what have what they

1298
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:03,159
have allowed in and what they have

1299
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:05,960
allowed in to our soils and what has

1300
00:58:03,159 --> 00:58:07,960
happened to our soils with their

1301
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:11,240
allocations and their

1302
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:13,358
licensing to me should not have the word

1303
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:16,598
protection on it so I think what we

1304
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:19,199
continue to come down to is they're

1305
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:21,280
supposedly protecting us but their track

1306
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:27,000
record really doesn't show that they've

1307
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:29,599
done a very good job so I feel like

1308
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,119
the same way I'm not even talking all

1309
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,880
the way

1310
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:38,358
back for sure I

1311
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:40,838
just B we can bash Pharmaceuticals all

1312
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:42,679
we want but there's life-saving

1313
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:45,639
medication out there that's saving

1314
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:48,318
people's lives every day oh I'm not I'm

1315
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:51,519
not bashing that I feel like it's really

1316
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:52,759
important Pharmaceuticals and and what

1317
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,239
like you guys were talking about the

1318
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:57,720
pharmaceuticalization I mean that's

1319
00:58:55,239 --> 00:59:00,318
exactly what I'm working on I'm working

1320
00:58:57,719 --> 00:59:02,000
on trying to understand you know there

1321
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:04,558
was a really important paper that was

1322
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,920
published a couple weeks ago that that

1323
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:11,680
showed that um uh uh canabo acids and I

1324
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:14,000
think in particular cbga showed a

1325
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:17,558
complete blocking of something called

1326
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:21,798
store operated calcium influx which is a

1327
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:24,079
way that helpers uh uh tea cells turn on

1328
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:26,199
the release of pro-inflammatory cyto

1329
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,240
kindes this is extremely important

1330
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:30,798
didn't get any press whatsoever and it's

1331
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:33,959
an extremely important discovery that

1332
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:36,159
basically says how can avonoids work to

1333
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:38,280
control inflammation it's always just

1334
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:40,159
kind of like a black box so they they

1335
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,920
hit the cannaboid receptors then there's

1336
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:44,480
Downstream stuff that happens we don't

1337
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:48,240
really know this group has figured it

1338
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:51,318
out so to me I read that paper I've read

1339
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:54,000
that paper eight times I I'm just I'm so

1340
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:56,639
excited I'm so like this is the current

1341
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,079
Frontier this is right where

1342
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:00,960
knowledge ends and where we could start

1343
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:03,480
looking into the crystal ball on what

1344
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,960
could be and when you start looking at

1345
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:09,719
all these ways that you know cannaboids

1346
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,960
work on on the body I mean there there's

1347
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:17,358
no class of compounds like that that

1348
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:19,039
have the safety in humans the longterm

1349
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:21,759
you know I mean humans have been using

1350
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:24,119
cannabis for a while so if there was

1351
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,440
toxic you know effects we would we would

1352
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:30,240
have seen it we would have documented it

1353
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:32,039
uh Yasmin herd's um research at Mount Si

1354
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:34,798
New York is extremely important what

1355
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:38,400
what she has now shown and this is all

1356
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:41,440
very very recent research is that um uh

1357
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,920
cannabis use in adolescence affects the

1358
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,480
distribution of gray to white matter as

1359
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:49,240
the brain matures and this is extremely

1360
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:52,400
important and you can't say well okay

1361
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:55,558
yeah you know kids who smoke weed during

1362
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:57,838
those ages they can you know maybe have

1363
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:59,680
com IED I don't know intellectual

1364
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:02,239
capacity later on in life that's not

1365
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:04,598
really what they're saying but the the

1366
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:09,479
endoc canabo system and The cannaboid

1367
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:12,519
receptors are so important that it you

1368
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:14,798
couldn't imagine that using lots of

1369
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:17,318
cannabis isn't going to somehow affect

1370
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:19,199
it one way or another and I think her

1371
01:01:17,318 --> 01:01:21,400
research is really important to show

1372
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:24,838
that the last thing I want to say is

1373
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,838
this whole Renaissance

1374
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:42,798
and and and what they're finding is that

1375
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:46,118
uh people who are taking again very very

1376
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:49,440
modest doses six months later they're

1377
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:53,160
still showing efficacy in that treatment

1378
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:56,838
I it is just it's amazing and so I

1379
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:59,598
applaud the scientific Frontier in these

1380
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:03,199
areas which are moving faster and faster

1381
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:04,880
and faster as regulation changes and yes

1382
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:07,679
that is driven by profit and the

1383
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,599
almighty dollar I I I don't know I can't

1384
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:12,598
fix that and I don't think we can fix

1385
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:15,480
that on hash church but we can coexist

1386
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:17,960
in that system and make sure that your

1387
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:20,838
guys's knowledge is passed on to these

1388
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:23,278
people who are regul so basically there

1389
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:25,519
are products that are going to come out

1390
01:02:23,278 --> 01:02:28,480
that's going to mimic you know what you

1391
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:30,278
guys do fly right so you have to be part

1392
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,400
of that discussion and part of that

1393
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:34,679
regulation people are going to do this

1394
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,720
people are already doing this people

1395
01:02:34,679 --> 01:02:40,199
everything along the value chain I know

1396
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:41,959
atn's seen it for years if you could

1397
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:44,399
make it and you could sell it into the

1398
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:45,798
Cannabis industry it's going to go and

1399
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,798
it's going to go forward and it's going

1400
01:02:45,798 --> 01:02:49,199
to make money and it's going to grow and

1401
01:02:47,798 --> 01:02:52,000
before you know it you're going to be

1402
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:55,798
10,000 20,000 880,000 orders and you're

1403
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,798
G be oh I need to

1404
01:03:07,239 --> 01:03:12,679
sure you don't get a bunch of you know

1405
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:14,920
[ __ ] and and thieves and people who

1406
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:17,239
are poisoning people there has to be

1407
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,880
some government oversight and some

1408
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:21,639
regulation I don't know what the right

1409
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,240
level is it's not nuclear waste it's an

1410
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:25,358
herbal medication it needs to be

1411
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:28,118
regulated as such but if you're talking

1412
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:30,480
about treatments that go onto plants

1413
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:32,119
that are being mass-produced yeah

1414
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,278
they're going to regulate that kind of

1415
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:37,160
thing they should be they they always

1416
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:40,239
have should be but companies large

1417
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:42,278
companies were afraid to do the research

1418
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:44,399
to basically bring that package forward

1419
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:47,318
and say okay here's a fungicide that you

1420
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,880
can use on cannabis to control powdery

1421
01:03:47,318 --> 01:03:53,159
mildew you could apply it at this rate

1422
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:56,440
at this time and there's no degradation

1423
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:58,399
byproducts that are going to affect the

1424
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,400
the the end product I'm not saying that

1425
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,358
that product exists but in order for

1426
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,760
companies to develop that product they

1427
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:07,318
need a regulatory pathway and then

1428
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,400
they've just spent millions of dollars

1429
01:04:07,318 --> 01:04:11,199
they need to recoup that investment you

1430
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:13,760
know welcome to Big Business this is

1431
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:16,399
just that's and and Mark that's the

1432
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:19,760
thing that that they're motivated by of

1433
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:23,798
course by profit so they're Afra the the

1434
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:26,278
fear comes in when there's not enough uh

1435
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:29,960
security to protect the those

1436
01:04:26,278 --> 01:04:31,358
Investments so because right we we know

1437
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:33,559
we know they're going to be profitable I

1438
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:35,239
think if you look at that's not the

1439
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:38,319
issue that's not the issue that's just

1440
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:41,078
that's just accept it you just accept it

1441
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:43,679
you buy a Cheerio you buy a corporation

1442
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:47,000
you buy a car you buy a Tesla whatever

1443
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:49,719
you buy it's all H it's all

1444
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,318
contextualized within that understanding

1445
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,558
that's what capitalism is I drive a car

1446
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:56,199
as a matter of fact I have to go do that

1447
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:58,760
pretty soon so but and I think

1448
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:02,318
I think here like you just said it about

1449
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:06,240
being able to use cannabis in TB you're

1450
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:09,159
going to have this this job 50 years ago

1451
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:11,519
I had a TBI and as a matter of fact when

1452
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:14,759
I got it I was rolling a joint in the

1453
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:17,519
car that we we got in a car accident and

1454
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,119
it was Nevada so TBI or not I had to go

1455
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:24,079
back into that car and find that ounce

1456
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:26,480
or go to prison with a TBI um the the PO

1457
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,318
I think it's it's a profound important

1458
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,039
Point not everybody's going to be able

1459
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:33,079
to smoke roll joints and smoke them so

1460
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:37,039
that they can do mitigate their seizure

1461
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:39,599
onset there has to be a way to access

1462
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,079
science is is a tool a profound tool

1463
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:46,359
we're the [ __ ] the [ __ ] uper as you're

1464
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:48,960
saying is not the tool it never is and

1465
01:05:46,358 --> 01:05:52,639
neither is our what inspires us it's

1466
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:55,079
never the tool it's how we are changed

1467
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,798
and how we carry that forward what we're

1468
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:59,880
willing

1469
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:02,119
to what the cost is whether that's what

1470
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:06,640
we're willing to spend or what we demand

1471
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:09,920
of of others and so right now I think we

1472
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:13,558
are in a very tenuous position

1473
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:16,760
but you know as Sam

1474
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:19,880
said it's all perfect and that's

1475
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:21,440
eventuality not in the finite sense in

1476
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,559
the sense

1477
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:28,440
that you know in the quantum sense I

1478
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:30,720
mean have I sort of have said you know

1479
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,679
I'm going to just if it's all perfect in

1480
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:36,239
the quantum sense then I'm just going to

1481
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:38,838
step into that space because it makes

1482
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:38,838
what I can't

1483
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:56,960
handle just say yeah I can't wait to see

1484
01:06:54,838 --> 01:06:58,838
what you do Mar you got to share it

1485
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,240
share some of your course work that

1486
01:06:58,838 --> 01:07:03,838
you're well I I'll just finish and I I I

1487
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:07,239
think a ATN could probably provide a lot

1488
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:09,558
of a lot of um experience or at least

1489
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:11,798
maybe share some of experiences like

1490
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:13,240
when you're dealing with when you're

1491
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:15,038
dealing with vendors I'm not talking

1492
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:17,479
about people who are touching the plant

1493
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:19,359
I'm talking about every everything else

1494
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,519
everything else that supports going into

1495
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:25,119
that you're talking about you know

1496
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:28,599
people who have you know payrolls and

1497
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:31,599
and and and and employees and and those

1498
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:34,318
employees have you know benefits like

1499
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:37,240
health insurance so I I think it was

1500
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:39,920
really quick to see like when you go to

1501
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:42,439
like an MJ biscon that if there's

1502
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:45,880
something that can be innovated that can

1503
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:47,679
be sold into this industry it might be a

1504
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:50,640
corporation but it might just be a mom

1505
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:53,278
and pop Corporation two people just

1506
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:56,400
garage inventors who are coming up with

1507
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:58,278
the next little widget or all kinds of

1508
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,639
different you know Innovations because

1509
01:07:58,278 --> 01:08:05,760
we're kind of at the birth of this new

1510
01:08:01,639 --> 01:08:07,318
phase for the you know cannabis industry

1511
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,559
and I hate to use that word industry

1512
01:08:07,318 --> 01:08:11,400
because it always sounds like such a

1513
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:13,079
dirty word but it is industry come on

1514
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,920
for yeah I mean for for for the lack of

1515
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:17,798
a better word it's it's just the word

1516
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:20,239
that we use but the question is I guess

1517
01:08:17,798 --> 01:08:23,679
you know again when you have like

1518
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:27,879
especially with CBD and and the whole

1519
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:30,079
delta8 um Market Market the whole uh uh

1520
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:36,640
uh loop loophole that the farm bill

1521
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:38,679
created which created this um uh uh well

1522
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,159
it basically satisfied a market that was

1523
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:42,880
already created look people want to get

1524
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:45,358
high right and those people in most

1525
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:49,798
cannabis unfriendly states in the

1526
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:51,679
country are you know gun ho on Delta 8

1527
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:54,079
because people are making a [ __ ] ton of

1528
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:57,158
money and I've seen videos where I've

1529
01:08:54,079 --> 01:09:00,960
seen pallet rack three high like you'd

1530
01:08:57,158 --> 01:09:03,719
see like a Home Depot of finished goods

1531
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:05,719
going from somewhere to somewhere and

1532
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:08,719
those those products are being sold

1533
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:12,439
without any real process specification

1534
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:15,039
on this conversion of CBD to Delta 8 so

1535
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:17,519
there's a lot of other stuff in there

1536
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:20,640
and because it's unregulated unlike the

1537
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,640
stuff that ATN has to you know I mean

1538
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,679
everything that's sold in the regulated

1539
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:28,560
market Delta H says well [ __ ] you just

1540
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:30,880
going to do this in an unregulated

1541
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,440
fashion there we've all been there it

1542
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,239
will become regulated it's just it's

1543
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:38,439
only made it's only made possible

1544
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:42,079
through the prohibition of Delta 9 if if

1545
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:43,798
if there is no prohibition then we Delta

1546
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:46,198
we would think Delta eight is a version

1547
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:48,119
of covid or something you know Delta

1548
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:50,919
eight is irrelevant Delta eight is not

1549
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:52,920
extracted from the plant it's made as an

1550
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:56,480
active pharmaceutical ingredient from

1551
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:59,079
CBD isolate so this is a Market that

1552
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:01,599
exists because people want to get high

1553
01:09:59,079 --> 01:10:05,319
and if people want to get high they need

1554
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:08,280
cannabis grown Delta 9 not Delta eight

1555
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:11,198
made from CBD right it's only a matter

1556
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:13,639
of time it's just satisfying the it's

1557
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:15,238
the market this and this is really

1558
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:18,920
endemic of a

1559
01:10:15,238 --> 01:10:22,039
problem that's created when you're just

1560
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:25,319
when there's a a profit

1561
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:27,600
driven um uh creation so they're cre

1562
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:29,960
creting this because it's driven by

1563
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,719
profit so they can make M when you can

1564
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:33,399
just really get high it does you don't

1565
01:10:31,719 --> 01:10:36,319
need to go through all of

1566
01:10:33,399 --> 01:10:40,479
this those warehous that

1567
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:43,198
are facing and that's that and there you

1568
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:46,319
can we work it out on hash Church well

1569
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:50,879
it's it's always worth the conversation

1570
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:53,719
and this is why cannabis is legal

1571
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:57,079
whatever however long it's taken to some

1572
01:10:53,719 --> 01:10:59,279
degree it's legal but it's motivated the

1573
01:10:57,079 --> 01:11:02,479
legality has been motivated in two

1574
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:06,719
different ways one because people desire

1575
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:08,479
it know it it frees it helps to heal the

1576
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:12,359
Mind Body

1577
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:15,119
Consciousness and because of profit the

1578
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:17,639
potential to make great deal of money

1579
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:20,880
and because of that that we're sitting

1580
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:24,239
in the middle of a kind of mosh pit or

1581
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:26,239
and and I think that what can happen is

1582
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:29,959
that these conversations but really

1583
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:31,839
taking creating accountability forcing

1584
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,719
accountability um demanding

1585
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:38,520
accountability from you know you're

1586
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:41,439
never I won't I don't buy anything from

1587
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:44,040
Amazon it's a principled piece maybe

1588
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:46,479
those things will change maybe that

1589
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:49,519
industry that owns just about everything

1590
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:53,039
probably the house I live in pretty soon

1591
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:55,639
um or many people live in um I I think

1592
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:58,198
we have to really work from from this

1593
01:11:55,639 --> 01:12:01,239
space as individuals speak to our

1594
01:11:58,198 --> 01:12:02,279
community support our community and ask

1595
01:12:01,238 --> 01:12:05,158
of it the

1596
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:08,079
greatest the greatest

1597
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:10,479
possibility always asking for something

1598
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:12,719
greater because that's how we get it and

1599
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:15,319
we demand it from one another and from

1600
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,639
our communities and uh you know it's not

1601
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:20,238
going to get better if we don't if we

1602
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:23,159
buy into it only if we demand We join it

1603
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:24,678
you know that drop dropping out we

1604
01:12:23,158 --> 01:12:28,759
should have bought some radio stations

1605
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:31,480
and televis stations in the 60s you know

1606
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:34,520
um I'd like to add that you know the

1607
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:37,158
profit driven corporations were birthed

1608
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:39,120
out of something different you know the

1609
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:42,319
first time I really understood the

1610
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:44,960
importance of regulation in cannabis was

1611
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:47,079
not from a corporation but from my

1612
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:49,359
friends in Jamaica who were just growing

1613
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:51,800
weed on the side of a mountain and then

1614
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:53,880
you know I'm kind of like I made bubble

1615
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:56,000
one time with the flower and it was

1616
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:58,440
really [ __ ] up bubble and then I

1617
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,479
walked around my friend's field and what

1618
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:03,238
I found was some illegal fungicides that

1619
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:06,000
can't even be used in North America that

1620
01:13:03,238 --> 01:13:07,959
they just shipped to Jamaica and he used

1621
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,520
these and I we had a conversation later

1622
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,319
on that night on the beach and I asked

1623
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,800
him like what were you thinking and he

1624
01:13:11,319 --> 01:13:15,079
was like I was thinking of putting food

1625
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:18,000
on my table man like I can't afford to

1626
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:20,238
lose this crop and so it wasn't a big

1627
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,439
Corporation putting people at risk it

1628
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:25,359
was a poor Jamaican farmer who just

1629
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:27,839
wanted to feed his family and who was

1630
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:30,238
because there was no regulations he was

1631
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,440
able to do it but at the cost of every

1632
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:34,439
sing I mean John Burell smoked some of

1633
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:37,158
that bubble and he said that he got

1634
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:38,839
extremely sick from it it was really bad

1635
01:13:37,158 --> 01:13:41,439
keep in mind when we're concentrating

1636
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:43,319
the resins off of these plants often

1637
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:44,839
you'll concentrate these chemical

1638
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:47,158
powders that have been put onto the

1639
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:49,840
plant and are stuck on that resin so

1640
01:13:47,158 --> 01:13:51,198
it's not just corporations it's not just

1641
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,119
I got to pay my

1642
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:55,119
shareholders sometimes it goes all the

1643
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:56,639
way to the other side and it's I just

1644
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:58,559
just got to put food on the table I'm

1645
01:13:56,639 --> 01:14:01,239
not trying to buy a Ferrari I'm not

1646
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,480
trying to you know be some corporate

1647
01:14:01,238 --> 01:14:05,279
douche nozzle with a private jet I'm

1648
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:07,119
really just trying to feed my kids and

1649
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:10,119
maybe get them some shoes and some

1650
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:12,479
clothes and so that's the importance of

1651
01:14:10,119 --> 01:14:14,679
Regulation we need to have a little bit

1652
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:16,479
of it to to hold each other accountable

1653
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:19,840
and it's not always a corporation that

1654
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:23,279
you have to hold accountable sometimes

1655
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:25,760
it's talk who produced those additives a

1656
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:28,880
corporation

1657
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:32,400
right there is there is it's cyclic and

1658
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,560
it goes back you know it goes back there

1659
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:37,439
anyway I hate to jump out of this

1660
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:41,080

01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,800
grasslands uh for those that don't know

1684
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:43,719
what we're talking about great family of

1685
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:46,840
individuals really good Growers um but

1686
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:48,960
he calls Vermont home that's true he

1687
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:52,079
calls Vermont home so he's like us in

1688
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:55,000
East coaster so uh but yeah I mean look

1689
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:56,158
I I think over the years we we've all I

1690
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,880
think it was a lack of knowledge at

1691
01:15:56,158 --> 01:15:59,479
first in North America we were being we

1692
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,039
were using things on plants that we

1693
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:04,039
didn't know because we were so young at

1694
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:06,519
the time at least my crew was um green

1695
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:09,319
cure was was pushed on to us as a as a

1696
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:11,280
product to use to bring the pH level of

1697
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:14,559
the of you know the the surface level

1698
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:16,800
down so petrius and uh powdery mildew

1699
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,639
wouldn't grow but you know then later we

1700
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:21,039
learned that you can't light it on fire

1701
01:16:18,639 --> 01:16:23,520
right and and we've we've learned so

1702
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:25,519
much through trial and era and I think

1703
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,040
that's the honest truth from from my

1704
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:30,000
side of it is like we just didn't know

1705
01:16:28,039 --> 01:16:32,880
and we didn't have this big Community

1706
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,719
that's so open today um we didn't have

1707
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,199
conferences we didn't have like private

1708
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:39,399
events and seses where we were sharing

1709
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:42,000
you know like back to you know like I

1710
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:44,599
had Marcus on true sters.com chat room

1711
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:48,238
you know like and I we would chat and

1712
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:50,520
like plural [ __ ] and Kaka and ot1 and

1713
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:52,559
all these guys would jump in and and

1714
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:55,800
that was the only space that I really

1715
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:58,080
knew to ask live and direct questions

1716
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,880
that would have direct call and

1717
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:03,600
response um so I think it's it's also a

1718
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:07,159
bit of it all together and as we learn

1719
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:09,159
and evolve you know um having you know

1720
01:17:07,158 --> 01:17:11,238
Sage stages such as Kelly and Josh

1721
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:14,359
around and others like you that have

1722
01:17:11,238 --> 01:17:16,279
been so deep in in um just learning

1723
01:17:14,359 --> 01:17:18,920
about what agricultural me like

1724
01:17:16,279 --> 01:17:21,000
practices mean um and Consciousness

1725
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:23,279
means together and how that kind of um

1726
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,039
plays a role so that that's something

1727
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:28,439
that you know together we've we've kind

1728
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:30,719
of at least I should say personally I

1729
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:32,279
I've really you know it's been a battle

1730
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:35,239
and a learning experience this whole

1731
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:36,639
journey reading books from Rob Clark and

1732
01:17:35,238 --> 01:17:39,359
you know they they didn't tell you what

1733
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:40,960
not to do they told you what what to do

1734
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:43,599
what how to get rid of things and what

1735
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:45,198
to look for but there was never that in

1736
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,239
between conversation so I think those

1737
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:51,198
are the things that we have today that

1738
01:17:47,238 --> 01:17:54,399
just we just didn't have um for so many

1739
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:56,319
years cross and print right yeah it was

1740
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:58,238
it was it man I I read those books front

1741
01:17:56,319 --> 01:18:01,279
to back back to front every almost every

1742
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:02,559
day for years you know and that was just

1743
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:04,519
the way it was because I didn't have

1744
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,440
anywhere else to go there was no YouTube

1745
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:11,040
channels and there was no internet with

1746
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:13,678
information or or basis of but as as you

1747
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:15,760
stated I mean we started off as you know

1748
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:18,520
individual dispensaries and then we

1749
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,360
realized well I realized that I got sick

1750
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:23,960
from Cannabis off something I couldn't

1751
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:25,439
see and so in 2007 I was like well what

1752
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,880
are the standards for testing and

1753
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:27,919
everybody there's no standards for

1754
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,960
testing what do you mean there's no

1755
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,840
standards there's no one testing except

1756
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:33,679
the University of Mississippi right and

1757
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,119
so when I reached out to them to

1758
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:36,800
actually say hey can we get the

1759
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:39,079
standards they were

1760
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,400
like but right but but we need the

1761
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:43,198
standards and so there were no standards

1762
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:46,198
and of course I didn't know Sam at the

1763
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:49,919
time so you know I used Ethan Russo and

1764
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:52,119
others to find Arno and then bring

1765
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,800
smuggled him into the states with his

1766
01:18:52,119 --> 01:18:56,399
testing solution and then you know

1767
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,039
started to calibrate an actual

1768
01:18:56,399 --> 01:19:02,479
laboratory because I didn't want to kill

1769
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:04,880
people who have AIDS and cancer for the

1770
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:07,158
possibility that they could get a upper

1771
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:10,159
respiratory infection and of course I

1772
01:19:07,158 --> 01:19:12,279
know now that that was an actual plate

1773
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:15,439
test that would have determined that as

1774
01:19:12,279 --> 01:19:17,238
opposed to understanding the potency I

1775
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:19,479
started in that direction because that

1776
01:19:17,238 --> 01:19:21,519
sounded like a logical and found others

1777
01:19:19,479 --> 01:19:24,279
Addison and Steve dangelo and others who

1778
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:27,239
were also interested in doing that but

1779
01:19:24,279 --> 01:19:30,279
yeah if we didn't have our semi-legal

1780
01:19:27,238 --> 01:19:33,039
illegal dispensaries I mean we spent BPG

1781
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:35,519
over a million dollars ourselves in that

1782
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:37,279
testing okay who could have and in the

1783
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,080
Private Industry would have spent that

1784
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:43,399
money to actually do that testing to

1785
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:45,519
bring the at least the testing from THC

1786
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:48,439
and then finding CBD from the darkness

1787
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,639
into the light you know it was us that

1788
01:19:48,439 --> 01:19:52,919
took the chance because we realized

1789
01:19:50,639 --> 01:19:55,440
there was a hole and if we didn't

1790
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,960
necessarily fix that hole

1791
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:59,439
there's always going to be a hole there

1792
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:02,000
that we're always going to trip over so

1793
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:04,799
we even as I'm a professional lay

1794
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,719
scientist realized that I there there

1795
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,279
was science that needed to be so that I

1796
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:11,760
didn't kill the people that I were

1797
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:14,198
selling my quote unquote legal illegal

1798
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,360
cannabis to because I wanted to be an

1799
01:20:14,198 --> 01:20:18,678
ethical Steward because it felt right

1800
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:21,599
because I self-healed myself from

1801
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:23,800
Cannabis because of my Gulf War syndrome

1802
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,719
right because of my multiple chemical

1803
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:28,400
exposures because you know I was

1804
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:30,359
gunfighter in a war over oil okay I

1805
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:33,198
lived under the oil fields it was

1806
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:36,158
literally 28° under the oil fields

1807
01:20:33,198 --> 01:20:38,960
whereas un out from under the oil fields

1808
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:41,279
it was 120 degrees that's how thick the

1809
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:44,039
smoke was ladies and gentlemen and that

1810
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:47,039
of course destroyed my my nervous system

1811
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:49,319
and my you know immunity system to the

1812
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:51,679
point where I had to figure out how to

1813
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:53,719
heal myself and by figuring out from

1814
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:56,480
Cannabis and exercise was able to

1815
01:20:53,719 --> 01:20:58,480
stimulate my appetite T to eat motivated

1816
01:20:56,479 --> 01:21:01,439
me to say you know what I need to step

1817
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:03,718
outside myself and find a way to help

1818
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:06,678
others so sometimes we have to be self-

1819
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:08,399
impacted or find a way or someone in our

1820
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:09,600
lives that's been impacted because I

1821
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:11,638
cannot tell you how many people have

1822
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,000
come to me and said hey my family member

1823
01:21:11,639 --> 01:21:14,560
has this that and the other and they

1824
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,520
can't get it and I need to get it for

1825
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:20,719
them because there's no other way for us

1826
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:22,679
to go whereas two weeks ago my group the

1827
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:25,000
veterans Action Council was using

1828
01:21:22,679 --> 01:21:27,719
science on Capitol Hill we had 26

1829
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,479
meetings in two days and we were using

1830
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:34,520
that nasal spray that the Medics are

1831
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:36,119
using currently in Israel as the litmus

1832
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:38,080
because the majority of people we met

1833
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:40,039
with were on the veterans or armed

1834
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:42,519
services committee so they had military

1835
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:44,479
fellows there so what we found as the

1836
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:48,440
arrow through in the conversation was

1837
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:52,158
this TBI nasal spray because it caused

1838
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:54,158
immediate uh shrinkage and and non

1839
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:56,920
expansion that continues to happen in

1840
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:58,679
the brain well right now Israeli Medics

1841
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:01,399
have that in their kit and right now if

1842
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:03,639
you're hit with a TBI no matter what

1843
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:06,519
they are given this right there on the

1844
01:22:03,639 --> 01:22:08,719
spot and it is having great effect and

1845
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,639
when we talk to these fellows who are

1846
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:12,679
just military people in regular suits

1847
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:14,119
for the next year this is what got

1848
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:15,800
through them because they understood how

1849
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:18,039
many of their brothers and sisters are

1850
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:20,880
also suffering and will continue to

1851
01:22:18,039 --> 01:22:23,279
suffer from these TB because of the new

1852
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,520
level of warfare that we are

1853
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:27,439
experiencing are going to continue

1854
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:31,520
continue to experience and so this was a

1855
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:33,638
way of using a pharmaceutical product to

1856
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,719
loosen the the strings of prohibition

1857
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:38,279
because that mountain is still so high

1858
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:41,960
for us to move that we still have to

1859
01:22:38,279 --> 01:22:44,198
find the human aspect and the connection

1860
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:46,198
to make them realize oh this matters to

1861
01:22:44,198 --> 01:22:48,638
me why because my fellow soldiers could

1862
01:22:46,198 --> 01:22:50,599
benefit from this and we know that oh a

1863
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:51,960
lot of our military has to be taken care

1864
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:55,320
of and they're not being taken care of

1865
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:57,840
and these TBI follow every body to their

1866
01:22:55,319 --> 01:23:00,319
grave so it' be best as we can to do as

1867
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:03,119
best as possible to do as a preventative

1868
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:06,519
which as we know THC or ingestion of

1869
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:09,039
cannabis right after TBI seems to stop

1870
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:12,320
that and stop the advancement of that

1871
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:13,840
psychosis as well as the the the death

1872
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:17,198
which is the swelling of the brain

1873
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,800
itself which causes untold amounts of of

1874
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:21,759
Life damaging realities that not only

1875
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,520
does the soldier have to deal with but

1876
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,560
their family and their whole support

1877
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:28,600
units have to deal with with as well as

1878
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:30,639
we ourselves have to pay for it as their

1879
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:33,159
care yeah they have to be doing this on

1880
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:35,639
the sideline at the NFL as we've

1881
01:23:33,158 --> 01:23:37,839
tragically seen recently right that

1882
01:23:35,639 --> 01:23:41,279
these guys are out there getting their

1883
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:44,679
brains literally beat in and then

1884
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:47,479
somehow they let that guy go back out

1885
01:23:44,679 --> 01:23:49,920
and he got reinjured you know yeah and

1886
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:51,359
and it just it's [ __ ] nuts and the

1887
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,760
government knows it because they got

1888
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:56,960
their own patent on the neuroprotective

1889
01:23:53,760 --> 01:24:00,079
properties of cannaboids so I mean this

1890
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:02,840
is going to happen this is go this is

1891
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:05,800
going to happen like you said ATN the

1892
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:08,719
the the nasal spray is a quick immediate

1893
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:10,400
onset into the brain and so I think

1894
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:12,960
we're going to try to stack so we're

1895
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:16,279
gonna we're g we're actually writing a

1896
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:18,960
grant to DOD and NIH and others to

1897
01:24:16,279 --> 01:24:21,279
basically help pay for this work because

1898
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,679
this is really really important work and

1899
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:25,679
I think we all know it's going to work

1900
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:28,359
we're going to see the needle is going

1901
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:30,560
to move on this we don't know exactly

1902
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:32,719
you know again dose and you have to look

1903
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,159
at a lot of different impacts when

1904
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:37,399
you're trying to develop a new

1905
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:40,039
therapeutic for something like like this

1906
01:24:37,399 --> 01:24:41,960
but you can imagine if you can deliver

1907
01:24:40,039 --> 01:24:44,439
across the blood so the bread brain

1908
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:47,359
barrier is a very interesting kind of

1909
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:50,799
Gateway that limits what's in your

1910
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:52,799
bloodstream going into your brain and

1911
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,039
and so if you can get things across the

1912
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,279
bloodb brain barrier and what we know

1913
01:24:54,039 --> 01:24:58,840
about canabo because they're very

1914
01:24:56,279 --> 01:25:01,800
hydrophobic is that they can get in we

1915
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:04,600
can get canabo into the brain during

1916
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:07,079
that golden hour of trauma so there's

1917
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,880
that that right that one hour it's like

1918
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:13,158
you have an hour to basically intervene

1919
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:16,039
and even like with other brain disorders

1920
01:25:13,158 --> 01:25:18,279
ATM like stroke right now with stroke I

1921
01:25:16,039 --> 01:25:20,158
mean just take two aspirin and call me

1922
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:22,279
in the morning you know there's really

1923
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:25,000
no way of treating but you figure that

1924
01:25:22,279 --> 01:25:26,679
you know again maybe it's the fact that

1925
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,880
the government had a patent on it maybe

1926
01:25:26,679 --> 01:25:31,679
the fact that these things are off

1927
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:33,679
patent now and now in order for a

1928
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:35,639
pharmaceutical company to get the return

1929
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:38,520
on that investment they'd actually have

1930
01:25:35,639 --> 01:25:40,960
to develop new medications to see if

1931
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:45,040
they work you know I think again the

1932
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:48,039
phyto canabo can give us a clue on what

1933
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:51,118
might eventually be the treatment that

1934
01:25:48,039 --> 01:25:53,319
gets used you know that gets FDA

1935
01:25:51,118 --> 01:25:55,158
approval and all that kind of stuff but

1936
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:57,238
yeah all that research needs to be done

1937
01:25:55,158 --> 01:25:59,799
and it seems like you know again I I I

1938
01:25:57,238 --> 01:26:01,879
don't know why but when the NFL

1939
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:04,199
publicized that they were throwing a

1940
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:05,960
billion dollars at research they didn't

1941
01:26:04,198 --> 01:26:08,479
look at concussion at all they just

1942
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:11,800
looked at pain because all they want to

1943
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:14,799
do is dull the pain and send that drone

1944
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:17,079
back out onto the field because there's

1945
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,560
million dooll sponsors that need to make

1946
01:26:17,079 --> 01:26:21,960
money on that football game and I tell

1947
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:23,719
you what if you haven't seen it yet you

1948
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,960
you all should watch the movie

1949
01:26:23,719 --> 01:26:26,920
concussion

1950
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:29,198
with Will Smith yeah Will Smith's a dick

1951
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:32,039
and everything but anyway get beyond

1952
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:34,678
that and go watch that movie concussion

1953
01:26:32,039 --> 01:26:37,198
you'll never watch a football game in

1954
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:40,440
the same way again and you'll learn that

1955
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:43,839
again the NFL is basically conspiring to

1956
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:45,879
basically keep this thing quiet yeah

1957
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:49,920
they want to keep it under wraps right

1958
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:51,480
and it's the same treatment for soldiers

1959
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:55,279
it'd be the same kind of thing it'd be

1960
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:57,718
like Full Assault of avonoids into the

1961
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:59,759
brain during that golden hour trauma

1962
01:26:57,719 --> 01:27:01,520
maybe this could have saved Bob Saget's

1963
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,920
life right because Bob Saget the

1964
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:06,280
comedian they think he just fell in his

1965
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:08,960
bathtub or something hit his head fell

1966
01:27:06,279 --> 01:27:11,319
asleep and never woke up you know so

1967
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:14,039
there's definitely you know the canono

1968
01:27:11,319 --> 01:27:16,639
are are definitely on the therapeutic

1969
01:27:14,039 --> 01:27:19,198
you know radar to

1970
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:21,480
use these things not just to get high

1971
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:24,158
but to use them for their medical

1972
01:27:21,479 --> 01:27:25,959
benefits to treat disease like this was

1973
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:29,399
speaking with Rob Clark and Rob Clark

1974
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:31,920
said mulim said you know in the 80s that

1975
01:27:29,399 --> 01:27:33,519
within that hour if they smoked a joint

1976
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,840
just on the way to the

1977
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:40,000
hospital the amount of neuroprotection

1978
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:41,840
that is it's Untold uh but I'm very

1979
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,279
interested now because you brought up

1980
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:47,360
Strokes because as we know that when you

1981
01:27:44,279 --> 01:27:50,238
smoke cannabis it dilates or can dilate

1982
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:51,759
the uh the blood the blood vessels right

1983
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:53,718
so if you're having a stroke and you've

1984
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,639
got a blockage could that also send the

1985
01:27:53,719 --> 01:27:56,920
blockage

1986
01:27:54,639 --> 01:28:00,279
to another area and causing more danger

1987
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:03,440
so that's where I kind of wonder what

1988
01:28:00,279 --> 01:28:07,719
what I'm thinking ATN is just in sort of

1989
01:28:03,439 --> 01:28:09,439
like a a uh uh something where you're

1990
01:28:07,719 --> 01:28:11,639
going to take advantage of the

1991
01:28:09,439 --> 01:28:15,599
anti-inflamatory

1992
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:18,159
pro-apoptotic uh modes that so

1993
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,239
cannabinoids are biologically active on

1994
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:22,238
so many different levels and you would

1995
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:24,879
think again that the the best thing you

1996
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:27,678
could possibly do is get as much into

1997
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:30,480
your brain at that point right after

1998
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:33,639
that traumatic brain injury and and just

1999
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:35,759
see what happens you know I mean could

2000
01:28:33,639 --> 01:28:37,199
it be worse so there are there are

2001
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,639
people working on this and and

2002
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:41,439
cannaboids are definitely key but one of

2003
01:28:39,639 --> 01:28:45,159
the things you guys are missing the the

2004
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:48,158
most important factor are these um

2005
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:49,638
membrane bound extracellular vesicles

2006
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:53,198
that are called

2007
01:28:49,639 --> 01:28:55,960
exosomes exosomes have the ability to to

2008
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:57,519
get through the blood brain barrier um

2009
01:28:55,960 --> 01:29:00,920
my friend who works at the neurosurgery

2010
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:02,800
department in Florida uh Miami um Dr

2011
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:04,920
brentt Reynolds he discovered brain stem

2012
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,639
cells for his thesis in the late 80s

2013
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:09,639
brilliant guy awesome guy uh he's been

2014
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:11,480
doing some research uh at the University

2015
01:29:09,639 --> 01:29:14,760
on these exosomes and when they put

2016
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:16,519
exosomes into uh the nasal spray and up

2017
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:19,880
the nose they found that it was

2018
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:21,440
delivering a 45 times uh payload uh from

2019
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:24,639
any other method that they have at the

2020
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:26,158
University there 45 times um so they

2021
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,880
they are working on concussion

2022
01:29:26,158 --> 01:29:29,759
medications that'll be available in

2023
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:31,840
every not just professional athletes but

2024
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,079
your children's sports games as well

2025
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,279
where you'll be able to use these

2026
01:29:33,079 --> 01:29:38,399
exosomes and exosomes are produced by

2027
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:42,118
pretty much you know most cells like not

2028
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:44,638
only Mamon but also uh fungal and and

2029
01:29:42,118 --> 01:29:47,679
plant cells so what Dr Brent did was he

2030
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:49,920
um isolated exosomes from the hemp plant

2031
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:51,960
and low and behold those those those

2032
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:55,440
exosomes contain

2033
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:57,920
cannabinoids so this this is really

2034
01:29:55,439 --> 01:30:01,079
really exciting science and I hope that

2035
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:02,880
this little blip gets you lit Dr Mark

2036
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:06,079
and you start going out and reading a

2037
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:08,199
bunch of uh um articles on this because

2038
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:10,559
these exosomes people have been studying

2039
01:30:08,198 --> 01:30:16,238
them for probably about 20 to 30 years

2040
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:18,000
now but um I'm not so send me a link or

2041
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:20,039
something like that I can send you a ton

2042
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,079
of papers I have about a dozen papers

2043
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:24,639
that I can send you on exomes and you

2044
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:26,279
you will be very excited because

2045
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:29,118
like I said you can extract them from

2046
01:30:26,279 --> 01:30:31,559
the cannabis plants and they do contain

2047
01:30:29,118 --> 01:30:33,599
cannabinoids in in the exosomes exosomes

2048
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:36,679
are used for cells to communicate with

2049
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:38,760
one another so they send they and and Dr

2050
01:30:36,679 --> 01:30:41,440
Brent even under you know the belief

2051
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:43,560
system now that the a lot of the amazing

2052
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:46,519
work that is being done with with stem

2053
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:48,760
cells are actually their exosomes that

2054
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:50,639
they're releasing to communicate so

2055
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:54,440
everyone there's your homework for the

2056
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:56,440
uh week exosome EXO o m uh they're

2057
01:30:54,439 --> 01:30:57,960
membrane bound extracellular vesicles

2058
01:30:56,439 --> 01:31:01,238
that are produced in the endosomal

2059
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:02,880
compartment of most eukariotic cells and

2060
01:31:01,238 --> 01:31:05,559
uh they're interesting they're they're

2061
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:08,840
nanoscopic they're like 20 to 80

2062
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:10,679
nanometers and uh they definitely break

2063
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:14,039
the blood brain

2064
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:17,560
barrier nature along with medicinal

2065
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:19,920
mushrooms so let's let's make sure the

2066
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:21,800
medical medicinal mushrooms continue to

2067
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,520
be in the conversation when we're

2068
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:26,639
talking about blood they produce exome

2069
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:28,280
they produce exosomes and if you if you

2070
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:29,840
extract the exosomes from medicinal

2071
01:31:28,279 --> 01:31:32,359
mushrooms you'll find the medicinal

2072
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:36,279
compounds from those mushrooms in those

2073
01:31:32,359 --> 01:31:40,000
exomes it's unbelievable the system is

2074
01:31:36,279 --> 01:31:43,079
perfect and they are bioavailable to our

2075
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,960
body immediately and you know they help

2076
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:48,439
our body's receptors and neur and

2077
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:51,639
neurology become more regenerative they

2078
01:31:48,439 --> 01:31:55,479
regenerate they if if every cell in our

2079
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:57,359
body has 380 trillion pathogens in it

2080
01:31:55,479 --> 01:31:59,718
basically every single cell which how

2081
01:31:57,359 --> 01:32:02,319
many cells 180 million I forget how many

2082
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:04,319
cells are in the body but every 180

2083
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:06,840
trillion right yeah and then every one

2084
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:08,519
of those cells has 380 trillion

2085
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:11,560
pathogens and it I mean it really shows

2086
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:13,560
you that exosomes and and when your when

2087
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:16,800
your body's exuding it's because it's

2088
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:18,840
out of balance and and it allows those

2089
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,880
pathogens out of the cells it creates an

2090
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:24,039
environment where that part of the cell

2091
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:27,400
can exude and so that's why this help

2092
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:30,079
and well-being regiment this this nod to

2093
01:32:27,399 --> 01:32:33,118
herbalism and micology comes back in

2094
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:36,279
because that group of people never got

2095
01:32:33,118 --> 01:32:39,719
into chemicals and they continued to to

2096
01:32:36,279 --> 01:32:42,719
to walk that line of of cellular

2097
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:45,319
regeneration and bioavailability to

2098
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:47,480
where your body doesn't have to it can

2099
01:32:45,319 --> 01:32:49,639
accept it so that's why it's important

2100
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:51,439
it's why it continues to show up at the

2101
01:32:49,639 --> 01:32:54,199
table it's why it continues to be part

2102
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:56,879
of the conversations because it's

2103
01:32:54,198 --> 01:32:58,638
natural to us and it helps ourselves

2104
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:01,400
Kelly's been doing amazing work with

2105
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:03,359
athletes and Trauma uh in mountain

2106
01:33:01,399 --> 01:33:06,399
biking and specifically downhill

2107
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:09,559
mountain biking and uh with Incredible

2108
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:12,479
fractures incredible breaks concussions

2109
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:15,560
people hidden trees rocks that and and

2110
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:18,198
working with top athletes which also

2111
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:21,199
have all kinds of sponsors that need

2112
01:33:18,198 --> 01:33:23,839
them to do you know 720s and back flips

2113
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:25,719
and trips and all the things and you

2114
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,560
know they they can't be out for a whole

2115
01:33:25,719 --> 01:33:30,639
summer and so I would love maybe Kelly

2116
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:33,600
will get into it but uh you know to

2117
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:35,960
bring in professional athletes is also a

2118
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:38,960
type of trauma it's different than

2119
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:41,118
soldiers of course but it's trauma quick

2120
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:42,760
trauma fast and it can really affect you

2121
01:33:41,118 --> 01:33:44,960
for the rest of your how many people

2122
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:47,119
have fallen and for the rest of their

2123
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,399
life they talk about this fall that you

2124
01:33:47,118 --> 01:33:51,599
know made it to where they can't do all

2125
01:33:49,399 --> 01:33:54,399
this stuff play soccer all whatever it

2126
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:58,079
is so if you actually deal with the

2127
01:33:54,399 --> 01:34:00,439
trauma proper you know your body can

2128
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:02,198
rebalance when you find the compounds

2129
01:34:00,439 --> 01:34:05,839
that break the blood brain barrier then

2130
01:34:02,198 --> 01:34:08,479
it allows your body to function at its

2131
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:10,840
organic chemistry higher level higher

2132
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:12,519
self and with that I really appreciate

2133
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:15,159
and love you all I have to go outside

2134
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:18,320
and do some work some hand digging on

2135
01:34:15,158 --> 01:34:21,559
the in the earth and stuff so big big

2136
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:23,880
love to all you all and every fractal of

2137
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:27,719
knowledge that comes out of us you know

2138
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:30,239
is a positive one a special big up to

2139
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:32,239
Wade laughter haven't heard enough from

2140

2142
01:34:35,319 --> 01:34:42,279
you uh and your journey on Earth and and

2143

thank you so much blessed

2145
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:51,439
love Yeah and Josh had mentioned I've

2146
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,360
been I have been working with a lot of

2147
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:54,158
people with heavy duty brain trauma and

2148
01:34:53,359 --> 01:34:59,000
I

2149
01:34:54,158 --> 01:35:02,039
also am a brain trauma you know I think

2150
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:04,880
an incredible success story um when I

2151
01:35:02,039 --> 01:35:08,359
was seven years old I had a car accident

2152
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:10,239
um that I lost my sight for a long

2153
01:35:08,359 --> 01:35:11,158
period of time and I was cross side for

2154
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:14,678
nine

2155
01:35:11,158 --> 01:35:17,238
months um and and it you know was not

2156
01:35:14,679 --> 01:35:19,920
only an incredible concussion but it

2157
01:35:17,238 --> 01:35:23,039
broke my skull so I have an opening in

2158
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:26,279
my skull and then from that I have

2159
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:30,039
suffered really tremendous

2160
01:35:26,279 --> 01:35:32,479
um uh I mean headaches I I don't really

2161
01:35:30,039 --> 01:35:34,719
even you know it's beyond migraines it's

2162
01:35:32,479 --> 01:35:36,718
a migraine that goes beyond and so when

2163
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:40,719
my brain has been looked at in a CAT

2164
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:44,118
scan or in any other MRIs I have

2165
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:48,319
showings of maybe a thousand Different

2166
01:35:44,118 --> 01:35:52,599
Strokes in my brain so I had the ability

2167
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:56,359
to either go totally natural which is

2168
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:58,800
why a lot lot of where I'm coming from

2169
01:35:56,359 --> 01:36:01,839
and I'm I'm really tried and true and I

2170
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:04,159
work with several hundred patients right

2171
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:06,480
now I call them gems I don't even want

2172
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:08,599
to call people patients I don't I don't

2173
01:36:06,479 --> 01:36:10,118
even feel like it's a practitioner or

2174
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:13,360
it's a this or it's a that or it's a

2175
01:36:10,118 --> 01:36:15,519
Seeker it's just being human on this

2176
01:36:13,359 --> 01:36:18,880
planet right now is traumatizing in and

2177
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:21,840
of itself being in a body is yet another

2178
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,600
traumatizing thing in and of itself with

2179
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,960
all of the different toxins that it's

2180
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:28,280
sitting in all of the different Wars of

2181
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:29,920
different whatever spiritual means

2182
01:36:28,279 --> 01:36:33,118
whatever you want to talk about we're

2183
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:35,560
getting hit on all levels so the reason

2184
01:36:33,118 --> 01:36:38,439
why I'm G to continue to be the voice

2185
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:42,719
for nature is because I understand that

2186
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:46,158
in a way that I don't need to look

2187
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:48,198
towards other things I understand that

2188
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:50,638
of course science is a

2189
01:36:48,198 --> 01:36:53,039
representation of nature of course

2190
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:54,118
science is a way for us to explain

2191
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:55,238
nature

2192
01:36:54,118 --> 01:36:57,479
but it's the

2193
01:36:55,238 --> 01:37:00,000
misrepresentation of where science has

2194
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:03,158
to go to where then we have to correct

2195
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:06,039
it because ATN you're talking about so

2196
01:37:03,158 --> 01:37:09,359
many important things what you're

2197
01:37:06,039 --> 01:37:12,479
talking about is is is compassion Beyond

2198
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:16,519
and yet I hear so many different

2199
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:19,678
dichotomies and fractures of Science and

2200
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:22,040
War and and industry has caused these

2201
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:26,239
ailments for then people to have to go

2202
01:37:22,039 --> 01:37:28,840
and seek nature to then go and seek more

2203
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:32,158
science because people are utilizing

2204
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:34,920
what is registered and what is allocated

2205
01:37:32,158 --> 01:37:37,479
by maybe the EPA or science to then try

2206
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:41,719
to get it out of them to then go back to

2207
01:37:37,479 --> 01:37:44,759
nature which is exactly what V said it's

2208
01:37:41,719 --> 01:37:46,279
cyclical and maybe cyclical starts with

2209
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:50,679
an

2210
01:37:46,279 --> 01:37:53,000
SI because humans just tend to do that

2211
01:37:50,679 --> 01:37:55,359
and I think what we really can do is we

2212
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:58,000
can come together and have this

2213
01:37:55,359 --> 01:38:00,118
beautiful understanding that all of the

2214
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,599
beautiful points of science that are

2215
01:38:00,118 --> 01:38:06,238
truly trying to help us without monetary

2216
01:38:03,599 --> 01:38:08,159
need without the lobbying without all of

2217
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:10,479
the government control because community

2218
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:13,519
care because what you're talking about

2219
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:16,319
with ATN and I know definitely you know

2220
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:18,159
that's where you're at with Mark so I

2221
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:20,960
think that there's people on the planet

2222
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:23,519
who are utilizing these great knowledges

2223
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:26,039
for good and then people who are using

2224
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:29,280
utilizing these great knowledges just

2225
01:38:26,039 --> 01:38:32,479
for money and profit to push forward a

2226
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:35,800
possible ego or competition but really

2227
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:39,000
what it comes down to is that there are

2228
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:41,440
people who need to heal and that is

2229
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:44,238
where we are going to reach the highest

2230
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:46,759
Collective consciousness of all of us

2231
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:49,638
because we're all at that highest level

2232
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:51,880
of healing that we all understand and

2233
01:38:49,639 --> 01:38:53,719
we're all following that highest level

2234
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:56,400
of healing that's where where we're

2235
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:58,840
going to actually go to the next level

2236
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:01,439
that's what we're all seeking we're all

2237
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:03,199
seeking that and I just wanted to say

2238
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:05,439
that first of all I appreciate

2239
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:07,678

2240
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:10,198

01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:07,920
cannabinoids 88.9%

2263
01:40:10,158 --> 01:40:16,559
Turpin I'm smoking on some beautiful

2264
01:40:13,238 --> 01:40:19,598
Bubba width flower that just came off

2265
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:23,400
the hangers from this year

2266
01:40:19,599 --> 01:40:25,960
2022 and uh obviously it's a really ni

2267
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:28,519
nice uplifting

2268
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:30,880
sativa with some really beautiful headyy

2269
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:32,760
space thank you to the breeder of that

2270
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:36,760
and I can't remember who it

2271
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:38,000
was and Ed Chen I just wanted to say

2272
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:41,480
that

2273
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:46,118
uh when did you start doing your lab

2274
01:40:41,479 --> 01:40:47,439
testing was that in 2008 or soon after

2275
01:40:46,118 --> 01:40:52,079
uh we started in

2276
01:40:47,439 --> 01:40:54,678
2007 and I had to switch Labs so 2008 is

2277
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:56,840
when I really had an a real lab and I

2278
01:40:54,679 --> 01:40:59,118
know you were doing it you know decade

2279
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:01,760
before but the the lab we were doing

2280
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:05,039
with was in Berkeley they were doing um

2281
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:09,719
over testing for uh novaris and bear so

2282
01:41:05,039 --> 01:41:12,158
they had six HV plc's and uh like four

2283
01:41:09,719 --> 01:41:16,399
uh gas chromatograph so I knew that I

2284
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:19,238
had uh sound um scientists who could at

2285
01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:21,118
least and then we brought Arno over to

2286
01:41:19,238 --> 01:41:24,198
teach us the extraction because back

2287
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:25,359
then it's $10,000 fine per test right if

2288
01:41:24,198 --> 01:41:28,039
you're caught with cannabis in a

2289
01:41:25,359 --> 01:41:30,519
laboratory so he taught us to do the

2290
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:34,800
suspended solution so we would take the

2291
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:37,960
100% alcohol shake the cannabis for um

2292
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:42,159
grind it at at an equal part then put it

2293
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:44,480
into a um a tube and then shake it for

2294
01:41:42,158 --> 01:41:46,719
one minute and then we would extract

2295
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:49,158
that and then that solution then we

2296
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:50,639
would take to the laboratory and then

2297
01:41:49,158 --> 01:41:54,559
that's what we would do that's what we

2298
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:57,159
would do 1500 tests on between yeah I I

2299
01:41:54,560 --> 01:42:00,400
I understand what you're saying is the

2300
01:41:57,158 --> 01:42:02,960
parts uh were so low of the active

2301
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:05,118
ingredient but in a measured amount that

2302
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:08,599
you could use it for calibration of your

2303
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:11,279
gc's and hlc's but it wasn't illegal to

2304
01:42:08,599 --> 01:42:14,239
have the

2305
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:16,920
standard also too reme remember that

2306
01:42:14,238 --> 01:42:20,198
when two they first started testing in

2307
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:24,840
California and in the Netherlands also

2308
01:42:20,198 --> 01:42:28,919
more than 80% closer to 85 % of all of

2309
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:30,440
the samples tested had uh either

2310
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:35,000
pesticides

2311
01:42:30,439 --> 01:42:37,359
insecticides Andor micro so uh yeah

2312
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,479
protection for the consumer absolutely

2313
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:41,479
was

2314
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:43,879
needed hey Sam I have a question for you

2315
01:42:41,479 --> 01:42:47,158
um when you guys when you and Rob were

2316
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:51,159
doing your work at War Farm was was

2317
01:42:47,158 --> 01:42:52,679
there um any sort of testing that was at

2318
01:42:51,158 --> 01:42:56,319
your fingertips when you guys were doing

2319
01:42:52,679 --> 01:42:58,440
that work or was it um hard to to do

2320
01:42:56,319 --> 01:43:02,759
that type of work or no

2321
01:42:58,439 --> 01:43:06,638
no we had a legally licensed lab we had

2322
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:08,800
hlc a prep HL prep so for isolating

2323
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:11,920
small single amounts you know Gram

2324
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:15,920
amounts of a of a single cannaboid and

2325
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:20,800
we had uh GCF for doing Turpin and

2326
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:24,960
canono also I preferred a GC because uh

2327
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:29,320
when you smoke cannabis or VAP it uh

2328
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:33,000
you're actually uh destroying part of it

2329
01:43:29,319 --> 01:43:36,319
and when a GC does its work it destroys

2330
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,960
part of this of the sample you put in so

2331
01:43:36,319 --> 01:43:42,679
it's it's closer to what people are

2332
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:45,520
actually consuming then hplc will show

2333
01:43:42,679 --> 01:43:48,639
you know the acid and the neutral uh

2334
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:51,159
elements but uh it doesn't really show

2335
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:53,719
what is being delivered to a person not

2336
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:55,519
that a GC is exactly the same as a

2337
01:43:53,719 --> 01:43:59,639
person but it's

2338
01:43:55,520 --> 01:44:01,520
closer started we started with GCS and

2339
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:04,719
the problem

2340
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:07,119
the coming up the Machinery so badly

2341
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:10,319
that that's why they gravitated toward

2342
01:44:07,118 --> 01:44:12,399
the V uvh plcs is because of the

2343
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:14,559
maintenance that was happening because

2344
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:17,879
of the turnover at the at the gas

2345
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:17,880
chromatographs because of the

2346
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:24,678
ignition now the a so hlc is used so you

2347
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:26,599
could quantify plant material and plant

2348
01:44:24,679 --> 01:44:29,079
material is enriched with cannaboid

2349
01:44:26,599 --> 01:44:31,960
acids what they often do is they just

2350
01:44:29,079 --> 01:44:35,000
apply the correction to correct for

2351
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:38,279
after decarbox silation what the canabo

2352
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,920
acid which is measured this produces

2353
01:44:38,279 --> 01:44:42,359
this amount of cannabinoid so they

2354
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:46,279
should have like either what's called a

2355
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:49,960
total THC or or theoretical

2356
01:44:46,279 --> 01:44:51,880
THC but um yeah I mean Sam that's true

2357
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:53,599
that you know what you smoke is what

2358
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:57,679
what it goes up to T

2359
01:44:53,599 --> 01:45:00,719
but um I think for um to be more precise

2360
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:02,840
on on what is actually in the plant and

2361
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:05,158
especially if you're doing native like

2362
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:08,679
live resin extractions or if you're

2363
01:45:05,158 --> 01:45:13,479
making you know again really quality

2364
01:45:08,679 --> 01:45:16,158
hash and and turning it into rosin um

2365
01:45:13,479 --> 01:45:17,799
really having the canabo acid profile is

2366
01:45:16,158 --> 01:45:20,719
going to give you more

2367
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:24,520
complete understanding of what that oil

2368
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:26,158
actually is agree absolutely with you

2369
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:29,360
Mark about

2370
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:32,039
hlc's but I'm I'm just saying that if

2371
01:45:29,359 --> 01:45:34,880
you want to know what happens what the

2372
01:45:32,039 --> 01:45:38,519
THC level that's being delivered to an

2373
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:40,359
average smoker in a joint then a GC was

2374
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:42,760
actually more valuable to us for that

2375
01:45:40,359 --> 01:45:42,759
one

2376
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,920
aspect yeah now there's a there's an

2377
01:45:46,359 --> 01:45:50,039
issue I know if you're dealing with this

2378
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:53,118
at all ATN that there's a so-called

2379
01:45:50,039 --> 01:45:56,079
thing called lab shopping where uh

2380
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:59,359
producers are again going around to

2381
01:45:56,079 --> 01:46:03,399
different labs and trying to get you

2382
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:06,920
know the highest potency results that

2383
01:46:03,399 --> 01:46:10,719
they can possibly get on large batches

2384
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:13,639
reproducibly so they can have a more

2385
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:17,679
reliable you know route to Market

2386
01:46:13,639 --> 01:46:19,840
without it you know uncovering you know

2387
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:21,880
people trying to negotiate to lower

2388
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:25,000
prices because again this is also just a

2389
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:27,319
pain of prohibition I think is that

2390
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:30,719
there is a downward pressure on

2391
01:46:27,319 --> 01:46:33,039
producers to basically you know I mean

2392
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:35,960
again the margin especially if you look

2393
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:37,880
at a mature State like California is is

2394
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:40,118
the margins that you're seeing at the

2395
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:44,359
dispensary and distributor levels are

2396
01:46:40,118 --> 01:46:47,158
certainly not um equal equalized across

2397
01:46:44,359 --> 01:46:49,880
the whole production supply chain and

2398
01:46:47,158 --> 01:46:52,118
certainly I think like if you look at

2399
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:55,359
states that are rolling out new programs

2400
01:46:52,118 --> 01:46:58,039
where you have vertically integrated um

2401
01:46:55,359 --> 01:47:02,079
organizations where underneath one

2402
01:46:58,039 --> 01:47:04,760
license or a group of licenses you have

2403
01:47:02,079 --> 01:47:08,238
cultivation extraction

2404
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:12,440
manufacturing and dispensing I I know

2405
01:47:08,238 --> 01:47:14,559
California inserts distribution right so

2406
01:47:12,439 --> 01:47:17,319
those so those Distributors can make a

2407
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:20,000
lot of money but really so my son who's

2408
01:47:17,319 --> 01:47:23,079
out in LA right now and doing really

2409
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,639
well I mean just to break into that

2410
01:47:23,079 --> 01:47:28,519
Market is really difficult because you

2411
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:31,679
really need to have some kind of

2412
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:35,639
stratification through that

2413
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:39,520
distribution dispensing Market to get

2414
01:47:35,639 --> 01:47:42,760
enough volume to make your teeny weeny

2415
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:45,080
margin yeah enough to pay the bills

2416
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:47,159
right Colin you're you're hitting it on

2417
01:47:45,079 --> 01:47:50,238
the head man but it's uh but yeah but

2418
01:47:47,158 --> 01:47:52,559
like I also find it at at what Marcus

2419
01:47:50,238 --> 01:47:53,718
said earlier with the with spraying and

2420
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,360
and I IPM

2421
01:47:53,719 --> 01:47:58,158
management it's also on the farmers end

2422
01:47:56,359 --> 01:47:59,960
they're they're looking for higher coas

2423
01:47:58,158 --> 01:48:01,638
too so they can sell it into the market

2424
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:04,000
because that helps them right because

2425
01:48:01,639 --> 01:48:06,440
there's this weird smoke and mirrors

2426
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,158
that Tac means something right and

2427
01:48:06,439 --> 01:48:12,039
quality is not quantitated and

2428
01:48:09,158 --> 01:48:13,879
quantitated through any of these numbers

2429
01:48:12,039 --> 01:48:17,439
it's a glimpse of what's there in terms

2430
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:20,880
of weight and chemical classes right so

2431
01:48:17,439 --> 01:48:23,000
so this is the problem right the current

2432
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:25,199
issue right now that's led to this so

2433
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,880
called phenomenon called lab shopping is

2434
01:48:25,198 --> 01:48:30,118
that is that when you get bud at the

2435
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:32,199
dispensary it's not Dy there's still

2436
01:48:30,118 --> 01:48:34,479
moisture in it right and so certainly

2437
01:48:32,198 --> 01:48:37,238
like if you're looking at a COA and

2438
01:48:34,479 --> 01:48:39,799
you're reporting potencies based on a

2439
01:48:37,238 --> 01:48:43,479
dried weight basis dried weight means

2440
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:48,119
bone dry that means no water so you have

2441
01:48:43,479 --> 01:48:51,118
to really have good technique to do the

2442
01:48:48,118 --> 01:48:54,158
water activity measurement to understand

2443
01:48:51,118 --> 01:48:55,799
what fraction of that cannabis as

2444
01:48:54,158 --> 01:48:58,638
received at the dispensary because it's

2445
01:48:55,800 --> 01:49:00,840
not bone dry right it has moisture it

2446
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:02,920
has like 12 so but Mark here here's

2447
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:05,279
where I'd argue through my Journeys and

2448
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:06,639
even the last month where I had an issue

2449
01:49:05,279 --> 01:49:09,359
not even an issue this is just how it

2450
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:12,599
went where I sent a batch in had 12 or

2451
01:49:09,359 --> 01:49:16,198
11% or 9% moisture right I sent it in

2452
01:49:12,599 --> 01:49:18,159
right that was the the R&amp;D COA they they

2453
01:49:16,198 --> 01:49:21,399
tested it and it said they said that it

2454
01:49:18,158 --> 01:49:23,719
had 12% moisture yeah and the tack was

2455
01:49:21,399 --> 01:49:26,679
actually higher then lower moisture

2456
01:49:23,719 --> 01:49:30,639
content one that they had sent me and it

2457
01:49:26,679 --> 01:49:30,639
was again these are the

2458
01:49:30,679 --> 01:49:38,800
the it was the same lab right so same

2459
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:41,599
lab same same you know same even within

2460
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:44,360
a lab it's statistically problematic to

2461
01:49:41,599 --> 01:49:46,560
make comparisons because there's so much

2462
01:49:44,359 --> 01:49:48,799
[ __ ] variation here correct and so

2463
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:53,599
what what this really relies on is the

2464
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:55,960
fact that so when you so so okay how do

2465
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:58,039
to describe this quickly so you have to

2466
01:49:55,960 --> 01:50:00,679
do the water activity measurement right

2467
01:49:58,039 --> 01:50:03,279
the water act so actually there was a

2468
01:50:00,679 --> 01:50:06,760
woman who gave a really good talk on

2469
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:09,439
this at the online cannabis Symposium

2470
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:12,520
that I think is on YouTube and I think

2471
01:50:09,439 --> 01:50:16,719
she's also giving the American Chemical

2472
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:18,719
society's um Journal Club a presentation

2473
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:21,359
this month I think if you Google it her

2474
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:23,198
name is Jenny I think and she gave a

2475
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:26,238
great talk on it and just describes

2476
01:50:23,198 --> 01:50:28,359
exactly what this phenomena is and so so

2477
01:50:26,238 --> 01:50:30,678
so what you need to do is when you're

2478
01:50:28,359 --> 01:50:34,079
when you're assessing potency and you're

2479
01:50:30,679 --> 01:50:37,079
reporting it on as it it's different

2480
01:50:34,079 --> 01:50:39,000
than dried weight right and and Colin

2481
01:50:37,079 --> 01:50:40,920
this is really you know important and

2482
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:44,520
again goes to what Sam was saying is

2483
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:47,279
that when they're determining the

2484
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:50,040
moisture content in a moisture balance

2485
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:52,158
which is just a little mini oven that

2486
01:50:50,039 --> 01:50:54,439
you put a sample on it just weighs

2487
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:56,759
before and after that just you heat it

2488
01:50:54,439 --> 01:51:01,000
up the water goes away but what else

2489
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:04,840
happens tpin go away right can abinoid

2490
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:07,238
DEC carboxilate so now you've totally

2491
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:09,199
changed everything you no longer have

2492
01:51:07,238 --> 01:51:12,118
the same denominator that you had when

2493
01:51:09,198 --> 01:51:14,598
you started with that experiment so AR

2494
01:51:12,118 --> 01:51:17,359
that's why we used to use the glass

2495
01:51:14,599 --> 01:51:20,679
desiccator so we do leave it in it

2496
01:51:17,359 --> 01:51:24,719
overnight with uh those blue crystals

2497
01:51:20,679 --> 01:51:26,960
that turn right right right that's that

2498
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:29,840
get rid an indicator in there that tells

2499
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:32,880
you that that would get rid of 99% of

2500
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:35,319
the moisture not 100% but as close as we

2501
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:37,319
could get in our lab in an easy way and

2502
01:51:35,319 --> 01:51:40,840
that's what we always did before we

2503
01:51:37,319 --> 01:51:43,399
tested anything with our GC but Sam the

2504
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:46,319
key thing is you're not heating it up

2505
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:49,000
right no we're not heating it up at all

2506
01:51:46,319 --> 01:51:51,599
okay so when you're in a Cannabis

2507
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Testing Lab and you have hundreds of

2508
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:57,480
samples do you think you can wait for

2509
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,719
desicator so

2510
01:51:57,479 --> 01:52:01,519
again what this woman showed is that you

2511
01:51:59,719 --> 01:52:04,198
could do just do a room temperature

2512
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:06,760
vacuum desiccation and even at that room

2513
01:52:04,198 --> 01:52:09,839
temperature vacuum desiccation you're

2514
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:12,079
still losing a big chunk of tpes but

2515
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:14,360
you're not doing the cannaboid

2516
01:52:12,078 --> 01:52:16,399
decarbox and it turns out again when

2517
01:52:14,359 --> 01:52:19,880
you're when you're testing something and

2518
01:52:16,399 --> 01:52:22,679
you're in the 20% regime of canabo total

2519
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:25,319
canabo uh that amount of CO2 is

2520
01:52:22,679 --> 01:52:27,440
significant so when you DEC carboxilate

2521
01:52:25,319 --> 01:52:30,519
it and again this is the going back to

2522
01:52:27,439 --> 01:52:32,359
the original discussion about using gas

2523
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:36,679
chromatography which is when you

2524
01:52:32,359 --> 01:52:37,839
decarbox it you're you you you've

2525
01:52:36,679 --> 01:52:40,279
chemically

2526
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:41,719
altered the the the plant there's no

2527
01:52:40,279 --> 01:52:43,559
other way of saying it I know what

2528
01:52:41,719 --> 01:52:45,560
you're saying Sam that while you're

2529
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:48,079
smoking it when you're decarboxylating

2530
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:50,880
it but if someone's using it as like a

2531
01:52:48,078 --> 01:52:54,679
tincture or if I know some people who

2532
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:57,800
are now putting live rosin into gummies

2533
01:52:54,679 --> 01:53:00,359
and they taste delicious they taste like

2534
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:03,159
the rosin Trad they were derived man

2535
01:53:00,359 --> 01:53:05,839
they taste really good so there I don't

2536
01:53:03,158 --> 01:53:08,879
think there's any decarbox I don't think

2537
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:11,119
there's I think it's just raw rosin

2538
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:13,960
going into the gummy itself no they're

2539
01:53:11,118 --> 01:53:16,479
we no they're decars oh they are decars

2540
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:18,520
you decarb the p and then you can put

2541
01:53:16,479 --> 01:53:21,118
drop that and do whatever you need to

2542
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:23,239
but yeah okay but I I don't know if you

2543
01:53:21,118 --> 01:53:26,920
agree with me Colin I mean certainly I

2544
01:53:23,238 --> 01:53:30,799
think I like seeing the hlc data because

2545
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:33,840
the hlc data showed me what that flower

2546
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:35,880
contains certainly the GC data is cool

2547
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:37,920
and that's what you need for like a head

2548
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:40,039
space measurement for tur no I think it

2549
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:42,599
look I think any look anytime you have

2550
01:53:40,039 --> 01:53:44,880
more data to compare against itself and

2551
01:53:42,599 --> 01:53:46,719
pit against itself as you know the 10%

2552
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:49,000
variance in each state is also a

2553
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:51,560
problematic aspect that gets tacked on

2554
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:55,000
to all these things like Colorado for

2555
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:56,960
instance is a is a really it's just kind

2556
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,679
of confusing to be honest in terms of

2557
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:01,920
how they calculate milligram serving um

2558
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:04,520
so because there's a there's a

2559
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:07,199
denominator that they have to do math on

2560
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:08,880
to get that that actual you know

2561
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:11,759
milligram serving that they believe is

2562
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,800
in your your product so if you you test

2563
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:16,599
for say

2564
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:18,679
85% there's a 10% variance that gets

2565
01:54:16,599 --> 01:54:22,480
tacked onto that that knocks it down to

2566
01:54:18,679 --> 01:54:26,279
70 you know maybe below 70 maybe 68

2567
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:31,118
right so there's a reason why we had a

2568
01:54:26,279 --> 01:54:34,198
hlc and a GC and an hclp prep because

2569
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:37,679
that allowed us to isolate uh several

2570
01:54:34,198 --> 01:54:39,598
grams of a single canabo and uh it was

2571
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:42,158
really important to have all three of

2572
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:47,119
those but what we used the most actually

2573
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:51,078
was J uh GC FID especially for Tes you

2574
01:54:47,118 --> 01:54:54,799
know that's that was our go-to

2575
01:54:51,078 --> 01:54:56,799
tool I I just put in the big ethical

2576
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:59,599
problem that we found when we started to

2577
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:02,159
do testing was exactly the whole problem

2578
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:04,679
that we're talking is because we realize

2579
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:06,279
also the majority of those original 1500

2580
01:55:04,679 --> 01:55:08,960
tests that the majority of them were

2581
01:55:06,279 --> 01:55:11,519
very chemically close together and what

2582
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:15,679
we realized is that there was going to

2583
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:18,360
be a perception that THC percentage was

2584
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:20,920
somehow going to matter to people and we

2585
01:55:18,359 --> 01:55:23,399
knew that that was not the real case

2586
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:26,039
here and unfortunately Harbor Side

2587
01:55:23,399 --> 01:55:28,559
decided to flood it out as we were

2588
01:55:26,039 --> 01:55:31,238
deciding the ethical realities because

2589
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:33,400
it is still prevalent if people think

2590
01:55:31,238 --> 01:55:35,678
along the lines of alcohol that oh it's

2591
01:55:33,399 --> 01:55:37,439
just because it's a high number I must

2592
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:39,239
be getting more [ __ ] up and must be

2593
01:55:37,439 --> 01:55:42,198
getting more of the sensation and more

2594
01:55:39,238 --> 01:55:44,439
of that feeling whereas we know it's a

2595
01:55:42,198 --> 01:55:47,399
symbiotic relation that Ensemble effect

2596
01:55:44,439 --> 01:55:50,198
of the tpin DI Turpin sesquiterpenes and

2597
01:55:47,399 --> 01:55:52,920
everything ingested together that are

2598
01:55:50,198 --> 01:55:55,439
giving this that effect and so

2599
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:57,560
this is the thing that's also missing

2600
01:55:55,439 --> 01:56:00,879
for the that nasal spray is of course

2601
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:04,599
it's THC dominant but it needs all the

2602
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:07,800
other Spectrum easiest the easiest way

2603
01:56:04,599 --> 01:56:12,159
to understand thatan is if you smoke

2604
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:16,119
100% pure THC it does not get you high

2605
01:56:12,158 --> 01:56:21,479
as pure cleaned up resin of skunk number

2606
01:56:16,118 --> 01:56:22,960
one that's only 50 60 7 8% of THC at the

2607
01:56:21,479 --> 01:56:27,158
most but

2608
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:29,840
the resin gets you higher agreed by

2609
01:56:27,158 --> 01:56:33,039
weight but we didn't all understand in

2610
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:35,159
078 the tpin and all of that because we

2611
01:56:33,039 --> 01:56:36,920
were still quantifying the THC and then

2612
01:56:35,158 --> 01:56:39,879
finding that secondary Spike which was

2613
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:42,760
CBD so this is also the understanding

2614
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:44,880
we've been able to gain as we were able

2615
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:46,560
to strike all right this off the map and

2616
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:49,078
so it opened up these other

2617
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:53,320
opportunities to where now we're testing

2618
01:56:49,078 --> 01:56:55,238
CBG cbga and all the other uh acid

2619
01:56:53,319 --> 01:56:57,439
precursors and are understanding and

2620
01:56:55,238 --> 01:56:59,439
finding our newer ones because now

2621
01:56:57,439 --> 01:57:01,839
science can play and we've checked off

2622
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:04,238
that list now we have to continue to add

2623
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:06,800
to that list but also add to our

2624
01:57:04,238 --> 01:57:09,839
understanding of why it matters because

2625
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:11,880
science isn't is still not replicating

2626
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:13,800
what the plant is producing right we

2627
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:16,679
still nobody's been able to take a tpine

2628
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:18,800
recipe and make it exactly what comes

2629
01:57:16,679 --> 01:57:20,399
off of a plant and the first one that

2630
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:23,279
does is going to be pretty amazing when

2631
01:57:20,399 --> 01:57:24,638
they do but no one's come even close

2632
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:26,599
have you found that's cuz they're not

2633
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:28,078
using the other volatile organic

2634
01:57:26,599 --> 01:57:30,639
compounds that are present in the

2635
01:57:28,078 --> 01:57:33,799
profile they just are thinking about tur

2636
01:57:30,639 --> 01:57:36,599
there are there are other volatiles but

2637
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:37,560
besides that they're not using all of

2638
01:57:36,599 --> 01:57:40,639
the

2639
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:43,679
150 uh turpins which are found in

2640
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:48,239
cannabis they might be using 10 of them

2641
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:53,000
or 20 of them but uh the average tpine

2642
01:57:48,238 --> 01:57:57,799
uh we were able to find about 50 or more

2643
01:57:53,000 --> 01:58:01,880
tpin and we only had maybe 100 or 120 of

2644
01:57:57,800 --> 01:58:04,360
the Turin to do our testing with so

2645
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:06,480
there was tpping that we didn't have

2646
01:58:04,359 --> 01:58:09,039
which uh even if they're there in tiny

2647
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:12,000
tiny amounts I mean Turin are there in

2648
01:58:09,039 --> 01:58:15,519
tiny amounts to start with and yet they

2649
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,920
really have a a an incredible effect

2650
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:21,239
they they the right turpins can

2651
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:25,679
definitely make cannabis more potent and

2652
01:58:21,238 --> 01:58:27,919
uh mod the effects in a in a major way

2653
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:30,800
yeah the issue is is that when you're

2654
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:33,520
talking about a commodity any commodity

2655
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:35,800
any commodity where large scale

2656
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:38,880
manufacturing third-party testing and

2657
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:41,840
production is happening there be some

2658
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:46,078
ways some metrics of basically testing

2659
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:47,480
for quality and uh yeah ATN I kind of I

2660
01:58:46,078 --> 01:58:50,078
I kind of hear what you're saying about

2661
01:58:47,479 --> 01:58:53,919
you know THC percentage I think of also

2662
01:58:50,078 --> 01:58:57,198
like the psychology of the dispensary

2663
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:59,118
buyer and when they go to buy a product

2664
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:01,000
they they they you know okay they can

2665
01:58:59,118 --> 01:59:03,719
look at the product they can smell it

2666
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,840
but what's its THC percentage or thca

2667
01:59:03,719 --> 01:59:07,679
percentage if they know what they're

2668
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:10,239
talking about right and so it it's just

2669
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:12,520
again a metric maybe it's not the right

2670
01:59:10,238 --> 01:59:16,559
metric but it is a metric and when

2671
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:20,599
you're talking about say buying large

2672
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:24,880
quantities of of plant material and you

2673
01:59:20,599 --> 01:59:28,599
have I don't know 50 kilos at you know

2674
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:30,880
14% but you have 50 kilos 18% you know

2675
01:59:28,599 --> 01:59:32,920
which one are you going to you know I I

2676
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:35,599
I I think that there's like there's a

2677
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:37,039
business mentality there but also like

2678
01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:39,639
if you're in our business where you're

2679
01:59:37,039 --> 01:59:42,238
extracting well that now the THC

2680
01:59:39,639 --> 01:59:44,199
percentage makes a makes makes a big

2681
01:59:42,238 --> 01:59:45,638
deal you know what I've seen now and

2682
01:59:44,198 --> 01:59:48,158
I've seen this on a couple different

2683
01:59:45,639 --> 01:59:51,599
coas where you know the plant makes

2684
01:59:48,158 --> 01:59:52,719
cannaboid acids but obviously the the

2685
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:55,239
dispens

2686
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:58,118
or the COA is going to report that total

2687
01:59:55,238 --> 02:00:00,879
THC number well I think what people do

2688
01:59:58,118 --> 02:00:02,559
to up their THC numbers is they spray

2689
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:04,118
distillate there's a lot of like

2690
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:06,360
spraying and dipping and all that kind

2691
02:00:04,118 --> 02:00:11,639
of [ __ ] going on these days [ __ ] they're

2692
02:00:06,359 --> 02:00:15,279
putting what uh hhc distillate now onto

2693
02:00:11,639 --> 02:00:18,199
hemp and selling hhc flour which totally

2694
02:00:15,279 --> 02:00:20,158
doesn't exist right yeah so now that

2695
02:00:18,198 --> 02:00:22,359
there's that infrastructure that okay we

2696
02:00:20,158 --> 02:00:24,198
can just take a distillate we could just

2697
02:00:22,359 --> 02:00:26,839
do that on the samples we send off for

2698
02:00:24,198 --> 02:00:29,719
testing the thing about that is that

2699
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:32,239
here's where hplc makes a difference

2700
02:00:29,719 --> 02:00:34,000
because if you're testing flour you're

2701
02:00:32,238 --> 02:00:36,519
going to see those cannaboids as

2702
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:39,679
cannaboid acids if they're spraying with

2703
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:41,280
THC distillate Ah that's been decarbox

2704
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:44,239
so you'll see a

2705
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:48,158
THC that will come up and we like well

2706
02:00:44,238 --> 02:00:51,718
total THD is you know 25% because we add

2707
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:54,118
the THC that's existing with the thca

2708
02:00:51,719 --> 02:00:56,760
now granted there is some you know

2709
02:00:54,118 --> 02:01:00,078
adventitious decarbox silation that just

2710
02:00:56,760 --> 02:01:01,880
happens after harvesting but you guys

2711
02:01:00,078 --> 02:01:04,880
know as well as I know that you know we

2712
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:07,279
all like fresh material and I think part

2713
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:10,719
of that freshness is exactly what you're

2714
02:01:07,279 --> 02:01:14,118
saying Sam there's that whole underlying

2715
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:15,679
Symphony of tpes and even you know

2716
02:01:14,118 --> 02:01:18,279
they're not necessarily tpin but they're

2717
02:01:15,679 --> 02:01:21,639
Turpin noids I'd call them because like

2718
02:01:18,279 --> 02:01:25,759
those prenol sulfides which that group

2719
02:01:21,639 --> 02:01:28,639
out norgan has now you know basically um

2720
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:32,119
used a volatile sulfur detector to

2721
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:34,880
detect our the skunky essence of

2722
02:01:32,118 --> 02:01:39,000
cannabis penal sulfides and the

2723
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:43,118
disulfide of penal sulfide and so they

2724
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:46,760
now have actually a method that they're

2725
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:51,039
using at testing labs to assign the

2726
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:53,960
gassiness of a strain based on the

2727
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:57,359
detection of the volatile sulfides and

2728
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:59,480
Marcus we had that dude on church right

2729
02:01:57,359 --> 02:02:01,719
we when they before they published their

2730
02:01:59,479 --> 02:02:03,039
paper that guy came on hash church

2731
02:02:01,719 --> 02:02:05,840
because I remember that was the first

2732
02:02:03,039 --> 02:02:09,198
time we had that conversation I think

2733
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:10,520
what was his name he was talking about F

2734
02:02:09,198 --> 02:02:15,439
yeah the the

2735
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:18,800
F yeah yeah that's right that that guy

2736
02:02:15,439 --> 02:02:20,919
well coming back for sure yeah that

2737
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:22,800
there's a professor there and he's

2738
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:25,000
involved in the American Chemical

2739
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:27,199
Society subdivision and I've met him at

2740
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:29,520
a couple meetings since we had that

2741
02:02:27,198 --> 02:02:32,158
discussion on church and yeah so they

2742
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:35,800
basically have a

2743
02:02:32,158 --> 02:02:39,238
gas uh you know scale of gassiness of

2744
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:41,279
how gassy your your weed or your hash is

2745
02:02:39,238 --> 02:02:43,718
based on the detection of these volatile

2746
02:02:41,279 --> 02:02:45,559
sulfides and again that's just that's a

2747
02:02:43,719 --> 02:02:48,520
recent discovery just with like in the

2748
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:50,960
last what two years right I mean yeah

2749
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:52,320
Max Max and his team at abstract they're

2750
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:53,920
the ones who kind of disc discovered it

2751
02:02:52,319 --> 02:02:56,399
right and wrote that paper well keep in

2752
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:58,078
mind Nick discovered it about 20 years

2753
02:02:56,399 --> 02:03:01,279
ago so when that paper came out he did

2754
02:02:58,078 --> 02:03:05,559
chuckle to himself uh a few

2755
02:03:01,279 --> 02:03:08,840
times got it Nick Z if I remember he did

2756
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:13,000
it in hops yeah he did it in hops he

2757
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:14,920
discovered 1,400 different styes in hops

2758
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,520
with that very machine that Mark is

2759
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:18,840
talking about and it's like some

2760
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:20,719
ridiculously like one to the trillion or

2761
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:23,520
something like it was he came on and he

2762
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:27,359
explained it I think they found five or

2763
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:29,760
so in cannabis so far and one of them is

2764
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:31,960
suspected of being much stronger

2765
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:35,520
smelling than all the rest I've got

2766
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:37,198
several of the files here but nobody has

2767
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:39,760
course you

2768
02:03:37,198 --> 02:03:44,118
do I asked if they can if they can do

2769
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:47,239
the turp profile of dog [ __ ] because no

2770
02:03:44,118 --> 02:03:49,759
what what I want to do is I want to know

2771
02:03:47,238 --> 02:03:53,238
files contribute to potency or

2772
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:56,159
modulation of I'm certain they do don't

2773
02:03:53,238 --> 02:03:59,479
you think Sam you can't assume that most

2774
02:03:56,158 --> 02:04:01,799
of the tpping don't oh but I'm sure what

2775
02:03:59,479 --> 02:04:05,039
they do is they I'm sure they they they

2776
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:06,719
modulate in that they they help create

2777
02:04:05,039 --> 02:04:08,279
and I've said this before on Church

2778
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:10,118
before and I think there is references

2779
02:04:08,279 --> 02:04:12,880
out in the literature you know just

2780
02:04:10,118 --> 02:04:14,960
increases the fluidity at the at the at

2781
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:18,440
the membrane at the at a at a cell

2782
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:21,760
membrane so so tpin help

2783
02:04:18,439 --> 02:04:23,439
exchange uh uh stuff across the cell

2784
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:26,239
membrane and I think what happens in

2785
02:04:23,439 --> 02:04:28,279
that Sam and it might be adventitious is

2786
02:04:26,238 --> 02:04:31,158
that there are things that now come into

2787
02:04:28,279 --> 02:04:33,319
the cell that uppr regulate canono

2788
02:04:31,158 --> 02:04:35,279
receptor expression and I think part of

2789
02:04:33,319 --> 02:04:38,000
the Entourage effect is that

2790
02:04:35,279 --> 02:04:40,399
upregulation of The cannaboid receptors

2791
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:43,520
that has to happen that happens with

2792
02:04:40,399 --> 02:04:46,638
full e full spectrum extracts that just

2793
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:46,639
doesn't happen with

2794
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:53,760
theing like kind of diminishes your your

2795
02:04:50,359 --> 02:04:58,039
your thca effects you know yeah I think

2796
02:04:53,760 --> 02:05:01,920
so and uh what we basically did was took

2797
02:04:58,039 --> 02:05:04,519
25 milligrams of absolutely 100% pure

2798
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:07,359
THC or we weighed these put them in a

2799
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:10,480
volcano with the tiniest Spike of a

2800
02:05:07,359 --> 02:05:13,639
single tpine and we went through about

2801
02:05:10,479 --> 02:05:16,439
15 of the different Turing the top ones

2802
02:05:13,639 --> 02:05:19,599
and uh some of them definitely

2803
02:05:16,439 --> 02:05:22,000
potentiated uh more of them modulated

2804
02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:26,199
but all of them did not do things like

2805
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:28,439
you say kopine uh I felt was negative

2806
02:05:26,198 --> 02:05:30,238
yeah yeah there's a few that do that so

2807
02:05:28,439 --> 02:05:33,238
it's it's interesting LOLOL might might

2808
02:05:30,238 --> 02:05:37,479
be actually one of them as well I find

2809
02:05:33,238 --> 02:05:41,078
Karlene is known to be a a CB2 uh

2810
02:05:37,479 --> 02:05:43,799
Agonist right so so it it acts as

2811
02:05:41,078 --> 02:05:46,799
basically a canabo and there's been this

2812
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:49,239
discussion about calling it a canono

2813
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:52,119
because the people who found that out

2814
02:05:49,238 --> 02:05:55,319
called it a dietary canono you know know

2815
02:05:52,118 --> 02:05:59,880
beta caropine because it's in you know

2816
02:05:55,319 --> 02:06:02,078
uh a black pepper o you know yeah yeah I

2817
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:06,840
mean like I I think there's there's all

2818
02:06:02,078 --> 02:06:10,359
kinds of new recent data on uh that kind

2819
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:14,319
of like fleshes out some of the um

2820
02:06:10,359 --> 02:06:17,639
Entourage effect because they're finding

2821
02:06:14,319 --> 02:06:20,118
not only more compounds in cannabis

2822
02:06:17,639 --> 02:06:22,039
extract that contribute to the overall

2823
02:06:20,118 --> 02:06:23,960
biological effect but but they're

2824
02:06:22,039 --> 02:06:26,439
discovering new receptors that these

2825
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:29,198
things are hitting so they're learning

2826
02:06:26,439 --> 02:06:32,799
more and more and more when I say they

2827
02:06:29,198 --> 02:06:35,319
we I mean collectively us scientists and

2828
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:36,800
everyone the whole human race I mean

2829
02:06:35,319 --> 02:06:39,000
that we do have a crystal ball it's

2830
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:42,159
called the scientific literature and you

2831
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:44,960
know science is a fascinating subject

2832
02:06:42,158 --> 02:06:47,638
for kids uh to learn and to be

2833
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:48,960
fascinated in um it just there's all

2834
02:06:47,639 --> 02:06:51,039
kinds of fascinating when you have a

2835
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:53,000
microscope and you have a kid you have a

2836
02:06:51,039 --> 02:06:56,078
whole day of activity man there's all

2837
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:57,679
kinds of things but um I I just want to

2838
02:06:56,078 --> 02:06:59,279
go back and say one other thing so this

2839
02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:01,480
is again talking about some of the

2840
02:06:59,279 --> 02:07:01,479
things

2841
02:07:03,719 --> 02:07:10,118
that your mic's hot

2842
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:11,440
Nick I'm sorry your mic is hot it's not

2843
02:07:10,118 --> 02:07:13,238
muted I was just letting you know I

2844
02:07:11,439 --> 02:07:15,078
could hear some sounds coming welcome

2845
02:07:13,238 --> 02:07:17,519
we're talking we're talking about file

2846
02:07:15,078 --> 02:07:19,118
so I thought I'd invite you in because

2847
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:20,320
you're one of the guys that opened that

2848
02:07:19,118 --> 02:07:22,920
you were the guy that opened that

2849
02:07:20,319 --> 02:07:24,799
conversation up with me so yeah Dr Mark

2850
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:26,760
if you want to catch them up the

2851
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:29,639
question really

2852
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:32,360
modulate yeah there you go ask that

2853
02:07:29,639 --> 02:07:35,279
question so the discovery of the sulfur

2854
02:07:32,359 --> 02:07:38,880
compounds that you guys have found and

2855
02:07:35,279 --> 02:07:42,759
now um I met with Ian and that group at

2856
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:46,359
the ABS they were looking at the soal

2857
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:49,480
gas factor and assigning gas Factor

2858
02:07:46,359 --> 02:07:51,639
based on the quantification of these

2859
02:07:49,479 --> 02:07:54,638
these volatile sulfides so yeah there

2860
02:07:51,639 --> 02:07:58,920
was just the question on uh because I

2861
02:07:54,639 --> 02:08:01,118
think Sam and other people are again um

2862
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:03,480
uh discussing about different compounds

2863
02:08:01,118 --> 02:08:05,839
that modulate the effects of

2864
02:08:03,479 --> 02:08:09,678
cannabinoids is it known whether or not

2865
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:12,480
Nick is Nick is the the co-p party who

2866
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:12,480
sent me my

2867
02:08:13,639 --> 02:08:17,920
tping which are from who' you get them

2868
02:08:18,599 --> 02:08:24,078
from what's that who who said what I'm

2869
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:25,800
sorry that's ni this is Nick um uh which

2870
02:08:24,078 --> 02:08:27,359
party did did you get him

2871
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:31,159
from

2872
02:08:27,359 --> 02:08:32,439
uh the what's the name of the lab AB

2873
02:08:31,158 --> 02:08:35,118
bris

2874
02:08:32,439 --> 02:08:38,839
or I'm afraid I can't remember the name

2875
02:08:35,118 --> 02:08:42,319
of the lab that uh where

2876
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:44,679
they yes that's correct

2877
02:08:42,319 --> 02:08:47,078
abstract gotcha no actually I have not

2878
02:08:44,679 --> 02:08:48,199
been working with on with them but I've

2879
02:08:47,078 --> 02:08:49,319
communicated with them on some of their

2880
02:08:48,198 --> 02:08:50,919
some of their research and some some

2881
02:08:49,319 --> 02:08:52,439
what they're doing I think some of their

2882
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:55,199
claims are a little a little bit um

2883
02:08:52,439 --> 02:08:57,078
broad but uh it's a they're definitely

2884
02:08:55,198 --> 02:09:00,719
doing some good work a lot a lot of

2885
02:08:57,078 --> 02:09:03,279
people in the space are um whether it's

2886
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:08,480
they was the only people I was able to

2887
02:09:03,279 --> 02:09:11,719
obtain the the pure th from and uh I I I

2888
02:09:08,479 --> 02:09:13,959
need to do the work but uh I'm having a

2889
02:09:11,719 --> 02:09:17,319
little bit of trouble getting pure THC

2890
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:19,559
so until I get P TC I can't do the F

2891
02:09:17,319 --> 02:09:22,399
work where where are you

2892
02:09:19,559 --> 02:09:25,000
based Amsterdam

2893
02:09:22,399 --> 02:09:26,479
oh okay um let me see what I can do uh I

2894
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,719
will I see if I can find you some some

2895
02:09:26,479 --> 02:09:30,799
fun stuff um and just youve got my email

2896
02:09:29,719 --> 02:09:33,559
on here so go ahead and shot me your

2897
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:36,119
address all of the T all of the Turing

2898
02:09:33,559 --> 02:09:42,360
are legal here I mean the canono are

2899
02:09:36,118 --> 02:09:45,118
legal in Holland except for Delta 99 and

2900
02:09:42,359 --> 02:09:47,039
Delta 8 all the rest of them are and

2901
02:09:45,118 --> 02:09:51,960
maybe even delta8 might be legal I

2902
02:09:47,039 --> 02:09:54,118
forget but Delta 9 is not legal so uh

2903
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:56,399
you

2904
02:09:54,118 --> 02:09:58,279
can't is

2905
02:09:56,399 --> 02:10:00,198
thatal that's exactly what I was going

2906
02:09:58,279 --> 02:10:03,920
to

2907
02:10:00,198 --> 02:10:03,919
say what is what

2908
02:10:04,679 --> 02:10:09,480
legal

2909
02:10:06,198 --> 02:10:11,519
thca no that's not legal because all you

2910
02:10:09,479 --> 02:10:16,118
have to do is heat it up and it turns

2911
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:16,119
into THC so of course that's not

2912
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:20,840
legal okay um in any case I'll still

2913
02:10:19,359 --> 02:10:22,960
I'll see if I can find something from

2914
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:26,078
the medical space they might have some

2915
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:28,599
so but when you speak speaking of

2916
02:10:26,078 --> 02:10:30,439
Standards I just wanted to mention too

2917
02:10:28,599 --> 02:10:33,599
when we were talking about standards and

2918
02:10:30,439 --> 02:10:35,960
Labs before that one of the big problems

2919
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:39,520
when we first started because we started

2920
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:42,599
our lab more than two decades ago uh was

2921
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:46,159
the problem that uh when you would order

2922
02:10:42,599 --> 02:10:50,880
analytical standards from segma or from

2923
02:10:46,158 --> 02:10:54,598
the United Nations drug uh people but

2924
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:57,880
when we would test them on our hlc we

2925
02:10:54,599 --> 02:11:00,078
would find they weren't as stated so if

2926
02:10:57,880 --> 02:11:03,118
you calibrate your machines according to

2927
02:11:00,078 --> 02:11:06,158
what they say they are without doing

2928
02:11:03,118 --> 02:11:11,238
checking yourself then what you find out

2929
02:11:06,158 --> 02:11:11,238
is that uh all of your results

2930
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:15,520
ex yes and so what's one of the things

2931
02:11:14,158 --> 02:11:19,198
that we found as well is that a lot of

2932
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:21,960
these sorry guys a lot of cross

2933
02:11:19,198 --> 02:11:25,279
here sorry I'm in the Delta Lounge uh

2934
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:27,399
the a lot of the um standards are

2935
02:11:25,279 --> 02:11:28,960
actually especially for th and diates

2936
02:11:27,399 --> 02:11:32,399
because they're they're kind of tricky

2937
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:34,279
to to to analyze um we found that you

2938
02:11:32,399 --> 02:11:35,960
needing a a sulfur chal medicines

2939
02:11:34,279 --> 02:11:38,039
detector array is is really one of the

2940
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:40,800
things that drives drives up your your

2941
02:11:38,039 --> 02:11:42,599
accuracy um and then the other issue is

2942
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:44,800
that there hasn't been a tremendous

2943
02:11:42,599 --> 02:11:47,480
amount of research done into them and so

2944
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:48,559
the the bands are not as narrow um for

2945
02:11:47,479 --> 02:11:49,879
for what they're saying so they they're

2946
02:11:48,559 --> 02:11:51,880
clustering a lot of things together and

2947
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:55,840
so you actually see like um

2948
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:59,039
for MMP um is listed as you know being

2949
02:11:55,840 --> 02:12:02,520
this one one very important th thile in

2950
02:11:59,039 --> 02:12:05,679
in aromatics and in reality the standard

2951
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:07,239
we use is actually uh covering several

2952
02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:08,880
isomers as well as some other compounds

2953
02:12:07,238 --> 02:12:11,678
that are right next to it and so in

2954
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:13,039
terms of Purity that's the indicator TH

2955
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:14,399
or that's the indicator that they use

2956
02:12:13,039 --> 02:12:16,479
the THS and thids that are in that

2957
02:12:14,399 --> 02:12:21,198
region uh but it's not necessarily

2958
02:12:16,479 --> 02:12:22,399
specific to that one uh that one file um

2959
02:12:21,198 --> 02:12:23,919
alternatively there's the other issue is

2960
02:12:22,399 --> 02:12:25,719
that it's hard to disassociate them

2961
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:27,599
together from from each other um without

2962
02:12:25,719 --> 02:12:30,039
some extremely high performance

2963
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:31,920
chromatography systems and we were still

2964
02:12:30,039 --> 02:12:35,118
working on that before I left

2965
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:38,639
Yak getting the accuracy down was

2966
02:12:35,118 --> 02:12:40,960
challenging it best honest it was that

2967
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:44,480
way with the canono when we started in

2968
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:48,239
the 90s when we built our first

2969
02:12:44,479 --> 02:12:50,598
lab you there was no way to separate

2970
02:12:48,238 --> 02:12:53,598
really without really really

2971
02:12:50,599 --> 02:12:59,400
specializing columns which were rare and

2972
02:12:53,599 --> 02:13:02,599
expensive CB uh C and CBD so everybody

2973
02:12:59,399 --> 02:13:05,399
was coting all of those together and

2974
02:13:02,599 --> 02:13:07,279
Reporting them as one Peak instead of in

2975
02:13:05,399 --> 02:13:10,359
fact they were two

2976
02:13:07,279 --> 02:13:11,679
peaks exactly um and then the other

2977
02:13:10,359 --> 02:13:15,039
tricky aspect is especially if you're

2978
02:13:11,679 --> 02:13:16,920
using gcms um The sulfur compounds like

2979
02:13:15,039 --> 02:13:18,800
most of the detectors don't like them so

2980
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:20,760
you need to have a SE detector for them

2981
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:22,320
um and even then it's it's really just a

2982
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:22,960
method development that has to continue

2983
02:13:22,319 --> 02:13:25,118
because there aren't a lot of

2984
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:27,719
established methods agant has been

2985
02:13:25,118 --> 02:13:29,479
working with us and improving improving

2986
02:13:27,719 --> 02:13:31,319
public access to to those method so it's

2987
02:13:29,479 --> 02:13:32,558
a it's a good thing um but it's we're

2988
02:13:31,319 --> 02:13:34,920
still a couple years out getting it

2989
02:13:32,559 --> 02:13:37,400
really really nailed down that's the

2990
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:40,199
reason why we never looked at files

2991
02:13:37,399 --> 02:13:42,759
because we had no way to determine the

2992
02:13:40,198 --> 02:13:45,558
trial percentages or anything else in

2993
02:13:42,760 --> 02:13:48,440
our lab we wished we could but there was

2994
02:13:45,559 --> 02:13:52,400
no way so we didn't

2995
02:13:48,439 --> 02:13:53,678
try that and not only that that the the

2996
02:13:52,399 --> 02:13:54,960
best detectors are actually really

2997
02:13:53,679 --> 02:13:56,158
they're good at detecting and good at

2998
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:57,800
isolating but they're not very good at

2999
02:13:56,158 --> 02:14:00,039
quantitation so it's it's a challenge

3000
02:13:57,800 --> 02:14:02,000
all the way around um David you said

3001
02:14:00,039 --> 02:14:03,960
something earlier about um you know

3002
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:06,439
what's what's known about the the sort

3003
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:07,800
of the co co effects and and the impact

3004
02:14:06,439 --> 02:14:10,759
whether or not they they sort of

3005
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:12,719
potentiate or or they interfere with and

3006
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:14,119
really that research hasn't yet been

3007
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:15,639
done I was just speaking to Ethan Russo

3008
02:14:14,118 --> 02:14:17,719
last week about this um he's very

3009
02:14:15,639 --> 02:14:19,480
interested in it as well so I'm gonna

3010
02:14:17,719 --> 02:14:22,719
try to see if they can set some sort of

3011
02:14:19,479 --> 02:14:25,000
studies up with everybody um but what to

3012
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:27,118
me from Evol from an evolutionary

3013
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:29,719
evolutionary evolutionary perspective

3014
02:14:27,118 --> 02:14:31,479
Jesus had trou talking morning sorry um

3015
02:14:29,719 --> 02:14:34,520
is it makes sense that there would be

3016
02:14:31,479 --> 02:14:36,359
some sort of uh neurological impact

3017
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:39,440
because they're so important in human

3018
02:14:36,359 --> 02:14:42,639
evolution and Mamon evolution in general

3019
02:14:39,439 --> 02:14:44,359
um looking at um the way that they

3020
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:46,319
predict ripening and they predict

3021
02:14:44,359 --> 02:14:48,279
fermentation and they also predict

3022
02:14:46,319 --> 02:14:51,639
putrescence um those are three very

3023
02:14:48,279 --> 02:14:54,238
important survival tools for uh for

3024
02:14:51,639 --> 02:14:55,800
mammals um and one things that's really

3025
02:14:54,238 --> 02:14:57,919
interesting I found is that if you you

3026
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:59,840
know what durian is it's a it's a very

3027
02:14:57,920 --> 02:15:02,399
of sest fruit in the world they call it

3028
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:03,800
um it's extremely high in 3mh and form

3029
02:15:02,399 --> 02:15:06,078
MP as well as some other thid and

3030
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:10,159
pentane thids um that are kind of more

3031
02:15:06,078 --> 02:15:12,238
the gassy garlic deily nastiness um in

3032
02:15:10,158 --> 02:15:16,000
very very high quantities when high high

3033
02:15:12,238 --> 02:15:18,799
proportions um the Tigers who are

3034
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:21,520
obligate carnivores will make their way

3035
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:23,559
to a durian tree and defend it because

3036
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:24,679
they like the durian so much it's just

3037
02:15:23,559 --> 02:15:27,239
it's got a lot of protein it's got a lot

3038
02:15:24,679 --> 02:15:29,000
of fat in it as well um but the fact

3039
02:15:27,238 --> 02:15:31,439
that they're able to detect those those

3040
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:34,760
STS and it use and they use it as a

3041
02:15:31,439 --> 02:15:37,719
source of of um food for an Oba

3042
02:15:34,760 --> 02:15:41,880
carnivore is pretty pretty impressive

3043
02:15:37,719 --> 02:15:44,880
well I'm very curious I also used to be

3044
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:47,400
curious in flavonoids because I know

3045
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:51,000
that they can modulate and potentiate

3046
02:15:47,399 --> 02:15:53,638
things but orally they can but if you

3047
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:56,198
smoke them it deactivates them so the

3048
02:15:53,639 --> 02:15:59,639
flavonoids are not responsible for the

3049
02:15:56,198 --> 02:16:01,558
smok different effects in cannabis for

3050
02:15:59,639 --> 02:16:02,840
Orly that could be a completely

3051
02:16:01,559 --> 02:16:04,760
different

3052
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:06,400
story

3053
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:10,559
100%

3054
02:16:06,399 --> 02:16:13,399
I there's an awful lot of Turpin that

3055
02:16:10,559 --> 02:16:15,719
really have no effects I mean they don't

3056
02:16:13,399 --> 02:16:18,039
get too high excuse I'm not talking

3057
02:16:15,719 --> 02:16:21,078
medical here I'm talking

3058
02:16:18,039 --> 02:16:24,359
recreational and the same same thing

3059
02:16:21,078 --> 02:16:27,679
with the uh canbids most of the canids

3060
02:16:24,359 --> 02:16:27,679
do not get too

3061
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:33,920
high yeah they but they do they do have

3062
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:36,000
an impact on the sort of CB1 CB2 as well

3063
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:37,719
as the other receptors and they have an

3064
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:40,638
impact on modulating say for example

3065
02:16:37,718 --> 02:16:43,199
your well they some of them certainly

3066
02:16:40,638 --> 02:16:46,920
some of them certainly do prime example

3067
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:51,040
is the way CBD will delay the

3068
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:53,760
onset uh reduce the peak experience and

3069
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:56,559
make the whole thing last longer for

3070
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:58,559
p uh and well as an example so not just

3071
02:16:56,558 --> 02:17:02,119
not just CBD but like looking at say

3072
02:16:58,558 --> 02:17:03,879
pierine and better care filing is the

3073
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:05,120
the impact that that has uh you know

3074
02:17:03,879 --> 02:17:06,398
there's the old adage like you know if

3075
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:08,719
you're if somebody's having a bad trip

3076
02:17:06,398 --> 02:17:10,760
or or having adverse reaction to THC and

3077
02:17:08,718 --> 02:17:11,718
kind having an anxiety issue uh you know

3078
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:13,639
give them a give them a teaspoon or

3079
02:17:11,718 --> 02:17:15,358
tablespoon of black pepper to munch on

3080
02:17:13,638 --> 02:17:17,920
and it pretty much Nerfs it very very

3081
02:17:15,359 --> 02:17:20,359
quickly um and the mechanism is not

3082
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:23,439
understood but it seems to be uh the

3083
02:17:20,359 --> 02:17:24,880
case of anecdotal experiences driving U

3084
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:26,840
research and it's really exciting to see

3085
02:17:24,879 --> 02:17:29,159
that sort of stuff start to happen well

3086
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:31,920
I for years I've been trying to get too

3087
02:17:29,159 --> 02:17:34,478
high on THC products but so far I've

3088
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:34,478
been pretty

3089
02:17:36,599 --> 02:17:41,120
unsuccessful you know and just for

3090
02:17:38,398 --> 02:17:44,358
conversation I would love to bring in

3091
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:47,559
there's a lot of people out there who

3092
02:17:44,359 --> 02:17:49,519
the more that the plant is concentrated

3093
02:17:47,558 --> 02:17:52,599
the less high that they

3094
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:55,840
get so so I've talked with Ethan Russo

3095
02:17:52,599 --> 02:17:58,439
at length about this and at first it was

3096
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:59,960
like no that's not possible but but yes

3097
02:17:58,439 --> 02:18:03,040
it is there's a lot of people who don't

3098
02:17:59,959 --> 02:18:05,318
get high off of a dab at all and maybe a

3099
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:07,439
little bit of hash they will they really

3100
02:18:05,318 --> 02:18:10,519
don't feel the effects so the more

3101
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:13,479
natural that it is or the more flower or

3102
02:18:10,519 --> 02:18:16,120
joint or maybe out of a bong that it is

3103
02:18:13,478 --> 02:18:18,799
they would be you know getting a higher

3104
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:21,800
effect and what was brought up

3105
02:18:18,799 --> 02:18:24,398
conversation after you know a couple of

3106
02:18:21,799 --> 02:18:24,398
years at

3107
02:18:37,159 --> 02:18:41,760
length brings the Entourage effect back

3108
02:18:40,318 --> 02:18:45,558
into the

3109
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:48,318
conversation without having to elude it

3110
02:18:45,558 --> 02:18:52,518
so the amuno acids are destroyed dur

3111
02:18:48,318 --> 02:18:54,760
during during vaporization or smoking

3112
02:18:52,519 --> 02:18:56,439
so uh like in terms of of Edibles you

3113
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:58,439
can certainly get some of those but but

3114
02:18:56,439 --> 02:19:00,120
in general they're they are destroyed by

3115
02:18:58,439 --> 02:19:03,639
by smoke yeah like the

3116
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:06,280
flavonoids yep and the

3117
02:19:03,638 --> 02:19:08,799
polyphenols well there seems to be

3118
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:11,280
something that's happening when you know

3119
02:19:08,799 --> 02:19:14,239
the more raw that people whether it's

3120
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:16,559
even combusting whether it's an edible

3121
02:19:14,239 --> 02:19:19,039
you know people that are getting more

3122
02:19:16,558 --> 02:19:21,239
effects off of an edible even if it is

3123
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:22,920
in butter and I hear and

3124
02:19:21,239 --> 02:19:25,318
understand that the amino acids are

3125
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:29,359
alive there but there's something that's

3126
02:19:25,318 --> 02:19:32,439
happening for a lot of people that need

3127
02:19:29,359 --> 02:19:35,519
the more raw compounds even if it's

3128
02:19:32,439 --> 02:19:38,359
decarbox even if it's heated up so

3129
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:40,280
that's a that's a conversation could it

3130
02:19:38,359 --> 02:19:42,079
that we don't understand yet and I'd

3131
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:44,960
love to hear what you all think about

3132
02:19:42,079 --> 02:19:48,799
could it be as simple as the when you

3133
02:19:44,959 --> 02:19:54,119
take canono THC especially

3134
02:19:48,799 --> 02:19:57,759
orally then uh you don't get high on the

3135
02:19:54,120 --> 02:20:02,479
THC you get high on the 11 hydroxy after

3136
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:05,840
it goes through the the liver and uh so

3137
02:20:02,478 --> 02:20:09,760
what reaches the brain and the blood is

3138
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:12,359
not THC it's primarily Leon hydroxy

3139
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:15,680
which is a bit stronger in effects in

3140
02:20:12,359 --> 02:20:17,800
THC and a bit different so uh it could

3141
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:21,960
be would that be the same with

3142
02:20:17,799 --> 02:20:24,478
decarbox or you know heating up at

3143
02:20:21,959 --> 02:20:27,478
any the liver actually the liver

3144
02:20:24,478 --> 02:20:31,679
actually converts the the Delta 9 into

3145
02:20:27,478 --> 02:20:32,879
into 11 hydroxy um and the with like

3146
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:33,760
sort of going into that that's that's

3147
02:20:32,879 --> 02:20:36,318
sort of an interesting things so

3148
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:38,559
anecdotally um I some people don't have

3149
02:20:36,318 --> 02:20:41,119
the enzymes uh the liver enzymes

3150
02:20:38,559 --> 02:20:43,199
functionality to process some of the THD

3151
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:45,359
into the bioactive form from oral

3152
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:47,359
consumtion and it depends on the form

3153
02:20:45,359 --> 02:20:50,399
that it comes in as an example I've

3154
02:20:47,359 --> 02:20:51,159
consumed upwards of 300 Mig of Delta 8

3155
02:20:50,398 --> 02:20:54,119
or

3156
02:20:51,159 --> 02:20:56,879
and had Zero Effect um whereas you know

3157
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:59,600
a vape instantly affects me it is very

3158
02:20:56,879 --> 02:21:01,799
very much lighter than Delta 9 um but

3159
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:04,000
orally I just for some reason my body

3160
02:21:01,799 --> 02:21:05,799
doesn't doesn't process the the material

3161
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:08,159
um my cousin um he has the same thing

3162
02:21:05,799 --> 02:21:10,599
with Delta 9 he can consume just insane

3163
02:21:08,159 --> 02:21:13,719
quantities of Delta 9 Edibles and he

3164
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:15,439
gets no effect uh from at all uh and you

3165
02:21:13,719 --> 02:21:17,079
know this needs to be studied more but I

3166
02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:20,000
I suspect that there's probably some um

3167
02:21:17,079 --> 02:21:25,120
Gene deletes or some enzyme uh deletes

3168
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:27,318
in different people to explain that um

3169
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:30,600
the but when you're talking about the

3170
02:21:27,318 --> 02:21:33,398
overall is that way for alcohol American

3171
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:38,120
Indians don't have the

3172
02:21:33,398 --> 02:21:40,318
yep Trace migration um by that um

3173
02:21:38,120 --> 02:21:41,359
there's a really interesting uh but the

3174
02:21:40,318 --> 02:21:43,478
point you're bringing about the whole

3175
02:21:41,359 --> 02:21:47,159
sort of full spectrum material is I

3176
02:21:43,478 --> 02:21:50,840
think Salient um I think that

3177
02:21:47,159 --> 02:21:53,079
the total quantity of all the material

3178
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:55,639
in working together will give you a

3179
02:21:53,079 --> 02:21:58,879
different effect um and so as an example

3180
02:21:55,639 --> 02:22:00,879
I'll go back the pure pure THC um like

3181
02:21:58,879 --> 02:22:02,920
pure THC beverages do almost nothing to

3182
02:22:00,879 --> 02:22:05,358
me um they do get me like sort of

3183
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:08,120
instant like instantly um intoxicated

3184
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:10,318
and then it's it's a very thin very

3185
02:22:08,120 --> 02:22:11,560
narrow experience it's I don't get the I

3186
02:22:10,318 --> 02:22:13,680
don't get some of the relaxation I don't

3187
02:22:11,559 --> 02:22:16,000
get the enjoyment of it as much and it's

3188
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:18,239
not just from from the aroma and flavor

3189
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:20,239
of it um but it's the combination of

3190
02:22:18,239 --> 02:22:21,039
everything so I 100% agree that the full

3191
02:22:20,239 --> 02:22:23,520
spect

3192
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:25,800
material is a quantitatively is a

3193
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:27,120
quantifiably different experience and

3194
02:22:25,799 --> 02:22:31,000
it's certainly a qualitatively different

3195
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:32,439
experience than isolates um and that's

3196
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,120
similar for anything a good cup of

3197
02:22:32,439 --> 02:22:35,398
coffee is is significantly more

3198
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:36,800
enjoyable and it's going to give you a

3199
02:22:35,398 --> 02:22:38,799
different impact whether it be

3200
02:22:36,799 --> 02:22:42,679
psychosocial or not uh sorry

3201
02:22:38,799 --> 02:22:46,438
psychological or not um than just you

3202
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:49,159
know a fingertip of caffeine um it it's

3203
02:22:46,439 --> 02:22:50,840
so it is different I think that the the

3204
02:22:49,159 --> 02:22:52,680
the complexity of those interactions are

3205
02:22:50,840 --> 02:22:55,478
very very difficult to disentangle and

3206
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:57,760
study and the typical approach of doing

3207
02:22:55,478 --> 02:23:00,398
you know one compound plus one

3208
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:01,840
modulator is where we need to start

3209
02:23:00,398 --> 02:23:03,599
doing this research but we really need

3210
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:06,040
to start looking at significantly more

3211
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:08,600
complicated um

3212
02:23:06,040 --> 02:23:10,040
and you know probably significant more

3213
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:12,520
complicated Arrangements of all of these

3214
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:15,319
compounds and instead of doing um sort

3215
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:17,840
of additions doing delet from a from a

3216
02:23:15,318 --> 02:23:18,840
sort of full spectrum mix so you say

3217
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:20,600
okay we've got a full spectrum that's

3218
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:22,318
completely Quantified we know what's

3219
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:25,880
with everything that's in it now let's

3220
02:23:22,318 --> 02:23:28,119
remove one of those fractions at a time

3221
02:23:25,879 --> 02:23:30,719
and see what the result is it's going to

3222
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:32,279
be it's going to take you know probably

3223
02:23:30,719 --> 02:23:36,000
decades to complete that research

3224
02:23:32,279 --> 02:23:37,560
because of all the possible combinations

3225
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:40,000
and some would say rightly that it's

3226
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:42,719
probably not worth doing

3227
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:45,079
because worth doing Nick we got to do it

3228
02:23:42,719 --> 02:23:49,438
we gotta find out because

3229
02:23:45,079 --> 02:23:52,478
it's it's it's maybe a million different

3230
02:23:49,439 --> 02:23:55,680
combinations talking about true I would

3231
02:23:52,478 --> 02:23:58,119
say trillions yeah every person is

3232
02:23:55,680 --> 02:24:03,559
different you're a and every person is

3233
02:23:58,120 --> 02:24:03,560
different yeah AI help let's go

3234
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:10,120
subjective so Nick and Sam still getting

3235
02:24:07,318 --> 02:24:12,559
to that question do you think I I would

3236
02:24:10,120 --> 02:24:14,920
just love maybe even to marinate on it

3237
02:24:12,559 --> 02:24:19,159
and and get back to me or what you all

3238
02:24:14,920 --> 02:24:24,680
think but just that idea that people who

3239
02:24:19,159 --> 02:24:27,200
can feel effect off of say a joint or

3240
02:24:24,680 --> 02:24:29,040
you know any any other raw form but as

3241
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:31,200
soon as it's concentrated or the more

3242
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:33,479
that it's concentrated even whether it's

3243
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:36,640
rosin even whether it's from a full

3244
02:24:33,478 --> 02:24:37,719
spectrum plant it's just the actual idea

3245
02:24:36,639 --> 02:24:40,199
of

3246
02:24:37,719 --> 02:24:43,000
concentrating those cannabinoids what's

3247
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:45,560
being left out that the person no longer

3248
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:46,959
has effects and so I think that's the

3249
02:24:45,559 --> 02:24:49,039
key point it's not about the level of

3250
02:24:46,959 --> 02:24:51,438
concentration it's about the exclusion

3251
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:53,359
of other components and I think that's I

3252
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:54,479
think that's a very very important

3253
02:24:53,359 --> 02:24:55,760
distinction to make is that it's not

3254
02:24:54,478 --> 02:24:59,920
necessarily that conservation is the

3255
02:24:55,760 --> 02:25:01,239
problem it's that the elimination of any

3256
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:03,960
of the compounds will provide an

3257
02:25:01,239 --> 02:25:07,199
attended experience um is is what's

3258
02:25:03,959 --> 02:25:07,199
going to be driving that

3259
02:25:07,239 --> 02:25:11,239
and go ahead excuse me Nick I didn't

3260
02:25:10,318 --> 02:25:14,439
mean to

3261
02:25:11,239 --> 02:25:18,879
interrupt no go ahead oh what I was

3262
02:25:14,439 --> 02:25:20,880
going to say was that uh what we found

3263
02:25:18,879 --> 02:25:24,278
was that

3264
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:27,599
the other materials in the plant did not

3265
02:25:24,279 --> 02:25:31,960
contribute to you getting higher but the

3266
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:35,200
resin heads they did so if you just

3267
02:25:31,959 --> 02:25:36,959
cleaned up the resin heads and made them

3268
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:41,600
so that they were like

3269
02:25:36,959 --> 02:25:43,599
99% uh resin heads with nothing else uh

3270
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:44,880
I found that got me higher than anything

3271
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:48,159
else

3272
02:25:44,879 --> 02:25:49,879
absolutely and and again tolerance is an

3273
02:25:48,159 --> 02:25:51,719
issue here and it's subjective but I

3274
02:25:49,879 --> 02:25:53,039
think that in general from from all all

3275
02:25:51,719 --> 02:25:54,358
the research that I've done and all the

3276
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:56,200
work that I've been doing and and

3277
02:25:54,359 --> 02:25:58,640
obviously the work Mark has been doing

3278
02:25:56,200 --> 02:26:01,120
with hash and bubble hash and cleaning

3279
02:25:58,639 --> 02:26:03,478
those up we see that the vast majority

3280
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:05,359
of effects do come from those residents

3281
02:26:03,478 --> 02:26:07,639
um that's not to say that there isn't

3282
02:26:05,359 --> 02:26:11,318
other that there aren't other compounds

3283
02:26:07,639 --> 02:26:14,159
in the other material that won't uh

3284
02:26:11,318 --> 02:26:17,879
change that experience but that the vast

3285
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:20,840
majority of the um uh sort of

3286
02:26:17,879 --> 02:26:23,679
recreational interest um is concentrated

3287
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:25,559
and and is concentrated in in the resin

3288
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:26,760
heads except when it comes to things

3289
02:26:25,559 --> 02:26:30,079
like you mentioned the amino acids and

3290
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:32,840
the proteins as well as the um the

3291
02:26:30,079 --> 02:26:34,398
polyphenol groups and the flavonoids

3292
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:36,200
which are which are a huge group and and

3293
02:26:34,398 --> 02:26:38,039
they're starting to be studied um but

3294
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:39,680
it's complex to to study them those will

3295
02:26:38,040 --> 02:26:42,160
you're only going to get an effect from

3296
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:44,639
in edible form through oil consumption

3297
02:26:42,159 --> 02:26:48,398
just because nature flavonoids are very

3298
02:26:44,639 --> 02:26:52,599
important for a lot of people uh but uh

3299
02:26:48,398 --> 02:26:57,079
I was really really focused on just the

3300
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:59,760
recreational focus and uh once I found

3301
02:26:57,079 --> 02:27:03,559
out that uh when you smoke flavonoids it

3302
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:04,880
deactivated them then uh I I I did not

3303
02:27:03,559 --> 02:27:06,719
focus on them

3304
02:27:04,879 --> 02:27:10,318
anymore that

3305
02:27:06,719 --> 02:27:13,000
was thermally they thermally degrade

3306
02:27:10,318 --> 02:27:15,079
they ther degrade they they don't

3307
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:18,120
volatilize and

3308
02:27:15,079 --> 02:27:21,879
that yeah that that's the problem with

3309
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:24,520
um with the the spice canavs too the

3310
02:27:21,879 --> 02:27:27,000
synthetic can avonoids is that they they

3311
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:30,319
don't cleanly vaporize

3312
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:32,079
right they thermally degrade earlier

3313
02:27:30,318 --> 02:27:34,680
when you said the exclusion of

3314
02:27:32,079 --> 02:27:37,478
components is it always the exclusion of

3315
02:27:34,680 --> 02:27:40,359
components or are or are there different

3316
02:27:37,478 --> 02:27:42,879
genetic makeups that have blind spots in

3317
02:27:40,359 --> 02:27:44,318
some form or another where they can't

3318
02:27:42,879 --> 02:27:47,639
experience

3319
02:27:44,318 --> 02:27:50,559
these 100% so there there every so in

3320
02:27:47,639 --> 02:27:52,760
both the plant and and the person um so

3321
02:27:50,559 --> 02:27:55,079
there's there are like human beings have

3322
02:27:52,760 --> 02:27:56,840
have anosmia and there are certain

3323
02:27:55,079 --> 02:27:59,959
people that that simply like have a very

3324
02:27:56,840 --> 02:28:02,398
low um sort of uh Aroma sensitivity um

3325
02:27:59,959 --> 02:28:03,639
and so so it's interesting and that

3326
02:28:02,398 --> 02:28:06,599
actually they would be almost be a

3327
02:28:03,639 --> 02:28:08,119
perfect candidate for study of Effects

3328
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:11,559
by because that would eliminate their

3329
02:28:08,120 --> 02:28:14,960
subjective enjoyment aspect of it does

3330
02:28:11,559 --> 02:28:17,439
that make sense um like by by by

3331
02:28:14,959 --> 02:28:20,159
choosing people that can't

3332
02:28:17,439 --> 02:28:24,439
detect like doing it both ways Nick

3333
02:28:20,159 --> 02:28:27,039
where you eliminate one thing at a time

3334
02:28:24,439 --> 02:28:30,200
and then eliminate two things at a time

3335
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:33,200
and then three and yeah you you also do

3336
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:36,079
it the way we did it which was we had 25

3337
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:38,159
milligrams of THC and we spiked it with

3338
02:28:36,079 --> 02:28:40,719
a single turpine then another single

3339
02:28:38,159 --> 02:28:43,318
turpine then another single turpine and

3340
02:28:40,719 --> 02:28:46,039
smoked them on different days so that we

3341
02:28:43,318 --> 02:28:47,719
could uh evaluate what they did we were

3342
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:50,279
primarily looking for ones that

3343
02:28:47,719 --> 02:28:51,559
potentiated and if they modulated want

3344
02:28:50,279 --> 02:28:54,200
to know

3345
02:28:51,559 --> 02:28:55,478
how exactly I mean I would love to talk

3346
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:57,120
about more about this and there's some

3347
02:28:55,478 --> 02:28:58,278
groups that I'd like to possibly bring

3348
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:01,279
into this conversation at some point

3349
02:28:58,279 --> 02:29:03,000
because it's a it's really I think it's

3350
02:29:01,279 --> 02:29:05,720
fascinating and I think the implications

3351
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:08,398
are are huge for um the recreational

3352
02:29:05,719 --> 02:29:10,478
Market as well as for um you know

3353
02:29:08,398 --> 02:29:13,478
therapy as as as medicine and I think

3354
02:29:10,478 --> 02:29:15,039
that uh you know it's it's it's one of

3355
02:29:13,478 --> 02:29:17,318
those things where we need to move away

3356
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:21,200
from the dogma of um single compound

3357
02:29:17,318 --> 02:29:24,600
single effect into you know

3358
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:24,600
the compounding effects of

3359
02:29:37,559 --> 02:29:42,879
M finally well-managed ADHD and and

3360
02:29:40,359 --> 02:29:44,720
cannabis is certainly a part of that um

3361
02:29:42,879 --> 02:29:49,519
is that the combination of multiple

3362
02:29:44,719 --> 02:29:51,398
salts of salts is more effective than uh

3363
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:53,479
the single primary component and this is

3364
02:29:51,398 --> 02:29:55,559
one of the big things that uh a lot of

3365
02:29:53,478 --> 02:29:57,398
uh sort of analytical chemistry and just

3366
02:29:55,559 --> 02:29:59,600
Western medicine and Science in general

3367
02:29:57,398 --> 02:30:01,079
has has struggled with is the the the

3368
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:05,680
the focus on principal component

3369
02:30:01,079 --> 02:30:08,600
analysis which is that vitamin vitamin C

3370
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:11,920
is the same way I mean vitamin C if you

3371
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:16,120
make it synthetically it works or

3372
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:19,120
natural pure vitamin C works but if you

3373
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:20,479
take vitamin C and you extract it from

3374
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:23,079
plant sources

3375
02:30:20,478 --> 02:30:26,000
and you're getting the other Associated

3376
02:30:23,079 --> 02:30:28,478
uh compounds with it it's more

3377
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:31,760
effective and and and I think that the

3378
02:30:28,478 --> 02:30:33,679
the the the focus on uh honestly this is

3379
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:36,559
for ease of analysis on just looking at

3380
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:40,159
what makes up 90 or 95% of of the

3381
02:30:36,559 --> 02:30:42,278
compound is like that gets you into the

3382
02:30:40,159 --> 02:30:44,200
not even the ballpark but in Into the

3383
02:30:42,279 --> 02:30:46,040
City of where the ballpark is located

3384
02:30:44,200 --> 02:30:48,680
for for what's really driving all these

3385
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:50,960
all these effects and it's it is a very

3386
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:53,120
important shortcut to take but it also

3387
02:30:50,959 --> 02:30:54,278
once you've identified those you know

3388
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:55,880
like what are the most the key

3389
02:30:54,279 --> 02:30:57,200
components that that drive the most most

3390
02:30:55,879 --> 02:30:58,799
of the the effects you need to start

3391
02:30:57,200 --> 02:31:00,520
branching out and looking at that all of

3392
02:30:58,799 --> 02:31:03,278
the attendant components that that come

3393
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:06,279
with it and why whole Spectrum full

3394
02:31:03,279 --> 02:31:09,200
spectrum um extracts or or or or plants

3395
02:31:06,279 --> 02:31:11,079
are more effective than single like sort

3396
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:12,680
of sing Single compound dos and it's not

3397
02:31:11,079 --> 02:31:14,398
true for everything and that's important

3398
02:31:12,680 --> 02:31:16,000
to realize but I think that in this case

3399
02:31:14,398 --> 02:31:17,840
there is enough evidence that we should

3400
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:20,840
really start looking into this in great

3401
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:20,840
detail

3402
02:31:21,559 --> 02:31:26,278
other research that I've always found

3403
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:29,960
really interesting is why are some

3404
02:31:26,279 --> 02:31:33,120
varieties of cannabis seiling lless by

3405
02:31:29,959 --> 02:31:35,079
that I mean no matter how much you smoke

3406
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:37,279
you always get higher when you smoke

3407
02:31:35,079 --> 02:31:40,079
another joint or another pipe or another

3408
02:31:37,279 --> 02:31:42,399
dab of that material where some

3409
02:31:40,079 --> 02:31:44,398
materials you smoke you smoke you smoke

3410
02:31:42,398 --> 02:31:46,639
and then you get to the point where

3411
02:31:44,398 --> 02:31:49,599
it'll kind of make you more Stone but it

3412
02:31:46,639 --> 02:31:53,159
won't make you more high and uh I don't

3413
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:56,800
know everybody else but I want to get

3414
02:31:53,159 --> 02:31:58,680
higher and this this is something that U

3415
02:31:56,799 --> 02:32:02,039
you know coming from from my my

3416
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:04,200
background um I love the the community

3417
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:05,880
around it but gets me a little bit wonky

3418
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:09,000
sometimes is is the use of terms like

3419
02:32:05,879 --> 02:32:10,959
High versus Stone versus heady versus

3420
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:12,520
you know like body Buzz all those things

3421
02:32:10,959 --> 02:32:13,959
like like trying to Define and this is

3422
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:16,120
also because of I'm very particular

3423
02:32:13,959 --> 02:32:18,318
about terms um but trying to define

3424
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:20,479
those in a way that gives us a a sort of

3425
02:32:18,318 --> 02:32:22,318
a shared understanding that is that is

3426
02:32:20,478 --> 02:32:23,719
uh quantifiable that we we can track it

3427
02:32:22,318 --> 02:32:25,519
and we can trace it and analyze it

3428
02:32:23,719 --> 02:32:28,159
across different users and different

3429
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:29,600
strains is really important um but again

3430
02:32:28,159 --> 02:32:32,520
this may me being just a little bit more

3431
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:33,760
picky um and what you said earlier about

3432
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:35,239
certain strains and that's that's that

3433
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:37,398
was the other side of you know gentics

3434
02:32:35,239 --> 02:32:39,760
of people that are sort of anosmia but

3435
02:32:37,398 --> 02:32:41,519
there are also strains that um simply

3436
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:43,439
don't like there are choar let's focus

3437
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:47,359
on the on the the proper term they're

3438
02:32:43,439 --> 02:32:49,120
choar um that don't express the same um

3439
02:32:47,359 --> 02:32:51,159
canono and they don't express the same

3440
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:53,760
same aromatic bance why we're interested

3441
02:32:51,159 --> 02:32:55,000
in in all of these different uh sort of

3442
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:58,920
the different strains and these

3443
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:01,600
different cultivars um and you know

3444
02:32:58,920 --> 02:33:03,439
using those to as as as using that

3445
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:05,840
variability as as a feature rather than

3446
02:33:03,439 --> 02:33:08,200
a bug is is what I like to do is like

3447
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:10,478
let celebrate the variation in between

3448
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:13,040
uh people and plants because we can then

3449
02:33:10,478 --> 02:33:16,199
you know create blends of these things

3450
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:18,120
that do you know everything we want and

3451
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:20,000
you could tune them which is which I'm

3452
02:33:18,120 --> 02:33:21,600
really excited by is is you know you

3453
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:23,200
know uh you know taking the components

3454
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:24,800
that we want and then from from

3455
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:27,560
different strains and combining them to

3456
02:33:24,799 --> 02:33:29,199
create uh something that is not not sort

3457
02:33:27,559 --> 02:33:32,398
of expressed in the in the natural

3458
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:34,399
genetics as a plant breeder I'm very

3459
02:33:32,398 --> 02:33:37,119
interested in knowing what it is that

3460
02:33:34,398 --> 02:33:40,478
people prefer and why so that I can

3461
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:42,279
breed a plant that's tailored for that

3462
02:33:40,478 --> 02:33:44,639
exactly what's interesting is um we've

3463
02:33:42,279 --> 02:33:48,000
been doing a lot of accessions uh or

3464
02:33:44,639 --> 02:33:49,559
studies of of different chemo bars and

3465
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:51,159
uh working with Jeremy Plum I wish he

3466
02:33:49,559 --> 02:33:54,478
was on this call because he he'd start

3467
02:33:51,159 --> 02:33:56,559
laughing right now um is the uh the

3468
02:33:54,478 --> 02:33:59,559
terpinolene dominance that we're seeing

3469
02:33:56,559 --> 02:34:03,879
in the US market recreational and hemp

3470
02:33:59,559 --> 02:34:06,600
is massive and uh the point where like

3471
02:34:03,879 --> 02:34:08,799
we're seeing a a loss a potential loss

3472
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:10,159
of genetic diversity because people are

3473
02:34:08,799 --> 02:34:12,759
selecting so heavily for that

3474
02:34:10,159 --> 02:34:15,159
terpinolene dominance because it appes

3475
02:34:12,760 --> 02:34:16,760
sort of it it act or not actually it it

3476
02:34:15,159 --> 02:34:18,279
lifts up the Citrus it lifts up the

3477
02:34:16,760 --> 02:34:21,920
tropical and it lifts up the diesel and

3478
02:34:18,279 --> 02:34:24,000
gasy character so well that and piny as

3479
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:25,680
well that it seems like we might be sort

3480
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,879
of selecting ourselves into a corner

3481
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:29,960
with with breeding stock and so I think

3482
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:33,239
it's really important to not just go for

3483
02:34:29,959 --> 02:34:36,278
what people currently want but to also

3484
02:34:33,239 --> 02:34:38,719
look at what uh what we see there sort

3485
02:34:36,279 --> 02:34:41,720
of attend with those or not attend that

3486
02:34:38,719 --> 02:34:43,760
follow those clear uh customer

3487
02:34:41,719 --> 02:34:45,559
preferences and so we know that TR is

3488
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:47,318
very very exciting for a lot of people

3489
02:34:45,559 --> 02:34:48,600
and that's people judge their but oh

3490
02:34:47,318 --> 02:34:51,600
that's that sounds smells amazingly

3491
02:34:48,600 --> 02:34:53,520
gassy and citrusy great but you know

3492
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:55,680
maybe they like something that has a lot

3493
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:57,920
more um tropical character and a lot

3494
02:34:55,680 --> 02:35:00,200
more of the burnt rubber and uh guava

3495
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:02,000
character that comes from the th uh just

3496
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:05,840
to bring It full circle here and making

3497
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:07,200
sure that uh we can uh you know protect

3498
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:09,318
those genetics so that breeders like

3499
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:10,920
yourself can combine them and produce

3500
02:35:09,318 --> 02:35:14,359
something that has

3501
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:17,359
both people have often ask me what is

3502
02:35:14,359 --> 02:35:19,880
the best and I say what do you mean by

3503
02:35:17,359 --> 02:35:23,559
best do you mean the strongest the best

3504
02:35:19,879 --> 02:35:26,358
tasting the best what do you mean by the

3505
02:35:23,559 --> 02:35:29,559
best because without understanding what

3506
02:35:26,359 --> 02:35:32,439
they mean by the best there is no single

3507
02:35:29,559 --> 02:35:35,199
best cannabis for everybody it just

3508
02:35:32,439 --> 02:35:37,279
isn't that way or for every situation

3509
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:39,920
there also needs to be a germ plasm

3510
02:35:37,279 --> 02:35:42,840
Institute to protect all the genetics so

3511
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:46,120
that there can be biodiversity of what

3512
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:48,359
Nick is talking about yet protecting and

3513
02:35:46,120 --> 02:35:49,960
breeding the other you know

3514
02:35:48,359 --> 02:35:51,479
characteristics that are still there

3515
02:35:49,959 --> 02:35:53,639
that people have come to know and love

3516
02:35:51,478 --> 02:35:55,840
and the problem is those don't exist

3517
02:35:53,639 --> 02:35:58,239
domestically and they don't exist in

3518
02:35:55,840 --> 02:36:00,079
Canada at this time so we need to start

3519
02:35:58,239 --> 02:36:02,318
thinking about something like that so we

3520
02:36:00,079 --> 02:36:04,439
can protect it because I mean I this

3521
02:36:02,318 --> 02:36:06,879
genetic tattooed on my arm has gone well

3522
02:36:04,439 --> 02:36:09,439
over a decade and it was one that helped

3523
02:36:06,879 --> 02:36:11,079
many patients that I wish had been saved

3524
02:36:09,439 --> 02:36:14,040
but it's gone from the face of the Earth

3525
02:36:11,079 --> 02:36:16,478
so I think Nick bring up a very real

3526
02:36:14,040 --> 02:36:18,920
point that we have to be protecting the

3527
02:36:16,478 --> 02:36:21,879
genetics that we have but also the

3528
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:24,318
biodivers that exists so that in future

3529
02:36:21,879 --> 02:36:26,559
Generations can understand much less

3530
02:36:24,318 --> 02:36:31,478
appreciate

3531
02:36:26,559 --> 02:36:34,719
yeah it's kind of hard to CH because to

3532
02:36:31,478 --> 02:36:36,840
maintain a germ plasm for example let's

3533
02:36:34,719 --> 02:36:39,719
say you have just one land

3534
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:42,120
race you every time you reproduce that

3535
02:36:39,719 --> 02:36:44,398
land race to not lose genes from that

3536
02:36:42,120 --> 02:36:48,399
gene pool you've got to have a minimum

3537
02:36:44,398 --> 02:36:51,559
of 1,000 males and 1,000 females every

3538
02:36:48,398 --> 02:36:53,879
reproduction and those 1,000 males they

3539
02:36:51,559 --> 02:36:56,799
can't be clones all the same nail

3540
02:36:53,879 --> 02:37:01,278
they've got to be from seed 1,000 males

3541
02:36:56,799 --> 02:37:04,478
1 then you you you you limit your loss

3542
02:37:01,279 --> 02:37:07,200
to really really a small percentage but

3543
02:37:04,478 --> 02:37:09,599
uh yeah the the only place that's really

3544
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:12,479
done is in third world countries people

3545
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:14,000
aren't growing thousands and thousands

3546
02:37:12,478 --> 02:37:16,559
of plants from

3547
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:19,239
seeds in in the commercial cannabis

3548
02:37:16,559 --> 02:37:21,478
world it's just it's very seldom done it

3549
02:37:19,239 --> 02:37:23,559
can be done but it's not you hear that

3550
02:37:21,478 --> 02:37:25,318
hash churches youve got work to do get

3551
02:37:23,559 --> 02:37:27,318
on it we've got a lot of work yeah and I

3552
02:37:25,318 --> 02:37:28,760
think you know it's what Sam is saying

3553
02:37:27,318 --> 02:37:33,600
is like I think it's important for

3554
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:36,559
people to to keep running genetics and

3555
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:40,200
continue those lines and not move on so

3556
02:37:36,559 --> 02:37:43,318
fast and try to to keep those lines in

3557
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:44,800
existence um you know in seed form and

3558
02:37:43,318 --> 02:37:46,959
and that's one thing I think that at

3559
02:37:44,799 --> 02:37:49,159
least commercially in terms of seeds I

3560
02:37:46,959 --> 02:37:51,719
don't see at all you know I used to

3561
02:37:49,159 --> 02:37:54,478
really respect you know the individuals

3562
02:37:51,719 --> 02:37:56,840
that had 10 you know 10 lines that was

3563
02:37:54,478 --> 02:37:59,358
it and that's that every every year that

3564
02:37:56,840 --> 02:38:03,318
was it and they they maybe introduce one

3565
02:37:59,359 --> 02:38:07,359
or two new lines you know but not whole

3566
02:38:03,318 --> 02:38:09,478
revisions and you know whole new drops

3567
02:38:07,359 --> 02:38:13,318
of just completely different things from

3568
02:38:09,478 --> 02:38:16,519
clone you most companies in the world

3569
02:38:13,318 --> 02:38:19,959
can't even maintain clones for 20 30

3570
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:22,880
years for seed production so you can't

3571
02:38:19,959 --> 02:38:25,839
lose clones how you going to save

3572
02:38:22,879 --> 02:38:28,000
varieties so Sam back in the in like the

3573
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:30,960
90s when like Ben donker like you were

3574
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:34,120
SM you were you created the the you were

3575
02:38:30,959 --> 02:38:36,559
there right so at what time did the did

3576
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:38,840
those mother plants start to be really

3577
02:38:36,559 --> 02:38:41,799
difficult to obtain was it like the late

3578
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:43,880
late late 80s late 90s like what was it

3579
02:38:41,799 --> 02:38:46,679
difficult the whole time obtain them

3580
02:38:43,879 --> 02:38:50,559
from who from where I don't understand

3581
02:38:46,680 --> 02:38:52,279
how how long did you basically when did

3582
02:38:50,559 --> 02:38:55,478
people like Sensei start losing their

3583
02:38:52,279 --> 02:38:57,760
mother plants to you know probably from

3584
02:38:55,478 --> 02:39:03,039
day probably from day

3585
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:06,520
one uh yeah I mean if you keep a plant

3586
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:09,359
uh as a clone and you keep it virus free

3587
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:12,399
so keep the pests away yeah and it

3588
02:39:09,359 --> 02:39:16,318
doesn't pick up more viruses which will

3589
02:39:12,398 --> 02:39:18,159
cause it to be uh lose beer and uh

3590
02:39:16,318 --> 02:39:20,199
vitality and

3591
02:39:18,159 --> 02:39:21,719
uh it

3592
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:24,800
I didn't see any difference between

3593
02:39:21,719 --> 02:39:28,639
clones 30 years later if if you kept

3594
02:39:24,799 --> 02:39:30,278
them clean safe and secure and that's

3595
02:39:28,639 --> 02:39:32,639
actually something that's that's a very

3596
02:39:30,279 --> 02:39:34,960
that's becoming a very large challenge

3597
02:39:32,639 --> 02:39:36,478
right now because of the amount of um

3598
02:39:34,959 --> 02:39:37,759
unregulated growth that's going around

3599
02:39:36,478 --> 02:39:40,398
and people are sharing you know the cuts

3600
02:39:37,760 --> 02:39:41,880
and all that stuff um the the one of the

3601
02:39:40,398 --> 02:39:43,519
ways to do that is actually through

3602
02:39:41,879 --> 02:39:45,358
tissue culture because you can actually

3603
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:47,079
you know preserve certain cells that

3604
02:39:45,359 --> 02:39:49,840
don't have the virus yet and you can

3605
02:39:47,079 --> 02:39:53,760
grow it from companies like say

3606
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:55,600
and power plant are doing this for the

3607
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:57,719
community

3608
02:39:55,600 --> 02:40:00,040
yeah hop

3609
02:39:57,719 --> 02:40:01,199
viroids oh oh yeah and this for my for

3610
02:40:00,040 --> 02:40:03,319
my experience in the hop in the Hop

3611
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:04,720
industry that's a it's a big problem um

3612
02:40:03,318 --> 02:40:06,760
and we I mean like it's not a problem

3613
02:40:04,719 --> 02:40:08,159
for hops as as much but for for if

3614
02:40:06,760 --> 02:40:09,120
you're growing cannabis near them or if

3615
02:40:08,159 --> 02:40:10,159
you're processing the same facility

3616
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:13,160
there needs to be very very good

3617
02:40:10,159 --> 02:40:15,600
phytosanitary pH phytosanitary controls

3618
02:40:13,159 --> 02:40:16,520
um one of the things that um like going

3619
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:17,680
back to the sort of the Pres

3620
02:40:16,520 --> 02:40:19,840
preservation of genetics one of the

3621
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:22,880
things that I've done in my own

3622
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:27,439
uh breeding and curation is to try to

3623
02:40:22,879 --> 02:40:29,318
always uh speed out genetics that I like

3624
02:40:27,439 --> 02:40:31,200
for some for for whatever particular

3625
02:40:29,318 --> 02:40:32,439
reason and I always keep the seeds of

3626
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:34,000
you know the the sort of the crosses

3627
02:40:32,439 --> 02:40:34,960
that that I I'm not too happy about

3628
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:38,200
because there might be something that

3629
02:40:34,959 --> 02:40:40,119
pops up in them um and the like I've got

3630
02:40:38,200 --> 02:40:42,520
some from some gentics that have

3631
02:40:40,120 --> 02:40:44,840
abhorent agronomic characteristics so

3632
02:40:42,520 --> 02:40:46,439
just there're terrible they're spindly

3633
02:40:44,840 --> 02:40:48,840
uh they're they're incredibly might

3634
02:40:46,439 --> 02:40:52,439
sensitive they the one of the things I

3635
02:40:48,840 --> 02:40:54,398
do I really do breed for is uh powder

3636
02:40:52,439 --> 02:40:55,960
milder resistance uh and and Bounty

3637
02:40:54,398 --> 02:40:59,719
milder resistance I just don't like

3638
02:40:55,959 --> 02:41:02,079
fungal infections in my bud um but uh uh

3639
02:40:59,719 --> 02:41:04,039
I actually do run sort of M stress tests

3640
02:41:02,079 --> 02:41:05,200
on mine so if you ever go into whenever

3641
02:41:04,040 --> 02:41:06,760
when I'm in a breeding session you go

3642
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:07,880
into towards the end of it everything's

3643
02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:10,079
covered in mes and I'm just trying to

3644
02:41:07,879 --> 02:41:11,839
see which ones survive best um but

3645
02:41:10,079 --> 02:41:13,000
that's a risky category most people

3646
02:41:11,840 --> 02:41:14,799
don't want to do that I understand why

3647
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:17,639
but it's it's it's a fun fun thing for

3648
02:41:14,799 --> 02:41:19,920
me that's come on tell the truth that

3649
02:41:17,639 --> 02:41:21,760
you say you did that the truth is you

3650
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:25,920
just can't get rid of the little

3651
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:28,920
boogers no no no no I introduced

3652
02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:31,120
them actually drove somewhere a spiderm

3653
02:41:28,920 --> 02:41:33,439
INF station in a hopfield took some and

3654
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:36,960
put it into my into my my might tent

3655
02:41:33,439 --> 02:41:36,960
which is inside another tent which

3656
02:41:37,079 --> 02:41:45,318
is and have you found plants which were

3657
02:41:40,559 --> 02:41:49,959
might resistant and didn't get might yes

3658
02:41:45,318 --> 02:41:51,600
why do you think tury it's it it it's

3659
02:41:49,959 --> 02:41:52,919
it's very possible that it's it's I mean

3660
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:54,920
it's I would say it's likely that it's

3661
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:56,799
something to do in the aromatic profile

3662
02:41:54,920 --> 02:41:57,600
um but also that their immune response

3663
02:41:56,799 --> 02:42:00,599
is

3664
02:41:57,600 --> 02:42:04,040
probably I have grown millions of plants

3665
02:42:00,600 --> 02:42:07,520
in my life Nick and I've grown thousands

3666
02:42:04,040 --> 02:42:09,760
of different uh land races of cannabis I

3667
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:12,200
have never seen a plant that could not

3668
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:13,800
get mites okay so there there there's

3669
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:15,399
not getting mites and then there's

3670
02:42:13,799 --> 02:42:17,239
resisting mites at the load that it's

3671
02:42:15,398 --> 02:42:18,879
currently affecting other plants and so

3672
02:42:17,239 --> 02:42:20,719
they're always together in the same tent

3673
02:42:18,879 --> 02:42:23,318
and so so the plant the mites might go

3674
02:42:20,719 --> 02:42:24,959
to other plants over this this

3675
02:42:23,318 --> 02:42:28,000
particular

3676
02:42:24,959 --> 02:42:30,318
cross myself I've seen it myself I've

3677
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:33,478
seen it with the Congo seen lower level

3678
02:42:30,318 --> 02:42:35,959
in a room yeah exactly way lower levels

3679
02:42:33,478 --> 02:42:38,159
though like 90% were on the crop and

3680
02:42:35,959 --> 02:42:39,039
maybe like 10% or less were on this

3681
02:42:38,159 --> 02:42:42,959
other

3682
02:42:39,040 --> 02:42:46,000
planet and speaking of resistance and

3683
02:42:42,959 --> 02:42:48,679
susceptibility the those important Milo

3684
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:50,439
papers came out which they found both

3685
02:42:48,680 --> 02:42:54,398
jeans for

3686
02:42:50,439 --> 02:42:56,359
susceptibility and genes for resistance

3687
02:42:54,398 --> 02:42:59,358
and they found out that it's more

3688
02:42:56,359 --> 02:43:01,760
important to not have the susceptibility

3689
02:42:59,359 --> 02:43:04,920
genes than it is to have the resistance

3690
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:07,800
genes to avoid mildew in your plants hey

3691
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:09,840
speaking in resistance Brian you're

3692
02:43:07,799 --> 02:43:12,199
you're working in a in a climate I think

3693
02:43:09,840 --> 02:43:15,159
that is more challenging than anyone

3694
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:17,920
yeah here and You' been reading for

3695
02:43:15,159 --> 02:43:19,879
years you know like you know like I have

3696
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:22,159
in you know on the East Coast we have a

3697
02:43:19,879 --> 02:43:24,199
tremendous amount of rain like today's a

3698
02:43:22,159 --> 02:43:26,520
great example you know we're we're in

3699
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:28,840
the thick of a tropical event you know

3700
02:43:26,520 --> 02:43:33,439
that's uh that's just been broken

3701
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:35,120
up yeah it's Challen Sunny up here today

3702
02:43:33,439 --> 02:43:37,239
it's sunny up here today but it's really

3703
02:43:35,120 --> 02:43:39,600
windy which isn't bad the land I have

3704
02:43:37,239 --> 02:43:42,600
here has opened up for good air drainage

3705
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:44,439
air flow um but yeah this is interesting

3706
02:43:42,600 --> 02:43:46,960
I was going to bring it up or ask anyone

3707
02:43:44,439 --> 02:43:50,520
that if they've seen any resistance

3708
02:43:46,959 --> 02:43:52,879
which I've to betrus from the lemoning

3709
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:55,079
group I've seen the lemon

3710
02:43:52,879 --> 02:43:56,799
oriented types and I can't break down

3711
02:43:55,079 --> 02:43:58,959
the science in terms of the breakdown

3712
02:43:56,799 --> 02:44:01,039
for the family of Tarpin of profile but

3713
02:43:58,959 --> 02:44:04,159
I've seen things in the lemon category

3714
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:08,200
be very resistant into the later season

3715
02:44:04,159 --> 02:44:11,119
for Bettis and resistance and then I've

3716
02:44:08,200 --> 02:44:13,359
seen this year out of a whole list of

3717
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:16,319
types I've actually seen only powdery

3718
02:44:13,359 --> 02:44:19,840
mil do pop up late season on the gas

3719
02:44:16,318 --> 02:44:21,359
mask feno number six backat cross one

3720
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:23,159
and which is ironic because the mom

3721
02:44:21,359 --> 02:44:26,520
doesn't show that so it's something

3722
02:44:23,159 --> 02:44:28,478
reached out and is not resistant in it

3723
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:32,279
but otherwise it's not bad it came in

3724
02:44:28,478 --> 02:44:34,438
late and everything else very very clean

3725
02:44:32,279 --> 02:44:37,200
and I've been breeding like five years

3726
02:44:34,439 --> 02:44:39,159
back here towards that so it shows with

3727
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:41,640
with Milo being a challenge but I found

3728
02:44:39,159 --> 02:44:45,799
it to be a challenge uh cultivar

3729
02:44:41,639 --> 02:44:48,439
specific strain specific more and yeah

3730
02:44:45,799 --> 02:44:51,000
so kind of leaning off of of things that

3731
02:44:48,439 --> 02:44:53,159
might go that that way and I'm finding

3732
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:56,478
definitely in Maine that more that the

3733
02:44:53,159 --> 02:44:59,840
fruit forward cookie back type still

3734
02:44:56,478 --> 02:45:02,159
kind of working with that complex of of

3735
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:03,398
uh genetics with some other tie in i'

3736
02:45:02,159 --> 02:45:06,359
I've got a whole list of some

3737
02:45:03,398 --> 02:45:08,318
exploration this year which I can list

3738
02:45:06,359 --> 02:45:11,720
off some strains that I'm working with

3739
02:45:08,318 --> 02:45:15,359
since if that is interesting anyone I

3740
02:45:11,719 --> 02:45:18,039
yes please I was trying to bre science

3741
02:45:15,359 --> 02:45:20,559
happening here I was trying to breed

3742
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:24,560
against P try to also I was trying to do

3743
02:45:20,559 --> 02:45:28,719
it in Skunk number one and uh I grew

3744
02:45:24,559 --> 02:45:31,840
several years and uh I it was so

3745
02:45:28,719 --> 02:45:33,719
difficult that I gave up but uh

3746
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:37,559
definitely could be because if you think

3747
02:45:33,719 --> 02:45:40,079
about it you I never see but tritis in a

3748
02:45:37,559 --> 02:45:41,840
variety like original

3749
02:45:40,079 --> 02:45:44,840
hay

3750
02:45:41,840 --> 02:45:47,398
so you know

3751
02:45:44,840 --> 02:45:49,239
really I really wonder what comes down

3752
02:45:47,398 --> 02:45:51,079
because Brian I really want to hear your

3753
02:45:49,239 --> 02:45:54,478
uh your strain list and I just wanted to

3754
02:45:51,079 --> 02:45:59,799
add yeah there people that want to hear

3755
02:45:54,478 --> 02:46:02,438
it yeah and I we also created 40 new

3756
02:45:59,799 --> 02:46:04,199
varietals um and everything that we did

3757
02:46:02,439 --> 02:46:05,318
this year was off a seed and I think we

3758
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:09,279
did about

3759
02:46:05,318 --> 02:46:11,639
1300 plants all from seed all our old

3760
02:46:09,279 --> 02:46:14,040
varietals and then mixing in some others

3761
02:46:11,639 --> 02:46:17,719
but I'm wondering to wanted to bring it

3762
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:19,800
into the conversation that maybe mo more

3763
02:46:17,719 --> 02:46:21,679
than having to do with varietals because

3764
02:46:19,799 --> 02:46:23,679
we've been growing in this bare area for

3765
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:25,479
so long we've been adding to our soil

3766
02:46:23,680 --> 02:46:29,159
for so long we've been getting it right

3767
02:46:25,478 --> 02:46:31,599
for so long we only do seed varietals

3768
02:46:29,159 --> 02:46:34,359
we'll keep our clone you know we'll keep

3769
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:36,399
um a mother maybe only because we've

3770
02:46:34,359 --> 02:46:38,439
we've grown it out from that year or

3771
02:46:36,398 --> 02:46:40,680
something but normally we'll just

3772
02:46:38,439 --> 02:46:43,159
continue to grow seeds and I've just

3773
02:46:40,680 --> 02:46:46,040
realized that now it's not really

3774
02:46:43,159 --> 02:46:48,159
mattering what varietal that we are

3775
02:46:46,040 --> 02:46:50,760
working with if we've been working with

3776
02:46:48,159 --> 02:46:53,000
it for a long time because I think then

3777
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:56,000
that involves the Endo fidic

3778
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:58,120
relationship within the plant that then

3779
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:00,040
goes into the seed because I think if

3780
02:46:58,120 --> 02:47:02,840
they building something that's super

3781
02:47:00,040 --> 02:47:05,720
resisting resistant you're building it

3782
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:06,960
through biology as well which hasn't

3783
02:47:05,719 --> 02:47:09,639
necessarily been a part of this

3784
02:47:06,959 --> 02:47:12,358
conversation up till now yes I think

3785
02:47:09,639 --> 02:47:15,079
varials are part of it yes I think tpin

3786
02:47:12,359 --> 02:47:17,920
can maybe draw more interesting things

3787
02:47:15,079 --> 02:47:20,120
from the air higher lactic acid is drawn

3788
02:47:17,920 --> 02:47:23,359
to more you know you know lemoning

3789
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:25,479
varietals I've noticed that also Brian

3790
02:47:23,359 --> 02:47:28,520
but the Endo fidic reaction so now it

3791
02:47:25,478 --> 02:47:30,799
really seems like anything new that we

3792
02:47:28,520 --> 02:47:34,600
bring on to our property is what's going

3793
02:47:30,799 --> 02:47:37,840
to get you know some kind of a reaction

3794
02:47:34,600 --> 02:47:39,720
have some type of a malady um in it and

3795
02:47:37,840 --> 02:47:42,000
then it takes us several years to then

3796
02:47:39,719 --> 02:47:45,079
work with it and then now we're getting

3797
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:47,840
to the point where we are having hardly

3798
02:47:45,079 --> 02:47:50,159
any we live in an incredibly difficult

3799
02:47:47,840 --> 02:47:51,840
environment it's super cold up here

3800
02:47:50,159 --> 02:47:54,520
we're in an inland

3801
02:47:51,840 --> 02:47:55,960
rainforest and this year we didn't have

3802
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:58,960
hardly any

3803
02:47:55,959 --> 02:48:02,679
buritis no and that and that's in stock

3804
02:47:58,959 --> 02:48:04,318
and Bud in early and late and it just

3805
02:48:02,680 --> 02:48:05,880
sort of goes on and on but the ones that

3806
02:48:04,318 --> 02:48:08,519
we did have the problems with were the

3807
02:48:05,879 --> 02:48:10,079
ones that were early and Brian I want to

3808
02:48:08,520 --> 02:48:12,079
roll right over to you because I'd love

3809
02:48:10,079 --> 02:48:15,439
to hear your

3810
02:48:12,079 --> 02:48:18,879
list oh well I we've had a great success

3811
02:48:15,439 --> 02:48:21,960
summer too for health actually and have

3812
02:48:18,879 --> 02:48:24,839
have really not seen much of any

3813
02:48:21,959 --> 02:48:28,159
Bettis um really into this later finish

3814
02:48:24,840 --> 02:48:30,680
which where kind of a better cold main

3815
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:34,000
sunny and Breezy finish this year so

3816
02:48:30,680 --> 02:48:35,960
that helps but the health is really up

3817
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:38,760
and I would show one strain I saw that

3818
02:48:35,959 --> 02:48:41,318
was interesting is from Dominion seedco

3819
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:43,880
from duke Diamond that's a local skunk I

3820
02:48:41,318 --> 02:48:45,478
don't know how much skunk guet has in

3821
02:48:43,879 --> 02:48:48,358
there but I was going to let Sam know

3822
02:48:45,478 --> 02:48:50,799
that that one was actually a resistant

3823
02:48:48,359 --> 02:48:52,960
and reparative strain where I say it

3824
02:48:50,799 --> 02:48:55,920
cracked down the middle even with some

3825
02:48:52,959 --> 02:48:58,119
support and did a little quick bind job

3826
02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:59,639
and this it came back late season where

3827
02:48:58,120 --> 02:49:02,760
it looked like it was about to die off

3828
02:48:59,639 --> 02:49:04,519
and it had great resistance repair uh

3829
02:49:02,760 --> 02:49:07,639
which I've seen with hemp but not as

3830
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:10,399
much with cannabis and then it's got no

3831
02:49:07,639 --> 02:49:12,439
mold there's no mold no Bettis no

3832
02:49:10,398 --> 02:49:15,119
septoria that's an old scratch pile

3833
02:49:12,439 --> 02:49:17,920
compost that had actually a sour best

3834
02:49:15,120 --> 02:49:20,720
[ __ ] ever with a rulin called candy

3835
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:22,719
coated that took some septoria pretty

3836
02:49:20,719 --> 02:49:25,478
hard like almost the hardest in the yard

3837
02:49:22,719 --> 02:49:27,519
picked clean Leaf know killed the Spore

3838
02:49:25,478 --> 02:49:30,000
Colony or tried do and it came back on

3839
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:32,159
it right away and then on the backside a

3840
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:35,200
black dominis super skunk seems to be

3841
02:49:32,159 --> 02:49:36,840
throwing lay but catching betrus really

3842
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:39,520
kind of quickly otherwise looking

3843
02:49:36,840 --> 02:49:41,439
healthy in this little three plant set

3844
02:49:39,520 --> 02:49:43,600
of just experimental run but the the

3845
02:49:41,439 --> 02:49:47,159
dominions work there the local skunk

3846
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:50,840
this one feno just really awesome gassy

3847
02:49:47,159 --> 02:49:53,238
kind of skunky gas skunk or sweet gas

3848
02:49:50,840 --> 02:49:58,200
skunk more than just Rony skunk I would

3849
02:49:53,238 --> 02:50:00,840
say so yeah anyway um I have the strain

3850
02:49:58,200 --> 02:50:03,040
list though so I'll read it off this

3851
02:50:00,840 --> 02:50:06,920
year what we're working with we've got

3852
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:09,960
some cherry chem I've got a Tropicana

3853
02:50:06,920 --> 02:50:13,040
kosher Tangi on my gas mask called

3854
02:50:09,959 --> 02:50:17,119
masquerade I've got a strawberry lime

3855
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:20,920
feno of my holy Road I've got some 91

3856
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:24,439
Royale and uh grapefruit skunk sided

3857
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:27,680
holy Road I've got a gas mask backat

3858
02:50:24,439 --> 02:50:28,960
cross one some black Wilson Reserve uh

3859
02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:32,318
cough

3860
02:50:28,959 --> 02:50:35,879
bx1 the candy coated ROM

3861
02:50:32,318 --> 02:50:38,199
sbse we've got that local skunk guava

3862
02:50:35,879 --> 02:50:41,318
mask is doing amazingly well just really

3863
02:50:38,200 --> 02:50:42,840
kind of running the the number of fenos

3864
02:50:41,318 --> 02:50:44,920
not a whole ton but enough of them to

3865
02:50:42,840 --> 02:50:48,359
get a good look on it and had great

3866
02:50:44,920 --> 02:50:50,719
results there so the Cherry mask is

3867
02:50:48,359 --> 02:50:52,640
doing really well also and I would share

3868
02:50:50,719 --> 02:50:54,840
back that the Cherry cam was from self

3869
02:50:52,639 --> 02:50:56,680
Fork seeds I got given to me at an

3870
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:59,680
emerald Cup right before I came back

3871
02:50:56,680 --> 02:51:01,800
here like six to seven years ago and

3872
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:04,238
usually see the indicia sided stuff in

3873
02:51:01,799 --> 02:51:05,799
Maine kind of go like you might have

3874
02:51:04,238 --> 02:51:07,398
mentioned with newer indicia types

3875
02:51:05,799 --> 02:51:09,799
introduced to the land even though we

3876
02:51:07,398 --> 02:51:12,119
like some of them I've had to breed with

3877
02:51:09,799 --> 02:51:14,398
like a blackberry pie local cut to get

3878
02:51:12,120 --> 02:51:15,239
the resistance out a year or two later

3879
02:51:14,398 --> 02:51:18,039
from

3880
02:51:15,238 --> 02:51:20,000
it and I'm seeing it even a year later

3881
02:51:18,040 --> 02:51:22,239
but you you know going back to it I've

3882
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:26,040
saw Cherry Kem this year from a seed

3883
02:51:22,238 --> 02:51:28,359
feno that really showed such good good

3884
02:51:26,040 --> 02:51:30,760
health that it did hit a septor little

3885
02:51:28,359 --> 02:51:32,840
bit of challenge which you know to bring

3886
02:51:30,760 --> 02:51:35,398
it up septor is like crushing trees that

3887
02:51:32,840 --> 02:51:37,719
are 20 30 feet tall now in Maine over

3888
02:51:35,398 --> 02:51:39,398
the last two years and the locals are

3889
02:51:37,719 --> 02:51:41,719
talking about I walk the woods and see

3890
02:51:39,398 --> 02:51:43,519
it and it seems like a climate change

3891
02:51:41,719 --> 02:51:45,959
but a different conversation type of

3892
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:47,720
thing and I'd get you know information

3893
02:51:45,959 --> 02:51:52,238
from the people on that one actually

3894
02:51:47,719 --> 02:51:55,358
seems to be where out with it but uh bre

3895
02:51:52,238 --> 02:51:57,520
fusium and fusarium too in the in in

3896
02:51:55,359 --> 02:52:00,559
your areas and just just this area in

3897
02:51:57,520 --> 02:52:03,120
New England and it's been what I've

3898
02:52:00,559 --> 02:52:06,079
heard it's new for me in the last few

3899
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:10,079
years but um yeah New York New York you

3900
02:52:06,079 --> 02:52:13,000
never had these types of things um so

3901
02:52:10,079 --> 02:52:15,840
it's um yeah I don't know

3902
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:18,520
it's yeah we're having to treat you know

3903
02:52:15,840 --> 02:52:20,520
even reverse mosis water has to be

3904
02:52:18,520 --> 02:52:23,079
treated you know even

3905
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:24,560
with you know going through systems so

3906
02:52:23,079 --> 02:52:27,039
it's it's really challenging I don't

3907
02:52:24,559 --> 02:52:28,840
know you know what you're doing to yeah

3908
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:30,680
we're seeing we're seeing these

3909
02:52:28,840 --> 02:52:32,600
different blights pop up Colin like that

3910
02:52:30,680 --> 02:52:34,760
like this you know septoria ferum I've

3911
02:52:32,600 --> 02:52:37,720
seen more septoria but it's added a

3912
02:52:34,760 --> 02:52:40,000
whole new level of of not negative but

3913
02:52:37,719 --> 02:52:41,559
actually positive movement for plant

3914
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:44,279
adaptation in the breeding that we're

3915
02:52:41,559 --> 02:52:47,359
doing with the I'm doing all that yes

3916
02:52:44,279 --> 02:52:49,680
nice I'm I'm finding I'm breeding more

3917
02:52:47,359 --> 02:52:52,960
for septoria since now that any of the

3918
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:55,000
Bettis or PMS like old news Bettis is

3919
02:52:52,959 --> 02:52:57,318
hard in main but the septor is such a

3920
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:59,639
kicker with even Big Trees other I can

3921
02:52:57,318 --> 02:53:01,959
see it in nature Tak certain types not

3922
02:52:59,639 --> 02:53:04,079
others right so I'm seeing it back to

3923
02:53:01,959 --> 02:53:06,599
the plants with cannabis it's not it's

3924
02:53:04,079 --> 02:53:08,200
not strain specific it's phenos specific

3925
02:53:06,600 --> 02:53:11,079
I've seen sisters touching each other

3926
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:13,040
like like Grava Kush and I documented it

3927
02:53:11,079 --> 02:53:15,559
this year where it's literally knocked

3928
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:18,000
off the flow is healthy but the seor hit

3929
02:53:15,559 --> 02:53:19,719
everything even with a clean out twice

3930
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:21,600
and we just took it down early and it

3931
02:53:19,719 --> 02:53:24,799
was finished it was on the IND side

3932
02:53:21,600 --> 02:53:26,479
thing too but the more sativa expressing

3933
02:53:24,799 --> 02:53:29,398
sister right next door touching it a

3934
02:53:26,478 --> 02:53:31,959
foot and a half away not one touch of

3935
02:53:29,398 --> 02:53:34,159
septoria on it so I'm kind of like

3936
02:53:31,959 --> 02:53:36,079
having to breed more through that these

3937
02:53:34,159 --> 02:53:38,600
days than anything else but seeing

3938
02:53:36,079 --> 02:53:40,920
things that are resistant you know on

3939
02:53:38,600 --> 02:53:42,760
one thing and not another the the light

3940
02:53:40,920 --> 02:53:44,879
hit of sepor at the end on Cherry cam

3941
02:53:42,760 --> 02:53:47,800
but otherwise it like moved on from no

3942
02:53:44,879 --> 02:53:50,478
Milo no betri even in the second stage

3943
02:53:47,799 --> 02:53:53,278
cut off the the tops you know right now

3944
02:53:50,478 --> 02:53:55,318
checking it every day and I would share

3945
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:57,960
back to that is the lemoning family and

3946
02:53:55,318 --> 02:54:00,519
then now into the whatever Cherry you

3947
02:53:57,959 --> 02:54:03,318
guys would know more makes up into the

3948
02:54:00,520 --> 02:54:05,359
Cherry Pie on chmd like I think was back

3949
02:54:03,318 --> 02:54:07,238
cross three or four on the chamd and

3950
02:54:05,359 --> 02:54:09,479
it's all cherry pie sided too it's just

3951
02:54:07,238 --> 02:54:11,079
got a little GL you know gasl and it

3952
02:54:09,478 --> 02:54:13,719
doesn't wash although you might be able

3953
02:54:11,079 --> 02:54:16,000
to pull something it doesn't wash for us

3954
02:54:13,719 --> 02:54:20,159
you know but it's a it's a flower

3955
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:21,799
strain I'll come up yeah

3956
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:23,318
yeah I was gonna say I got a few goodies

3957
02:54:21,799 --> 02:54:24,759
that I can't wait to like throw your

3958
02:54:23,318 --> 02:54:27,359
away to see if you pull something off

3959
02:54:24,760 --> 02:54:29,719
them like the grapefruit skunk hly Road

3960
02:54:27,359 --> 02:54:32,399
you know it goes back to that Calo skunk

3961
02:54:29,719 --> 02:54:35,879
one cut from Humble clone that's not

3962
02:54:32,398 --> 02:54:39,199
like their typical Tangi and I One my

3963
02:54:35,879 --> 02:54:40,679
alltime favorites yeah yeah and it goes

3964
02:54:39,200 --> 02:54:42,359
grapefruit skunk you know what I'm

3965
02:54:40,680 --> 02:54:46,680
talking about it's really grapefruit ha

3966
02:54:42,359 --> 02:54:48,800
grapefruit skunking and know so I can't

3967
02:54:46,680 --> 02:54:51,279
what's that I I hate to interrupt I need

3968
02:54:48,799 --> 02:54:54,238
to my flight's boarding like seven

3969
02:54:51,279 --> 02:54:56,359
minutes so I need to just say say say

3970
02:54:54,238 --> 02:55:00,079
goodbye but also in Rel relation to this

3971
02:54:56,359 --> 02:55:02,760
specific thing um if you look at um the

3972
02:55:00,079 --> 02:55:05,359
obviously the lemine and lenol dominant

3973
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:08,318
so for citrus um there typically is also

3974
02:55:05,359 --> 02:55:11,159
a lot of Alpha and beta pining and

3975
02:55:08,318 --> 02:55:13,920
cedine and uh those combinations are

3976
02:55:11,159 --> 02:55:17,879
what make up pinol and a lot of the um

3977
02:55:13,920 --> 02:55:21,000
sort of or coniferous oils that are used

3978
02:55:17,879 --> 02:55:23,238
as anti fungal um and I suspect that

3979
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:25,478
those will probably have a lot OFA on

3980
02:55:23,238 --> 02:55:27,119
that and they taste great so you know as

3981
02:55:25,478 --> 02:55:28,438
a Target like if you can find any Piney

3982
02:55:27,120 --> 02:55:30,520
varieties cross them with lemine

3983
02:55:28,439 --> 02:55:33,840
varieties you're probably going to get a

3984
02:55:30,520 --> 02:55:35,920
decent uh a decent little uh uh sort of

3985
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:38,200
antifungal cocktail there um I really

3986
02:55:35,920 --> 02:55:39,840
wish I could stay on but I need to

3987
02:55:38,200 --> 02:55:41,800

hours I want I wanted to hear a little

3997
02:55:59,478 --> 02:56:03,478
bit more from Wade because we haven't

3998
02:56:01,439 --> 02:56:07,159
heard enough from Wade how how is

3999
02:56:03,478 --> 02:56:10,559
everything going in Wade's world right

4000
02:56:07,159 --> 02:56:13,520
now um things are going pretty good in

4001
02:56:10,559 --> 02:56:15,920
Wade's World um I've been loving this

4002
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:19,159
conversation and seeing some of the

4003
02:56:15,920 --> 02:56:24,398
faces and um

4004
02:56:19,159 --> 02:56:27,840
uh enjoying my uh dab rig here

4005
02:56:24,398 --> 02:56:31,079
um I uh it occurred to me to try and do

4006
02:56:27,840 --> 02:56:35,120
a memory test and and review what I've

4007
02:56:31,079 --> 02:56:37,600
heard today um I know early on in the

4008
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:39,760
conversation uh Kelly and Josh were

4009
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:44,359
talking about getting a letter from the

4010
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:47,398
EPA about their products and um and it

4011
02:56:44,359 --> 02:56:49,720
occurs to me to say that I that's a sign

4012
02:56:47,398 --> 02:56:51,680
of respect they recognize that you're

4013
02:56:49,719 --> 02:56:55,438
actually doing something in the market

4014
02:56:51,680 --> 02:57:00,200
and to some extent you're a threat to an

4015
02:56:55,439 --> 02:57:01,880
existing business model um and uh one of

4016
02:57:00,200 --> 02:57:04,079
the thoughts I had as that conversation

4017
02:57:01,879 --> 02:57:06,839
progressed was I live in California

4018
02:57:04,079 --> 02:57:08,920
where we have an abundance of rules and

4019
02:57:06,840 --> 02:57:11,600
regulations for

4020
02:57:08,920 --> 02:57:14,200
everything and especially cannabis and

4021
02:57:11,600 --> 02:57:16,800
to be quite honest in my opinion

4022
02:57:14,200 --> 02:57:19,359
especially as a patient myself uh at a

4023
02:57:16,799 --> 02:57:22,318
whole new serious level now and My Life

4024
02:57:19,359 --> 02:57:24,960
um we've made a hot mess of legalization

4025
02:57:22,318 --> 02:57:27,799
it's not really legalization it's

4026
02:57:24,959 --> 02:57:30,199
commercialization um but that wanders

4027
02:57:27,799 --> 02:57:35,039
off to a different topic and I wanted to

4028
02:57:30,200 --> 02:57:37,200
try again like a memory thing um after

4029
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:40,200
after that we got into this thing about

4030
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:44,000
science and nature and I think of

4031
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:46,359
science myself as um and I'm not a paid

4032
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:49,840
scientist Mark but I understand your

4033
02:57:46,359 --> 02:57:53,680
point well said um

4034
02:57:49,840 --> 02:57:56,680
to me science is really a method of

4035
02:57:53,680 --> 02:57:59,238
trying to understand nature in all its

4036
02:57:56,680 --> 02:58:02,238
various aspects everything from the

4037
02:57:59,238 --> 02:58:05,318
stars and the universe that we live in

4038
02:58:02,238 --> 02:58:08,520
to um how our bodies work and we

4039
02:58:05,318 --> 02:58:10,920
wouldn't know so much about how cannabis

4040
02:58:08,520 --> 02:58:13,720
has the effects it does in the body in

4041
02:58:10,920 --> 02:58:16,920
addition to psychoactivity

4042
02:58:13,719 --> 02:58:20,119
Heist um if it weren't for science I

4043
02:58:16,920 --> 02:58:22,639
mean science wanted to learn about

4044
02:58:20,120 --> 02:58:25,239
cannabis uh and did and has and has

4045
02:58:22,639 --> 02:58:28,358
revealed an incredible amount and and

4046
02:58:25,238 --> 02:58:31,959
Mark uh scalone Dr Mark scalone pointed

4047
02:58:28,359 --> 02:58:35,318
to a paper I think he met referenced

4048
02:58:31,959 --> 02:58:37,959
cbda um and some of the effects that

4049
02:58:35,318 --> 02:58:40,238
it's had and yeah I I'm a big fan as you

4050
02:58:37,959 --> 02:58:43,000
can imagine

4051
02:58:40,238 --> 02:58:47,879
um um let's see after that it went

4052
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:50,279
towards oh yeah we got into thols and uh

4053
02:58:47,879 --> 02:58:52,920
and their the the effects and their

4054
02:58:50,279 --> 02:58:58,079
presence and Sam was talking about doing

4055
02:58:52,920 --> 02:59:00,200
the 25 milligrams THC and uh and then

4056
02:58:58,079 --> 02:59:02,439
adding a tpine one at a time one day at

4057
02:59:00,200 --> 02:59:04,640
a time I love that kind of methodical

4058
02:59:02,439 --> 02:59:06,680
approach because that's science actually

4059
02:59:04,639 --> 02:59:09,039
that's especially if you keep track of

4060
02:59:06,680 --> 02:59:12,279
what you're doing records I'm sure Sam

4061
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:15,080
does uh breeding into scale you know I'm

4062
02:59:12,279 --> 02:59:17,040
just stunned at the breadth of knowledge

4063
02:59:15,079 --> 02:59:20,920
in this group of people that you invite

4064
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:20,920
Marcus and

4065
02:59:21,200 --> 02:59:27,640
um in a certain way I feel very humbled

4066
02:59:24,279 --> 02:59:27,640
to sit here with you all

4067
02:59:28,680 --> 02:59:36,559
today um but I also feel inspired you

4068
02:59:33,238 --> 02:59:38,760
know um my life has changed pretty

4069
02:59:36,559 --> 02:59:44,318
dramatically in the last

4070
02:59:38,760 --> 02:59:45,559
year uh but in a good way because um

4071
02:59:44,318 --> 02:59:47,238
there were some health challenges

4072
02:59:45,559 --> 02:59:49,920
happening in my life four or five years

4073
02:59:47,238 --> 02:59:52,600
ago that didn't make sense to me it

4074
02:59:49,920 --> 02:59:54,920
wasn't the person that I always thought

4075
02:59:52,600 --> 02:59:56,840
lived in this body you know the body was

4076
02:59:54,920 --> 02:59:59,398
going through some changes I think it's

4077
02:59:56,840 --> 03:00:02,079
part of getting old but for me it was

4078
02:59:59,398 --> 03:00:05,680
specifically a form of cancer that has

4079
03:00:02,079 --> 03:00:07,600
manifested in my bones and

4080
03:00:05,680 --> 03:00:11,559
um and

4081
03:00:07,600 --> 03:00:12,318
so um on that conversation about science

4082
03:00:11,559 --> 03:00:16,359
and

4083
03:00:12,318 --> 03:00:18,199
nature I love nature very much I've

4084
03:00:16,359 --> 03:00:19,600
spent a good portion of my life trying

4085
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:24,560
to understand

4086
03:00:19,600 --> 03:00:27,640
how how a garden works and what the

4087
03:00:24,559 --> 03:00:31,559
diversity of nature can

4088
03:00:27,639 --> 03:00:35,439
do for a plant that I love very much and

4089
03:00:31,559 --> 03:00:40,439
now um what I found as a patient

4090
03:00:35,439 --> 03:00:43,318
myself um is that uh in the regulated

4091
03:00:40,439 --> 03:00:45,520
market in California even in Nevada

4092
03:00:43,318 --> 03:00:48,278
County which is where I live I live

4093
03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:50,000
between Nevada City and Grass Valley uh

4094
03:00:48,279 --> 03:00:53,520
in the Sierra

4095
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:56,439
Foothills um even here where our local

4096
03:00:53,520 --> 03:00:59,840
cannabis Alliance has created a program

4097
03:00:56,439 --> 03:01:02,238
through a whole supply chain where any

4098
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:04,398
patient who has a medical recommendation

4099
03:01:02,238 --> 03:01:07,398
from their physician can get free

4100
03:01:04,398 --> 03:01:10,599
product that's been donated by the the

4101
03:01:07,398 --> 03:01:13,278
supply chain all of the license holders

4102
03:01:10,600 --> 03:01:17,238
in our area uh contribute not all of

4103
03:01:13,279 --> 03:01:21,200
them a good portion of them um and I've

4104
03:01:17,238 --> 03:01:21,199
taken advantage I I helped set that

4105
03:01:21,238 --> 03:01:27,840
up and over the last year I have

4106
03:01:25,680 --> 03:01:30,600
actually taken advantage of that program

4107
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:33,478
quite a bit but even

4108
03:01:30,600 --> 03:01:36,880
me with all of the people I know it's

4109
03:01:33,478 --> 03:01:40,639
it's kind of hard to find versions of

4110
03:01:36,879 --> 03:01:43,358
the canvas plant chemistry in products

4111
03:01:40,639 --> 03:01:46,079
where I can get the couple of hundred

4112
03:01:43,359 --> 03:01:48,559
milligrams that I want couple times a

4113
03:01:46,079 --> 03:01:53,478
day I'm not really much trying to

4114
03:01:48,559 --> 03:01:55,439
control my cancer because the um back to

4115
03:01:53,478 --> 03:01:58,438
science for a second and if this is too

4116
03:01:55,439 --> 03:02:02,398
much interation anybody interrupt but uh

4117
03:01:58,439 --> 03:02:05,318
back to science um I ended up in a

4118
03:02:02,398 --> 03:02:09,639
series of hospitals uh in December of

4119
03:02:05,318 --> 03:02:14,079
last year um about coming on 10 months

4120
03:02:09,639 --> 03:02:17,920
ago now um and at one of them down in

4121
03:02:14,079 --> 03:02:21,520
Stanford I got a course of radiation in

4122
03:02:17,920 --> 03:02:24,238
one day one dose it worked wonders at

4123
03:02:21,520 --> 03:02:28,640
least my experience other than a sunburn

4124
03:02:24,238 --> 03:02:32,000
around my mouth but um uh my appetite

4125
03:02:28,639 --> 03:02:34,478
improved I slept better I was less pain

4126
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:36,318
um and meantime yeah I was on a pretty

4127
03:02:34,478 --> 03:02:40,719
aggressive CAS course of

4128
03:02:36,318 --> 03:02:44,238
chemo um and I think it kept me

4129
03:02:40,719 --> 03:02:44,238
alive I'm really

4130
03:02:45,079 --> 03:02:52,120
grateful I

4131
03:02:46,840 --> 03:02:55,439
have a really renewed and profound sense

4132
03:02:52,120 --> 03:02:58,840
of how life really is a

4133
03:02:55,439 --> 03:03:02,960
gift your chance

4134
03:02:58,840 --> 03:03:06,200
to be involved with family to be

4135
03:03:02,959 --> 03:03:08,799
involved in a community back to the the

4136
03:03:06,200 --> 03:03:12,479
theme of this morning's

4137
03:03:08,799 --> 03:03:14,358
Church uh the idea that we are in fact a

4138
03:03:12,478 --> 03:03:16,398
community and

4139
03:03:14,359 --> 03:03:19,840
as

4140
03:03:16,398 --> 03:03:23,599
as as Wade sitting here on his little

4141
03:03:19,840 --> 03:03:26,040
patio looking at my pond and these big

4142
03:03:23,600 --> 03:03:26,040
beautiful

4143
03:03:27,040 --> 03:03:33,080
trees in my situation I feel really

4144
03:03:30,040 --> 03:03:34,560
grateful actually I don't know many

4145
03:03:33,079 --> 03:03:37,359
people who

4146
03:03:34,559 --> 03:03:40,318
are better

4147
03:03:37,359 --> 03:03:45,318
situated in their life to be doing what

4148
03:03:40,318 --> 03:03:47,439
I'm doing right now I uh multiple Myoma

4149
03:03:45,318 --> 03:03:50,159
is the kind of cancer that I have it's a

4150
03:03:47,439 --> 03:03:53,960
spefic specific bone marrow cell called

4151
03:03:50,159 --> 03:03:57,439
a plasmid kind of goes crazy uh not only

4152
03:03:53,959 --> 03:04:00,959
doesn't die off uh makes insane numbers

4153
03:03:57,439 --> 03:04:03,318
of clones of itself and crowds out all

4154
03:04:00,959 --> 03:04:05,278
the other types of bone marrow cells and

4155
03:04:03,318 --> 03:04:08,119
meantime bursts the Bones from the

4156
03:04:05,279 --> 03:04:10,640
inside sorry to be specific and gruesome

4157
03:04:08,120 --> 03:04:13,840
but there it is so pain is a bit of an

4158
03:04:10,639 --> 03:04:17,519
issue um

4159
03:04:13,840 --> 03:04:19,238
and I think that in my case at least

4160
03:04:17,520 --> 03:04:22,040
because every person's different our

4161
03:04:19,238 --> 03:04:25,199
metabolism our body's needs our body's

4162
03:04:22,040 --> 03:04:27,560
ability to respond to something like a

4163
03:04:25,200 --> 03:04:30,319
cancer it's been a fascinating question

4164
03:04:27,559 --> 03:04:33,840
to me trying to understand because this

4165
03:04:30,318 --> 03:04:36,238
is a cancer of cells of the immune

4166
03:04:33,840 --> 03:04:39,159
system the effects

4167
03:04:36,238 --> 03:04:40,639
of high dosage cannabis use and

4168
03:04:39,159 --> 03:04:44,000
specifically in my case of course I'm

4169
03:04:40,639 --> 03:04:48,278
mixing CBD and THC in various versions

4170
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:52,760
ingesting as well as dabbing on my uh uh

4171
03:04:48,279 --> 03:04:54,680
the Min n thing uh uh and

4172
03:04:52,760 --> 03:04:59,559
um

4173
03:04:54,680 --> 03:05:01,880
yeah the combination of uh having done

4174
03:04:59,559 --> 03:05:06,199
some time trying to understand how my

4175
03:05:01,879 --> 03:05:08,159
mind works um through a form of Buddhism

4176
03:05:06,200 --> 03:05:12,600
if you will that I did for a number of

4177
03:05:08,159 --> 03:05:14,920
years uh through um a really lifelong

4178
03:05:12,600 --> 03:05:16,640
interest in how things grow how do

4179
03:05:14,920 --> 03:05:19,120
things work and specifically how do

4180
03:05:16,639 --> 03:05:21,278
plants work how does that happen how do

4181
03:05:19,120 --> 03:05:25,840
you put a seed in the ground and the

4182
03:05:21,279 --> 03:05:28,279
combination of moisture and soil and sun

4183
03:05:25,840 --> 03:05:30,600
produce this plant that feeds us so

4184
03:05:28,279 --> 03:05:32,359
provides these beautiful flowers these

4185
03:05:30,600 --> 03:05:36,120
incredible

4186
03:05:32,359 --> 03:05:38,960
aromatic plants that uh can have such

4187
03:05:36,120 --> 03:05:42,720
profound effects on our experience and

4188
03:05:38,959 --> 03:05:45,199
um and meantime here I am you know um

4189
03:05:42,719 --> 03:05:47,159
what's true is my cancer seems to have

4190
03:05:45,200 --> 03:05:51,000
responded really well to treatment at

4191
03:05:47,159 --> 03:05:55,000
this point I'm on a fairly low dose of

4192
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:56,799
uh a chemotherapy drug which so far my

4193
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:58,680
oncologist to say no you don't want to

4194
03:05:56,799 --> 03:06:00,920
stop it Wade look at the good results

4195
03:05:58,680 --> 03:06:03,000
you having and it's true all my blood

4196
03:06:00,920 --> 03:06:06,279
Works going in the right directions I've

4197
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:08,439
known enough cancer patients I don't

4198
03:06:06,279 --> 03:06:11,720
remember who it was that referenced that

4199
03:06:08,439 --> 03:06:13,720
a patient is not really a great term for

4200
03:06:11,719 --> 03:06:16,719
who we are because yeah I've been I've

4201
03:06:13,719 --> 03:06:18,719
been a patient under California law for

4202
03:06:16,719 --> 03:06:22,238
glaucoma

4203
03:06:18,719 --> 03:06:24,079
well before there was such a thing um I

4204
03:06:22,238 --> 03:06:29,760
was diagnosed back in

4205
03:06:24,079 --> 03:06:32,079
9495 and um anyway cannabis I I love

4206
03:06:29,760 --> 03:06:35,680
this plant one of the other points that

4207
03:06:32,079 --> 03:06:39,200
I came to mind to say is we've already

4208
03:06:35,680 --> 03:06:42,439
looked at or can see in medicine they

4209
03:06:39,200 --> 03:06:44,479
have a high THC Marinol is one of the

4210
03:06:42,439 --> 03:06:46,559
names of it uh that you can get

4211
03:06:44,478 --> 03:06:48,519
prescribed to by a doctor and get it in

4212
03:06:46,559 --> 03:06:50,439
a hospital here in the United States

4213
03:06:48,520 --> 03:06:52,238
approved by Food and Drug Administration

4214
03:06:50,439 --> 03:06:55,920
same is true with epid dialects you can

4215
03:06:52,238 --> 03:06:58,039
get it uh delivered to your home um one

4216
03:06:55,920 --> 03:07:00,478
of the reasons I am celebrating today

4217
03:06:58,040 --> 03:07:05,319
despite all of the other I've been cying

4218
03:07:00,478 --> 03:07:05,318
a lot but I really am these are tires of

4219
03:07:05,680 --> 03:07:11,880
attitude um because yeah that made me

4220
03:07:08,920 --> 03:07:15,359
epids made me think of h a couple of the

4221
03:07:11,879 --> 03:07:17,079
families that I know who have family

4222
03:07:15,359 --> 03:07:18,520
members who are dealing with severe

4223
03:07:17,079 --> 03:07:21,079
epilepsy

4224
03:07:18,520 --> 03:07:24,560
one of them's been on our show a couple

4225
03:07:21,079 --> 03:07:28,920
of times here your show Marcus thank you

4226
03:07:24,559 --> 03:07:32,879
uh our show Forest herd speak of

4227
03:07:28,920 --> 03:07:36,079
community uh he's he and his son Silas

4228
03:07:32,879 --> 03:07:38,639
have had a huge effect on the

4229
03:07:36,079 --> 03:07:41,238
conversation about cannabis in Nevada

4230
03:07:38,639 --> 03:07:46,318
County

4231
03:07:41,238 --> 03:07:48,318
um uh we're propos anyway back to Silas

4232
03:07:46,318 --> 03:07:50,478
he is uh

4233
03:07:48,318 --> 03:07:52,079
uh this is a boy if you don't know the

4234
03:07:50,478 --> 03:07:55,559
story I'll tell anybody that wants to

4235
03:07:52,079 --> 03:07:57,799
hear it for a second um when I met

4236
03:07:55,559 --> 03:08:03,278
forest and silus uh

4237
03:07:57,799 --> 03:08:05,879
Forest um yeah Silas was seven years old

4238
03:08:03,279 --> 03:08:08,200
and Forest was at a public meeting where

4239
03:08:05,879 --> 03:08:10,879
he was showing pictures of his son in

4240
03:08:08,200 --> 03:08:12,359
the hospital uh because he had just been

4241
03:08:10,879 --> 03:08:15,719
told that his son likely wouldn't make

4242
03:08:12,359 --> 03:08:18,359
it the age of 10 due to uh what was

4243
03:08:15,719 --> 03:08:19,920
eventually diagnosed as Linux G syndrome

4244
03:08:18,359 --> 03:08:21,840
which is you got to have like 10

4245
03:08:19,920 --> 03:08:27,159
different kinds of seizures and this kid

4246
03:08:21,840 --> 03:08:27,159
was seizured 100 times a day or more

4247
03:08:27,359 --> 03:08:37,159
well today or no let's see September

4248
03:08:32,120 --> 03:08:38,920
11th of this past month uh is one year

4249
03:08:37,159 --> 03:08:41,680
since Silas had a

4250
03:08:38,920 --> 03:08:45,238
seizure he's still doing several hundred

4251
03:08:41,680 --> 03:08:48,840
milligrams of CBD and THC there's a

4252
03:08:45,238 --> 03:08:52,199
specific uh cultivar we found back in

4253
03:08:48,840 --> 03:08:54,238
2014 or 2015 called medy haes the

4254
03:08:52,200 --> 03:08:58,520
results of it were published in

4255
03:08:54,238 --> 03:09:01,600
oanes uh in that issue uh that year uh

4256
03:08:58,520 --> 03:09:04,680
called medihaze and yeah that specific

4257
03:09:01,600 --> 03:09:09,359
version of medihaze the seeds came from

4258
03:09:04,680 --> 03:09:12,120
Europe um gave Silas really profound and

4259
03:09:09,359 --> 03:09:15,238
immediate relief from his seizures and

4260
03:09:12,120 --> 03:09:17,920
we still have a couple of I think we

4261
03:09:15,238 --> 03:09:21,000
still have like aund and some grams of a

4262
03:09:17,920 --> 03:09:23,639
high potency extraction of that oil that

4263
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:26,000
seems to work pretty well but that

4264
03:09:23,639 --> 03:09:28,840
original cut the Clone has gone for a

4265
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:33,959
variety of reasons

4266
03:09:28,840 --> 03:09:38,200
um um and Forest did at one point time

4267
03:09:33,959 --> 03:09:41,759
and try try and titrate silus off of the

4268
03:09:38,200 --> 03:09:44,319
dose of the the mes that he was mixing

4269
03:09:41,760 --> 03:09:47,478
into to the other plant oils he had

4270
03:09:44,318 --> 03:09:51,760
access to uh and he started showing

4271
03:09:47,478 --> 03:09:53,159
signs of uh a seizure might be coming on

4272
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:56,120
and so he went right back to using the

4273
03:09:53,159 --> 03:09:59,398
medi haes so you know there's a lot of

4274
03:09:56,120 --> 03:10:02,760
good news there Silas is now in high

4275
03:09:59,398 --> 03:10:07,199
school he's uh actually coming out of

4276
03:10:02,760 --> 03:10:09,639
his shell enough that um he's doing

4277
03:10:07,200 --> 03:10:12,840
dance

4278
03:10:09,639 --> 03:10:15,079
class as a sophomore in high school so

4279
03:10:12,840 --> 03:10:17,760
this is a huge change and Improvement in

4280
03:10:15,079 --> 03:10:20,238
his well-being and meantime uh the other

4281
03:10:17,760 --> 03:10:22,159
story I just wanted to say the one of

4282
03:10:20,238 --> 03:10:27,159
the other reasons I'm feeling deep

4283
03:10:22,159 --> 03:10:28,799
gratitude um I met a family when um I

4284
03:10:27,159 --> 03:10:32,238
don't know if that Jan's still on the on

4285
03:10:28,799 --> 03:10:34,318
the call but uh uh back when Steep Hill

4286
03:10:32,238 --> 03:10:37,520
moved from Oakland to

4287
03:10:34,318 --> 03:10:40,238
Berkeley um they did one of their first

4288
03:10:37,520 --> 03:10:42,279
public facing events uh invited a whole

4289
03:10:40,238 --> 03:10:44,799
bunch of their clients to come see their

4290
03:10:42,279 --> 03:10:47,640
new place and I went down there thinking

4291
03:10:44,799 --> 03:10:50,318
I would meet a bunch of farmers

4292
03:10:47,639 --> 03:10:53,959
silly me uh the place was full of uh

4293
03:10:50,318 --> 03:10:57,359
people in shiny you know big watches and

4294
03:10:53,959 --> 03:11:00,000
shiny shoes and suits and I was dressed

4295
03:10:57,359 --> 03:11:02,760
like a farmer kind of like I am today

4296
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:05,000
and uh I was one of like two or three

4297
03:11:02,760 --> 03:11:08,318
people in a crowd of 100 or 200 that

4298
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:12,000
were there but I visited with uh the

4299
03:11:08,318 --> 03:11:15,318
Reverend Dr kimon and my f friend Fred

4300
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:17,879
Gardner and uh we shared nice food in

4301
03:11:15,318 --> 03:11:19,879
the conversation for a while and and Kon

4302
03:11:17,879 --> 03:11:21,920
was pretty excited about it but I

4303
03:11:19,879 --> 03:11:23,599
understand that's kind of closed down

4304
03:11:21,920 --> 03:11:27,159
now

4305
03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:28,960
uh I met a family there that night one

4306
03:11:27,159 --> 03:11:31,520
of the other one of the few folks that

4307
03:11:28,959 --> 03:11:34,919
weren't in Chinese shoes and suits and

4308
03:11:31,520 --> 03:11:37,560
whatnot was his family who had a young

4309
03:11:34,920 --> 03:11:39,879
man in a wheelchair and he was covered

4310
03:11:37,559 --> 03:11:43,199
in a blanket and he had a mask on and he

4311
03:11:39,879 --> 03:11:45,478
was in a catatonic State Rus I think

4312
03:11:43,200 --> 03:11:47,800
it's called Uh that might be the wrong

4313
03:11:45,478 --> 03:11:50,438
term but his hands were CL wrenched and

4314
03:11:47,799 --> 03:11:52,519
his legs were locked up and he was in a

4315
03:11:50,439 --> 03:11:54,680
fetal position in this

4316
03:11:52,520 --> 03:11:56,920
wheelchair and so I walked up to him and

4317
03:11:54,680 --> 03:12:00,318
I asked him what what are y'all doing

4318
03:11:56,920 --> 03:12:00,318
here and

4319
03:12:02,200 --> 03:12:08,840
uh they were looking for somebody who uh

4320
03:12:06,079 --> 03:12:09,799
could grow some ACDC or might have some

4321
03:12:08,840 --> 03:12:14,719
for their

4322
03:12:09,799 --> 03:12:18,639
son who was uh 21 when I met this family

4323
03:12:14,719 --> 03:12:21,358
and I won't name anybody uh because they

4324
03:12:18,639 --> 03:12:24,199
where they live is actually still a

4325
03:12:21,359 --> 03:12:26,840
threat to their home if their Community

4326
03:12:24,200 --> 03:12:29,359
knows that they use

4327
03:12:26,840 --> 03:12:32,639
cannabis in

4328
03:12:29,359 --> 03:12:36,359
California homeowner associations

4329
03:12:32,639 --> 03:12:39,559
anyway uh that family they were there I

4330
03:12:36,359 --> 03:12:41,600
I had some ACDC in my garden that year

4331
03:12:39,559 --> 03:12:44,359
and I had already figured out it did its

4332
03:12:41,600 --> 03:12:46,880
genetics did not do well in the hot dry

4333
03:12:44,359 --> 03:12:49,479
Summers of Nevada County it was

4334
03:12:46,879 --> 03:12:51,318
discovered if you will identified as a

4335
03:12:49,478 --> 03:12:54,000
plant of Interest over on the medino

4336
03:12:51,318 --> 03:12:57,000
coast I guess is my understanding of the

4337
03:12:54,000 --> 03:13:00,680
story there where you know there's a lot

4338
03:12:57,000 --> 03:13:03,000
of moisture in the air and the peak heat

4339
03:13:00,680 --> 03:13:05,120
in the Summers might get into the 80s

4340
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:07,559
well here we you know we just flirted

4341
03:13:05,120 --> 03:13:09,880
with a 100 here and single digit

4342
03:13:07,559 --> 03:13:13,079
humidity levels this past summer for at

4343
03:13:09,879 --> 03:13:16,478
least a few weeks and uh anyway ACDC was

4344
03:13:13,079 --> 03:13:18,719
not doing well in my garden but uh I

4345
03:13:16,478 --> 03:13:21,358
said you well if you're looking for CBD

4346
03:13:18,719 --> 03:13:23,760
I have some because I was already

4347
03:13:21,359 --> 03:13:26,840
starting to I I was creating a product

4348
03:13:23,760 --> 03:13:30,000
we called Wonder drops uh it was a 25

4349
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:32,719
to1 and had I was so proud of it man it

4350
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:36,520
had a label had all the milligrams in it

4351
03:13:32,719 --> 03:13:40,238
it was tested we had uh 350 milligrams

4352
03:13:36,520 --> 03:13:41,760
of CBD 14 milligrams of THC and every

4353
03:13:40,238 --> 03:13:44,559
one of those milligrams came from my

4354
03:13:41,760 --> 03:13:46,159
garden and meantime we had hundreds and

4355
03:13:44,559 --> 03:13:48,680
hundreds of these bottles going out to

4356
03:13:46,159 --> 03:13:52,398
the uh bunch of dispensaries up and down

4357
03:13:48,680 --> 03:13:54,559
California at one point anyway I handed

4358
03:13:52,398 --> 03:13:57,039
it to Mom you know because she she was

4359
03:13:54,559 --> 03:13:59,278
the one who was uh really engaged on the

4360
03:13:57,040 --> 03:14:00,920
Cannabis thing and she said yeah this is

4361
03:13:59,279 --> 03:14:04,200
exactly what we what he needs but he

4362
03:14:00,920 --> 03:14:04,200
would need two of these a

4363
03:14:04,238 --> 03:14:09,760
day I went wow okay

4364
03:14:22,920 --> 03:14:28,879
um one of the daughters of the family

4365
03:14:25,760 --> 03:14:31,840
has um engaged with

4366
03:14:28,879 --> 03:14:34,839
a an indor operation that allows them to

4367
03:14:31,840 --> 03:14:38,318
preserve some of the genetics we found a

4368
03:14:34,840 --> 03:14:40,079
specific uh High CBD low THC version

4369
03:14:38,318 --> 03:14:43,318
that did well in our neighborhood called

4370
03:14:40,079 --> 03:14:45,639
remedy and uh another version of similar

4371
03:14:43,318 --> 03:14:47,879
genetics called therapy that passed

4372
03:14:45,639 --> 03:14:52,840
through here both of those did quite

4373
03:14:47,879 --> 03:14:55,759
well uh for that young man who is now

4374
03:14:52,840 --> 03:14:59,760
just turned 30 like I said his family is

4375
03:14:55,760 --> 03:15:03,120
now providing his oils for him but uh

4376
03:14:59,760 --> 03:15:05,559
the mother and one of the other a son of

4377
03:15:03,120 --> 03:15:11,520
that family came to visit to tell me how

4378
03:15:05,559 --> 03:15:11,519
well they were doing um and uh to give

4379
03:15:13,478 --> 03:15:22,358
thanks I think it's why we do this work

4380
03:15:18,719 --> 03:15:26,398
when you um I mean I love the cannabis

4381
03:15:22,359 --> 03:15:31,399
plant personally for the psychoactive

4382
03:15:26,398 --> 03:15:33,680
effects that Sam is such a devotee of

4383
03:15:31,398 --> 03:15:38,198
and most of us

4384
03:15:33,680 --> 03:15:41,880
are but I also love her

4385
03:15:38,199 --> 03:15:43,040
for some of the other effects that I

4386
03:15:41,879 --> 03:15:47,679
have

4387
03:15:43,040 --> 03:15:47,680
seen in uh

4388
03:15:48,600 --> 03:15:53,318
and just to loop back into the

4389
03:15:50,520 --> 03:15:55,399
conversation that we've been having here

4390
03:15:53,318 --> 03:16:00,680
and to stop taking up so much

4391
03:15:55,398 --> 03:16:03,920
time um science helps me and US

4392
03:16:00,680 --> 03:16:08,120
understand the magic if you will that is

4393
03:16:03,920 --> 03:16:10,199
nature there's a deep wisdom in nature

4394
03:16:08,120 --> 03:16:13,359
if we take the time to

4395
03:16:10,199 --> 03:16:15,439
look um the fell who's doing that series

4396
03:16:13,359 --> 03:16:18,159
of books teaming with microbes teaming

4397
03:16:15,439 --> 03:16:21,639
with fungi teaming with

4398
03:16:18,159 --> 03:16:24,760
bacteria um L FR I think is his name saw

4399
03:16:21,639 --> 03:16:26,719
him speak a couple times and yeah he's

4400
03:16:24,760 --> 03:16:29,238
pointing in a really great Direction the

4401
03:16:26,719 --> 03:16:30,799
woman who's uh recognizing the

4402
03:16:29,238 --> 03:16:32,398
importance of mother trees and

4403
03:16:30,799 --> 03:16:36,478
regeneration of

4404
03:16:32,398 --> 03:16:38,639
forests um those of us Kelly and Josh

4405
03:16:36,478 --> 03:16:42,079
who are pointing to the importance of

4406
03:16:38,639 --> 03:16:45,599
living soil and regenerative practices

4407
03:16:42,079 --> 03:16:47,639
and I I went into regenerative practices

4408
03:16:45,600 --> 03:16:49,800
myself a long time ago

4409
03:16:47,639 --> 03:16:51,840
uh one because I didn't wanted to reduce

4410
03:16:49,799 --> 03:16:53,959
the impact of my indoor gardening in San

4411
03:16:51,840 --> 03:16:56,520
Francisco when I was doing that and then

4412
03:16:53,959 --> 03:16:59,198
when I came up here

4413
03:16:56,520 --> 03:17:01,840
because despite doing Wonder drops I was

4414
03:16:59,199 --> 03:17:05,319
still giving a lot of lot of my product

4415
03:17:01,840 --> 03:17:08,799
away uh because when somebody's sick how

4416
03:17:05,318 --> 03:17:08,799
can you tell them they have to pay

4417
03:17:09,478 --> 03:17:16,559
you for what you have it might save the

4418
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:16,559
life of their child

4419
03:17:19,799 --> 03:17:27,159
anyway that's my testimony if you will

4420
03:17:23,639 --> 03:17:31,639
for today on hash church is uh my

4421
03:17:27,159 --> 03:17:35,359
gratitude for the the love that

4422
03:17:31,639 --> 03:17:39,599
is this plant and what she offers to us

4423
03:17:35,359 --> 03:17:43,079
I think of her as a manifest um can I go

4424
03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:43,079
can I go into God for a

4425
03:17:43,359 --> 03:17:50,120
second uh I think uh uh in in discussion

4426
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:54,120
with my friend Swami chitan of Swami

4427
03:17:50,120 --> 03:17:56,239
select uh he he's a he's in a a full

4428
03:17:54,120 --> 03:18:00,160
Hindu holy guy you know I've known him

4429
03:17:56,238 --> 03:18:02,079
for a long time um he and I talk

4430
03:18:00,159 --> 03:18:05,559
spirituality sometimes and it's really

4431
03:18:02,079 --> 03:18:06,439
far out to dig into the viic traditions

4432
03:18:05,559 --> 03:18:08,799
of

4433
03:18:06,439 --> 03:18:13,120
spirituality and

4434
03:18:08,799 --> 03:18:14,318
uh we if you will argued if for a while

4435
03:18:13,120 --> 03:18:17,520
back and forth

4436
03:18:14,318 --> 03:18:19,840
about if there is God what is it

4437
03:18:17,520 --> 03:18:20,720
and it was what we arrived on that I

4438
03:18:19,840 --> 03:18:25,600
like

4439
03:18:20,719 --> 03:18:27,879
is God is the sum total of all

4440
03:18:25,600 --> 03:18:30,600
sentience not just in

4441
03:18:27,879 --> 03:18:34,679
humans but humans play a huge part at

4442
03:18:30,600 --> 03:18:38,559
least on this planet but the trees and

4443
03:18:34,680 --> 03:18:41,398
The Rocks Crystals the

4444
03:18:38,559 --> 03:18:44,879
fish literally the the fungi the

4445
03:18:41,398 --> 03:18:47,278
bacteria in the air that we breathe and

4446
03:18:44,879 --> 03:18:51,358
all of that all the way out to all the

4447
03:18:47,279 --> 03:18:54,279
stars and galaxies and everything that

4448
03:18:51,359 --> 03:18:58,559
we can conceive of where there is

4449
03:18:54,279 --> 03:19:00,199
sentience contributes to what we think

4450
03:18:58,559 --> 03:19:03,719
of as

4451
03:19:00,199 --> 03:19:05,720
God and you can find God within yourself

4452
03:19:03,719 --> 03:19:08,599
you can find it by looking at flowers

4453
03:19:05,719 --> 03:19:08,599
you can find it

4454
03:19:09,398 --> 03:19:13,398
by comeing

4455
03:19:22,600 --> 03:19:28,760

03:21:23,120 --> 03:21:27,760
memory test to see if I were how stoned

4499
03:21:25,199 --> 03:21:30,560
I am and I'll have to go back and listen

4500
03:21:27,760 --> 03:21:33,520
to this at some point but I I really do

4501
03:21:30,559 --> 03:21:36,398
feel deep gratitude I uh I am getting

4502
03:21:33,520 --> 03:21:38,199
stronger every day uh is how it feels to

4503
03:21:36,398 --> 03:21:41,879
me

4504
03:21:38,199 --> 03:21:44,680
um I will point to most of my cannabis

4505
03:21:41,879 --> 03:21:47,238
use at this point is focused on my

4506
03:21:44,680 --> 03:21:50,318
enjoyment of the day

4507
03:21:47,238 --> 03:21:52,478
particularly as how it relates to pain

4508
03:21:50,318 --> 03:21:57,079
management uh because I want to be able

4509
03:21:52,478 --> 03:21:59,760
to move around uh and I can do it for a

4510
03:21:57,079 --> 03:22:03,238
little while uh sitting this long has

4511
03:21:59,760 --> 03:22:05,159
been an interesting challenge uh I'm

4512
03:22:03,238 --> 03:22:06,000
doing great at the moment because I'm

4513
03:22:05,159 --> 03:22:09,199
really

4514
03:22:06,000 --> 03:22:12,159
stoned and it helps a lot with pain and

4515
03:22:09,199 --> 03:22:13,840
yes I also ingest quite a bit because I

4516
03:22:12,159 --> 03:22:16,520
find that especially for long-term

4517
03:22:13,840 --> 03:22:19,199
relief if I don't want to have my dabri

4518
03:22:16,520 --> 03:22:21,279
fired up and going all day long uh right

4519
03:22:19,199 --> 03:22:22,960
next to the bed or out in the out on the

4520
03:22:21,279 --> 03:22:24,880
patio like I am

4521
03:22:22,959 --> 03:22:28,799

4522
03:22:24,879 --> 03:22:30,599
um yeah I'm taking some uh what's

4523
03:22:28,799 --> 03:22:35,318
colloquially known as

4524
03:22:30,600 --> 03:22:37,520
RSO uh but yeah next Sunday next Sunday

4525

4529
03:22:47,920 --> 03:22:52,079
not even sure what time we're Gathering

I can to heal my bones because again

4536
03:23:19,520 --> 03:23:26,560
this kind of cancer kind of blows them

4537
03:23:22,120 --> 03:23:29,000
out but uh that was a very very very

4538
03:23:26,559 --> 03:23:30,959
very long- winded way of saying actually

4539
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:35,520
I'm doing really good for anyone that

4540
03:23:30,959 --> 03:23:37,639
wants to know uh deep gratitude here

4541
03:23:35,520 --> 03:23:40,600
really I'm kind of

4542
03:23:37,639 --> 03:23:41,318
stunned uh and a big part of that is hey

4543
03:23:40,600 --> 03:23:45,840
I

4544
03:23:41,318 --> 03:23:48,159
survived what looked like might be uh a

4545
03:23:45,840 --> 03:23:50,920
not survival able moment and that's

4546
03:23:48,159 --> 03:23:52,920
pretty far out and thank you for working

again uh in the same way that this has

4554
03:24:09,639 --> 03:24:14,318
been an incredible nourishment to me

4555
03:24:11,879 --> 03:24:16,599
today uh I don't usually say a lot in

4556

the veterans Action Council meetings and

4557
03:24:16,600 --> 03:24:20,359

4558
03:24:18,920 --> 03:24:23,600
because yeah there's a lot of drama

4559

it I uh uh again I feel humbled to be in

4572
03:25:02,680 --> 03:25:06,880
the company of the folks that are on the

4573

this

4575
03:25:08,920 --> 03:25:14,520
um I joined the Navy to avoid being

4576
03:25:11,680 --> 03:25:17,199
drafted to go to Vietnam uh because I

4577
03:25:14,520 --> 03:25:20,000
was I was of the era where my draft

4578
03:25:17,199 --> 03:25:22,120
number uh we had a lottery in place at

4579
03:25:20,000 --> 03:25:25,199
that point and I was number

4580
03:25:22,120 --> 03:25:28,160
34 and meantime it didn't want to take

4581
03:25:25,199 --> 03:25:30,120
student loans College I went for a year

4582
03:25:28,159 --> 03:25:34,119
and a half it made no sense to me at all

4583
03:25:30,120 --> 03:25:38,600
what was going on and um and so I quit

4584
03:25:34,120 --> 03:25:42,120

4586

signed a contract to join the Navy and

4591
03:25:55,920 --> 03:25:59,719
meantime yeah the Navy and I didn't

4592
03:25:57,398 --> 03:26:04,079

4593
03:25:59,719 --> 03:26:04,079
uh they kicked me out uh at my

4594
03:26:05,279 --> 03:26:13,319

4596
03:26:13,318 --> 03:26:18,959
Action Council thing I know you've asked

4597
03:26:15,799 --> 03:26:22,879
me a couple times uh again I'm humbled i

4598
03:26:18,959 --> 03:26:29,079
i in the company of people like yourself

4599
03:26:22,879 --> 03:26:32,039
um uh or Al burn or Michael crowz or you

4600
03:26:29,079 --> 03:26:34,120
know I mean this Todd scattini I mean

4601
03:26:32,040 --> 03:26:38,239
you know you just go down the list it's

4602
03:26:34,120 --> 03:26:40,199
like Pearson Crosby I mean I just it's

4603
03:26:38,238 --> 03:26:44,279
just wow

4604
03:26:40,199 --> 03:26:47,640
so um thoughtful

4605
03:26:44,279 --> 03:26:50,199
impassioned people who are are really a

4606
03:26:47,639 --> 03:26:53,159
lot on the same page we are trying to

4607
03:26:50,199 --> 03:26:56,199
change the laws trying to educate the

4608
03:26:53,159 --> 03:26:59,398
people who actually can change loss and

4609
03:26:56,199 --> 03:27:02,279
I think to your point earlier at J um

4610
03:26:59,398 --> 03:27:04,799
local is where you can really B change

4611
03:27:02,279 --> 03:27:07,279
to bear and there it's at least

4612
03:27:04,799 --> 03:27:09,759
partially about making the story

4613
03:27:07,279 --> 03:27:12,640
personal uh when you can touch people's

4614
03:27:09,760 --> 03:27:15,279
hearts you can change their

4615
03:27:12,639 --> 03:27:18,559
minds and on that note I'm going to stop

4616
03:27:15,279 --> 03:27:22,760
that was yeah I I I would love to come

4617
03:27:18,559 --> 03:27:24,719
back if you're doing it again Marcus and

4618
03:27:22,760 --> 03:27:27,120
um and I actually do have a science

4619
03:27:24,719 --> 03:27:29,198
question for you Dr Mark can I send I

4620
03:27:27,120 --> 03:27:32,120
think I still have an email for you

4621
03:27:29,199 --> 03:27:33,720
Andor Sam um

4622
03:27:32,120 --> 03:27:36,680
about

4623
03:27:33,719 --> 03:27:38,879
um yeah yeah I don't know if I could

4624
03:27:36,680 --> 03:27:41,318
take we should take it offline or take

4625
03:27:38,879 --> 03:27:43,039
it go ahead fire away if you have it

4626
03:27:41,318 --> 03:27:45,719
probably other people are thinking the

4627
03:27:43,040 --> 03:27:49,279
same damn thing right well you reference

4628
03:27:45,719 --> 03:27:53,559
okay if you don't mind Marcus I

4629
03:27:49,279 --> 03:27:57,079
um uh I am kind of bound by an agreement

4630
03:27:53,559 --> 03:27:59,559
not to get too specific I'll start there

4631
03:27:57,079 --> 03:28:02,639
uh a a state health

4632
03:27:59,559 --> 03:28:05,278
department is in a certain state is

4633
03:28:02,639 --> 03:28:06,920
struggling with the fact that a limited

4634
03:28:05,279 --> 03:28:10,079
number this is in the United States a

4635
03:28:06,920 --> 03:28:12,478
limited number of their licensed

4636
03:28:10,079 --> 03:28:14,439
producers and for the sake of

4637
03:28:12,478 --> 03:28:18,760
conversation we'll say there's

4638
03:28:14,439 --> 03:28:21,318
10 uh four four or five of them in the

4639
03:28:18,760 --> 03:28:25,318
last few months have consistently

4640
03:28:21,318 --> 03:28:30,278
started popping up with analoges of

4641
03:28:25,318 --> 03:28:32,680
Delta 9 Delta 10 Delta 6 probably some

4642
03:28:30,279 --> 03:28:36,279
ohcc I think you

4643
03:28:32,680 --> 03:28:38,359
referenced in products that typic

4644
03:28:36,279 --> 03:28:41,000
shouldn't have it like in flour or in

4645
03:28:38,359 --> 03:28:42,960
other products at concentrations that

4646
03:28:41,000 --> 03:28:44,920
are completely inappropriate for

4647
03:28:42,959 --> 03:28:46,879
something that hasn't been treated in

4648
03:28:44,920 --> 03:28:50,279
some way

4649
03:28:46,879 --> 03:28:52,478
meantime the rest of the licensed uh

4650
03:28:50,279 --> 03:28:54,800
producers in this state uh are not

4651
03:28:52,478 --> 03:28:54,799
having

4652
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:14,840
this the the department of Health's

4653
03:29:11,359 --> 03:29:17,559
response to this is to just have the

4654
03:29:14,840 --> 03:29:19,920
manufacturers who producing product that

4655
03:29:17,559 --> 03:29:21,920
has that have these analoges at a

4656
03:29:19,920 --> 03:29:23,840
sufficient concentration to put it on

4657
03:29:21,920 --> 03:29:27,079
their packaging and labeling as one of

4658
03:29:23,840 --> 03:29:29,600
the canono in the product and I

4659
03:29:27,079 --> 03:29:32,559
personally feel a strong objection to

4660
03:29:29,600 --> 03:29:36,359
that but I would love to hear your or

4661
03:29:32,559 --> 03:29:37,920
Sam's thoughts on that and and um and

4662
03:29:36,359 --> 03:29:40,439
obviously it's to me it's a public

4663
03:29:37,920 --> 03:29:42,439
health and safety issue because we don't

4664
03:29:40,439 --> 03:29:45,159
really know what these analoges do as

4665
03:29:42,439 --> 03:29:48,439
well as what else is along for the ride

4666
03:29:45,159 --> 03:29:50,600
when those analog are in I can pipe in

4667
03:29:48,439 --> 03:29:54,960
really short and

4668
03:29:50,600 --> 03:29:58,439
fast that we don't find T rate when

4669
03:29:54,959 --> 03:30:02,839
we're looking in our lab so something's

4670
03:29:58,439 --> 03:30:05,840
wrong what do you say Mark yeah so so

4671
03:30:02,840 --> 03:30:08,520
this is prohibition economics at work

4672
03:30:05,840 --> 03:30:13,680
and you know it costs a lot of money to

4673
03:30:08,520 --> 03:30:17,079
put THC into a product so the

4674
03:30:13,680 --> 03:30:19,800
cheapest the the the guy who can do that

4675
03:30:17,079 --> 03:30:23,079
for the cheapest makes the most money in

4676
03:30:19,799 --> 03:30:26,119
a free market economy and so if we're

4677
03:30:23,079 --> 03:30:29,199
just talking about canono in general

4678
03:30:26,120 --> 03:30:31,160
yeah so um again way we were talking

4679
03:30:29,199 --> 03:30:33,640
about this earlier this loophole that's

4680
03:30:31,159 --> 03:30:36,600
in the farm bill that legalized

4681
03:30:33,639 --> 03:30:40,079
Industrial Hemp which is CBD blessing

4682
03:30:36,600 --> 03:30:43,120
and a curse because U um I think I've

4683
03:30:40,079 --> 03:30:46,079
said it before on hash church as long as

4684
03:30:43,120 --> 03:30:47,720
there's there's there's prohibition any

4685
03:30:46,079 --> 03:30:50,719
where there'll be a black market

4686
03:30:47,719 --> 03:30:53,920
everywhere and and what that means is

4687
03:30:50,719 --> 03:30:56,879
that legal licensed

4688
03:30:53,920 --> 03:30:59,799
producers have to somehow economically

4689
03:30:56,879 --> 03:31:02,559
keep up to have a competitive product in

4690
03:30:59,799 --> 03:31:05,799
the marketplace and if the only knob

4691
03:31:02,559 --> 03:31:08,760
they have to turn is the cost of their

4692
03:31:05,799 --> 03:31:12,398
ingredients you know you could basically

4693
03:31:08,760 --> 03:31:16,359
make THC cheaper

4694
03:31:12,398 --> 03:31:18,318
from readily abundantly available SE BD

4695
03:31:16,359 --> 03:31:21,120
isolate and a chemical

4696
03:31:18,318 --> 03:31:25,318
conversion put that into your products

4697
03:31:21,120 --> 03:31:27,880
cheaper than you know higher a team the

4698
03:31:25,318 --> 03:31:30,198
greenhouse grow cannabis extract

4699
03:31:27,879 --> 03:31:33,000
cannabis make cannabis oil put it in the

4700
03:31:30,199 --> 03:31:35,479
gummies it's cheaper just to buy the

4701
03:31:33,000 --> 03:31:38,639
commodity mix it into the gummy and

4702
03:31:35,478 --> 03:31:42,318
you're there quicker cheaper better

4703
03:31:38,639 --> 03:31:45,159
quicker and and so so I I think it's

4704
03:31:42,318 --> 03:31:47,159
interesting because different states are

4705
03:31:45,159 --> 03:31:50,639
taking different approaches to this and

4706
03:31:47,159 --> 03:31:55,879
they realize that I think again this can

4707
03:31:50,639 --> 03:31:59,398
only happen because of prois of Delta 9

4708
03:31:55,879 --> 03:32:02,559
right so if Delta 9 was available and

4709
03:31:59,398 --> 03:32:06,358
everybody was making Delta 9 across the

4710
03:32:02,559 --> 03:32:08,799
board in in the entire country and even

4711
03:32:06,359 --> 03:32:10,640
in the entire world right we wouldn't

4712
03:32:08,799 --> 03:32:14,719
there wouldn't be a need for Delta 8

4713
03:32:10,639 --> 03:32:17,959
this Delta 8 Market came up from yeah

4714
03:32:14,719 --> 03:32:20,198
the farm bill and the fact that in the

4715
03:32:17,959 --> 03:32:22,398
language of the farm bill they only

4716
03:32:20,199 --> 03:32:25,600
referen that what they did the farm bill

4717
03:32:22,398 --> 03:32:28,119
removes Industrial Hemp from the control

4718
03:32:25,600 --> 03:32:32,920
dangerous substance act and it's defined

4719
03:32:28,120 --> 03:32:36,079
as cannabis with less than than 3% Delta

4720
03:32:32,920 --> 03:32:38,639
9 THC there was no mention about Delta 8

4721
03:32:36,079 --> 03:32:40,439
and they never contemplated the fact

4722
03:32:38,639 --> 03:32:43,478
that you know Roger Adams first did it

4723
03:32:40,439 --> 03:32:46,359
in the 40s and then mulam redid it back

4724
03:32:43,478 --> 03:32:50,519
in the 70s is that you could chemically

4725
03:32:46,359 --> 03:32:52,720
convert CBD into THC and when you do

4726
03:32:50,520 --> 03:32:55,560
that conversion under certain conditions

4727
03:32:52,719 --> 03:32:58,079
you get Delta 8 which they don't mention

4728
03:32:55,559 --> 03:33:00,559
in the in the in the farm bill and

4729
03:32:58,079 --> 03:33:03,359
what's now complicated things is that

4730
03:33:00,559 --> 03:33:05,959
because Delta 8 is actually mentioned in

4731
03:33:03,359 --> 03:33:08,439
the control danger substance act now

4732
03:33:05,959 --> 03:33:11,959
they're hydrogenating that Delta 8 and

4733
03:33:08,439 --> 03:33:13,880
making hhc that's where hhc comes from

4734
03:33:11,959 --> 03:33:16,438
and they're like well hhc is not on the

4735
03:33:13,879 --> 03:33:18,639
control dangerous substance tack but you

4736
03:33:16,439 --> 03:33:20,600
know be that as it may this is all made

4737
03:33:18,639 --> 03:33:24,519
possible because of the Ridiculousness

4738
03:33:20,600 --> 03:33:27,960
of probation itself and if you're if

4739
03:33:24,520 --> 03:33:30,840
you're making a psychoactive substance

4740
03:33:27,959 --> 03:33:32,839
in a chemical reaction vessel it's

4741
03:33:30,840 --> 03:33:35,439
different than extracting it from a

4742
03:33:32,840 --> 03:33:37,719
plant right it's differing than than

4743
03:33:35,439 --> 03:33:42,000
than from nature itself and when you get

4744
03:33:37,719 --> 03:33:47,159
that whole Spectrum yeah when you make a

4745
03:33:42,000 --> 03:33:51,559
Delta 8 you're semi synthesizing it from

4746
03:33:47,159 --> 03:33:55,279
uh CBD which is illegal under the

4747
03:33:51,559 --> 03:33:57,359
controlled substance act so I mean it it

4748
03:33:55,279 --> 03:34:00,960
might fit through the loophole of the

4749
03:33:57,359 --> 03:34:04,760
Farm Act but Delta 8 is not legally

4750
03:34:00,959 --> 03:34:07,119
produced well we're we're we where're CD

4751
03:34:04,760 --> 03:34:10,199
runs into issues and again they never

4752
03:34:07,120 --> 03:34:13,600
contemplated this so I think Sam my

4753
03:34:10,199 --> 03:34:16,560
feeling again you know all your work and

4754
03:34:13,600 --> 03:34:20,520
everything that went into gws epid

4755
03:34:16,559 --> 03:34:23,840
dialects besides is that is that is that

4756
03:34:20,520 --> 03:34:26,720
the legislatur got snookered on seeds

4757
03:34:23,840 --> 03:34:28,318
rope and oil and they they're like CBD

4758
03:34:26,719 --> 03:34:31,159
what's that we don't care about CBD just

4759
03:34:28,318 --> 03:34:32,639
THC we only care about THC that's the

4760
03:34:31,159 --> 03:34:35,559
only thing that went into the language

4761
03:34:32,639 --> 03:34:38,920
of the bill I I I don't think they

4762
03:34:35,559 --> 03:34:41,719
realize that again CBD being the active

4763
03:34:38,920 --> 03:34:44,879
ingredient of an FDA approved drug

4764
03:34:41,719 --> 03:34:47,879
there's another law called the fdn C act

4765
03:34:44,879 --> 03:34:50,438
which is the food drug and cosmetic act

4766
03:34:47,879 --> 03:34:53,398
and and what that what that law says

4767
03:34:50,439 --> 03:34:56,000
which is is enforced by the FDA is that

4768
03:34:53,398 --> 03:35:00,799
the active ingredient of an FDA approved

4769
03:34:56,000 --> 03:35:03,478
drug cannot be used in food feed or

4770
03:35:00,799 --> 03:35:05,519
cosmetic or you know topical use for

4771
03:35:03,478 --> 03:35:07,000
interstate commerce it's interesting

4772
03:35:05,520 --> 03:35:09,520
that they put that Interstate Commerce

4773
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:13,238
in there so what they need to do is they

4774
03:35:09,520 --> 03:35:15,159
need to make an exception to the fdn C

4775
03:35:13,238 --> 03:35:17,840
act like I think they've done for like

4776
03:35:15,159 --> 03:35:20,039
things like caffeine so caffeine is like

4777
03:35:17,840 --> 03:35:22,960
an active ingredient in drugs and stuff

4778
03:35:20,040 --> 03:35:24,600
like that but it's also in Coca-Cola and

4779
03:35:22,959 --> 03:35:27,000
Mountain Dew and all that other [ __ ]

4780
03:35:24,600 --> 03:35:29,040
right so they made an exception to the

4781
03:35:27,000 --> 03:35:31,359
FD andc act I think caffeine actually

4782
03:35:29,040 --> 03:35:35,120
got grandfathered but I think there's

4783
03:35:31,359 --> 03:35:37,640
other examples of things that the FDA

4784
03:35:35,120 --> 03:35:40,560
approved as active ingredients but are

4785
03:35:37,639 --> 03:35:43,478
okay to use and you you'll know and Wade

4786
03:35:40,559 --> 03:35:46,198
knows this in Spades is that what what

4787
03:35:43,478 --> 03:35:47,760
Charlotte web the company Charlotte web

4788
03:35:46,199 --> 03:35:49,960
did I don't know if this the Stanley

4789
03:35:47,760 --> 03:35:52,639
Brothers anymore or not but what the

4790
03:35:49,959 --> 03:35:57,519
company Charlotte Web said okay fine

4791
03:35:52,639 --> 03:36:00,719
we'll submit CD extracts as a dietary

4792
03:35:57,520 --> 03:36:04,120
supplement from hemp because Industrial

4793
03:36:00,719 --> 03:36:08,840
Hemp right Canabis with lower than 3%

4794
03:36:04,120 --> 03:36:10,960
THC was removed from the control danger

4795
03:36:08,840 --> 03:36:12,680
substance act so the farm bill enabled

4796
03:36:10,959 --> 03:36:15,159
now the production of hemp it's like

4797
03:36:12,680 --> 03:36:16,639
well okay hemp is an agriculturally

4798
03:36:15,159 --> 03:36:19,959
produced

4799
03:36:16,639 --> 03:36:21,599
food I guess in a in a manner of

4800
03:36:19,959 --> 03:36:23,159
speaking right you can make seed oil you

4801
03:36:21,600 --> 03:36:27,000
can make seed protein from it right

4802
03:36:23,159 --> 03:36:29,238
Marcus so it's essentially a food and

4803
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:30,279
and there's different regulation there

4804
03:36:29,238 --> 03:36:32,879
so the

4805
03:36:30,279 --> 03:36:36,159
USDA um the Department of Agriculture

4806
03:36:32,879 --> 03:36:39,398
only cares to the point where the crop

4807
03:36:36,159 --> 03:36:41,000
is grown right so all the Amendments

4808
03:36:39,398 --> 03:36:43,719
that go on the land you know whether

4809
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:46,359
it's organic nonorganic and all about

4810
03:36:43,719 --> 03:36:49,159
farming and agricultural production

4811
03:36:46,359 --> 03:36:52,600
and the USDA kind of washes their hands

4812
03:36:49,159 --> 03:36:56,079
after that it sort of becomes the fda's

4813
03:36:52,600 --> 03:36:58,680
baywick to pick up okay now that corn

4814
03:36:56,079 --> 03:37:01,840
has been grown now it goes to Market

4815
03:36:58,680 --> 03:37:03,439
yeah if you're gonna if you're Delonte

4816
03:37:01,840 --> 03:37:05,079
and you want to make cans of corn

4817
03:37:03,439 --> 03:37:09,680
because that's what you do with corn

4818
03:37:05,079 --> 03:37:12,478
right you need an FDA inspected facility

4819
03:37:09,680 --> 03:37:14,680
certain levels of quality and production

4820
03:37:12,478 --> 03:37:16,719
standards that have to be held to

4821
03:37:14,680 --> 03:37:18,680
because you're making a variable

4822
03:37:16,719 --> 03:37:21,478
Agricultural Product that's being put

4823
03:37:18,680 --> 03:37:25,600
into these Delonte cans of corn that

4824
03:37:21,478 --> 03:37:30,398
people are eating right so yeah I

4825
03:37:25,600 --> 03:37:32,640
mean I I think where this goes again is

4826
03:37:30,398 --> 03:37:35,079
this run into big corporations because

4827
03:37:32,639 --> 03:37:37,719
now you're talking about industrial

4828
03:37:35,079 --> 03:37:41,120
agriculture you're talking about archers

4829
03:37:37,719 --> 03:37:44,238
Daniel Midland you're talking about big

4830
03:37:41,120 --> 03:37:46,359
chemical companies that bought the seed

4831
03:37:44,238 --> 03:37:49,600
companies that

4832
03:37:46,359 --> 03:37:53,960
that engineered seeds to be resistance

4833
03:37:49,600 --> 03:37:56,840
to the chemicals that they sell oh

4834
03:37:53,959 --> 03:38:00,759
boy and and and again yes like we were

4835
03:37:56,840 --> 03:38:04,880
talking earlier the F the EPA regulates

4836
03:38:00,760 --> 03:38:08,439
that so I know that USDA regulates the

4837
03:38:04,879 --> 03:38:11,639
genetically modified soybeans and corns

4838
03:38:08,439 --> 03:38:14,159
that are grown today but um I I've said

4839
03:38:11,639 --> 03:38:17,398
it before I think and I think Marcus you

4840
03:38:14,159 --> 03:38:20,600
agree that of the big drivers for for

4841
03:38:17,398 --> 03:38:24,760
hemp to overtake soybeans is going to be

4842
03:38:20,600 --> 03:38:26,399
on protein production per acre when it

4843
03:38:24,760 --> 03:38:28,960
comes down to it if you need to grow

4844
03:38:26,398 --> 03:38:31,680
protein you need to grow this crop

4845
03:38:28,959 --> 03:38:34,039
because this crop produces way more

4846
03:38:31,680 --> 03:38:36,639
protein for acre than soybeans and it

4847
03:38:34,040 --> 03:38:38,960
requires less chemicals but when you say

4848
03:38:36,639 --> 03:38:41,398
less chemicals now those chemical

4849
03:38:38,959 --> 03:38:42,679
companies get upset because they want to

4850
03:38:41,398 --> 03:38:45,840
sell the

4851
03:38:42,680 --> 03:38:49,398
chemicals right yep it's not just the

4852
03:38:45,840 --> 03:38:51,920
it's also you simultaneously create oil

4853
03:38:49,398 --> 03:38:54,318
so you're producing protein but when

4854
03:38:51,920 --> 03:38:57,439
you're defatting the protein you're

4855
03:38:54,318 --> 03:38:59,600
creating oil simultaneously so it's uh

4856
03:38:57,439 --> 03:39:01,559
it's two products I wanted to say thank

4857
03:38:59,600 --> 03:39:03,760
you to Wade I didn't think that was too

4858
03:39:01,559 --> 03:39:05,559
long at all it was awesome it was so

4859
03:39:03,760 --> 03:39:08,398
good to hear from you I love the whole

4860
03:39:05,559 --> 03:39:10,719
recap of the hash church that we had I

4861
03:39:08,398 --> 03:39:12,398
love the update of how you were doing I

4862
03:39:10,719 --> 03:39:15,000
I know I'm not the only one because I

4863
03:39:12,398 --> 03:39:16,478
heard read a ton of people in the chat

4864
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:18,639
saying I've been thinking a lot about

4865
03:39:16,478 --> 03:39:21,159
Wade lately I always think a lot about

4866
03:39:18,639 --> 03:39:23,920
you Wade and it's uh it's just nice to

4867
03:39:21,159 --> 03:39:26,439
hear your Humanity I know how you feel

4868
03:39:23,920 --> 03:39:28,840
things because when you speak you you

4869
03:39:26,439 --> 03:39:31,680
you get us to feel the things that you

4870
03:39:28,840 --> 03:39:34,478
feel it's a very profound and Powerful

4871
03:39:31,680 --> 03:39:37,559
tool that you have at your disposal uh

4872
03:39:34,478 --> 03:39:40,039
but it's wonderful and it's uh it's it

4873
03:39:37,559 --> 03:39:42,159
it couldn't have been a better part of

4874
03:39:40,040 --> 03:39:44,120
hash church for you to share everything

4875
03:39:42,159 --> 03:39:46,799
that you did and of course I'll do a

4876
03:39:44,120 --> 03:39:48,439
hash church next week and we'll talk to

4877
03:39:46,799 --> 03:39:51,039

4878
03:39:48,439 --> 03:39:52,960

4879
03:39:51,040 --> 03:39:54,600
glad to hear that you're getting better

4880
03:39:52,959 --> 03:39:56,119
and that like you know I know things

4881
03:39:54,600 --> 03:39:59,318
were rough there for a while I was

4882
03:39:56,120 --> 03:40:01,079
following the updates on Facebook and uh

4883
03:39:59,318 --> 03:40:02,920
I'm just glad that you've able been able

4884

to get through all of that of course

4885
03:40:02,920 --> 03:40:08,559
you're still in it but uh get through

4886
03:40:05,398 --> 03:40:11,119
the sort of the I don't know what it is

4887
03:40:08,559 --> 03:40:13,639
when we're going through those things oh

4888
03:40:11,120 --> 03:40:15,720

you sharing with us on in on hash search

4892
03:40:20,680 --> 03:40:25,279
it is it is our show not my

4893

show there's Community again again it's

4894

have time I I have to sacrifice going to

4906
03:41:03,680 --> 03:41:07,760
see my son skating you know that's this
