1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
then unmetered i just wanted to welcome

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:08,490
the people into the room that came in

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:12,359
which was Remo and Jeff and Ramon and

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,820
Rick and is that correct that maybe even

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:18,989
the skunk man is off-camera in in the

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:25,768
house at hashed Church episode 52 if I

7
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:33,808
talk do you hear me hell yeah that's

8
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:37,939
awesome guys Wow Wow so can we ask can

9
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:42,929
we ask them the origin of Hays please

10
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:45,030
but I'm not sure you can ask me much

11
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:50,729
that you don't already know but you can

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:54,448
try I got a question I got a really good

13
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:57,858
question which is he can't tell us a

14
00:00:54,448 --> 00:01:01,170
secret on how you mix this great dry sip

15
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:08,490
sure but you have to over to my house or

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:13,859
I could shoot you afterwards I hope you

17
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:15,149
a I hope you're doing well Sam sounds

18
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:20,250
like you're keeping busy

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,900
dude I am brother I am hey Sam let's for

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,000
sure could you for sure talk a little

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,009
about skunk won and the impact obviously

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,900
that it made on indoor growing for us

23
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,519
all I mean know some of us sitting in

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,799
the room obviously know the story and

25
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:36,719
but it would be really nice to hear you

26
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:39,630
talk about skunk number one I'm not sure

27
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:43,769
what people on here but it was one of

28
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:48,739
the first indica sativa hybrids but what

29
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:48,739
was more unusual about it was that it

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:56,549
was fairly stabilized so that when you

31
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:58,289
grew it and you made seeds from it then

32
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,750
you pretty much got what you wanted a

33
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,610
lot of the other indica sativa hybrids

34
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,989
and there weren't a lot of them around

35
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:11,909
back in the mid seventies one skunk was

36
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:13,419
created but yeah it helped change but

37
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:15,370
also

38
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:18,159
other people complain that it was too

39
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:24,750
stinky and what it was stinky for him of

40
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:24,750
course was terpene so you can't win you

41
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,700
the best stuff is stinky

42
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:35,859
we like the stinky we didn't do so that

43
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:38,229
was something you put together in the

44
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:42,610
mid-70s skunk won really started in the

45
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:45,009
mid 70s yeah yeah it started in the mid

46
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,280
seventies correct was already available

47
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:50,739
by I think 70

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,269
78 at the latest Africa when was it

49
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:54,280
introduced to the Dutch scene because

50
00:02:52,269 --> 00:03:02,140
obviously there are no Scouts involved

51
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:04,568
until 84 and then 85 seriously Wow and

52
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,789
it became a staple in the breeding lines

53
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:09,429
of almost everybody doing seeds as soon

54
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:12,039
as you introduce it was one of the

55
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:15,010
easiest plants to hybridize and get

56
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:17,400
predictable results with and often the

57
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:21,759
hybrids were better than either parent

58
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,120
so yeah people liked it for that wait

59
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:28,030
when did you decide you didn't like that

60
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,329
dank Afghani part of the skunk and

61
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:35,109
pretty much pretty much from the

62
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:39,790
beginning Aeryn what I what I had was I

63
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:43,030
had phases at the time which I loved

64
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:46,030
that's really what I was smoking and I

65
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,669
would smoke the skunk it was strong it

66
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,390
was really interesting if good blood

67
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:54,669
structure and added of it but it also

68
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:57,849
had that kind of high which was what I

69
00:03:54,669 --> 00:04:01,208
thought I'm a narcotic couch lock and

70
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:03,549
that's not really what I like so I found

71
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:06,789
out that the sweeter ones were more

72
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:09,129
turns I work so for almost 10 years are

73
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:11,530
selected away from the skunk ear ones

74
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:15,939
there I brought it to the Netherlands

75
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:23,649
and we really like to go out to 20,000

76
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:26,769
feet what that allowed is selection of

77
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:27,109
plants which were really super the best

78
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:30,709
of

79
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:34,400
best and I selected ten of those girls

80
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:36,500
ten boys from those grows then take the

81
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,269
routes of the progeny and was able to

82
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:45,800
consist determine which combine the best

83
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:48,589
best progeny really easy look easy after

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:53,300
I selected to another large group of

85
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:55,579
plants thousands well from all of us

86
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,900
seed breeders who are out of here in the

87
00:04:55,579 --> 00:05:02,778
world senior senior Sam skunk man thank

88
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:05,329
you very much for your contribution into

89
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:10,490
making our industry what it is today to

90
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:14,538
grow absolutely I'm I'm I'm really happy

91
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:18,319
that I helped tip the balance to what it

92
00:05:14,538 --> 00:05:20,449
is today which is really unstoppable the

93
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,400
world governments have not admitted that

94
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:25,819
they've been defeated but the truth of

95
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,948
it is of course that the war on cannabis

96
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:30,408
is is completely lost

97
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:33,830
they're just punching it out a few

98
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:38,718
places I would say ditto from the hash

99
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:40,639
makers mr. skunk man Sam and we also

100
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:43,848
appreciate all that you've done to

101
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,588
severely tip the scales I give you props

102
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:49,550
all the time and being one of the people

103
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:53,899
that 100% inspired me into water hash

104
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:55,310
and into dry sift for certain so you

105
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,378
know you never know what it would be

106
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:01,430
like without you but I appreciate that

107
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:03,860
we don't have to wonder I look forward

108
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:07,459
to the day when anybody who wants to

109
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:12,129
smoke a legal cannabis product can get

110
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:15,859
you know dry said that's 92 even better

111
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:22,129
99.9 percent resonates and of their

112
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:24,889
favorite varieties that days is already

113
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:28,210
reachable by a few of us and will soon

114
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:32,389
be reachable by anybody who wishes it

115
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:35,209
yeah could you please talk about others

116
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,949
and the strain haze and its origin

117
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:39,168
because it's it's it's one of my

118
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:40,240
favorites as well years was really

119
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:43,538
started by

120
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:49,900
a friend of mine up in the hills of

121
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:54,279
Santa Cruz and he also a friend of Rob

122
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:57,818
Clark's he's also involved in this well

123
00:06:54,279 --> 00:07:06,359
helping the guy what it was was a

124
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:12,160
combination of Hunter Rojas so also a

125
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:16,210
green Colombian and a long Colombia

126
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:19,750
though those three will combine to

127
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:23,258
create what was called the original

128
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:26,050
phase then some South Indian and Thai

129
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:28,389
genetics that I gave was added a little

130
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:34,439
bit later but that was not really the

131
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,439
original age that was sort of they later

132
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,168
would what you're describing as the

133
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,819
later haze be what some of us become

134
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:44,829
known as like the stuff that Neville was

135
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:48,430
putting out the no.5 by Hayes was

136
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:51,399
obviously very sure if he thought stuff

137
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,590
that had tire and or South Indian

138
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:56,228
genetics in it or if he got stuff that

139
00:07:53,589 --> 00:08:04,948
was just plain to him because the

140
00:07:56,228 --> 00:08:08,860
Columbian expressed Greek I am goldish

141
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:11,439
purple and the silver blues those are

142
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:17,740
all coming from just Columbian genetics

143
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:20,589
so I can't say I'm not sure after five

144
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,269
those checks genetic materials we might

145
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:24,879
have some of these answers where they're

146
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:28,620
not there's tire South Indian genes and

147
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,899
or not how many distinctly different

148
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:35,288
varieties of cannabis David exam do you

149
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:38,228
think there are like I don't know by

150
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:42,699
traditional is what I would consider a

151
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:45,639
variety and there was hundreds because

152
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:48,730
just just in South America there might

153
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:52,899
have been a hundred just in India there

154
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:54,490
might have been a hundred but it a few

155
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:58,970
hundred

156
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:03,259
what it really is boils down to is most

157
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:07,700
of them have only THC so it's the

158
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:10,278
terpene plus the THC maybe a few other

159
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,100
cannabinoids but those aren't really

160
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:16,539
making it recreationally better but they

161
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:21,110
might be useful for some other purposes

162
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:24,019
so while people like medical varieties

163
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:27,399
with CBD in them for example are the

164
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:32,088
terpenes and cannabis unique to cannabis

165
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:36,709
no 140 terpenes identified in cannabis

166
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:41,120
so far are also found in all kinds of

167
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:43,310
other plants - but but we know that the

168
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,350
hundred and forty five hundred and forty

169
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:49,579
that have been identified he Canada so

170
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:52,220
far might potentially be modified THC in

171
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,528
the other two methods whereas other ones

172
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:58,310
found other places they're not finally

173
00:09:54,528 --> 00:10:00,470
canvassed a much more less likely to be

174
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:06,199
having anything to do with modifying

175
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:07,250
never thanks hey anybody else I'm sorry

176
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,060
I keep being the one that asked

177
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:18,350
questions but I could ask Sam questions

178
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:22,009
mr. Bovard - Sam I've got a question for

179
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:24,290
Sam uh time and time again I always go

180
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:27,139
back to kind of thinking about how you

181
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:30,469
were able to select and thinking about

182
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:32,419
tissue culture is it critical for anyone

183
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,720
who really wants to break ground and

184
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:36,860
breeding to have that skill like would

185
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,959
you think like when I think about

186
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,629
selecting between twenty thousand I'm

187
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,519
like when you smell it you may be you

188
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:46,970
know really really far away from base

189
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,000
camp um is that a gift that you have for

190
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,019
being able to do that like I'm just

191
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,909
thinking about all the people who fail

192
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:55,819
and thinking about going through a field

193
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:57,980
of twenty thousand like outdoor it seems

194
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:02,150
insane unless you had an innate gift for

195
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:05,659
that ability well look luckily I also

196
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:06,879
did have a colleague Rob Clark who

197
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:10,179
helped me with the

198
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,659
my large field Brady or large scale

199
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:15,909
greenhouse breeding Robert helped me do

200
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:18,250
the selection processes so that right

201
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:23,230
there cuts the numbers in half but if

202
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:26,980
you want to evaluate cannabis I suggest

203
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:29,019
you you need to grow large plants not

204
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:35,170
they don't have to be in the ground but

205
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:38,350
it's easier and were those numbers

206
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:42,009
around 20,000 for you Sam or were you

207
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,570
planting more than 20,000 was the number

208
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:48,819
that I was able to grow at that moment

209
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:51,550
at that time but yeah I mean if you it

210
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:55,330
depends on the variety and what's going

211
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:57,459
on the larger the numbers you work with

212
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:01,870
the better your results are going to be

213
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:04,389
in I am Not sure of tissue culture or

214
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:07,210
molecular biology is an important

215
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:10,899
cannabis breeding at this moment but it

216
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:13,720
is the future and if you don't know how

217
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:16,360
to do it you may need to have a team

218
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,090
that you're working with that assists

219
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:23,649
you in those aspects that you aren't

220
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:26,259
able to do yourself so did you always

221
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:28,299
travel like during the known harvest

222
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:30,970
season so that when you went to India

223
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:33,729
you knew you know this is coming down on

224
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,590
so I'm gonna be able to smell we tried

225
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,930
to but there wasn't always possible

226
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:41,800
sometimes I had to take it from dried

227
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:45,669
buds sometimes I had to get seeds from

228
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:48,639
people and not even see the plants

229
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:51,159
themselves not with that preferred but I

230
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:57,340
mean if you're in the area and that's

231
00:12:51,159 --> 00:13:01,000
all you can get other times I had to use

232
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:04,600
second parties like Rob from connecting

233
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,779
for me in Yunnan China or many other

234
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:14,620
places since we've had a very long

235
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:18,399
relationship what is that down is that

236
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,750
dried shift say it's some sleaze tag was

237
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,629
it dry sift

238
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:26,948
no it's actually some great water hash

239
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:29,139
and Sleestak that you like it I like it

240
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:33,338
just as much as the day we were smoking

241
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:35,310
we're sitting right there hey Sam you

242
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:37,810
got dry seft

243
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:43,539
well what can I say

244
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:45,849
my favorite is usually dry sis but you

245
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:53,289
would be all over this yet let me tell

246
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:57,490
you as long as it's not dink I'm sure

247
00:13:53,289 --> 00:14:00,250
you yeah it's just like Turk City right

248
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:05,649
here dude I still have memories of that

249
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:07,600
Sleestak dry sift let me tell you that's

250
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:09,639
about to worry about to turn California

251
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,980
out on Sleestak be here in a minute do I

252
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:15,250
have to say when I first saw it was it a

253
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,620
Sleestak or was it a Sleestak skunk one

254
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:21,100
cross that was the dry cept I can't even

255
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:25,568
remember it was oh no it was Pierce

256
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:28,269
least a Karen the first 50 saw yeah my

257
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:32,049
question to you Erin is has any of that

258
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:34,778
Sleestak been analyzed for cannabinoid

259
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:38,019
interpreting contact because that stuff

260
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:41,948
really is unusual to it so as always you

261
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:44,409
smoke it want to keep you up and for

262
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:47,758
more periods of time it's creative

263
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:53,828
forget it you know what I mean I like

264
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:56,669
you know for me that's like the Sleestak

265
00:14:53,828 --> 00:15:02,438
is what really brought us all together

266
00:14:56,669 --> 00:15:05,099
you know we had in Amsterdam by the name

267
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:09,399
of Matt a shout out to him he's in the

268
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:13,600
Alabama I think right now I had some dry

269
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:15,730
sips Sleestak in it was just amazing

270
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,850
it was amazing and it was just it wasn't

271
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:22,050
even really cleaned up and then he's and

272
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:26,470
I have already met Sam the skunk man

273
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:29,109
years before this at at birth at our

274
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:33,490
mutual friend Adam Adam's birthday from

275
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:36,490
th seeds and you know

276
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:39,818
so I Matt's like I got to show this dry

277
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:43,269
sift to say I'm a skunk man you know

278
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:47,229
because he says he can clean it up and

279
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:51,490
make it like the best right so he takes

280
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:54,069
this JA this nice jar of Sleestak takes

281
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,688
it over to him and then we get a phone

282
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:58,808
calls I can't you got to come over to

283
00:15:55,688 --> 00:16:00,428
Sam's house you know and Sam's like yeah

284
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:06,808
I really couldn't clean it up it was

285
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:10,119
really clean and to like to a hash maker

286
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:13,078
that's like music to your ears when when

287
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:17,889
when the legend can't do much to your

288
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:21,159
material you know and it's just as good

289
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:22,749
it's it's like it's like winning a

290
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:24,338
cannabis cup for your first time or

291
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:29,499
something it's like yeah you know you

292
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:32,649
recognized by legend and he fell in love

293
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:34,329
with the strain to even more impressive

294
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:36,068
you know like here we are that just a

295
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:37,568
little experiment you bred something and

296
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:39,729
you you did it and here's a little bit

297
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:44,039
of first dry sip that came out out of it

298
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:48,610
and you're sitting at a legends house

299
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:50,948
smoking your hard work at the legends I

300
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:54,610
mean it was like a dream it was a dream

301
00:16:50,948 --> 00:16:58,568
come true and to have them like it so

302
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:00,548
much and to have them want to play with

303
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:03,219
it and use it and grow it and do

304
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:06,338
experiments with is is truly an honor

305
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,828
you know and and I'm sure I'm sure

306
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:10,629
really [ __ ] thankful that I created

307
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:13,119
Sleestak you know it's just a little

308
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,819
experiment away you know those little

309
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,548
experiments turn out to be very

310
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:21,009
something very special later on and hey

311
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:23,199
you know and thank you for enjoying my

312
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:27,298
work because I've enjoyed your work for

313
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:32,320
you know since I was 12 years old I

314
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:36,490
absolutely enjoy smoking Sleestak tricep

315
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:38,950
and Rob Clark might enjoy slightly

316
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:42,429
better than me because he's really you

317
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:45,720
know a creative writing person and that

318
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:47,800
stuff he swears is the greatest for

319
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,529
creative variety because

320
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:53,558
it keeps you up all day so you know it's

321
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:56,230
but I also think it's brilliant do you

322
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:59,109
have the terpene and cannabinoid profile

323
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,420
or is there anything in every such THC I

324
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:03,459
I haven't I

325
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:08,320
we haven't done anything with it yet but

326
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:09,910
I can tell you yes we have a yeah it's

327
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,069
going to be in the greenhouse buddy I'll

328
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,840
just tell you that so we're gonna get

329
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:16,569
the whole expression here in a minute

330
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:19,449
I was always blown away that when that

331
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:21,519
Sleestak dry sift showed up because I

332
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,590
was also a big fan of it and I was lucky

333
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,529
enough to get to smoke a good good

334
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:28,119
amount of it it was so beautiful it had

335
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:30,549
such a great high it could keep you up

336
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:33,699
till 4:00 in the morning no problem like

337
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:35,740
it was insane but I really thought that

338
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,630
it would be something we just saw from

339
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,130
that day on I thought it was so special

340
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,170
that it would and then it was always

341
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:44,500
sudden that Sleestak disappeared and it

342
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:47,529
was like pho pho pho for like the next

343
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,799
10 years I didn't see any like killer

344
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:52,660
amazing like off the chain door I sift

345
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,789
Todd would have been happy he's all over

346
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:59,500
it he's all over the VHL but man I've

347
00:18:54,789 --> 00:19:00,539
missed the DNA I got you bro I've missed

348
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,839
it

349
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:07,599
yeah dude it is amazing for certain so

350
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:10,769
yeah question of Tara for Ramon and Rick

351
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:16,529
and Sam how how is that freeze-dried

352
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:21,700
hash tasting just back to the driver

353
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:30,399
right I really liked it which one is it

354
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:33,789
yeah I liked it and the effect to it to

355
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,910
me it seems that like the THC level

356
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:39,909
might be a little bit less than some of

357
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:43,240
the other ones but I like the effect in

358
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:47,259
the way better I wish it was even

359
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,950
stronger monitors surface it's very

360
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:53,230
interesting tasting and effective and

361
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,819
that's what I like about Heather this is

362
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:58,150
the different jerkings

363
00:19:54,819 --> 00:20:01,569
i mean it's it's not hard to find strong

364
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:04,149
THC it's it's hard to find

365
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:09,398
tgd with the turkeys that you might for

366
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:10,778
a particular taster of 837 people

367
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:13,329
watching and I've decided I'm gonna

368
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:21,569
write a song called I'm in love with the

369
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:23,678
terpenes I'll say the chorus with you

370
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:27,220
you're on the main character in the

371
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:32,889
video are you kidding me I'm just

372
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:35,499
singing I'm glad that we've reached the

373
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:41,498
level of understanding that we have even

374
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:43,960
if we just scratched the surface you

375
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:45,639
know can I ask you know Sam what was

376
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,440
some of the original streams that were

377
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:49,329
being passed around in the 80s by the

378
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,700
first seed companies and what was the

379
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:53,439
first seed company you know that would

380
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,580
be a great question to start with and

381
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,729
what was some of the strains they

382
00:20:54,579 --> 00:21:03,339
offered the first seed actually of

383
00:20:57,729 --> 00:21:06,308
course was sacred seeds that was 1976 in

384
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:11,108
Santa Cruz California I know because I

385
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:14,229
started it when we have original

386
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:18,519
offerings we had Hayes

387
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:22,330
we had skunk I think was the next year

388
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:27,038
and then we had Afghani number one which

389
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:33,118
I got from Jim Dublin and I had Hindu

390
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:39,479
Kush which and South Indian Kerala and

391
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:43,199
Durban poison so a lot of land races but

392
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:46,179
most and they were all true breeding so

393
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,919
that's was my focus at the time for the

394
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:54,190
first few years I was in the seed

395
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:56,619
business which one are you talking about

396
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:59,320
Horacio are you asking about the unknown

397
00:21:56,618 --> 00:22:01,509
American that showed yeah the unknown

398
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:04,358
American question that we always have I

399
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:07,989
think we have to ask Neville because Sam

400
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:12,189
can't remember his name is that no no me

401
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:15,130
and Rob saw Neville about I will maybe

402
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:17,558
five or ten days after the Ameri

403
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,230
who had been staying with Neville for

404
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:22,960
the weekend or something left

405
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:25,650
and Neville showed us what the guy

406
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,269
showed us that showed him which was

407
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:30,970
grinding it up in like in the coffee

408
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:33,490
bean grinder type device and then

409
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,940
putting water in it and stirring it

410
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:42,250
again and then letting it settle out so

411
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:46,169
it was that's what but I can't remember

412
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:48,308
the name maybe under hypnosis I could

413
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:50,890
well you know what one day we'll hit

414
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:54,609
open it he'll he'll appear again he'll

415
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:58,450
he'll show up I mean was with me but he

416
00:22:54,609 --> 00:23:02,079
doesn't remember either maybe you guys

417
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:08,710
were smoking that amnesia sift now we

418
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:11,710
weren't no I don't think never mostly

419
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:14,140
smoked cannabis with tobacco I know dude

420
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,240
the one time I was all excited I had met

421
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,750
him before actually but one time I ended

422
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,849
up upstairs at our Ian's apartment above

423
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,919
the greenhouse and it Howard Marks was

424
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:25,750
there and Neville was there and I was

425
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,460
with breeder Steve and I was like yeah

426
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,589
man this is what I'm talking about going

427
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,929
to talk to the old school dudes and then

428
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:37,750
they all literally except Arion like

429
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:41,500
steve and neville and howard all rolled

430
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:45,579
up hash in tobacco and I literally was

431
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,919
just like ah it's just one of those

432
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:49,449
experiences where you think it's why I

433
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,788
tell people don't get excited about

434
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,620
meeting the the your favorite band

435
00:23:51,788 --> 00:23:59,169
because they probably won't be who you

436
00:23:53,619 --> 00:24:03,069
want them to be well I can honestly say

437
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:05,950
I've accidentally taken one or two puffs

438
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:07,178
of tobacco in my entire life really

439
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,400
that's nasty

440
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,019
you must have given though like I would

441
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,730
love to have seen the mean mug and you

442
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:17,319
gave the guy who passed you a choice

443
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:19,839
with tobacco in it one time it was a sim

444
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:22,678
see so it was a titty Simpson beatnik

445
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:26,859
Bill Keith but you see Keith in Morocco

446
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:28,120
right hashish is not that marihuana

447
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:32,109
flowers mixed

448
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:36,419
my tobacco yeah so that's that's not

449
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:39,219
really what we're looking for okay sorry

450
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,019
yeah I can't do the tobacco for sure I

451
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,640
even in India you know where we're

452
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:45,160
smoking chill ohms on the side of the

453
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,540
Ganges River and everyone's like no no

454
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:53,470
you must put tobacco in there and I'm

455
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:57,159
like you know I must not just with the

456
00:24:53,470 --> 00:25:02,829
ganja instead of tobacco and hash and

457
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:04,900
then like that you know an interesting

458
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:07,929
note on the terpenes ratio is someone in

459
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:10,269
LA stopped me at an early cannabis

460
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:14,200
industry meeting and he thought I was

461
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:16,690
responsible for oh gee and I corrected

462
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,830
him but I he he had gotten a clone he

463
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,019
knew it was for me

464
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:24,099
back when I got out of prison pretty

465
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:26,200
much in the 405 Oh six and he basically

466
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:28,119
told me when he was doing terpene test

467
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,309
that it was coming back with a very wide

468
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:31,419
panel and he likened it to like a box of

469
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:33,250
Crayola crayons

470
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:37,000
he's like once you get your hands on a

471
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:38,829
box of 64 colors in the box you never

472
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,390
want to go back to eight and what he

473
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,369
thought was is that even though the

474
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:45,130
crayons weren't full like that wasn't

475
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:47,559
you know complete terpenes profiles like

476
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:49,240
if you will really rich ones of each he

477
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,309
goes there was a little of everything in

478
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,680
OG he says and what he thought the

479
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:56,829
reason why oh gee became so popular is

480
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,019
because there was a terpene for everyone

481
00:25:56,829 --> 00:26:01,029
like if you look in a box of 64 colors

482
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:02,829
almost everyone's gonna find a color

483
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:04,509
that they really like but if they look

484
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:07,599
in a little box at 8 they'll be like me

485
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:09,339
you know and and and I thought that was

486
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:13,509
an interesting comparison for what it's

487
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:18,519
worth hey Doc I have a question for Josh

488
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:22,359
and this it's Sam Josh hi Sam my

489
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:25,539
question is okay you got the clone from

490
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:27,879
some folks in Florida I believe did they

491
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:30,220
breed it did they just grow some seeds

492
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,390
and find it did they get the clone from

493
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:36,549
somebody else story as I know it is they

494
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,090
got the seed out of a bag that they

495
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:39,089
purchased

496
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:49,148
was that the Grateful Dead thing it's a

497
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:54,219
thing that comes from these two guys in

498
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:59,168
Orlando in around 92 93 that are friends

499
00:26:54,220 --> 00:27:01,360
with Bubba that are friends with I think

500
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:04,840
some of his buddies and that's how it

501
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:07,178
ended up in their hands and they were

502
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,359
breeding between 90 when they you know

503
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:13,419
they were already breeding at this point

504
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:14,740
and those seeds I believe you know

505
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:16,869
that's where there's a couple other

506
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:20,079
varieties that they've come up with that

507
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:22,230
even made it to Los Angeles and I'm not

508
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:27,240
sure where that variety is now but uh

509
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:33,759
you know do the original genetics is

510
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:35,798
something to be found out no that's it's

511
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,019
part of the reason I even came out and

512
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:40,028
started doing this is you know I have a

513
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:41,589
long story in history with this but

514
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:43,480
there is a history before it it's just

515
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:48,308
super interesting to find out what that

516
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:51,460
is right and maybe if we're lucky the

517
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:54,278
Philo's work might allow us to discover

518
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:58,840
it but there's no guarantee that we will

519
00:27:54,278 --> 00:28:01,898
because if for example if you take an

520
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:04,418
Afghan and a Colombian and the Mexican

521
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:06,689
and then you breed it to itself from a

522
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:08,799
population level for ten generations

523
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,869
it's gonna come out with a lot of

524
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,808
different ratios depending on what seeds

525
00:28:10,868 --> 00:28:17,230
you using at the end there you

526
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:20,378
understand what I mean absolutely so

527
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:23,288
some will be almost totally sativa some

528
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:25,148
will have more Afghan some will be more

529
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:28,089
like I mean it's just there's just no

530
00:28:25,148 --> 00:28:31,928
predicting what 10 self generations will

531
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:33,908
do if anyone is interested in doing some

532
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:39,009
project with the cut that I have I mean

533
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:42,249
I'm I'm down for sure

534
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:47,608
set send me send me an email mark can

535
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:49,839
tell you how and what you can do also is

536
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:52,808
where are you on the east coast or the

537
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,919
west coast I'm in Washington up in the

538
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:55,629
Seattle area

539
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,720
so it's really easy you could turn it

540
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:00,910
into one of the labs of Washington who

541
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,289
will send a bread to Philo's for DNA

542
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:07,120
analysis that would be cool

543
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:11,109
what could okay that'd be really cool

544
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:13,659
III think it'd be really nice weren't

545
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:20,469
just really in landraces but anything

546
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:22,720
else is interesting also are you able to

547
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,430
maybe explain to the audience as well

548
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,960
what what that is you're talking about

549
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,340
because they don't know I don't think

550
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,170
they all know about the project and we

551
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:33,490
almost have 900 people listening right

552
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:36,250
now so okay I'll give it a real short

553
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:39,039
rundown I'm I'm not the greatest world

554
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:42,130
speaker but here basically what we're

555
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:47,920
doing is we're extracting the DNA from

556
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:54,190
either seeds or leaves which will allow

557
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:56,950
us to conduct or create a family tree

558
00:29:54,190 --> 00:30:00,880
for cannabis that'll show both

559
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:03,220
relationships and evolution we might be

560
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,020
able to say that everything evolved from

561
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:09,670
this variety I doubt we will but that's

562
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:13,089
theoretically possible or we'll be able

563
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:16,000
to say that this variety is related to

564
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:19,209
this variety and this variety meaning

565
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,109
that all the cannabis in Africa

566
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:27,640
originally came from India or originally

567
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:29,859
came from Asia or it came from and the

568
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,410
same thing all the cannabis in Jamaica

569
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:37,029
it had to come from someplace Africa

570
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:38,710
India well in a few years we might be

571
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:42,069
able to answer most of these questions

572
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:45,930
with DNA analysis we're not trying to

573
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:50,319
grow the plants we're not trying to

574
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:55,269
making some sort of living DNA library

575
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:57,339
were the genetics to be stolen and we

576
00:30:55,269 --> 00:31:00,430
have been interested and then a that

577
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:05,199
kind of GMO craft but I am interested in

578
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:07,769
in the relationships and the evolution

579
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,769
of cannabis

580
00:31:07,888 --> 00:31:13,418
not a question for sad about the Durbin

581
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,788
someone's asking if he came to South

582
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:22,359
Africa to collect the Durban poison

583
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:25,088
not only today that good South Africa

584
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:29,468
but others been there but I've never

585
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:33,388
been there but where I got the seeds for

586
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:37,929
South African were from Jim Goodwin and

587
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:40,358
he got them from Edie Rosenthal who got

588
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:47,619
them from a coffee shop in Amsterdam

589
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:51,218
called the trance key seventies but when

590
00:31:47,618 --> 00:31:55,358
I grew them my greenhouse in Santa Cruz

591
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:59,080
County that it gave were all

592
00:31:55,358 --> 00:32:00,608
hermaphrodite so I had to select out the

593
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,728
one or two that were theast

594
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:07,628
hermaphrodite well it was interesting

595
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:09,580
though so what I did was I selected out

596
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:13,329
the team that were the least made seeds

597
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:16,478
from those grew those next year and I

598
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:18,638
did that for about four I maybe even

599
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:20,588
five years but at least four and then

600
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:24,638
what I had was a variety there was

601
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:29,319
hardly hermaphrodite at all and that was

602
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:31,088
my German poison South African so I did

603
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:33,868
get the seeds from somebody else but I

604
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:37,538
did all the work to clean them oh and

605
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:39,908
yeah at the time it was the earliest

606
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:44,919
thing that people could grow in Canada

607
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:47,320
for example outdoors awesome well they

608
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:50,499
appreciate the the answer the guy from

609
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:52,598
South Africa is giving you a shout out

610
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:57,129
saying that whether you know it or not

611
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:59,588
you change the game down there okay the

612
00:32:57,128 --> 00:33:01,569
other thing about South African is I've

613
00:32:59,588 --> 00:33:03,999
grown several other South Africa

614
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:07,378
varieties that were not as early as that

615
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:10,629
one that one really is early but

616
00:33:07,378 --> 00:33:13,538
whatever I mean if there's ours it's

617
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:19,009
good that should be the goal everything

618
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:26,878
else is secondary to quality for me

619
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:29,098
true enough and I mean you've always

620
00:33:26,878 --> 00:33:30,778
pretty much from I don't know if it's

621
00:33:29,098 --> 00:33:32,519
been from day one or not but maybe you

622
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:35,308
could answer this when it became

623
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:39,868
prevalent or when you became aware that

624
00:33:35,308 --> 00:33:42,358
you would be breeding for hashish not

625
00:33:39,868 --> 00:33:45,448
for cannabis to be rolled into joints

626
00:33:42,358 --> 00:33:48,989
and smoked you know we've we've done

627
00:33:45,449 --> 00:33:53,249
this we've done it a bit but nowhere

628
00:33:48,989 --> 00:33:56,879
near as much as we'd like because some

629
00:33:53,249 --> 00:34:00,919
varieties like skunk and Sleestak also

630
00:33:56,878 --> 00:34:04,468
it very much so when it's dried and

631
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:09,240
cured a little bit the resin can be

632
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:12,269
knocked off much much easier than many

633
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:14,758
varieties some varieties like Hays it's

634
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:17,128
difficult to knock it off I don't know

635
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:20,309
if the resin is stickier or if the

636
00:34:17,128 --> 00:34:23,668
adhesion layer is different I I don't

637
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:28,079
know what the exact mechanics are but in

638
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:31,500
the future also - you don't want hashish

639
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,899
that that when you harvest it it falls

640
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,018
off and you don't want it when it's

641
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:39,268
hanging and drying it falls off so

642
00:34:37,018 --> 00:34:43,828
there's a fine line between convenience

643
00:34:39,268 --> 00:34:45,148
and stupidity that's for sure hey I had

644
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:48,599
another kind of good question I just

645
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:52,199
thought of in regards to whether you

646
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:55,048
think that you know oil whether it's

647
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:58,858
butane oil or propane oil or ether oil

648
00:34:55,048 --> 00:35:01,440
or alcohol oil or even rosin whether you

649
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:03,449
consider those to be hash and then Part

650
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,309
B - that question would be what do you

651
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:06,808
think about this rosin thing that's

652
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:12,660
taking everyone by storm

653
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:15,150
I have zero against rosin rosin with a

654
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:18,929
however it's pronounced to me

655
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:22,950
it's hashish no solvents are being used

656
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:25,078
it's being heated that's true but in

657
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:28,048
fact that could have been done in the

658
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:31,980
60s or 70s if you wrapped fashion so

659
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:33,869
famous tweeted stick hot and hard enough

660
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,929
need to get a little bit of rosin but

661
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:43,470
nobody was manufacturing it by the large

662
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:47,368
amount but all but what makes its

663
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:49,559
difference is solvent when solvency and

664
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:53,100
waters not a solvent it's used in some

665
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:57,869
suspension agent so it's just like air

666
00:35:53,099 --> 00:36:04,170
for dry safety but a solvent whether it

667
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:08,190
be you know petroleum ether or butane or

668
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:11,780
propane or ethyl alcohol or whatever

669
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:14,730
even co2 that's fundamentally different

670
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:17,609
I'm not saying they can't make a totally

671
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:21,090
clean safe product I'm saying it's not

672
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:24,809
really hash it's more in the direction

673
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:27,539
of an oil or a glassed or an absolute

674
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:29,909
whatever so to me it's fundamentally

675
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:32,340
different but I understand that

676
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:35,399
I'm arbitrarily drawing the line in the

677
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:38,720
sand but luckily I had people like you

678
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:41,430
to pretty much feel the same way I do I

679
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:44,099
can ask a question and it's about

680
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:48,089
polyploid and I thought I had one back

681
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:50,309
in 1997 I had a plant that when cannabis

682
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:52,260
froze it pops two stems out and then

683
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:54,179
grows a little higher hops two stems of

684
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,190
in the opposite direction and does it

685
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:58,440
again and this one went up pop four

686
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:01,260
stems up went up top four it stems up

687
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,740
when I opt for and I just posted a photo

688
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,359
of this privately in our little Facebook

689
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:10,108
message thing but I'll post it publicly

690
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:12,269
but I wanted to ask Sam what what what

691
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:14,909
was the plan I had and you know what and

692
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:17,780
then again what is a polyploid way to

693
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:21,779
you Todd what you're mixing EPS is what

694
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:25,619
what's called world pilot Oxnard's world

695
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:27,869
finest oxy means that the internodes do

696
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:31,559
what you're talking about

697
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:32,340
polyploid you can't tell if a plant is

698
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:35,460
polypoid

699
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,260
by physically looking at it it what you

700
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,440
have to do is test the chromosomes to

701
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:42,240
see whether it has two sets or three or

702
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,079
four or whatever you think it is

703
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:49,819
whether it's a triploid or Ted

704
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:52,069
played or whatever like Sam does it make

705
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:54,559
a difference when growing or breeding

706
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:57,200
like um we're both mean how are both

707
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,000
looking at this uh article where on this

708
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,460
guy's going on about different strains

709
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,949
being really tetraploid or diploid and

710
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:07,909
he has so much theory that it becomes

711
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:09,889
way too much to read it's not true and

712
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:13,039
you look in nature all you find is

713
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:16,429
diploid I mean maybe a few people have

714
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,679
made tetraploid varieties I did a little

715
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:22,429
bit of experiments with it but none of

716
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:24,379
the varieties are tetraploid unless

717
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:26,779
somebody's making one but then they'd

718
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,059
probably be advertising there's a guy up

719
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,010
in Canada what's his name Billy Budd or

720
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:36,739
that's exactly who we're talking about

721
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:39,770
ah push ok we'll test test it send a

722
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:41,689
leaf to Philo's I'd have to buy his

723
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:42,940
clones and they they have a bad

724
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:47,929
reputation

725
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:50,179
ok no I strongly suspect that I have not

726
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:56,389
tested it so I cannot say absolutely

727
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:58,009
that it's not tetraploid and can just to

728
00:38:56,389 --> 00:38:59,750
clarify we hadn't had no one said it

729
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:02,630
what was the what was the effect that

730
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:04,130
the plant I had or I saw I had with four

731
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:11,150
stems instead of two at each

732
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:15,590
intersection taxi it just happened

733
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:25,130
read about it in with Wikipedia world

734
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:29,200
file a taxi yeah my 20 year old Jamaican

735
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:29,200
seed came up with that exact thing

736
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:36,410
producing the extra a third instead of a

737
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:37,870
tube yeah it could make two for three

738
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:41,059
whatever

739
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:43,960
just for the same time how do you spell

740
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:48,739
this wonderful new word to my vocabulary

741
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:56,019
well world we know how to spell world WH

742
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:56,019
o are LED horrible and filer toxic PHY

743
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,549
l.a.x

744
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:09,048
why I'm guessing but hey I'm the world's

745
00:40:01,548 --> 00:40:11,389
worst speller what or maybe you'll find

746
00:40:09,048 --> 00:40:13,778
it on that on that genetic subject

747
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:17,088
though I had a question for you learn

748
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:21,108
when you look at on the surface of a

749
00:40:17,088 --> 00:40:23,630
leaf and you look very closely at the

750
00:40:21,108 --> 00:40:25,098
formation on a grid level of the

751
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,950
trichome heads that are forming you

752
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:29,690
actually see them in a grid and those

753
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:32,419
strings tend to be really good pass

754
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:34,130
trains for obvious reasons because

755
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:39,009
they're spread out with bigger heads and

756
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:39,009
then sometimes in a very strange

757
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:44,659
variation or expression in the gene or

758
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:48,019
plant they you'll see that same surface

759
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:50,929
area and they're the stalks fight for

760
00:40:48,018 --> 00:40:54,578
the surface the surface area that's

761
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:57,858
there creating a almost like a chaotic

762
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:59,690
expression of stalks trying to get in

763
00:40:57,858 --> 00:41:02,630
every little space and they produce

764
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:06,528
heads as well maybe not as big but it

765
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:08,660
creates a very hard to wash or extract

766
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:11,449
type of plant so what what kind of

767
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:16,489
genetic expression would that be linked

768
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:19,189
to in this poly or truck I'm not sure it

769
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:22,548
has anything to do with polyploid I

770
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:28,099
think more likely it's just a different

771
00:41:22,548 --> 00:41:31,460
variety of resin stem type because

772
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:34,249
there's so many different types but like

773
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:36,858
I'm sure you've seen it that there are

774
00:41:34,248 --> 00:41:39,318
types of resin that quite literally even

775
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:42,650
after you've dried it for two weeks you

776
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:46,130
cannot touch it it'll just smear its

777
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:49,130
like oil and there's other resin which

778
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:54,410
says like Sleestak which after two weeks

779
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:56,150
I just I mean it falls off like golden

780
00:41:54,409 --> 00:42:00,828
and it's beautiful

781
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:03,559
so yeah I we haven't gotten to that

782
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:07,390
level yet where we understand the DNA

783
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:11,059
and the genetics of this but eventually

784
00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:11,920
I'm sure people well now that they'll

785
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:16,630
use it to

786
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,548
use DNA assisted breeding so that they

787
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:21,010
can screen thousands of little tiny

788
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:24,509
seedlings and only grow the plants that

789
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:31,079
have what it is that they're after so

790
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:34,599
I'm sure that in the future two or three

791
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:38,039
the Dutch police put out scratch and

792
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:42,119
sniff cards so that in torment

793
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:44,949
neighborhood police type people could

794
00:42:42,119 --> 00:43:00,670
smell what cannabis smells like and

795
00:42:44,949 --> 00:43:03,389
coffee smell number one no wood street

796
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:14,559
Sam what strain do you think they like

797
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:17,558
they I'm pretty sure candy crush they

798
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:19,750
got that [ __ ] I remember that day now I

799
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:22,809
don't know what variety it was but it

800
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:25,510
was terpenes commonly found in drug

801
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:28,410
cannabis that's what they used and it

802
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:28,410
was a scratch-and-sniff

803
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,869
they also send out this little card and

804
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,759
say hey if you see this on your

805
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:41,048
neighbor's building and in the

806
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:43,180
wintertime it snows but like there's

807
00:43:41,048 --> 00:43:44,650
some rooftops that look like yeah well

808
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:46,960
there's for some reason the snow is

809
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:52,180
melted right in the certain spots and

810
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:56,858
there's like they had a little tiny

811
00:43:52,179 --> 00:44:01,568
portable battery-operated helicopter

812
00:43:56,858 --> 00:44:05,139
that they flew around with a sensor that

813
00:44:01,568 --> 00:44:08,289
could sense terpenes and they looked for

814
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:11,289
cannabis terpenes from the air but only

815
00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:14,259
at suspected houses they didn't do the

816
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:16,900
general entire city they would go to a

817
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:20,400
place that was under suspect and they

818
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:24,608
would sniff it and say yep it's there

819
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,599
dan that's like taking a good idea and

820
00:44:24,608 --> 00:44:31,059
using it for bad

821
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:34,449
yeah I tell you I can tell you right now

822
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:40,779
that somebody's like back at their phone

823
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:43,480
or something got some of my which I

824
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:46,360
think what terpene it was I think it

825
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,639
might have been Lemon skunk but went

826
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,620
like went out of the country didn't have

827
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:53,019
any cannabis on him at all

828
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:57,130
nothing just had the presence of

829
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:59,469
terpenes and had another dog let it

830
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,690
basically come at him like the dog was

831
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:07,179
like across the airport as a paw whoa

832
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:10,750
like I could bolt it right for him like

833
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:13,869
it was just terpenes being on him they

834
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:16,480
trained dogs internationally with Terry

835
00:45:13,869 --> 00:45:20,099
awfully and maybe other ones also but

836
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,780
Terry awfully and they used to train

837
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:24,639
since we got so many growers in the room

838
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,850
people asked me a lot of question and it

839
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:30,039
goes both ways now people have used on

840
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:32,650
teas like even you know blueberry tea on

841
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:36,099
two to feed their plants during the end

842
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:38,440
um Sam how much do you find nutrients

843
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:42,009
can sway or carry over into the plant

844
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:45,429
whether it be a fish hydrolysate which

845
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:48,610
has its own fish ash terpene or using um

846
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:50,739
flavored teas to impregnate the plant um

847
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:53,500
is it are we

848
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:55,629
is that real and how far does it go like

849
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,480
our people use the different nutrients

850
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:00,190
and their taste

851
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,320
you can totally affect the taste of your

852
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:05,079
cannabis with nutrients you ever tried

853
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:08,309
turbinator or we gets us Terminator

854
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:13,420
flavor doesn't you know it's weird

855
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:17,309
anybody else wanna chime in well would I

856
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:20,349
find effects cannabis taste the most is

857
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:22,960
growing your plants organically to their

858
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:27,670
full potential with lots of lots of tiny

859
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:30,400
roots and big plants but that said I'm

860
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:33,730
sure that some different organic foods

861
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,430
must have slightly different but I'm not

862
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:38,199
sure about you know feeding it molasses

863
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:38,769
to make it taste like molasses or

864
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:41,349
blueberry

865
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:44,519
to make it taste like blueberry that I

866
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:50,650
think that's go ahead a bit far but

867
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:52,480
never use too much no no but if you ever

868
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:54,070
use too much bat guano your weed gets a

869
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,559
bat whoa no taste to it like you can

870
00:46:54,070 --> 00:47:03,160
overkill it with some of the stuff yes

871
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:06,130
olia playing effect oh no not in the

872
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:08,920
negative way I meant that as long as you

873
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:12,460
can organically grow great great fine

874
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:14,170
tiny roots lots of them then your

875
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:17,349
cannabis is probably going to taste

876
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:19,720
pretty good can we ask you sandy what's

877
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:23,130
your feeling on flushing cannabis in the

878
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:27,250
end of its cycle of flowering I

879
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:29,769
primarily grow in the ground and I grown

880
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:33,159
big you know ten feet tall you know

881
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:37,239
three kilos plus whatever so I don't

882
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:39,879
flush them I when I plow the ground in

883
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:44,069
the springtime before I plant I use

884
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:46,960
organic amendments and I time it so that

885
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:49,059
it'll be pretty much sucked dry by the

886
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,210
end of season that I try out again next

887
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:51,210
spring

888
00:47:55,018 --> 00:48:00,458
have you seen like when you've done

889
00:47:57,938 --> 00:48:02,978
flushing experiments do you find what

890
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:04,688
would be the difference in your case I

891
00:48:02,978 --> 00:48:06,368
mean you're going at it organically so

892
00:48:04,688 --> 00:48:07,989
from the start a lot of people will say

893
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:10,269
low men it should be fine

894
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:12,880
but does it affect the smoke does it

895
00:48:10,268 --> 00:48:15,068
affect the sift or people depleting the

896
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:21,150
plants of something critical

897
00:48:15,068 --> 00:48:24,849
I find that plants taste better when you

898
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:27,910
feed the soil so that the soil could be

899
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:31,419
the roots feed the players when you

900
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:34,208
force feed the plants I think you can

901
00:48:31,418 --> 00:48:36,608
get higher yields but I don't think you

902
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:39,639
get a better taste I don't know anybody

903
00:48:36,608 --> 00:48:41,889
who forced feeds tomatoes to get a

904
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:45,308
better tasting tomato than has grown

905
00:48:41,889 --> 00:48:52,389
from heirloom varieties tomatoes grown

906
00:48:45,309 --> 00:48:53,048
for tastes organically but that's you

907
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:55,449
know what

908
00:48:53,048 --> 00:48:57,130
fertilizers definitely alter yields and

909
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:59,548
actually that's the whole thing about

910
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:02,140
modern technology was the advent of

911
00:48:59,548 --> 00:49:03,998
fertilizer to get higher yields with

912
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:06,539
food crops for farmers that was the

913
00:49:03,998 --> 00:49:10,379
whole point of fertilizer

914
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:15,960
yeah well higher yields is important but

915
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:17,280
higher quality is more important I don't

916
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,110
know I can get some pretty good high

917
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,740
quality off right actually what I do

918
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:25,890
isn't entirely organic I have a vegan

919
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:28,289
program actually uh I find giving my

920
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:30,210
plants vegan stuff actually gives it a

921
00:49:28,289 --> 00:49:33,630
nice clean flavor and you get like at

922
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:39,570
the end nice ass at the end free burning

923
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:46,470
you know tastes great if if it works I'm

924
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:49,289
sure it must be as you know I don't

925
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:52,349
smoke marijuana at all alright I'm

926
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:56,190
strictly a reson smoker I like that

927
00:49:52,349 --> 00:50:02,519
stuff so that's cool we do not I guess

928
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:05,809
tricep tricep rocks yeah I I probably

929
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:10,050
smoke less herbal cannabis than mark and

930
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:14,909
Mark pretty much avoids it I don't smoke

931
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:25,769
it at all or I tried to do less than

932
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:27,989
that no it's not that I am against

933
00:50:25,769 --> 00:50:32,039
marijuana for people that like it that's

934
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:33,569
their choice but the main thing with me

935
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:39,090
is to me

936
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:47,490
marijuana's strictly the the messenger

937
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:58,320
and hashish is is the message we're

938
00:50:47,489 --> 00:51:02,549
sport almost welcomes least actor well

939
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:05,750
whenever you do get at Sleestak analyze

940
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:08,850
for both cannabinoid and terpene content

941
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:11,940
preferably different mother

942
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:15,360
not just from seed seeds from it but the

943
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:18,519
original mother I am really curious

944
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:24,820
Aaron alright

945
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:26,559
it's gonna happen Sam I guess I got

946
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:29,860
another question while we've got another

947
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:32,079
gap when it comes to indoors is

948
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,539
obviously um even though you have the

949
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,819
lucky luxury of being able to perfect

950
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:40,269
the outdoor grow when it comes to

951
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:42,580
indoors how many dip how far does light

952
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:44,500
go in affecting cannabis like when

953
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:47,019
you've seen those I've seen these crazy

954
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,639
you know when the guy has 50 25 watt

955
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:50,050
fluorescent bulbs and he's wrapped the

956
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,449
plant in it like a mania

957
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:53,769
um and I look and I'm like he seems to

958
00:51:52,449 --> 00:51:57,189
be getting a result it's not

959
00:51:53,769 --> 00:51:59,440
commercially viable but how often do you

960
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:02,230
see lights playing a critical factor in

961
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:06,159
directing the wave the genetics express

962
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:09,519
themselves to be honest I might be the

963
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:13,569
wrong person to ask because I've grown

964
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:19,269
primarily outdoors and in greenhouses

965
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:21,850
with natural sunlight so I'm not the

966
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:24,429
real right guy to answer about lights I

967
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:25,000
I have little crop experience with

968
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:30,399
lights

969
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:32,889
I maintain plants with artificial lights

970
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:37,900
for long periods of times that cold

971
00:52:32,889 --> 00:52:41,799
temperatures for suspended animation but

972
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:44,769
that's about it well but you get I I

973
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:47,440
assume everyone brings you there bud to

974
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:50,559
smell and then hopefully convert to hash

975
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,929
do you basically get anything make your

976
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,820
strains back and you're like and I'm

977
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:57,009
like when do you basically go this

978
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:59,260
indoor [ __ ] is there's a reason why you

979
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:06,490
don't [ __ ] with it and you know it in

980
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:10,600
your nose I would say indoor stuff

981
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:13,389
that's grown under lights that I would

982
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:18,250
like the clone of grown outdoors in the

983
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:21,210
ground organically is to be really good

984
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:24,550
the trouble is a lot of it's grown

985
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:27,730
chemically and it's force-fed to try to

986
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:30,820
maximize yield and they're really

987
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:31,949
interested in really fast results rather

988
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,750
than

989
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:35,639
the highest of the highest of the

990
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,230
highest quality like you would do want

991
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:41,518
to make for your own grandmother

992
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:45,510
oh wait Horatio people don't just bring

993
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:50,298
Sam stuff like that it doesn't usually

994
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:53,369
work work that way you know I'm saying I

995
00:53:50,298 --> 00:53:57,778
don't know I assume you guys obviously

996
00:53:53,369 --> 00:53:59,548
get to us a way mortar profiles then at

997
00:53:57,778 --> 00:54:01,469
least I imagine that's kind of why I'm

998
00:53:59,548 --> 00:54:03,989
like well if every year in Amsterdam for

999
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:06,419
your whole life is the best of the best

1000
00:54:03,989 --> 00:54:09,179
being brought out you do eventually get

1001
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:10,889
a sense of like you'll see og over and

1002
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:13,649
over and over again and then go man

1003
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:19,230
nothing smells like 95 what was it about

1004
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:24,690
that guy to be honest it's it's not

1005
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:28,469
really true number one is i when people

1006
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:33,650
would come and visit me I as a raw

1007
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:40,500
didn't make cash out of their there

1008
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:44,608
their way I mean that's a lot of work a

1009
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:48,329
few times maybe Aaron might have brought

1010
00:54:44,608 --> 00:54:50,548
some pretty clean resin which I either

1011
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:52,680
was able to clean up a little bit for or

1012
00:54:50,548 --> 00:54:54,719
in a few cases like he mentioned I

1013
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:57,719
couldn't even clean it up for because it

1014
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:03,298
was so good but you know they they got

1015
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:05,969
clever and clever or so if nobody else

1016
00:55:03,298 --> 00:55:07,710
flushes in fruits and harvesting then

1017
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:09,179
what are we really talking about in a

1018
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:12,960
sense because the plant doesn't have

1019
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:15,618
salts in the buzz when people

1020
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:19,380
traditionally grew cannabis

1021
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:23,160
hydroponically they pumped it up to get

1022
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:25,318
very fast growth they would use carbon

1023
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:28,199
dioxide they would use all kinds of

1024
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:31,108
extra nitrogen they wanted to pump it up

1025
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:31,608
and get it through wham bam thank you

1026
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:37,558
ma'am

1027
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:41,639
so it's then in that situation maybe you

1028
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:44,700
do need to flush it at the end because

1029
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:45,659
you've had it on such a high level in

1030
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:48,028
the first place

1031
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:50,608
whereas organic what you're doing is

1032
00:55:48,028 --> 00:55:53,159
you're feeding the soil and there were

1033
00:55:50,608 --> 00:55:55,528
some microorganisms are breaking down

1034
00:55:53,159 --> 00:56:00,058
and the roots are picking it up from

1035
00:55:55,528 --> 00:56:02,400
there so it's indirectly you and that

1036
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:04,349
you you're not forced feeding them and

1037
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,858
that unless you've got incredibly high

1038
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:11,039
nitrogen levels but most organic farmers

1039
00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:13,380
are aware of that someone's asking about

1040
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:17,430
Sam and if you've ever heard of the

1041
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:20,009
black African was an old strain her and

1042
00:56:17,429 --> 00:56:23,338
some things of would take an old head -

1043
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:29,068
no does that sound familiar well as as

1044
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:32,190
far as I know black African was because

1045
00:56:29,068 --> 00:56:36,750
it was either compressed like a corn

1046
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:40,039
cobs or buried under the ground and it

1047
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:43,199
may or may not have been affected by

1048
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:48,240
various microorganisms may or may not be

1049
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:50,308
so healthy for you so true black African

1050
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:54,899
there might also be weed that's black -

1051
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:56,839
I've seen black I'd seen a Vietnamese it

1052
00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:06,690
was black and I've seen other sativas

1053
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:11,369
almost black it could be either you're

1054
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:14,730
talking about Sam then I was started to

1055
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:18,690
these two Peter sitting here next to me

1056
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:19,500
who were handed me some various assorted

1057
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:22,259
there

1058
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:24,389
Rosen's and I told them I was gonna

1059
00:57:22,259 --> 00:57:27,929
smoke without tonight you've always

1060
00:57:24,389 --> 00:57:34,739
known some pretty cool amigos haven't

1061
00:57:27,929 --> 00:57:37,108
you Sam it helps it helps like how many

1062
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:43,949
years ago did you meet the infamous haze

1063
00:57:37,108 --> 00:57:47,159
brothers well the original haze brother

1064
00:57:43,949 --> 00:57:54,509
was doing work up in the hills in the

1065
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:56,608
late sixties time--even in 72 but I one

1066
00:57:54,509 --> 00:57:58,900
of them lived across the street from me

1067
00:57:56,608 --> 00:58:02,318
and one of them lived down the street

1068
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:04,750
from me so they were both there because

1069
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:07,239
the first days brother did it alone for

1070
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:11,619
a couple years then he was working with

1071
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:23,739
the other A's brother who actually lived

1072
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:26,289
close to me and yeah so what 72 72 and

1073
00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:28,149
all the was done by the first taste

1074
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:31,329
brother but that was the second brother

1075
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:34,329
who were not really brothers but just

1076
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:38,589
friends who added South Indian and Thai

1077
00:58:34,329 --> 00:58:44,019
for me very cool

1078
00:58:38,588 --> 00:58:47,108
exotic flavours I'm a huge haze fan

1079
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:49,719
myself it's no no secret that I my son's

1080
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:51,578
middle name is haze I'm like super

1081
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:54,250
stoked on the haze it always made me

1082
00:58:51,579 --> 00:58:57,369
happy like literally just the smell of

1083
00:58:54,250 --> 00:59:00,250
that sort of spicy exotic flavor that

1084
00:58:57,369 --> 00:59:05,798
the haze is often would give you in the

1085
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:10,088
air but hey it was hard to beat it

1086
00:59:05,798 --> 00:59:13,000
