00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,128

67
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,658
this is it was ralph getting a

68
00:02:58,128 --> 00:03:02,518
Valentine's Day card that said I teach

69

71
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,519
received no it's the one he received

72
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:11,430
from Lisa it's the one he received from

73
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,950
Lisa because she never he never got a

74
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,069
Valentine's Day card poor [ __ ] Ralph

75
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:19,378
you know how nice of Lisa to sort of see

76
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:22,289
that Ralph was hurting and to send him a

77
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:25,289
card because even the local cops kid

78
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:26,909
needs some love and there's a lot to be

79
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:30,448
cited some of these Simpsons episodes

80
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:33,000
obviously you know all taken from the

81
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:34,440
social context that is life yes she

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,079
broke his heart but first she tried to

83
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,269
save his heart and that was the lesson

84
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:42,510
she put herself out there she tried to

85
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:45,150
offer him some sort of you know and it

86
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:48,168
came back to be but he was a little bit

87
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,510
more annoying than previously thought of

88
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:56,939
let's have a damn shall we

89
00:03:50,509 --> 00:04:01,048
it was a condo today she's a good [ __ ]

90
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:03,658
right it's been a while I watch an

91
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:05,489
episode every once in a while with my

92
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:10,078
son my 14 year old son likes the

93
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:12,109
Simpsons oh yeah that is a fab AG behind

94
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:17,840
me look at that

95
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:20,220
here let's see if we can get this off

96
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,929
might be a little bit stuck and I did

97
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,750
just heat it up so we might have to do a

98
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,400
little bit uh there we go

99
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,889
gotta love the heat transference

100
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:48,539
courts allowing us to do such things

101
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:52,850
let's hit the fab egg shall we I think

102
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,850
it's great Tara I think it's great

103
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,728
Tara is called talking about Whitney

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,199
harmonies new glass banger unbelievable

105
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:08,209
concept he's put frit inside the bottom

106
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,740
of the banger

107
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:12,509
he's encased another banger into the

108
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,810
bottom of the banger so it's like a cup

109
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:19,379
within a cup and basically the frit acts

110
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:22,228
as a timer and you can it changes color

111
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:25,680
as it gets hot and then it changes color

112
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:27,659
back again as it loses its temperature

113
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,360
so what it can do is and this is a very

114
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,900
cool concept it can train you to hit

115
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,139
your dab instead of from a timer from

116
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:39,000
color from a color sequence so I thought

117
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,780
it was [ __ ] coolest [ __ ] its

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,120
innovative

119
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,409
I love the innovation of these glass

120
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,560
blowers and the stuff that they're

121
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,270
bringing to us I'm an end-user so even

122
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,829
more happy will I have one in the very

123
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:51,359
near future

124
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:55,079
absolutely I got on the second list the

125
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,520
first list was was hammered out actually

126
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,098
I'm not using my phone for this first

127
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,959
time so I can actually show you guys if

128
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:04,589
the phone actually wanted to work

129
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:09,888
sometimes I just hate iPhones but not

130
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:12,598
always let me see if I can find Whitney

131
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:16,710
Whitney harmony glass all right so here

132
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:18,300
is the unit right here and that's he's

133
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,000
doing a giveaway go check him out on

134
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:28,009
Instagram you can see his account is if

135
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,629
I can get it to focus Whitney Harmon

136
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:32,639
Whitney Harmon glass Whitney Harmon

137
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:37,728
glass go check him out it's a super cool

138
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,728
concept really really cool concept

139
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:43,449
I thought about the torch with the laser

140
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,730
thermometer all in one that's kind of a

141
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,500
good idea still I thought about it but

142
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:52,410
honestly like I don't know I think this

143
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,410
is cooler I think this is way cooler

144
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,589
it's sealed in its quartz I wouldn't be

145
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,480
too worried about it

146
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:02,469
it's not like the quartz can breathe and

147
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:08,980
things can get through I'm not a big

148
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:11,860
future round the fan no big wave today

149
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:14,020
and Topanga all right all right you know

150
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,360
with what bong rip tasted like it tasted

151
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:18,909
like another one drew I know exactly

152
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,210
what that bong rip tasted like because

153
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:24,130
I'm constantly taking that bong rub

154
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:26,889
let's get a little bit more cleaner on

155
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:28,500
the banger a little bit of areas that

156
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:31,870
get missed sometimes when you have a

157
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:35,050
really big banger it's easy to sort of

158
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:39,160
missile a section here in there and we

159
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:42,970
do not want to let the Chas hang out for

160
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,740
any amount of time I am one that thinks

161
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:49,479
that that is not such a good idea

162
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:53,829
Oh Kris you don't even know bro you

163
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:56,110
don't even know I have a video of the

164
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:58,478
final piece and now it's a short video

165
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,620
like two minutes but I am going to be

166
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:04,300

168
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,079

video going close up and looking at the

172
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,350
absolute insane quality of the glass and

173
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,418
how much it pops in the Sun I was a

174
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,189
little disappointed the this apartment

175
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:23,079
that I went to photograph in was very

176
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:23,819
not sunny the Sun in order to go I'm

177
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,109
behind

178
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,680

185
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,440
that away before it was even that before

186
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,450
anything went down in here so it was an

187
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,520
impossible one to let to win unless you

188
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,670
said that it was the pizza from the kiln

189
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,679

190

195
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,139

196
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,550
expecting some some cool glass something

197
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,799
something I've never seen some new

198
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:10,379
technique that involves tinfoil but he

199
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:12,569
opens it up and it's pizza he's cooking

200
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:15,600

211
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:52,650
dr. Natasha and her husband David that

212
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,320
was a nice little hangout session we sat

213
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:57,120
by the boats and puffed some bowls out

214
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,020
of this really cool little piste he had

215
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,519
he basically had maybe I put it way over

216
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,799
there if you know the baby exhale dog

217
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,649
actually I have a big exhale right here

218
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,750
I can show you so if you know the vape

219
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:13,370
exhale bond the bond that has the base

220
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:15,720
with the hole in it this unit right here

221
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,970
he has a couple of different models but

222
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,340
basically it feeds the unit feeds right

223
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,040
in through here well the other day these

224
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,889
guys had a handheld battery unit with a

225
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,779
ceramic bowl that fit right into here so

226
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:30,059
it was a battery unit that fit into here

227
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:32,850
and I'll tell you the rip that I got off

228
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:35,099
those hot thing was was actually very

229
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,840
impressive for you that don't know the

230
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,810
vape exhale that's the unit right there

231
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,759
this is a cool little unit maybe one day

232
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:44,069
Sabo will give us one of these to give

233
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,860
away it kind of a cool unit to share

234
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,840
with the audience but you can go and

235
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,519
purchase on your own from vape exhale

236
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,899
and save those an awesome dude even if

237
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,409
you just want to learn about the unit

238
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,240
it's definitely worth

239
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:57,039
the money I'm not gonna lie they don't

240
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,930
all come in Pelican cases you can get

241
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,208
them fairly cheaper than that but oh

242
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:02,979
good job seventies moment that's a lot

243
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,539
of work getting those tents up if I'm

244
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,519
guessing what kind of tents you put

245
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:10,838
yourself up I took a few down just the

246
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,919
other day and it was it was work that's

247
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,000

248
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:18,219
no no ants on my rig today but keep an

249
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,448
eye out keep an eye out anytime you can

250
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:24,850
of course recognize any type of bugs I'm

251
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:27,338
going to reward you with great with a

252
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,959
great gift of some sort so if you see

253
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:30,639
one climbing on my hat if you see one

254
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,888
climbing on my shirt if you see one

255
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,079
inside my bong if one goes in the bowl

256
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:37,028
while I'm dabbing I mean that's

257
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:38,769
potentially worth like a million bucks

258
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:40,179
you could literally get a million bucks

259
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:41,948
transferred into your account

260
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:43,958
he transferred I'm sure they do eat

261
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:47,229
transfers up to a million bucks these

262
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:49,359
days so just being silly down to this

263
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,829
nine pound tastes like grapes all right

264
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,839
Amelia lavender look down to that

265
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:54,789

you're welcome Peter s I'm happy to be a

268
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:03,880
part of your journey you will not

269
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:07,318
probably see any tins of eagle 20 behind

270
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:12,818
me there are no Eagle 20 tins in my home

271
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:15,458
but boy what would that be worth the

272
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:17,318
portable electric nail I don't know of a

273
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:20,679
port oh the one that I had wasn't really

274
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:22,479
a nail I'll have to find out from David

275
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,739
if he's maybe he's in the chat or dr.

276
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,110
Anna Tosh I don't know if they're in the

277
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,818
chat right now but I was a really cool

278
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,259
little unit and seeing as I already have

279
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:31,688
a couple of the pipes I wouldn't mind

280
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:35,409
getting one of those little pieces to

281
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:37,719

282
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:40,058
good my dogs barking in the background

283
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,740
not sure what up but I definitely am NOT

284
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:43,629
going to be yelling at him to shut up

285

286

287
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:49,240

291
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:56,889

someone is here absolutely someone is

307
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,019

316
00:13:53,799 --> 00:14:07,629

pictures I've done it in the past Savage

318
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:13,809
I've G clayed them you know people they

319
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,139
just die I don't see a huge market for

320
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,939
it

321
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:19,870
I have people contact me and they want

322
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:21,640
photos I sell photos at least photos if

323
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,100
I print them they cost more obviously

324
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:26,169
because a giclee at south big enough can

325
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,720
cost you know I've spent upwards of 500

326
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:31,750
bucks on a nice G clay like a 4 foot by

327
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,790
5 foot or whatever Oh mine's inclined

328
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,950
he's like a little like toy poodle

329
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:45,939
crossed with a shih tzu

330
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:48,190
he's a ship who in fact I don't promise

331
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,790
on any signatures if you bump into me

332
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,899
one day in life and and I have a pen and

333
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:55,059
you have something you want me to sign

334
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:58,208
my god I will sign anything like a

335
00:14:55,059 --> 00:15:00,039
hundred things but I find when I make

336
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:02,049
people to promise something simple like

337
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,269
that it ends up becoming more difficult

338
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:06,370
than it should be and like the product

339
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:08,139
it should just be shipped doesn't get

340
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,209
shipped and then it just doesn't all

341
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:13,809
work out and it fails so in regards to

342
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:16,250
will I send you anything signed no I

343
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:18,109
don't want the responsibility

344
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,330
don't mean to sound like a dick and be

345
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,039

356
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,639
I like to do promise nothing give all

357
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,889
when I make a simple promise like okay

358
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:55,009
I'll sign your thing I end up forgetting

359
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:56,720
I end up not doing it or you know for

360
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:58,399
the instance of the gentleman who asked

361
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,769
recently who wanted me to sign the book

362
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,079
the book that I gave away of Dana

363
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:05,360
Larson's was the only thing I have not

364
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,650
personally shipped I've shipped

365
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,870
everything myself

366
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:11,360
Dana shipped the book Dana lives in the

367
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,580
city 40 minutes away from me I don't see

368
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,649
Dana very often at all maybe two or

369
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:19,129
three times in a two to three month

370
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:22,129
period I might see Dana so when he asked

371
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:24,080
me could you sign it I just was like you

372
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:25,730
know what I'll try but it's unlikely you

373
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,040
know and then Dana hit me up the next

374
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,570
day saying I shipped the book I knew

375
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:31,819
that it wasn't gonna happen and in that

376
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,850
experience it taught me that I shouldn't

377
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,860
be promising anyone any type of

378
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,690
signatures hey if you win one of these

379
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,180
morning's Adam you'll get yourself a hat

380
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,250
if it happens to be a hat and you have

381
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:45,319
to give the right response or happen to

382
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,019
share this the right energy or happen to

383
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,600
you know say something that is funny and

384
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:55,629
grabs me in a certain way

385
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:58,070
absolutely but otherwise nada

386
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:59,870
yeah drew it is sold in California

387
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,490
dispensaries and I'm not sure when we're

388
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:06,199
going to do Colorado because that intro

389
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,818
involves building an entire facility in

390
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,380
Colorado of course you can't ship things

391
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,359
over state lines we need to have the

392
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,610
facility in Colorado a processing resin

393
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,799
that's grown in Colorado and we have

394
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:17,809
partners there and we have the ability

395
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:20,149
to do it but we're really just trying to

396
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:22,490
get our feet up let's release California

397
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:28,150
let's show everyone what we're about and

398
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,150
then we'll recreate the

399
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:33,829
oh sure I can do that tinychat comm

400
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,940
backslash French huh DS pretty easy

401
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:37,159
there we go

402
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,070
you can plug that into your Google and

403
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,269
it'll come up well there you go Eliot

404
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:47,149
it's always nice to play with dry

405
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:49,250
squares screamed dry set screens that is

406
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,130
a mothership sticker on this Pelican

407
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:58,609
behind me this is a stack of Pelley's

408
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:59,480
behind me one two three four there's a

409
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:01,459
couple over there

410
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,110
I have nothing like flab dofollow flat

411
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:07,840
four two one you got to see his Pelican

412
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:10,729
collection it's completely insane insane

413
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,619
your partners in Oregon already - no not

414
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,420
really John we've had conversations with

415
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:16,429
a few people we're always down for

416
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,440
working with good people who are doing

417
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,850
things we usually just pick that small

418
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,370
percentage of people people that are

419
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:25,549
focused on you know biodynamic farming

420
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:27,379
and the symbiosis of the root bacteria

421
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:30,769
like soil balance is talking about and

422
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,570
living soils with rhizomes and all of

423
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:35,240
these sorts of things that allow for the

424
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:37,250
plant to express itself at a higher at a

425
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,440
higher level of terpenes and

426
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,910
cannabinoids and whatnot these are the

427
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,710
people we want to align ourselves with

428
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,080
the people that are understanding that

429
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,539
you know growing biodynamically and

430
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:50,389
organically and you know really allowing

431
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:51,829
the plant to express itself that's where

432
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,030
we want to come in and process that

433
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:54,949
resin we don't want to be the mass

434
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:56,210
processor we want to be the processor

435
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,340
for the people who are producing the

436
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,200
highest quality product and those are

437
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:03,769
the people we want to promote even more

438
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,450
so than our brand we will promote the

439
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,740
people who grow the cannabis that we

440
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,330
process because they there are

441
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,400
everything they're doing everything

442
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:12,769
let's be honest the processor is a very

443
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,730
short percentage of time over the course

444
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:18,529
of that plant's life from seed to finish

445
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,620
oh well you know lots of people grow

446
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:24,529
with salts it's uh I I don't I think

447
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:27,049
that you can grow some decent herb using

448
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:30,019
these salts growths I just believe that

449
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:33,019
the Sun and organics and the symbiosis

450
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:35,200
of living organisms feeding for and on

451
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:38,629
the plants will produce a higher quality

452
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,610
expression that's unparalleled this just

453
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,020
can't be compared now that doesn't

454
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:43,309
that's not on the market

455
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:45,470
right now you know so that's not

456
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:49,579
available to people so things like

457
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:52,339
mostly salt grown newts are the ones

458
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:55,909
that are are popularizing right now so

459
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:57,259
trust me I'm sure you can

460
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:02,240
Willie you'll have to check out with the

461
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:02,960
company though oh thanks kiwicare Carrie

462
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,910
Thanks

463
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:10,039
just trying to keep it real just try and

464
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:11,600
keep it truthful you know I kind of was

465
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,970
having a conversation with a guy today

466
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,709
who we were talking about Tokyo smoke

467
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,180
and he said you know they're really not

468
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,220
bad guys and they'll probably end up

469
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,950
getting some good traction out of this

470
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,390
this nightmare Fiasco that they had with

471
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,370
mice these are of course the guys that

472
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,860
said there's no original bombs and in

473
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:31,869
the pipe making industry and their metal

474
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:33,919
3d printed space metal by pipe for

475
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:35,449
$13,000 is going to be the new future

476
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,610
obviously these guys are somewhat

477
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,860
disconnected from the scene but they're

478
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:42,259
reconnecting to a new scene that isn't

479
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:43,639
the scene and I understand that but you

480
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:46,069
know you can do it without completely

481
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:50,060
insulting an entire industry we were

482
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:52,490
just sort of talking about that that

483
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:54,589
concept of like coming out and like you

484
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:57,170
know trying to represent an industry

485
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:59,799
while insulting the entire industry it

486
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:03,500
was really it was really a crazy [ __ ]

487
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:05,149
crazy [ __ ] thing yeah sweet dragon

488
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,710
that was a sweet dragon this is a sweet

489
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,600
dragon and this is a pretty nice dragon

490
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,880
and I get it it's hard not to make fun

491
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:12,319
now but you know I haven't met Alan on a

492
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,230
few occasions he's actually a really

493
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,659
nice guy and it was unfortunate that

494
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,519
them that it got that it came out like

495
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,440
that that they just said the things that

496
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,420
they said and the editing and the way it

497
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,380
came out was just like oh that's just

498
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:32,690
terrible you can't be you can't do such

499
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:34,160
a thing yeah they're not bad guys trust

500
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,690
me they're not bad guys at all they're

501
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,700
actually pretty good dudes but they just

502
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,830
came across really do sheet in that in

503
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,200
the particular video and they did kind

504
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:48,409
of insult the entire industry in there

505
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:49,610

513
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:15,940
got 250 people I don't feel like I've

514
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:17,230
gotten too deep it feels a little

515
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,049
different now that I'm on the computer

516
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:25,329
than when it did on the phone but maybe

517
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:27,609
another dab will loosen the gift of debt

518
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:29,679
of gab I need to just do a quick little

519
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:31,959
cleanup because my last step is still

520
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,120
actually sitting in there somewhat dirty

521
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,690
it's always the good sign of a pretty

522
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:40,469
strong gab when you go to take your next

523
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,970
hit and your bowl still has the oil

524
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:47,110
floating around in it from the last one

525
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:50,920
it's not a bad sign love cleaning the

526
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:55,769
Banger love not having it Chazz out on

527
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,769

528
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,819

529
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:03,009

538
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,740
the world and eventually you know

539
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,079

Crystal yeah me too T Minor

543
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,799
oh yeah Benny Sheets those guys are

544
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:38,439
next-level dosa as well all four of

545
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:42,399
those glassblowers I can't pronounce

546
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:46,090
that I see Dyson's named Daisuke Saito I

547
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,840
think Yoshinori condo and junichi Kojima

548
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:52,959
who is aka Rhodes Rhodes really really

549
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:55,179
really talented individuals I love what

550
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,279
I love about it is what I love about

551
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,320
everything that I do in the fact that

552
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,089
the things that I'm good at hash making

553
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:04,259
isolating resin heads I'm good at it

554
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:07,299
because I pay careful careful attention

555
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:08,420
okay I go in and I was paying more

556
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:10,859
attention

557
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,210
ahead of a lot of people and then

558
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:14,519
teaching other people how to pay

559
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,529
attention and how to become aware has

560
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,049
been a learning lesson for me because as

561
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:20,970
I teach I realize all the things I don't

562
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:22,379
know and I go out and I seek that

563
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,390
knowledge and I want to learn more and

564
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,640
more and there's so much that I don't

565
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,440
know about these components in these

566
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,330
plenty of this plant and the resin that

567
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,430
it produces I'm sure eventually one day

568
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:35,309
the stuff I don't know about cannabis

569
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:38,009
will fill a small library maybe even a

570
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:40,529
big library so I'm definitely looking at

571
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:42,779
it as I'm still the student even as I

572
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:44,690
try to fit the shoes sometimes as I

573
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:47,220
don't like to say teacher but share

574
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,570
facilitator of knowledge you know let's

575
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,100
all learn this knowledge because

576
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:52,289
eventually some really [ __ ] smart

577
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:54,599
people are going to gain it and when

578
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:56,609
they do the next step of the next

579
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:59,909
knowledge the deeper level that we need

580
00:24:56,609 --> 00:25:02,279
to go into may be unveiled so what do I

581
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:06,120
think of Jerome Baker I like Jerome

582
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:12,839
Baker you know originally I met Chris oh

583
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:15,839
geez like it must be 20 years maybe more

584
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:20,759
than 20 to 22 years ago is when I first

585
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:22,230
met the main blower I'm spacing right

586
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:23,700
now actually a little bit because I

587
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,319
called him Chris and now I'm like

588
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,180
doubting that that's his name and

589
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:30,450
everyone used to call him Jerome Baker

590
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,799
and anyway one of you guys will put up

591
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,480
his name and then I'll feel terrible

592
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:35,159
I've known him for a long time so it's

593
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,190
kind of crazy that I'm spacing on his

594
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,840
name but I like him I like his you know

595
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,120
it's different it's a different level

596
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,949
and style of glass people used to love

597
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:45,989
that [ __ ] back in the day he was you

598
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:49,470
know when I first met him it was in 1995

599
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:52,710
and he was in the back of Adam Dunn's

600
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:55,980
place which was I want to say it was the

601
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:59,250
KGB Jason exactly don't know why I

602
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,440
called him Chris but yes Jason was there

603
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,359
he had his long hair and I got some

604
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,180
video footage of him use bone a glass

605
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:08,279
pipe and it was the KGB Adam had just

606
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:11,009
closed the CIA which was cannabis in

607
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:14,940
Amsterdam and the KGB which was his new

608
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:18,750
incarnation was called no KN o W good

609
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:20,580
buds and it was [ __ ] awesome yeah he's

610
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,750
been on Church absolutely Jay Harris

611
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,149
exactly

612
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:26,039
I call them crisps but yeah a couple of

613
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,080
good dabs of some sativa some narrow

614
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,450
leaf drug cultivars and that'll occur

615
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,759
although you know actually the last one

616
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,590
I took was that God's green crack and it

617
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,500
is definitely not a narrow leaf drug

618
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:40,169
cultivar it is very strong and narcotic

619
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:44,759
and that could seriously put people to

620
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:46,019
bed excellent a pot smoker yeah I've

621
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,029
been sharing it for almost twenty years

622
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:50,639
so if you've been paying attention if

623
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:52,829
you've been out there listening the

624
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,560
information has been what I would

625
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:58,679
consider fairly widespread even though

626
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:01,319
tons of people still don't know exactly

627
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,539
about what water hash is how the concept

628
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:07,470
works you know the things to sort of

629
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:09,500

00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:35,039
I don't know where the hell I think I

664
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,019
put it up there I found my old rolodex

665
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:41,129
from like I don't know it's I got to be

666
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:44,160
close to 20 years old and it opened up

667
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:46,440
on the BPG and Debbie's personal number

668
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,820
and it was like like she seriously must

669
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,850
have written that in there like a year

670
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:54,389
after they opened that place just kind

671
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:58,819
of cool all right let's hit this little

672
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,820
dab we're going back in for some Congo I

673
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,840
just hit something special no wonder I

674
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,520
saved it that's the way dude I love that

675
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,869
want to hear one of my most amazing and

676
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,639
it's kind of funny because it goes back

677
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:11,189
to joints and I haven't smoked joints in

678
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,470
a long time before I started the bubble

679
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:15,570
bag company the night that I got busted

680
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:18,000
and arrested was 16 and a half pounds at

681
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:20,339
a roadblock I ended up staying the night

682
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,200
in the West Vancouver jail and they

683
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:24,329
impounded my car and the next morning I

684
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,620
released myself on my own cognizance in

685
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,299
the end it was a very very chill

686
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:40,229
experience other than having to spend

687
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:42,029
time in jail and this is the price you

688
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:46,049
pay for practicing civil disobedience

689
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:49,309
prior to these great legal platforms and

690
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:51,720
systems mechanisms being put into effect

691
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:54,299
how we get those into effect as we

692
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,130
practice civil disobedience that's what

693
00:29:54,299 --> 00:30:00,599
I was practicing I got caught I got in

694
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:03,690
trouble I spent the night in jail I lost

695
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:06,480
all my pounds but I'm not away home I

696
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:08,940
noticed that they had left my ashtray in

697
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,680
the car and back then I used to smoke a

698
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,200
lot of joints and leave the roaches in

699
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,390
the ashtray well there was this big fat

700
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,740
roach in the ashtray and I was driving

701
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,660
home and I was kind of choked and pissed

702
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,640
off but having all my pounds taken and

703
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,320
having the letting down the compassion

704
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,240
club and getting busted and having to go

705
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,240
to court and losing money and all this

706
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,799
crazy [ __ ] you know being pretty

707
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,990
stressed out about it actually and I

708
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,940
opened the ashtray as I'm getting out of

709
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,950
West Vancouver driving up towards

710
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,299
Horseshoe Bay and I see this big Roach

711
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,620
there's a whole bunch of little ones in

712
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,889
there too but I see the big one and I'm

713
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:40,379
like

714
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,759
I know what that is and I I just put it

715
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,330
in my mouth and I push the cigarette

716
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:48,750
lighter in and I like that joint and if

717
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:52,769
it wasn't the [ __ ] haze it was like a

718
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:55,890
pure haze joint I just I inhale and as I

719
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:58,980
exhaled I realized everything is going

720
00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:01,680
to be fine stop reacting to this

721
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,319
experience do not give them any more

722
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,900
power than they have already taken from

723
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:09,179
you and from that moving from that

724
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,370
moment on I started looking at it as a

725
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:15,210
valuable lesson instead of a costly

726
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:16,769
mistake and that's led me to start with

727
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:20,130
the bubble bag company start fresh

728
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:22,379
headies start promoting isolation of

729
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,840
glandular trichomes heads start

730
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:27,630
educating people do macrophotography

731
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:31,199
start my youtube channel hash Church all

732
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:34,980
of that comes from being arrested one

733
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:38,430
night at a roadblock with cannabis so

734
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:41,579
you know sometimes if you're really

735
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:43,799
looking forward to change you know and

736
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:45,599
you manifest this rock bottom that's

737
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:47,339
kind of some of the best change you can

738
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,139
ever manifest not saying that I was

739
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:51,689
really rock bottom but it was a bummer

740
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,060
for me it was my lowest of my low it was

741
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:57,509
a little scary low lower than I like to

742
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:59,039
go and there's real comfort in that

743
00:31:57,509 --> 00:32:02,069
experience I was talking about it today

744
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,720
actually in how you have these two sort

745
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:05,429
of worlds whether you have this money

746
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,839
world this world of people who want to

747
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,670
become involved with cannabis that have

748
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,709
never become involved with cannabis and

749
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:12,240
then you have this kind of as community

750
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,039
people who have been very very much

751
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,950
involved and are very connected and feel

752
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:18,990
very somewhat possessive about their

753
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,400
connection with cannabis that they you

754
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:23,970
know some people feel like they kind of

755
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,950
own it and I get that and so the real

756
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:27,690
value in those two groups in the future

757
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,730
will be what in mathematics is called

758
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:33,660
the semi VESA kiss which is when the two

759
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:36,450
circles intersect there's a third little

760
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:39,360
area right here and that little area is

761
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,220
going to be a very valuable area if you

762
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,079
can communicate with both sides of that

763
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,850
group and if you can create the buffer

764
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:47,579
zone that's going to be needed for this

765
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:49,709
industry to expand beyond the simple

766
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:52,019
division that we've been suffering from

767
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,850
thanks to prohibition and we haven't

768
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:56,460
done much better it's almost like a

769
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:58,889
colonial mindset as prohibition mindset

770
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,890
is so ingrained in us that even now as

771
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:03,690
we get legalization we fight against it

772
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,820
we fight against the mainstream being

773
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:08,309
involved we fight against it being

774
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:10,079
allowed on a larger level and we want to

775
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:12,269
somehow protect our little baby from

776
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,149
getting out of the nest and spreading

777
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:19,670
her wings and you know touching the rest

778
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:23,100
of the world and so it's uh it's pretty

779
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:26,610
it's pretty trippy I think that we're in

780
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:29,129
for a neat surprise in the upcoming in

781
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:31,139
the upcoming years of cannabis

782
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:33,120
prohibition crumbling and falling and

783
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,530
what's going to replace it they're not

784
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,659
going to fall easy they're going to

785
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:39,539
constantly try to replace it with a more

786
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,580
corrupt version of itself but we've

787
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:43,980
already crumbled the most corrupt

788
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:47,449
version of itself so I think that the

789
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:50,730
foundation will soon follow we have a

790
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:53,220
very incredible group that is now

791
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:55,170
willing to say I use cannabis and some

792
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,390
of them are children and some of them

793
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:01,410
are elderly and some are female and some

794
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:04,170
are male and all races and all genders

795
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:06,090
and belief systems and it's incredible

796
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:08,190
before there were only a certain group

797
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:10,469
of people who were willing to stand up

798
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,480
and promote the use of cannabis and

799
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:13,939
those people were looked at it was easy

800
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,179
to make those people look like

801
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,579
degenerates

802
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:20,099
because we were willing to be arrested

803
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:22,529
for what we believed in and in society

804
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:25,019
it's like the laws are supposed to keep

805
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,550
you in the corral so having this group

806
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:28,469
of individuals who think they can just

807
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:31,200
do something and not face the

808
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:35,369
consequences sort of freaks society out

809
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:37,739
quite a bit however in any sane society

810
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:39,929
when a law makes no sense whatsoever

811
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:43,019
it's up to the good people of the

812
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:46,260
society to stand up to practice civil

813
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:50,550
disobedience and to not allow them to

814
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,510
you know direct what is right what is

815
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,789
the truth

816
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:56,420
you know because lies are lies and

817
00:34:53,789 --> 00:34:58,710
that's the [ __ ] that I can see

818
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,420
whatever your truth is if it changes

819
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,610
then change your truth and let people

820
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,369
know but you don't have to lie there's a

821
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:08,519
lot of line there's a lot of [ __ ] so

822
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:10,259
I think it's why people I hope it's why

823
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:12,780
people enjoy these wake and bakes

824
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,330
because I try to be genuine I try to be

825
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:21,120
myself and I try to be as truthful as I

826
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:22,860
absolutely can I want to call it for a

827
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,230
very short amount of time we called it

828
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:29,430
University same-same I took some things

829
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:32,039
I didn't last very long my college was

830
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:34,889
psychedelics my college was reading on

831
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:36,809
my own and between my own psychedelic

832
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:38,339
use and between my own reading and

833
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:40,949
absorbing of knowledge and of course

834
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:44,220
interactions with smart individuals you

835
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:45,389
know hanging out what is in my life find

836
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:47,250
out the things you want to get good at

837
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:49,769
and then hang out with people who are

838
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,050
much better than you at those things so

839
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:54,509
those are the things that I've practiced

840
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:56,280
whether it's playing pool whether it's

841
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:58,350
trying to learn guitar whether it's

842
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,580
isolating resin heads whatever the

843
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:02,489
things that you're passionate about

844
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:05,340
driving a dirt bike or a snowmobile or a

845
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:07,829
snowboard hang out with the best of the

846
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:11,519
best of that group and you will quickly

847
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:13,860
learn at an exponential rate of things

848
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,619
that you want to learn about and so

849
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:19,829
that's kind of even for photography

850
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:21,569
you know same thing and anyone can do

851
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:23,340
this it doesn't take anyone special now

852
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,769
the more you pay attention and the more

853
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:28,110
you focus to what's going on the more

854
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:30,500
aware you are the faster and quicker

855
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:33,390
you'll be able to absorb the information

856
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,099
accurately to what it is you're trying

857
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:36,269
to learn if you're spacing out and

858
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:38,489
you're not paying attention and you're

859
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:41,550
the text guy and you're the MTV flash

860
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:44,459
flash generation you might have a harder

861
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:47,250
time in focusing and being hyper aware

862
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,539
and being you know notice listening to

863
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,369
what you're learning and then applying

864
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,650
it the way you learned it certain people

865
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:54,690
are exceptional at it and other people

866
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:58,289
can't do it to save their lives

867
00:36:54,690 --> 00:37:00,570
it's crazy but for me

868
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:02,659
it's what it's my thing I try to just

869
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,950
hang out with people who are much better

870
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:06,779
try to find people that are doing things

871
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:08,939
that you're inspired by but doing it at

872
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,789
a higher level and you too will climb

873
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,309
quickly

874
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:16,980
the last run I did of bubble hash jeez

875
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:19,319
it probably would have been maybe within

876
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,030
the last six months I did a couple of

877
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:24,869
batches here and there I've done some

878
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:26,940
batches in the tropics in Jamaica and

879
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:29,700
I've done a few local batches just

880
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,068
little small batches bigger ones in

881
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:36,929
Jamaica but soon we'll have some batches

882
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:38,818

883
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:40,500

885
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,230

886
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:49,650

looking fairly good in Jamaica and soon

905
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:42,539
we'll be able to process this into

906
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:46,349
medicine and plant many many more acres

907
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:48,359

920
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:13,739
that all the packaging they've been

921
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:16,259
ordered they're currently being

922
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:19,169
manufactured all the oil and the

923
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,940
terpenes have been produced and ratioed

924
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,440
out and are just waiting for these

925
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,510
applicators and

926
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,608
pens to come in so we can fill them up

927
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,980
and also be available through the

928
00:39:26,608 --> 00:39:31,078
bubbleman brand through Harborside I'm

929
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,269
hoping Berkeley patients group is going

930
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,769
to jump on with an order and I'm sure

931
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:37,108
some other spots that I'll let you know

932
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:39,929
as well as weed maps is going to be

933
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:43,619
getting photographs and links to all the

934
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:45,808
accurate places like la cush and the

935
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:48,150
real green dragon to places in LA that

936
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:50,400
we're processing for right now so we

937
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,990
want to let people know the legitimate

938
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,510
places that our work is going to be

939
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:57,118
found and we'll be very vigilant in

940
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:59,220
exposing people who are claiming to sell

941
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,280
stuff from us that is not from us

942
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:05,159
toaster grow I gave away the karma cup

943
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,160
in today and I gave away the Turk proof

944
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:11,029
which is basically rosin and PTFE like

945
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:15,808
sheets probably safer than parchment and

946
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:17,849
we gave it to mind something nuts I

947
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:20,010
think he said he came in and said and

948
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:23,010
the answer is it's the pizza from the

949
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:24,869
kiln it's definitely made me laugh and I

950
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:27,839
figured what is a better answer than

951
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:29,760
that I hate having a contest I hate

952
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,969
making it like seem like we're winning

953
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,109
I'd rather feel like you were chosen and

954
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:36,419
that you didn't really have to do

955
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:39,179
anything for it except be you and have

956
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:41,940
your sense of humor and so that's what

957
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:44,129
we did how about this for a beautiful

958
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,099
story to finish it off with and I hope

959
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:51,088
that it's not too personal I don't think

960
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:54,180
that it is do gee oh gee remember his

961
00:40:51,088 --> 00:40:57,389
father I think it was David pop Pasir

962
00:40:54,179 --> 00:41:00,690
poster his father was on his deathbed

963
00:40:57,389 --> 00:41:02,068
he's passing away now he remembered I

964
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,659
didn't know much about him but I gave

965
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:05,818
his dad a shout-out well he wrote me

966
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:08,098
this really beautiful email and he said

967
00:41:05,818 --> 00:41:10,019
hey there bubble man I first want to say

968
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,519
thanks for your kind words I want to

969
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:14,130
give you a little story to go with my

970
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,929
father's name my father was born in 1947

971
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,849
and got to experience some really neat

972
00:41:15,929 --> 00:41:19,710
times and always loved plants and

973
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:21,329
flowers he raised me and my brother by

974
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,949
himself and helped me learn and grow

975
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:25,289
teaching us that honesty respect and

976
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:26,909
love were the base of our being he did

977
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:29,130
this by living his life this way every

978
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:30,838
day cannabis was and will always be one

979
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,369
of his greatest passions more than

980
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:33,690
cultivation the idea of sharing some

981
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:35,369
really good herb with the friends that

982
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,048
you kept was the reward

983
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:38,430
felt that this idea of sharing parallels

984
00:41:37,048 --> 00:41:40,889
to what you talked about with the idea

985
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:42,929
of plentiful not scarcity he first saw

986
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:45,150
the Grateful Dead in 67 and at the age

987
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:48,118
of 8 took me to my first dead show that

988
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,588
was 1992 at Star Lake amphitheater I was

989
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,838
fortunate enough to see them again in

990
00:41:49,588 --> 00:41:53,818
1995 which I'll never forget the Gloria

991
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,710
Encore so we got to experience a lot

992
00:41:53,818 --> 00:41:57,838
together he was diagnosed with chronic

993
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,909
lymphatic leukemia and when I was 12 he

994
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:01,498
was given three months to a year two

995
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:03,118
weeks from that day we got a call from a

996
00:42:01,498 --> 00:42:05,159
different doctor who informed him he was

997
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,990
a candidate for a stem-cell transplant

998
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:08,879
this gave us the last 15 years together

999
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:10,828
and allowed me and my brother to grow up

1000
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,440
having an excellent example of how we

1001
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:16,109
should live aloud and and be and treat

1002
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,940
one another everybody is every day is

1003
00:42:16,108 --> 00:42:19,288
blessing my name is Jason and I take

1004
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,818

1007
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:26,038
weekend bakes I wasn't working and glad

1008
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:28,039
I got through and hearing you talk about

1009
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,599
my father brought me much joy I

1010
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:33,059
appreciate the pin and will wear it with

1011
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:34,680
the cool story of holes I also thank you

1012
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:36,450
for the hash knowledge that in turn will

1013
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:37,768
help me become a better grower the

1014
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:40,919
learning never ends

1015
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:43,709
so how [ __ ] cool is that you know you

1016
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,588
step out you do things for a reason and

1017
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:49,289
there are doors that open up because of

1018
00:42:46,588 --> 00:42:52,078
it this is the real [ __ ] in life it

1019
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:54,989
seems to be hijacked by you know the

1020
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,298
fakeness of creating a person and making

1021
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:59,220
that person famous so that when people

1022
00:42:57,298 --> 00:43:00,630
are supposed to be opening doors with

1023
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:02,699
one another the ones they've actually

1024
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:05,548
manifested into their life they get

1025
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:07,618
hijacked by John Travolta or whoever

1026
00:43:05,548 --> 00:43:09,480
thinking that that's a person they need

1027
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:12,088
to engage with the people you need to

1028
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,059
engage with you would never [ __ ]

1029
00:43:12,088 --> 00:43:16,828
guess so Jason I want to thank you bro

1030

1033
00:43:21,568 --> 00:43:25,288
kind of Tears me up when I took when I

1034
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:28,348
read it to you guys it's just a good way

1035
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:33,119
to connect a lot of this Internet a lot

1036
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:36,150
of this you know way of connecting

1037
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,460
that's different than in real life and

1038
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:40,769
true face-to-face person this connection

1039
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,710
through the internet a lot of it has

1040
00:43:40,768 --> 00:43:45,058
been made to be less than and if we can

1041
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,949
make it more than by May

1042
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:48,929
sort of a more special connection

1043
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:51,719
connecting with each other a little bit

1044
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:54,269
more than just through a quick little

1045
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:56,699
buzz on a wake and bake video then man

1046

1049
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,179
lines incline starts with the pita is

1050
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:08,278
with the beat starts with the breath

1051
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:10,130
ends with the breath probably with the

1052
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:13,889
first beat it's pretty heavy

1053
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:15,778

for coming in and heading back to work

1058
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,818
peace brother like to find a way to

1059
00:44:25,018 --> 00:44:28,889
connect this community more than this

1060
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:31,259
also yes Larry Dunnington well the first

1061
00:44:28,889 --> 00:44:33,568
way is to be simple don't look at the

1062
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:36,298
huge picture like it you know like start

1063
00:44:33,568 --> 00:44:37,798
or locally start within yourself connect

1064
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,748
within yourself with the plant learn as

1065
00:44:37,798 --> 00:44:41,639
much as you can and then you know

1066
00:44:39,748 --> 00:44:43,649
naturally as you start talking about

1067
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:45,179
cannabis you'll connect with people that

1068
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,769
you pull into your life and you'll find

1069
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:49,139
the direction that you're supposed to go

1070
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:51,629
in through these coincidences that are

1071
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:53,188
really coincidences and Robert Anton

1072
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:55,159
Wilson has a book he calling the phrase

1073
00:44:53,188 --> 00:44:58,528
the coincidence so I don't want to take

1074
00:44:55,159 --> 00:45:00,119
any credit for that but it is the

1075
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:02,568
coincidence and you have these

1076
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:06,028
coincidences you will see these

1077
00:45:02,568 --> 00:45:08,518
experiences replicating themselves into

1078
00:45:06,028 --> 00:45:10,318
your life in different ways where it's

1079
00:45:08,518 --> 00:45:11,368
like okay I'm supposed to experience

1080
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,558
this this is what's supposed to be

1081
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:15,269
happening it's a great way to lead your

1082
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:17,089
direction if you're really lost and you

1083
00:45:15,268 --> 00:45:19,348
don't know what direction you're going

1084
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:21,328
really nice way is to follow the

1085
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,189
coincidence you've seen the same person

1086
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:24,959
a stranger in your life three times in

1087
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:27,989
one day okay they're either the DEA

1088
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:29,338
investigating you or more likely they're

1089
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:31,259
a very important person that you've

1090
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:32,909
manifested into your life and vice versa

1091
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:34,829
and you guys are supposed to connect

1092
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:37,140
this is another valuable thing that the

1093
00:45:34,829 --> 00:45:39,689
DEA loved to [ __ ] with by taking away

1094
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:41,759
that trust and by creating paranoia

1095
00:45:39,688 --> 00:45:43,259
people would manifest people into their

1096
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,418
lives and then they would suffer

1097
00:45:43,259 --> 00:45:47,608
paranoid delusions that that person was

1098
00:45:45,418 --> 00:45:49,978
out there to hurt them and not actually

1099
00:45:47,608 --> 00:45:51,838
help them so all sorts of different ways

1100
00:45:49,978 --> 00:45:54,418
that they can affect us in negative ways

1101
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,429
I'm gonna leave you guys on that note

1102
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,869
230 people hanging out in the room I do

1103
00:45:56,429 --> 00:45:59,849
appreciate it I think

1104
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:02,880
pretty good one I'm not sure how long it

1105
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:04,860
went but I guess we'll find out when it

1106
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,390
stops thank you guys all for coming in

1107
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:11,240
May the full melt bless your Bowls

1108
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:11,239
sooner than later peace out everybody
