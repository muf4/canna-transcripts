00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:24,089
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,609
and as you can see I'm not in my normal

4
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:29,339
regular office right now today we are

5
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,590
actually in behind my house up one of

6
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,850
the local trails that splits off and

7
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,820
goes to a few different mountains

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,700
locally but yeah I've got the KTM out

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,980
here today so we are going to maybe get

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,510
up on the mountain head up to the

11
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,859
waterfall have a little session just

12
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,570
show you guys a little bit of GoPro

13
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,859
footage as I've got my chest mounted

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,649
GoPro which should give some pretty

15
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,269
decent visuals of the trail it is

16
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,948
freshly wet so we'll try to make sure I

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,620
keep wiping it as I rip through trees

18
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:57,420
and they hit the front of me because

19
00:00:54,619 --> 00:01:00,538
it'll obviously cause water droplets and

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,879
whatnot so why don't we head on over to

21
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:09,719
the old guy of starting starting the

22
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:13,009

because

here

52
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,938
all right so I just got here to the not

53
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,438
quite beat really the end of the trail

54
00:04:13,938 --> 00:04:17,959
this is really just the beginning of the

55
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,430
trail for people that want to hike some

56
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,038
of you may have heard recently there was

57
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,990
five hikers that passed away right

58
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:26,418
behind Lions Bay on Mount Harvey

59
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,310
well that is indeed the trail that got

60
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:31,129
them to where they breathed their last

61
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,509
breaths very sorry for them always a sad

62
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,219
story to hear about people dying in the

63
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:35,689
mountains especially when you come from

64
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,639
Mountain culture and you love mountain

65
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:40,939
culture I made it to the waterfall

66
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:44,780
nonetheless rainin so there's going to

67
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:48,439
be some rain falling on the lens here we

68
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:51,168
could potentially get ourselves into the

69
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:54,469
trees here sometimes I climb up there

70
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:56,029
and have my staff but just down in here

71
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,370
is good enough we'll see what happens

72
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:01,429
this is the trail that I came down that

73
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:05,209
led me right up to this point which is

74
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:07,220
the waterfall so why don't I go and try

75
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:08,598
and find something to set up where the

76
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,250
camera won't be getting too wet and

77
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:12,050
we'll have a quick couple of pups

78
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,519
I think maybe a little bit of

79
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,770
conversation and that'll be it for this

80
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,359
nice quick short video a little bit of

81
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:19,459
dirt biking a little bit of water

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,788
falling and of course a whole lot of

83
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,788
puffins

84
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:26,689
[Music]

85
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,489
alright guys sorry for the lack of

86
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,319
talking just kind of gearing up getting

87
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,300
things in the go here so I've got a

88
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,420
little bit of that dry sift oh nine

89
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,520
cookies rosin right there for your

90
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,199
demand and I guess we're gonna probably

91
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,639
just do a little dunk this stuff's very

92
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,129
buttery and basically is not very dab

93
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,800
friendly when it comes to the dabber so

94
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:16,389
I'm gonna heat up the piece sorry about

95
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,920
the loud background noise of course

96
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:20,169
we're right next to a waterfall so it's

97
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,449
going to be fairly loud sorry about that

98
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,189
but maybe enjoy it I'm gonna get back to

99
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,430
my pipe and we'll see what's going on

100
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,430
here

101
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:58,079
[Music]

102
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:12,948
my dunk ready that live down here

103
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,850
sickly might be going for a decent-sized

104
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,850
dunk here

105
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:19,719
all right back down

106
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:31,399
twenty-nine seconds still feeling pretty

107
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:33,500
decent it's gonna go up 45 seconds just

108
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:34,969
because we're outside and hey when

109
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,819
you're outside it's never a bad idea to

110
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:41,080
hit it a little bit early so here we go

111
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,079
hit it up everybody

112
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:21,439
perfect low temp tab just puddled

113
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,110
just because we're on the bush doesn't

114
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:28,509
mean we have to be savages of course I

115
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,259
still have my DC glass cleaner and my

116
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,090
q-tips

117
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,830
although the glass cleaner is not going

118
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:37,750
to be very useful at this point in time

119
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:40,930
because truly that was a perfect perfect

120
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,719
low temp tab that brought my my banger

121
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:45,099
back to where it needed to be Talia that

122
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,930
was so exciting I think it's due for

123
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,629
another one what do you say one dab to

124
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:51,370
dab three dabs four let's hit a second

125
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:55,019
one I'm gonna put the cleaner over here

126
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:57,429
for now lay down the dabs cue tippers

127
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:00,269
all right I'm gonna go keep this back up

128
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:00,269
and be right back

129
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,870
eating it up out in the boonies my

130
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,480
favorite place to be for any of you that

131
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,299
truly know me this is where I love to be

132
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,680
out and out in the forest out amongst

133
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:17,679
the waterfalls out amongst the trees

134
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,610
keeping fierce

135
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:36,649
on the on the timer I find that timer

136
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,528
man I'll tell you hitting not that early

137
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:40,909
- that was at 45 seconds last time it

138
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:44,350
was definitely what I'd call a pretty

139
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:46,850
nice low temp tap there's my dad for now

140
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:51,918
little guy

141
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:54,259
Rasen rip we're at 23 seconds my FZ

142
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:58,538
because you need an ofc you when you're

143
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:58,538
dabbing in the in the backcountry

144
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:09,088
beautiful okay getting up to 40

145
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:09,089
yep yep yep all right let's do this

146
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,779
now that's what I call a ripper

147
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:53,448
so they're perfect low temp dabber

148
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:56,500
huddling huddling if you will nothing

149
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:56,500
better than that right there

150
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:06,049
all right because we hit a couple of

151
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:08,629
dabs there we're gonna hit the DC glass

152
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:11,479
cleaner I like to keep it in small vials

153
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:12,700
to make it portable and easy to use nice

154
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,019
and easy

155
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,330
steams out any dirt and debris that

156
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:20,629
might be caught down in there any little

157
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:22,339
burnt sort of nasties they generally

158
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:26,480
come to the surface with the DC glass

159
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:27,170
cleaner if done correctly so definitely

160
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,740
stoked on it

161
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:32,569
DC glass cleaner for the win all right

162
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,399
well I think I'm going to get back on

163
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,870
the bike it's been fun I'll give you

164
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,830
guys one last little shot of the

165
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,240
waterfall and yeah maybe I might ride

166
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,920
you out on the trail and just at one

167
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,528
point in the trail it the ride will end

168
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:46,969
and the music will come on so I know not

169
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:51,110
