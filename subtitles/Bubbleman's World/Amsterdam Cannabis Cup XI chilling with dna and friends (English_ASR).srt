00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,599
from DNA genetics and this is uh the G

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,878
DNA genetics uh Green Green Room

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,399
headquarters room so uh Tony and I have

7
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:37,799

into a different set interesting we

13
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,599

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,399
all right we might try all of those but

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,920
uh yeah you were going to take a fresh

19
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,118
rip out of the RAR brand new tube or at

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,320
least cleaned fresh very well is it

21
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,959
brand new or clean no it's just clean

22
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,679
clean a couple of years already going

23
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,919
here we go with a with

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,920
a with a fresh green

25
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:30,599
red nice nice and light

26
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:34,719
vaporized styles

27
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:37,399
it's good that's nice Definitely that Co

28
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,200
sure that's um one of our entries

29
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,799
actually is it yeah yeah it look

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,079
beautiful I opened the jar when I got

31
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,960
here I still I love her you know what I

32
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:51,399
mean I love her I just see it as

33
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:53,519
something it I could extract resin from

34
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,000
yeah it under the better you can

35
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,840
recogniz I think also the better you can

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,039
make your your resin can make a better S

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,600
I think it's an important relationship

38
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,719
ship on both of them knowing the herb

39
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,158
and knowing the resin knowing the resin

40
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:09,879
will definitely help you grow better

41
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,879
herb you see that jar

42
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:22,159
actually who's who's in in under DNA um

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,360
DNA DNA genetics it's really good for

44
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,479
sure I think it has a good chance it's

45
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,200
really nice the only thing I'm afraid

46
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:32,919
about is it's just like

47
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:35,359
on Old strain that not old but strain

48
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:38,199
that we've been using quite long already

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,440
but it's a strain that you don't get fed

50
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,839
up of something like that you can put

51
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,079
like we really love our Gooser same

52
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,319
thing counts for an LA you know not a

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,519
lot of people appreciate that and

54
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:51,598
they well I think because so many people

55
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,920
try to grow it and don't grow it like

56
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:59,199
this true so who grew this that was

57
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:02,719
grown by K if I'm not mistaken he did a

58
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:04,399
good job looks pretty darn nice I always

59
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,120
want to pull my macro lens out when I

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,879
see flavors like that really just got to

61
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,439
go get some batteries this trip so I can

if you guys ever uh require heavy duty

73

great Gardener just opened up oh a

111
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,960
little bit of 90 maybe is that 90 I

112
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:02,839
smell from over here oh my goodness

113
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,959
this is the backup you guys you guys

114
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:09,560
went with the 73 I like that M you know

115
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:12,879
the 73 upon producing like upon making

116
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:16,759
it was by far the most smelliest bag but

117
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:19,079
upon aging now the 90 has now become

118
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,639
more smelly than the 73 it really is

119
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:26,240
holding that sort of shishka sort of

120
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,680
Barb dank smell totally so yeah this one

121
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,879
smells a bit now though I mean it just

122
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,598
keeps changing right what do you to say

123
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:35,079
about that Aaron from DNA

124
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:38,719
genetics um I'm waiting for my head okay

125
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:41,598
perfect it's DNA food DNA approved DNA

126
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,199
approved DNA approved well here let's

127
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:45,560
hit that actually I don't know this is

128
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,038
the melts but uh you just pulled that

129
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,160
out so why don't we do a little dabble

130
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,318
doodle of

131
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,520
that here we go why don't you heat that

132
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:00,680
little piece of bar and then dip it into

133
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:04,680
the MK okay and then dou and then dip it

134
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:08,079
up oh that was worked out rather

135
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,240
well wow oh now I'm going to St make it

136
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:14,240
a churro toss it into the into the

137
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,918
aurro you got toss it into the sugar all

138
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,960
right we have to be smart with Hotel

139
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,279
puffing so just give him a

140
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,519
puff take I'm running that way you won't

141
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,318

142
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,359
going to take that whole thing no no I'm

143
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,520
