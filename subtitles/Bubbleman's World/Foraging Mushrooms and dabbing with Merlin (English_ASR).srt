113
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,038

118
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,560
nice to have a dab before you get into

119
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,639
the forest

120
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,399
a lot of it is just walking takes a

121
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,840
while when you're foraging mushrooms

122
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,198
first of all anyone that is being

123
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,399
inspired by this video i'll tell you

124
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,879
right now

125
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,359
try to find a local amateur mycologist

126
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,439
in your area a group of mycologists some

127
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,879
information online there's all sorts of

128
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,360
great things anything that has paul

129
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,800
stamet's name on it

130
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,080
because picking mushrooms is something

131
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,000
you should be careful these guys have

132
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,519
two big full bags of mushrooms right

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,120
there whatever mushroom you find if

134
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,359
you're not two hundred percent sure

135
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,918
don't yeah when in doubt throw it out uh

136
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,120
people ask is it edible every single

137
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,959
mushroom is edible one time

138
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,720
uh you wanna stay away from the ones

139
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,399
that are only edible one time because

140
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,840
those are poisonous and they generally

141
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,679
kill you

142
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,038
so be careful out there when you're

143
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,240
picking mushrooms

144
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,639
i'm gonna clean my banger and we're

145
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,400
gonna get into the forest

146
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,560
all right so we're just heading into the

147
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,399
forest here

148
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,839
in squamish

149
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,079

150
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,560

172
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,638
puke in your truck so hard

173
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,719
at one point i didn't know if i wanted

174
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
to [ __ ] myself or puke

175
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,080
that's what he was saying to himself i

176
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,400
could see it on his face and i know you

177
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,318
could see it on his face

178
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,099
you look nervous for the last 10 minutes

179
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,199
of the ride

180
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,639
[Laughter]

181
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,639
dude you know it would have been fine if

182
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,240
he barfed in the truck though

183
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,879
yeah i mean you've done in mine a few

184
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,500
times but i'm not tripping

185
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,629
i don't really care

186
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,629
[Applause]

187
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,399
another red belted polypore

188
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
it's just so sweet in here

189
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,079
no

190
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,800
they have those only in whistler

191
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,478
supposedly

192
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,400
have you heard of them

193
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,399
um not up in whistler i haven't but

194
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,318
that's interesting push play

195
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,079
i wasn't recording that whole thing

196
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,199
just did a whole nice intro talking

197
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,399
about bringing you guys on this

198
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,680
adventure

199
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,359
i'm not gonna repeat myself but um yeah

200
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,639
continue to show you guys a little bit

201
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,399
of mushrooms that we find in here

202
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,599
hopefully we find some edibles that we

203
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,038
recognize

204
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,560
like i said before when you don't

205
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,158
recognize them it's best to just

206
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,478
probably not even pick them

207
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,038
uh and it's definitely best

208
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,360
to not eat them

209
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,720
all right we're gonna film this weird

210
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,600
we're gonna film this weird mushroom

211
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,600
that marilyn found

212
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,320
a weirdy

213
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,039
oh there's some witches brew

214
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,839
ah there's some witches brew

215
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,920
we've been walking around for about what

216
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,000
half an hour

217
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,360
it's been pretty chill

218
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,360
unless there's a huge flush

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
i usually walk around for about a half

220
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,000
an hour plus before i kind of get to my

221
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,759
zone and start

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,360
pulling things up out we'll see how it

223
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,958
goes for us we might be a little early

224
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,440
we might not be

225
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,958
i'm kind of hoping that we're not

226
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,040
some really big mushrooms popping out of

227
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,679
the forest floor here

228
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,278
just not necessarily the ones

229
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,879
we're looking for also this is a very

230
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:45,919
popular spot so a lot of people do pick

231
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,919
in and around here

232
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,079
what's up braxton

233
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,359
yeah they sure did

234
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,439
they sure did

235
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,078
i wonder if deeper down

236
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,639
well that's way over there

237
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,039
back this way

238
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,120
what's wrong

239
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,039
on what the knife

240
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,720
oh my goodness

241
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,039
i thought you were stung

242
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,720
i'm not gonna recording

243
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:47,000
all right i'll get these little yellows

244
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,000
it's always good to just cut them

245
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,838
i'm not confident in that one

246
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,479
that little guy

247
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,079
and then we'll head back over here

248
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,240
pull this

249
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,599
another nice flush these are actually i

250
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,799
didn't actually see this flush i'm

251
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,440
seeing it for the first time but look

252
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,078
how big these ones are

253
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,640
oh brixton you

254
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:16,879
silly little dog

255
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,879
you know some yellows

256
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,439
really nice color on these things

257
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,239
make sure we don't get all this

258
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,959
nice little golds hey

259
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,360
oh wow look at this guy

260
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,599
isn't that cool

261
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,440
we were like we just walked by these

262
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,239
ones man

263
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,160
they're hard to see

264
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,000
the beautiful colors and look at them

265
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,078
they just once you start there's more

266
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,320
and more and more no problem it's always

267
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,679
best to make sure it's a nice one yeah

268
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,839
that was a nice one

269
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,838
i'm excited for you to cook with these

270
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,519
i made a really nice soup with like a

271
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,519
huge bag full of these

272
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,519
it was so creamy here

273
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,519
these are small but they weren't perfect

274
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,039
this is the first one

275
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,519
all right well let's keep let's get

276
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,278
going yeah that's it

277
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,839
all right merle's uh picking up some

278
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,240
more yellow foots

279
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,519
just getting little babies but uh one

280
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,240
thing you may or may not know about

281
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,159
merlin is that he is an exceptional chef

282
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,079
and he'll make something very nice and

283
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,958
fancy and delicious out of these yellow

284
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,359
foots

285
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,359
and he'll figure out a way to pull that

286
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,360
flavor out of them

287
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,360
even though they're still quite small

288
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,959
that's fun looking for them

289
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,199
we just found this little purple

290
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,760
mushroom looking pretty crazy so we

291
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,759
figured we'd share

292
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:21,239
[Applause]

293
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,240
we got another

294
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,399
maybe just don't pick the rotten one

295
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,079
there

296
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,399
this guy right here oh it's not even a

297
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:36,399
mushroom

298
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,959
so if you've got golds there they're

299
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
everywhere they're going to be all

300
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,479
around us we're in a patch right now see

301
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,000
them over by the tree i see a big one

302
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,839
standing out right there another patch

303
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,320
behind right there

304
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,000
it's funny how it happens hey yeah it's

305
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,800
when you're not looking for them yeah

306
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,240
here's another little flush right here

307
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,240
they're popping out right here

308
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,920
nice one

309
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,120
boop

by brixton right here

312
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,159
i guess these are indicators this is the

313
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,278
first time i found them next to these

314
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,919
big ones

315
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,198
really yeah

316
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,958
i was in the middle of saying these

317
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,639
aren't really indicators and then i lit

318
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,439
then you walked right by that little

319
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,278
patch of chandra yeah just sticking

320
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,760
right out nicely

321
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,759
it's kind of cool

322
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,800
yeah picking mushrooms is a trip

323
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,320
we've got our friend who's coming to

324
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,599
meet us here and we're in a pretty big

325
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,000
chunk

326
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,159
of land so his phone died and that's why

327
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
merlin is screaming his name every few

328
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,838
minutes

329
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,959
so he can find us

330
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,680

but as i was sitting merlin could see

339
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,000
underneath me

340
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,000
were more chanterelles

341
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,839
and there's a line of chanterelles that

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,679
heads in this direction

343
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,680
and it probably crosses the path and

344
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,679
heads over there

345
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,838
um

346
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:27,439

347
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,519
sir i'm glad we went mushroom picking

348
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,279
today dude what uh

349
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,120
don't you just find it meditative and

350
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,278
medicinal somewhat the woods are the

351
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,278
best place to calm down yes

352
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,879
super relaxed the better parts of

353
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:42,240
picking mushrooms you get to just chill

354
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,198
in the woods and find treasures

355
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,198
dinner

356
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,799
yeah exactly

357
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:51,599
forging with a chef and you are a chef

358
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:54,159
self-proclaimed that's okay

359
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,199
i'm uh

360
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,838
i'm proclaiming it as well

361
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,240
look at that flush though dude this is

362
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,560
like pretty much

363
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,039
a blessing

364
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,838
this little flush of goldies

365
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,838

366
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:22,679

aren't they nice mushrooms yeah yellows

368
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,920
so as you can see we're having a pretty

369
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,919
good time there is a level of relaxation

370
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,278
that occurs

371
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,519
when you're picking when you're picking

372
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,039
mushrooms and uh

373
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,799
i just sort of saw this over here i

374
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,958
thought i'd come and share

375
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,319
this is a like a boulder right here

376
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,039
covered in moss

377
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,879
and what's growing out of the boulder

378
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,919
but a tiny little mushroom a little p

379
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,838
look at that

380
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,439
look at that little guy you want the

381
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,320
attention i know

382
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,199
i know brixton i know oh you broke it

383
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,079

384
00:16:53,198 --> 00:17:01,838

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,199
little bowlette right there

387
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,959
i don't recognize this one

388
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,839
for sure so i'll be leaving it but i

389
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,400
honestly think that that's what that was

390
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:17,838
like i said when in doubt

391
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,540
just uh leave it be

392
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,399
leave it be

393
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,078

398
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,400

attached to there we go

523
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,558

524
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:02,558
eye out for some of those

525
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,519
in this little zone

526
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,810
that you found

527
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,158
mushrooms are such a hoot

528
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:17,678
[Music]

529
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,960
they are such an absolute trend

530
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,320
no

531
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,159
we're kind of well because we also said

532
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,000
let's go now yeah we're like let's go

533
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,520
let's do we're good

534
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,839
come in here and then what always

535
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:31,839
happens when you're good

536
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,839
because you start finding more things

537
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,600
now we're heading out anyway if we see

538
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,119
anything else of interest

539
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,038
we will be sure

540
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,000
to share with the audience like this big

541
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:46,879
red belted polypore conch

542
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,880
how cool is that

543
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,119
i love the red belted polypores

544
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,439
that was great

545
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,519
picked some lovely

546
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,519
yellow foots got a couple golds

547
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,520
a little stress

548
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,359
after half an hour walking and not

549
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:18,879
seeing anything though it's funny how

550
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,639
you feel right

551
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,640
but mushrooms sometimes require a little

552
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,120
bit of a commitment

553
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,038
every time i give up when i find them

554
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,759
you get off your phone you focus on the

555
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:29,759
forest floor

556
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:36,079
and then you give up that's right

557
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,080
oh i think i might have found something

558
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:46,200
i don't think it's what we want

559
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,200
no it's like what you picked earlier

560
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,360
so

561
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,119
i just realized that look at how

562
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,639
close i parked

563
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,158
to some amanitas now they've been

564
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,360
nibbled on and there's some new ones

565
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,720
coming out

566
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,719
that goes to show you the power of the

567
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,919
mushroom i drove down this street and

568
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,079
just randomly pulled over right here

569
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,320
and there's amanita muscaria mushrooms

570
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,240

00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,720
here i love it when it does that oh yeah

677
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,480
they're fat yeah golf ballers turning

678
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,000
into

679
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,759
and this has really been our technique

680
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,359
of holding them apart with the frogs and

681
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,278
getting like a lot of them have like 10

682
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,199
14 heads on them

683
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,440
it's got a nice crystal content like it

684
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,840
is crystalline oh yeah

685
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,840
it's got resin

686
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,960
oh yeah

687
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,599
it's funny like in the beginning i

688
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,359
started playing with those straws and

689
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,398
this was the first section i did and i

690
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,839
don't know if you can see how many

691
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,639
clocks are in that section that's

692
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,639
ridiculous

693
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:15,679
it is ridiculous

694
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,639
like some of them have like 16 monster

695
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,080
heads on

696
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,399
i gotta say this is probably the first

697
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:23,678
grow i've ever toured with like my

698
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:26,079
flashlight on my camera it's pretty fun

699
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,080
really nice crystally content

700
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,119
super fun day picking mushrooms with

701
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:30,879
merlin

702
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,278
checking out his grow

703
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,039
he is going to end up producing a really

704
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:36,798
nice meal with those mushrooms and i'm

705
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:38,158
hoping i can be there so we can finish

706
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,158
off the video

707
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,679
with actually the food that we prepare

708
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,919
with these mushrooms

709
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,399
um but i think we're at the point where

710
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,440
we need to dab this is inspiring me to

711
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:49,678
dab

712
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,240
your trichome forest has inspired me

713
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,919
let's get dabbed let's do it let's dab

714
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,779

715
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,869
dab a doodle

716
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:58,868
[Music]

717
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:05,839
oh yeah look at that

718
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,839
when you open the door

719
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,798
spinning

720
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:12,798
spinning

721
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:20,398
yeah the canopy is pretty nice leaving

722
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,399
right now right

723
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:25,119
yeah yeah it really is

724
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:25,119
good job sean

725
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,120
all right we've gotten we've picked the

726
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,200
mushrooms

727
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,639
we've walked through the woods walked

728
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,840
through the woods we've checked out the

729
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,600
grow

730
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,359
i think it's time for a dab

731
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:40,959
and a joint and a joint yes i love that

732
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,240
you're always rolling a joint while i'm

733
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,519
uh

734
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,519
making a dab that's actually perfect

735
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:52,240
so hope you guys enjoyed this little

736
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:54,558
squamish adventure that we've been on

737
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,558
here

738
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,880
we're probably doing some more of these

739
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,278
mushroom picking adventures

740
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,519
i like the idea of foraging and then

741
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:05,119
having merlin make a really nice meal i

742
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,440
mean that meal give give them a low down

743
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:09,439
on what that meal was yesterday

744
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,440
five quart five course dinner yeah the

745
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,558
five course dinner so first course first

746
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,840
course was uh

747
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:20,079
it was a bruschetta with uh balsamic

748
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,720
reduction with maple then we did uh

749
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,319
beat tartar with avocados and roasted

750
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,558
pineapple that beet tartar was

751
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,918
ridiculous you also had a toasted

752
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:30,798
sourdough with the beef toasted

753
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,759
sourdough that's true and then we did uh

754
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:37,200
we did pan seared scallops with a

755
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:40,319
butternut squash celery root puree with

756
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,960
a bar barbarian and then we did that

757
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,359
[ __ ] was so good micro greens with it as

758
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,000
well yep that was incredible and then we

759
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,319
did a wild mushroom chanterelle mushroom

760
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,398
risotto with oysters as well with

761
