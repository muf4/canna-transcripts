00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,559
into a car state where we can take that

188
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,200

194
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:47,720
different temperature at a different

195
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,720

yeah I would I would go was 200° yeah we

211
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,559
should try lower for sure and then we

212
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,079
could do we could do a bit with this

213
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,958
stuff into a 160° and Stir It Up and we

214
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:33,439
could and uh see what the results are on

215
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,359
that yeah no I'm stoked for that get

216
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,680
this denail plugged

217
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:43,919
in there's some more of that oh man that

218
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,919
is just so nice looking these little

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,679
nuggets no what I did the Nuggets is I

220
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,799
put them in these slick containers oh

221
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:55,120
yeah you see how would it's like that on

222
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,000
the bottom the platinum and after it sat

223
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,519
for a while and ended up ordering some

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,120
of these things off the net cuz I like

225
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,679
the bigger containers

226
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,639
those are great contain are they glass

227
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:06,278
yes and then I took them then then I

228
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,360
kind of just took it and I dumped it out

229
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:11,039
and it stayed in the form like that but

230
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,079
I could also take it down into that form

231
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,039
too but like what I've done with this

232
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,479
stuff here is this is the easy stuff

233
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,799
that I can just you know you just we get

234
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,839
a little bit of water in this give a

235
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:26,838
little bit of press I'll be right back

236
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,959
oh yes I brought the dab the dab kit so

237
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:31,000
we've got

238
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:33,078
that and and we've got our

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,240
coil so this is nice and easy you want

240
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:37,599
to make sure when you're putting this on

241
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,879
that this Bend is on the bottom and not

242
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,600
the top okay basically when it's on the

243
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:44,720
top it creates a little more and when

244
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,399
it's on the bottom it just it's more

245
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,040
secure yeah so this will be light enough

246
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,120
it we'll be able to keep that right here

247
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:54,838
okay and then it's a simple one switch

248
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,399
on the back turn it on to allow the

249
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:01,120
power to go to the Whip and then we'll

250
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,120
go down to a nice

251
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:06,320
750 push that button a second time and

252
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,839
uh the denail should be up to

253
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,920
temperature within the next couple of

254
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,560
minutes and at that point it's just a

255
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:16,319
matter of us figuring out what we want

256
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,958

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,799
just you had a screen to go on there too

302
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,159
you know what I'm going to go right into

303
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:15,120
the quartz oh drop right on quartz Okay

304
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,559
I uh I think I'm preferring it I find on

305
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,078
the screen it's real slow it does it's

306
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:22,078
not hot enough yeah you know

307
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,919
eye

308
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:53,559
closer

309
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:56,639
oh it's just so nice to enjoy

310
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,559
quality with Purity yes you know that's

311
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,600
the key people think that Bubble Bags

312
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:04,198
give you you quality they don't you got

313
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,199
to do it right they give you Purity and

314
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:09,758
if you have quality the Purity will show

315
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,879
you the quality it's really important

316
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,318
that people understand the difference

317
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:18,039
between Purity Purity means how pure is

318
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:19,399
the hash is it 80% gland heads is it 90%

319
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:23,120
is it

320
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,958
99.9% gland heads we want to get 95 and

321
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,759
up that's what we want that's when you

322
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,559
get this real nice I mean this just

323
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,440
melted and paint I painted it along the

324
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,838
side of the the quartz and it was just

325
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,319
it just

326
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:38,360
disappeared so there you go for that and

327
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:41,439
then um if you want to scoop a scoop

328
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,278

metal ones it's quick before it Heats it

335
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:01,198
up mhm with the bigger thicker ones have

336
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
a little bit more time you know because

337
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,000
when you go here if you dump it in the

338
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,919
center there it's going right into the

339
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,199
bong and it's gone so you want to go

340
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,919
kind of like this but it's like you

341
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,318
almost have to do this and then kind of

342
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,439
do that little thing you'll learn your

343
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:17,359
style I'm sure you're going to be one of

344
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,759
the things that that we were talking

345
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,958
about before is the way the methods of

346
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:25,240
growing your Tri chromes the tri chromes

347
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,160
yeah right your quality and then your

348
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,960
Purity it happens in the grow room for

349
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,519
sure yes and that's where it starts

350
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,038
genetics and then variables you know who

351
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,480
can control the variables who can

352
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:37,960
basically you know be for indoor it's

353
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,640
like you're being God you have to you

354
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,919
want to control everything and the more

355
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,320
you control the more likely your resin

356
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,960
will will go right to maturity first

357
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,720

we share knowledge with each other I'm

364
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:12,319
sure that Darren's going to show me

365
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,599
tricks that he's learned and it's very

366
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,079
important for me to learn these tricks

367
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,719
and to listen to the people sure I may

368
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,119
have shown someone how to do something

369
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,519
but that doesn't mean they're not going

370
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:24,678
to show me how to do something so when I

371
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:28,879
come on these trips I'm most excited to

372
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:32,880
uh to learn and uh judging by the hash

373
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,120
you have here um you got some things to

374
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,520
teach that's nice isn't it mhm that's

375
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,279
just

376
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:44,558
ridiculous it's deep it's almost like a

377
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,558
sublimator hit like for the

378
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:54,200
hash works good look at that I got a

379
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,480
little little piece of

380
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,840
reclaim so I think Darren and I are

381
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,159
going to do that about 20 25 more times

382
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:03,720
you're welcome to join us if you like

hash off mhm the warm

394
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,079
Dabber this is literally caramel holding

395
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,158
it in my hands no matter what I don't

396
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,359
care who you are if you love puffing the

397
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:49,320
minute you hold this in your hands this

398
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:51,158
is what you say in your mind I want this

399
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,439
I want lots of

400
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:56,840
this it's just and

401
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,360
never that's the melting a never

402
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:01,639
stopping

403
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,599
why like one of the things people are

404
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,080
going to ask cuz we've talked about it

405
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,879
is the information that Tony passed on

406
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,240
to you about sealing it up in plastic

407
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,320
and trying boiling it at different

408
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,000
temperatures yeah why don't you let them

409
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,678
know just I know we talked about it

410
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,480
briefly but just run them through what

411
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:20,280
you did briefly for the one or the 200

412
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:24,159
and the 180 and uh cuz people are going

413
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:26,319
to ask I know yes well you see

414
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,080
there's cuz they are we're going to show

415
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,960
it on the camera as well so talk about

416
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,038
each one you want and I'll photograph

417
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,880
them and inlay the photo so they're

418
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:36,000
going to see it really good well the

419
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,159
ones with the circles here we've taken a

420
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,440
photo of this stuff here was

421
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:45,039
basically this stuff that I put in the

422
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,600
Slick containers that took that

423
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,440
form and then I just pressed them into

424
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,119
little balls I just wanted I was playing

425
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,919
one night and that's what I did but then

426
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:57,000
I was talking with um Tony from River

427
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,080
Rock Wellness Center on the internet

428
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,200
during chat one night and he was

429
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:03,839
suggesting melting it at certain degrees

430
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,919
what I did is I melted it at certain

431
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,599
degrees one of them was

432
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,200
200° and with that 200° what end up

433
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:14,678
taking place is the waxes and the Turpin

434
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,679
boiled and burst the TNC boils at 177°

435
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,880
membrane and then what it did is it

436
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,038
almost turned it into like a you know a

437
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,080
butter likee

438
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,960
substance the solvent it was it was uh

439
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:27,558
you couldn't press it and stick it it

440
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,798
was just crumbly like like cured finger

441
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:32,599
hush it just wouldn't press together

442
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:34,599
right I see now then I took this stuff

443
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,759
that you just had that you were in your

444
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:39,359
head saying I want more of this yeah I

445
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,519
melted this at

446
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:45,479
180° let's take you back one second was

447
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:47,079
this one of these balls from your slick

448
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,159
or was it one of your finger pressed or

449
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:51,278
was it literally just it was powder it

450
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,960
it was just powder okay so it was just

451
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:55,599
the powder you started with

452
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,880
powder put it into a put it into a

453
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:01,359
Ziploc baggie like a sandwich baggie put

454
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,799
it onto the corner wrapped it up tied it

455
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,158
up so it was all in the in the in the

456
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:05,278
corner of the bag so it was sealed in

457
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,720
there it was going to float around the

458
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:10,240
bag right then I took the took water a

459
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,558
cup of water boiled it put the

460
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,519
thermometer in it once it boiled I put

461
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,720
in the cup and once it got to 200° I

462
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,519
melted the first baggie got that first

463
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,360
substance we Ted how long did you do

464
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,200
that for I just did it until it's till

465
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,719
it melted it was probably 3 minutes a

466
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,720
minute you know even less than that

467
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,038
right but short time for sure short time

468
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,038
once it's melted

469
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,440
I took it and I put it in the freezer to

470
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,879
saw it up right there now that's the

471
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,159
first batch that I got the second batch

472
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,159
I used the powder as well right straight

473
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,039
from the powder and then I melted it it

474
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,840
started at 180 and and cooled down to

475
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:50,240
177 176 and I stirred the cup with the

476
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,839
same method in the baggie now what it

477
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,759
did then is it turned it into this

478
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:58,558
caramel because THC will boil at 177° is

479
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:01,558
what uh Tony told me and he showed me

480
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:04,558

508
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,919
one time and that was years ago when

509
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,798
they even harassed him at the border so

510
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,880
man I'm just recovering from the last

511
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:18,278
hit like wait until this one this one's

512
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,960
going to like blow you out of recovery

513
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:24,038
I'll help you get out of

514
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:28,480
recovery look at

515
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:31,038
that it is really nice too I can say um

516
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,839
dry sift is just different from bubble

517
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,079
hash it's um you know a lot of people

518
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,439
are always like oh it's way better it's

519
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:40,119
way better I think if you only ever saw

520
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,679
killer dry sift and only saw mediocre

521
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:45,319
bubble you would say that whereas the

522
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:48,200
nicest bubble is really on par with the

523
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:50,439
nicest dry sift however they are

524
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,440
different and the one thing that dry

525
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,399
sift

526
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,798
really in a way is unique is that

527
00:24:55,398 --> 00:25:00,639
there's no footprint in the extraction

528
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:03,240
and there's no no um you don't lose any

529
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,520
tpin like you do in water extraction you

530
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,319
know there's no breaching of the heads

531
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:11,918
everything's like intact just it's a

532
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:15,519
unique unique method and it's it's an

533
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,840
old method and it's definitely uh it's

534
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,960
not that hard to learn how to do this

535
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,038
and you don't need a lot of material to

536
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,399
do it you know what I'm saying like even

537
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:26,960
a small amount of herb you can just play

538
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:29,319
around on these small screens and learn

539
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,720
how to do this and is it not a skill

540
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,879
that you would consider up there in your

541
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,600
you know quiver of skills well

542
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,278
absolutely it's like going to college

543
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,199
and getting a degreeing something and

544
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,839
and uh applying it and seeing that you

545
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,038
what you learned works yeah no Absol

546
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,798
it's you've done a great job you know

547
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:49,640
when when uh we we we we met a long time

548
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:52,879
ago and we we talked about bubble bags

549
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,919
and stuff and and we I bought one of

550
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,480
those those screen sets and everything

551
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,960
before and the tumble now and I know I

552
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,919
tried doing the thing I thought the

553
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,159
stuff that was underneath the 70 was

554
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,520
this was the the killer I was wow right

555
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:07,080
off look how much I'm getting and and

556
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,918
I'm looking I'm smoking I'm like well

557
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,079
you know this is okay but you know I

558
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:14,600
could finger rub better or you know and

559
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:15,599
I didn't really see what we were what

560
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,158
you were talking about I think it

561
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,839
happened with a lot of people for a

562
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:22,799
while they just weren't quite getting it

563
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,398
and I think the photo essays were good

564
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,158
for a small group of people that were

565
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:29,199
really gung-ho well for the

566
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,440
perfectionist yeah perfectionist also

567
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,120
for for the lucky guy you know the small

568
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,600
percentage which there are these guys

569
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,479
and I've really maybe focused on them

570
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:38,678
more than I should and it's why I always

571
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,360
say anyone can do this is that there's

572
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:42,960
random dudes that just like literally

573
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:45,439
buy bags for the first time run their

574
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,960
grow through it and get

575
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,159
like like the nicest hash that you could

576
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,440
get like nice nice as anything I've ever

577
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,640
made or smoked yes and to me I just call

578
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,798
it that's the nicest hash in the world

579
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,840
it doesn't mean it's exclusive there's a

580
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:02,000
big pile up there yeah of the night you

581
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:05,798
know this is like hello nicest hash in

582
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,278
the world for for certain like no doubt

583
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:10,558

584
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,200

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,359
thing for me that turned me on to the

590
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,159

just got on my bike and rode some more

602
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,919
because I could not sit still I was like

603

couldn't believe it so

610
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,798
then I ordered the screams and gave it a

611
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:15,679
another set of screens and gave it a

612
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:18,720
full 150% effort on it and did not stop

613
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,600
until I got the results I wanted I got

614
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,079
those results took a while didn't it

615
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:26,480
yeah like two three weeks dude you were

616
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:28,519
persistent I felt bad I felt like like

617
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,558
cuz you you text me and I was like why

618
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:33,000
is he not what's the material I was

619
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,558
getting what I was using I

620
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,558
wasn't I just wasn't it wasn't what I

621
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:41,678
was using

622
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:44,158
now and then when I thought what I got

623
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,679
was full melt I was all yeah look at

624
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,799
that sent him a

625
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,440
video and he says to me well it's it's

626
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:54,119
starting to

627
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,240
sizzle I know I'm terrible eh that's

628
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:58,798

629
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,480
beautiful that's that's uh that's the

630
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,918
real deal you don't have to [ __ ] around

631
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,880
you're not going to say oh that that's a

632
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,240
good job Darren I get critized for that

633
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,039
though but you shouldn't I think it's a

634
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,798
good thing and I remember when I first

635
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:13,000
met skunkman Sam I felt like he was

636
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,278
almost like a like a university

637
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,960
Professor or something like when you

638
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:18,599
were when you were wrong he was just

639
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,319
like you're wrong I was just like oh my

640
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,959
God but I appreciate it now looking back

641
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:26,720

642
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,200
snaps you right it's not it's not

643
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,640
codling you into doing

644
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,880
right you're doing it wrong so do it

645
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,320
right well that's it you know and and

646
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:40,000
you're definitely doing it right then is

647
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:42,278
[ __ ] it sizzled and then I made another

648
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,480
little video after [ __ ] around some

649
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:47,919
more and then he said yep that is

650
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,679
definitely full melt because it bubbled

651
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,278
and then it bubbled some more and then

652
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:56,278
it bubbled some more and it just melted

653
00:29:52,278 --> 00:30:00,159
and it was just like holy [ __ ] the one

654
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:03,599
50 to 70% THC with full tpine profile

655
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,278
like the that is the canabo profile this

656
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,439
is from OG Kush from the plant you know

657
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:11,200
what I mean like

658
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,798
mhm and what uh what we're going to be

659
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:18,120
taking pictures of this week is going to

660
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:21,000
be u a Brooklyn mango a Bubba Kush and

661
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,879
OG Kush excellent and uh going to get

662
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,240
some macro photos of some nice plants

663
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,320
here might even be able to get a little

664
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,000
bit of video clips we'll we'll find out

665
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:34,398
when we uh meet the folks yes basically

666
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,119
um what I'd like to show on on those

667
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:40,678
videos what I'd like to show the the

668
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:42,759
world is what we're doing to get this

669
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,440
growth of the tri chromes because well

670
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,398
that's important it's the most important

671
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,120
spot and we're doing that right from the

672
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:52,839
stage of rooting the plants to help to

673
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:55,038
to introduce and uh improve the THC

674
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:56,759
production on the plants as well yeah

675
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,720
I'm sure people would be very interested

676
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:02,038
in specific uh you know details of like

677
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,038
okay what do you do at this point at

678
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:06,798
this point and at that point for me um I

679
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,798
haven't grown in so long and it's why I

680
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:11,278
don't give much grow advice you know I

681
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,558
grew for years and I do now have my

682
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,119
license but because our licenses are

683
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:17,759
potentially going to be uh taken away

684
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:19,638
from us in the next couple of months

685
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,599
ending on my birthday if you can imagine

686
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:23,038
that it's not they they can't they uh

687
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,158
they they shouldn't be able to do that

688
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,558
to people and I think that it's not

689
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:28,600
going to be able to happen there's you

690
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,200
know they think they're talking

691
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:33,439
regulating voltages and amounts of

692
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,120
plants because so many people are

693
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,759
growing so many amounts of I don't know

694
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:39,278
we don't need you know like thousands of

695
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,839
pounds or anything but I definitely like

696
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:44,000
the idea of um production licensed

697
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,439
producers great and distribution that

698
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,480
work great for you know elderly people

699
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,720
and maybe even like kids and stuff and

700
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,120
like there might be a whole group of

701
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,120
people that love that but also

702
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:58,038
dispensaries are essential it's like a

703
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,678
Grassroots organization that is

704
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:02,519
necessary component um because there's

705
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:04,278
so many of them that open up that you're

706
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,638
able to choose where you want to go and

707
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:09,079
find a variety of strains um that maybe

708
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:12,119
one licensed producer could never really

709
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:13,720
have and um also of course the right for

710
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:16,158
us to be able to grow plants you know

711
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,399
like 98 plants or something just under

712
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,159
100 and obviously you know throw a light

713
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:24,518
limit on it it's that simple you know if

714
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,919
you if you have a 98 plant license maybe

715
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:29,558
that's 20 lights you know not 100

716
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,600
because that's what a lot of people were

717
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:35,158
doing just throw up a a light for every

718
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:36,839
plant that you're allowed to and so

719
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,600
licensed production facilities can do

720
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:40,240
that when you need to grow a lot but for

721
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:43,678
everyone else and the reason I think the

722
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,440
dispensaries will really reain Superior

723
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,759
is that the Grassroots Growers that grow

724
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,440
that herb for those dispensaries are so

725
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:53,359
many and they grow such a small amount

726
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,480
and they do it right that they're able

727
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,839
to produce a level and a quality of

728
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,399
cannabis that most not all but

729
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:03,158
most can't touch production level

730
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:08,000
facilities can't touch doesn't mean not

731
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:10,840
all of them I've been in 50 and 100 plus

732
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,599
lighters that were like absolutely

733
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:15,879
growing like grade a herb like just

734
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:19,519
Danang like the whatever they call it

735
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:22,080
now quadruples quads yeah yeah back in

736
