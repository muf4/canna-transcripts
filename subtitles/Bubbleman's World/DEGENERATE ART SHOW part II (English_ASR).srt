1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:19,549
[Music]

2
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,000
and we are here with uh bubble man the

3
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,079
man who's responsible for all of this

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,759
madness

5
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,759
here why the hell did you take this

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,879
crazy project on Mark

7
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,960
um you know that's kind of a hard uh a

8
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:38,878
hard question to answer it's been a year

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,000
and a half in the making it was this

10
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,558
space was originally supposed to be

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,198
um a space for my manager to have an

12
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,799
office if you could believe it or not

13
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:50,000
that's all I needed for the Bubble Bag

14
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,839
Company a small little office space and

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,119
on a beach in Jamaica I had a friend

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,600
call me and say I found the space for

17
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:00,000
you it's inii ini Commercial Drive

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,800
that's 11-11 Commercial Drive and I was

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,439
sitting on a beach in Jamaica thinking

20
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,560
that I could just be sitting enjoying

21
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,359
the bubble bag thing for the next 10 or

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,478
20 years and watching my kids play on

23
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,079
the beach thinking you know maybe I

24
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:13,798
should start more projects maybe I

25
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,560
should maybe I should give back more to

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,439
the community rather than just try and

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,680
hoard for myself and sort of undertook

28
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:23,519
this project of getting this space

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,640
trying to turn it into a something new

30
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,879
that isn't easily categorized you know

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,079
and I always had the idea of making it a

32
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:32,679
gallery space and so this really was our

33
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,118
the birth of our Gallery we've been here

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,560
a year and a half and this was our first

35
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,920
show and it was the birth of the melting

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,240
point I couldn't think of a better theme

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,920
to have uh to start have started us out

38
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:45,718
with so tell me what the intention was

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,000
in bringing all of these Glass artists

40
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:50,078
in their work together why did you want

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,399
to do that specifically um well that's

42
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,879
directly related to um a relationship I

43
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,640
have with marble Slinger the glass

44
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,039
blower so um me and him have been

45
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,599
talking about this I mean really we've

46
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,599
talked about this for years and a year

47
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,559
ago

48
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,759
um in combination with me getting this

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,118
space and not knowing a name and all

50
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,280
these different things over a year ago

51
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,199
now there was a showdown in San

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,199
Francisco at a gallery called the

53
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,439
melting point gallery and it was a it

54
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,199
was a pipe show and I had I wasn't able

55
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,400
to go I'm not allowed down in the US but

56
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,159
I had I saw pictures and a little bit of

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,959
video of the show and it it really

58
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,840
inspired me I mean the name inspired me

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,319
so much that I called the gallery

60
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,120
melting point Gallery so that was a big

61
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,318
part of the inspiration and then just uh

62
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,840
my relationship with marble Slinger and

63
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,439
uh the last few years have just been

64
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,439
sort of on a collision course for this

65
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,439
event to have happened you know he was

66
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,400
he was my inspiration and I think I was

67
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,000
kind of his inspiration and he really

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,680
wanted to show the people up here that

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,080
there's an entire community of glass

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
that we don't know about because there's

71
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,879
this border that keeps us divided like

72
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,598
I'm not allowed to go down there they're

73
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,399
afraid to come up here because they feel

74
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:56,318
that when they go to the Border they're

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,920
they're offering themselves up to the to

76
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,679
the chopping block even when they're not

77
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,158
doing anything wrong so I mean that

78
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,000
that was kind of our inspiration right

79
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,919
there you know this is the first event

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,878
of its kind in Canada which is very

81
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,719
exciting I think so I mean I'm I'm I'm

82
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:11,280
not everywhere in Canada at all times

83
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,959
but I haven't heard of such an event

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,519
happening and I mean honestly I'm a

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,000
glass collector and I know a lot about

86
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,400
the glass Community some of these pieces

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,158
blew my mind absolutely blew my mind the

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,760
themes the concepts the construction

89
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:29,438
okay so here's the tough question mark

90
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:31,519
which is your favorite piece oh almost

91
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:34,560
imp possible to answer because there are

92
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,360
so many different themes you know I like

93
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,360
so many different pieces in the show for

94
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,519
so many different reasons uh the first

95
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,599
piece to to come in was the Jason Lee

96
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,840
which was the that incredible motorcycle

97
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:49,199
piece that was actually a combo of of

98
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,280
Jason Lee and uh Steve hops I believe

99
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,958
was his name and they did an absolutely

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,120
outstanding job really I mean it was the

101
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,560
first piece to show up and we opened it

102
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,239
up and we see this this motorcycle and

103
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,799
it just blew the top of every 's heads

104
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,799
off it made us realize that this show is

105
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,319
going to be impeccable so also um the

106
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,920
Amber piece the DJ right behind us here

107
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,679
the DJ and the break dancer is just I

108
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,039
mean it doesn't you know words don't

109
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,400
even need to describe it you just need

110
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,279
to see a little bit of a picture of it

111
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,239
or see it in in real life and it's so

112
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,519
accurate and with the jewelry added on

113
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,239
to the to the pieces and little things

114
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:28,319
like gluing a little tiny curly strap

115
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,519
from the headphone down to the turntable

116
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,839
every detail was was perfect I I really

117
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,599
enjoy that piece a lot you totally

118
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,319
successfully wiggled out of my very

119
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,160
tough question so I'm going to ask it

120
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,399
again in a different way if you could

121
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,840
choose one of these pieces to add to

122
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:49,159
your collection um as um a smoking

123
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,399
device is something that you're you know

124
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,160
inhaling your favorite resin through so

125
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,239
we'll narrow the categories a little bit

126
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,600
so as a puffing piece which one would

127
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,280
you choose to add to your personal

128
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,400
collection I mean really that is so

129
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,638
difficult to answer it there's there's

130
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:06,638
multiple pieces that I the max piece is

131
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,918
so impressive to have that I mean you

132
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,560
really you hold that in your hand and

133
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,319
you feel that you could really take over

134
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,560
a small third world country with that

135
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,199
pipe like a like a gauntlet holding it

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,360
up in front of the people it's uh it it

137
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:24,840
it could be the one but honestly the the

138
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:27,080
Amber the the max um there's there's so

139
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,879
many that I love it's hard to choose a

140
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:31,240
favorite honestly the Jason Lee they're

141
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,000
all great the artist all did an

142
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,680
impeccable job and honestly if I had the

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,839
cash I'd buy every single one of them

144
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,840
and then I would have a pipe party where

145
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,799
we would hit every single one of them if

146
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,719
I had my way what do you think was the

147
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,319
greatest success of the opening of the

148
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,800
show last night um I think it was a

149
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,680
combination of things I think it was

150
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,918
just you know the artists showing up and

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,720
really being positively pumped to have a

152
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,359
venue to be able to display their art

153
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,560
which is now a criminalized industry

154
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,360
down in America where they live the fact

155
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,839
that we really topped it off with the

156
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,919
living raw foods we had the outside

157
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:06,399
access with the fire twirlers like it

158
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,439
just seemed to always keep getting

159
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,918
better and for me I I didn't even plan

160
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:12,199
it all my you know like a lot of it was

161
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,120
planned by my manager dandi and Aaron

162
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,360
had components we were all compon

163
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,918
components that were compartmentalized

164
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,000
almost up to the very end where we just

165
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,519
sort of went click click click click

166
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,879
click click click like Lego and put them

167
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,519
all together so everyone did their part

168
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,719
and played their part impeccably and I

169
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,959
think that's what made it go off as well

170
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,759
as it did yeah so a couple of people

171
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:37,159
have used the word movement around um

172
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,280
this art and can you explain to me what

173
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:44,599
that means to you in terms of this art

174
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:46,119
and these um pipe making artists um

175
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:47,478
being being a part of a movement what

176
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,800
are we moving towards where are we

177
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:52,680
moving from well you know what I think

178
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,280
we're we're really this pipe art is

179
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,720
really um sort of a Frontline for

180
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,279
cannabis activism I mean a lot of these

181
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,840
guys have been in spired by cannabis but

182
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,519
they are not allowed to come out of the

183
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,638
closet with it because down in America

184
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,799
just admitting that condemns your work

185
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,720
so you know they don't they're in a

186
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,478
they're really they're in a they're in a

187
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,240
place where they need to make their

188
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:18,598
decisions based on fear and I think part

189
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,439
of the word movement is to try and you

190
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:23,038
know remove fear from your emotional

191
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,759
vocabulary step up out of the fear and

192
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,439
that's what I mean man these guys are

193
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,038
making these pieces any every day it

194
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,240
sounds ridiculous to you guys out there

195
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:32,079
but literally they can they can get

196
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,038
arrested and thrown in jail they can be

197
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,478
fined thousands of dollars they can

198
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:38,399
spend months in jail for blowing glass

199
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,918
pipes that have no traces of resin in

200
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,318
them but merely for sending it over an

201
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,839
imaginary line that was just put up to

202
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,759
divide us just to create more division

203
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:51,560
just to fill jails so it's neat that

204
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:54,280
Canada bordering America can be the

205
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,240
venue for these guys to come up you know

206
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,878
it was uh very much the same for the um

207
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,918
the modern artists who were fleeing

208
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,158
Germany and the Nazi Germany time 37 in

209
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:07,240
Berlin fleeing into Amsterdam and having

210
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:10,918
these incredible

211
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,598
um squats these huge art buildings that

212
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,478
there's a few old ones in Amsterdam that

213
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,360
have famous names but these people were

214
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,719
fleeing there to just save themselves

215
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,800
and save their art the the fact that

216
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,680
these guys make pipes is an expression

217
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,120
of their freedom and their it's being

218
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,360
condemned where they live so anytime you

219
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,720
do that it's uh it's a big deal and

220
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,639
that's why the word movement comes comes

221
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,158
in they're they're a movement and

222
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,479
they've got to lift themselves up really

223
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,759
what I want to do with all this is I

224
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,959
want to start stop the divisions we

225
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,759
constantly divide ourselves even even as

226
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,679
a community of pip blowers we can Divi

227
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,559
divide ourselves and and put ourselves

228
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,838
into little balls and it I just like to

229
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,439
break the bubbles get things out into

230
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,160
the mainstream and show people that this

231
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,000
really is

232
00:08:54,159 --> 00:09:00,439
Art it really is thank you you did a

233
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,039

around a little bit so that we could

249
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,559
chat today the day

250
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,919
after um I want to start by you telling

251
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,000
me about this insanely beautiful piece

252
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,838
here tell me exactly what it is and what

253
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,120
it means to you and anything else that

254
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,680
you want to say um this is a piece is

255
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,799
called arity I made it in uh

256
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:55,039
2003 um

257
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,359
it's well you can see the tag here it

258
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,679
says an artistic cycle describing the

259
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,600
evolution of a medium from its Inception

260
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,679
through necessary function to a pure

261
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,360
expression for its own sake and it's

262
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:10,199
kind of about a human uh every time

263
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,120
humans get a hold of a technology it's

264
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,200
usually just a matter of time before

265
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,720
they turn it towards artistic expression

266
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,759
and some

267
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,600
technologies actually get turned to a

268
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:24,519
point where the artistic expression is

269
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,079
the primary purpose of utilizing the

270
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,120
technology and that's kind of what this

271
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,078
piece is about is it's a you know you've

272
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,639
got this sand and people from Sand they

273
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:36,559
started working with glass and glass was

274
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,720
natural for preserving food and for

275
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,958
making bowls and functional objects of

276
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,600
all kinds and so moving through that

277
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,958
people started making these functional

278
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,240
objects and then they started

279
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,319
making they started decorating them to

280
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,320
make them fancier and stuff and it

281
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,560
eventually at some point with glass it

282
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,959
became the function became the

283
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,759
decoration rather than the vessel and

284
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,239
the first first place or the glass

285
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,838
article and so that's kind of what this

286
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,399
is about is it's like there's all these

287
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,399
things you can make a bubbler you can

288
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,839
make a goblet you can make a bowl you

289
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,120
can make a distilling apparatus for a

290
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,880
science for a pharmaceutical company but

291
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,639
then you can also take the same medium

292
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:22,278
and make this thing that has no purpose

293
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:26,000
other than to communicate or

294
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:27,799
to fulfill my fancy as a maker and who

295
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,240
is this

296
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,919
creature um I I wouldn't say that it's

297
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,399
so much of a who I mean it's kind of

298
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,559
a you know a

299
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,159
phoenix Phoenix Rising sort of an entity

300
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:44,399
you know it's a it's an energy creature

301
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:47,639
it's a being um I don't know that it is

302
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,000
personality for and when you started a

303
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,440
project like this did you know like did

304
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,879
you already have a vision in mind of

305
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,800
what it was going to turn out or does it

306
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,120
get a life of its own and and grow into

307
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:01,240
something other than what you thought it

308
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,240
was going to between start and finish

309
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,319
what I usually do is I just I come up

310
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:10,838
with an idea like something I want to do

311
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:14,519
with it before I come up with a form so

312
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:17,160
for this piece I was interested in kind

313
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,320
of conveying an idea before I was

314
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:23,198
interested in making a form per se and

315
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,399
so it's

316
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:28,319
um it's can be a harder way to go

317
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
because you have to you come up with

318
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,360
this thought this something that's worth

319
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,120
spending all this time CU it takes it

320
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,919
took us three months and thousands of

321
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,759
dollars to be able to make this so to

322
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,519
take all that time and all that energy

323
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,559
and just do something that might that

324
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,799
doesn't really have anything behind it

325
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,518
that's just a thing just doesn't it

326
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,120
doesn't seem worth it to take all that

327
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,278
time and energy so we always try and

328
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,120
have a an idea going before we even

329
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:56,639
start melting glass and usually before

330
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,399
we even start drawing

331
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,759
form that's stunning I'm glad that you

332
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,879
spent the time and the resources because

333
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,679
it's totally

334
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:09,240
mindblowing so last night was a pretty

335
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:11,198
amazing night and I'm wondering as an

336
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,720
artist what the significance of last

337
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:17,719
night was to you um it was it was

338
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,759
definitely a good time I mean you know

339
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,000
it's really nice to get this piece out

340
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,639
and uh have you know have people see it

341
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,278
and appreciate it you know the the art

342
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,198
has to be seen if it's not seen then

343
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:32,519
it's just my as well not exist in the

344
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:35,278
first place and so every opportunity I

345
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,078
get to get it out there and have people

346
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,879
experience it the way that I do or part

347
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,239
you know start to you know have that

348
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,759
experience with it it's really I like to

349
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,039
see that I like to have people get that

350
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:49,159
chance

351
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:54,639
to to see it thank you for bringing this

352
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:57,240
Beast up um in your uh in your Homeland

353
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,560
down there in you know what to us as

354
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,519
Canadian seems like you know Land Of

355
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:04,599
Darkness although I know there are some

356
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,120
very bright spots has the environment

357
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,120
that you work in changed significantly

358
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,039
with you know Ashcraft and all of the

359
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,320
sort of bad guy Crackdown on the on the

360
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,799
pipes programs that's happening or is it

361
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,000
a little bit further out there are you

362
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,078
feeling the impacts in in your work and

363
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,198
in your environment I think it's you

364
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,078
know honestly it's a

365
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:27,879
really long-term thing like I don't feel

366
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:30,599
that there's been this like huge shift

367
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:35,159
in the recent past I mean things

368
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,639
happened and some people were uh their

369
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:38,360
businesses were confiscated and they

370
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,600
were taken to jail but that's also

371
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,240
something that's been going on steadily

372
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,440
in the states and around other other

373
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,480
countries for a long time and it's more

374
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,920
a matter

375
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:55,839
of a cycle of um this because it's a

376
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:57,639
gray area and because it's sort of a a

377
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,399
semi Market it

378
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,440
has just sort of a mixed bag of

379
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,159
attributes that are in some ways helpful

380
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,720
to the independent artist in some ways

381
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,360
not I mean for instance one of the

382
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,639
things that's really

383
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,120
helpful about it being semi Market is

384
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,278
that no there aren't corporations with a

385
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,078
lot of money to just walk in and take

386
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:21,958
over the market for instance

387
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:23,799
um with a clothing company like for

388
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,119
instance seedless you've got this

389
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,799
seedless company and they're making all

390
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,679
their their clothes and stuff but at

391
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,318
some point

392
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,799
a company with overseas connections to

393
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:37,159
have all this stuff made can walk in and

394
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,599
just either try and forcibly buy the

395
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:42,480
company and take over that brand and

396
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,879
turn it into like part of the corporate

397
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,000
Juggernaut whereas with the glass pipes

398
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,078
that's much harder to do because of the

399
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,958
legal issues a company with that much to

400
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,719
lose and that much investment can never

401
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,159
take that course of action you know

402
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,920
that's not going to happen the same way

403
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,679
and so it's kind of leaves room for the

404
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,318
little guy for the whole time so it's

405
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:08,159
it's definitely a mixed thing that it's

406
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:08,159
hard to really like completely

407
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,039
um I just don't like to have a totally

408
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,120
negative outlook on it on anything for

409
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,278
that matter but see the opportunities

410
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,120
and just about anything exactly because

411
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,759
there's the world is messed up anyway so

412
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,560
you know you have to just look at what

413
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,318
is really there and op capitalize on

414
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,758
what's there whatever it

415
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:31,078
is so how long have you been blowing

416
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,959
glass class for Al together uh just

417
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:36,879
about 10 years so in that time you have

418
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:39,159
invested yourself into a huge amount of

419
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,559
Art and incredible pieces that have now

420
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:44,000
been spread out in the world that are

421
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:46,679
off in other people's homes and if there

422
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
was one piece that you've made that's

423
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:52,278
made its way out there in the world that

424
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,159
you could have back which one would it

425
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:59,720
be and

426
00:16:55,159 --> 00:17:02,240
why the one piece that I I would like to

427
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,798
have back never actually left my

428
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,279
possession you've got it I've still got

429
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:10,199
it that it's very good Forward Thinking

430
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:14,000
nice SP yeah no it was a it's a fish

431
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,199
2000 I made it for the fish show that

432
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,720
they had at Big Cypress in Florida it

433
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,279
was a New Year's show and it was about

434
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,838
God I forget how many people were there

435
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:27,000
40,000 people or something but we got

436
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,599
there and it's uh it was the first piece

437
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,038
where I'd been working on these other

438
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:32,599
pieces that are around here there's

439
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:34,480
number one the over there and this is

440
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:37,079
number

441
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,558
three this is some pieces from that time

442
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:44,519
frame this is about 1999 hold it nice

443
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:46,678
and still so like this piece was

444
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,599
um built in

445
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,280
1999 it's called number three at first I

446
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,798
was numbering these uh fancy aquatic

447
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:57,480
pieces um they were I'd been

448
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:00,279
experimenting with large scale stuff

449
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,519
for maybe half a year or something but I

450
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:06,158
was really kind of uh holding my punches

451
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,960
on the pattern work a little bit to

452
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:09,919
because they're so risky to make the

453
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,798
technical process of joining so many

454
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,880
parts was difficult so I wanted to have

455
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,639
minimum amount of work in the pieces so

456
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,840
that when they broke which they did on a

457
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,360
regular basis they would it wouldn't be

458
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,839
such a big deal and when I got confident

459
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,119
with the construction I started making

460
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:26,879
these bigger and elaborately decorated

461
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,558
pieces like that one over there is

462
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,200
number one in the case and then this one

463
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,839
here is number three but anyways at the

464
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,360
end of 99 I decided to make fish 2000

465
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:40,759
and I'd seen my first fish show earlier

466
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:43,439
that year and uh it

467
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,679
um after my first fish show I was all

468
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,440
stoked on this on this band I was like

469
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,960
oh these guys are just great I love what

470
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,798
they're doing with the crowd and with

471
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,798
the energy and like getting everyone

472
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:56,918
involved and so I um spent like a month

473
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,480
trying to figure out how to make a glass

474
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:01,880
piece that was going to repres present

475
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,798
this thing that I had seen this con

476
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,320
concert and so it was like this long

477
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,839
process of all kinds of like couch

478
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,359
meditations and just like really I spent

479
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:15,038
all this time thinking about it finally

480
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:17,678
came up with the design and uh executed

481
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,158
this thing it was like I barely finished

482
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,759
it in time to get on the plane I was

483
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:24,520
literally warm in my suitcase getting

484
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,200
ready to go had been scheduled to go

485
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:27,839
home to my parents house for Christmas

486
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,360
and I just couldn't get on the plane to

487
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,959
go there cuz I had to finish this piece

488
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:36,000
it was just

489
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,919
like it was nuts but it's um it ended up

490
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,880
being a cluster of dolphins spiraling

491
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,759
around each other there's five six

492
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,799
dolphins in it plus a bunch of fish and

493
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:49,919
it's a bubbler that hangs on the wall

494
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:51,558
it's really terrible that I don't have

495
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,480
it or a picture I could probably Supply

496
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:59,720
a picture for you if you need it um but

497
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,200
it's you know tall the Dolphins are each

498
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,679
dolphin is decorated with a different

499
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,519
color of dichroic and then they're

500
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,880
joined and they're dancing in front of a

501
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,440
spiral that has five different colors

502
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,520
dichroic one for each dolphin and

503
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,200
they're spiraling together and the

504
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,038
dolphins that are hooked together the

505
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,519
sections that are hooking each dolphin

506
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:23,279
together is that same

507
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,480
spiral tube stock with each of the five

508
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,720
colors so each of the energies is

509
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,880
represented going through as these

510
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,440
dolphins are like spinning around and it

511
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,200
was I was going through I mean it was

512
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,320
just amazing at the

513
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,159
show uh we were just puffing that thing

514
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:42,038
so tough cuz we got to the fish show and

515
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,640
there was no no one had anything to

516
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:46,679
relax with there's no herb anywhere they

517
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,799
just like it just ended up being this

518
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:54,080
crazy puff session the whole time like I

519
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:55,798
have no idea how many people experienced

520
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:59,119
that piece but it was it must have been

521
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:03,918
a thousand at least wow I mean

522
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:06,558
and you hung on to it um H is that piece

523
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,640
not up here because it's been used and

524
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,599
so you didn't want to bring it across

525
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,600
the border um it's not up here because

526
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,319
there wasn't time for me to prepare it

527
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:17,839
to cross the border yeah so yeah I mean

528
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:19,720
it's it's definitely you know plus it's

529
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,158
become so valuable to me that it

530
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,880
Crossing International bord something

531
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,600
that can't be done in a hurry it's not

532
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,960
that I'm scared of it but you know you

533
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,199
have to be got to be careful exactly

534
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,120
yeah

535
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,038
so what is next for you you know like

536
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:36,558
this piece here seems to me like it

537
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:39,400
would represent sort of a pinnacle thus

538
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:42,319
far in your path as an artist do you

539
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,919
have ideas of where you want to go next

540
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,519
um I mean I just keep wanting to make

541
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,120
more of these more of these large pieces

542
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,519
and um installations and stuff I'm

543
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:55,158
really looking for I have some ideas to

544
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:57,960
make some pieces with several uh figures

545
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:02,000
or Sentinels like this size in like

546
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:06,038
arrangement to fill fill a space or

547
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,159
cover a room or something like a

548
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:12,839
different thought about making a piece

549
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,840
with the like

550
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:19,519
um I I see these guys as kind of like

551
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:22,839
Sentinels or Warriors or you know people

552
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,759
entities that are in doing battle or

553
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:27,199
whatever so I I kind of want to like

554
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:31,038
arrange some of these guys with like you

555
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:35,240
know in a line like a formation and then

556
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:38,158
have like the black hordes of like you

557
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,640
know scorpions and just like worms and

558
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,400
you know I've been doing some really

559
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,840
like dark experimental stuff with like

560
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,919
really buggy looking forms and stuff so

561
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:49,759
I kind of want to bring them to br br

562
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:53,200
together exactly together the dark and

563
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,240
the light exactly well thank you for

564
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,000
your incredible work and for taking your

565
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,000
time this morning and hopefully you'll

566
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,440
come up to Vancouver and place some more

567
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,839
you know you make it up here once in a

568
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,840
while I do thank you thank you

569
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,679
nice good

570
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,278
enough Max yes welcome to Vancouver

571
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,120
thank you so the crazy piece in there

572
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:18,079
that you blew I never seen anything like

573
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,199
that

574
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:23,079
before what what was the inspiration

575
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,159
behind that beast and what do you call

576
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:27,720
it and what is it and tell me a little

577
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:30,400
bit about it well uh I make a lot of

578
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,440
pieces that that are similar to that and

579
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,080
uh I guess I kind of think of them as

580
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,600
some kind of like a a lightning storm or

581
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:42,240
a thunderstorm type of theme

582
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:44,959
um I think my inspiration is probably

583
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,880
just growing up in the Northwest and you

584
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,319
know I feel like my glass is kind of a

585
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,360
representation of uh you know like the

586
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:55,678
nature and all that you know it's kind

587
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:58,678
of how I see the world uh put into glass

588
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,759
so I guess that's

589
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,038
part of the inspiration at least how

590
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:04,640
long does it take to create something

591
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,079
like that like how many hours of work

592
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,840
are we talking about there uh I'd say

593
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:12,079
that there's roughly like a 100 hours in

594
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,079
there but there's time you know there's

595
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:17,119
sitting and waiting or you know uh time

596
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,720
that it takes to heat up you can only

597
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,158
hold a piece that big for a certain

598
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,120
amount of time so uh you know it took me

599
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,880
about two weeks from start to finish

600
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:29,079
doing 10hour days and how does it puff

601
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,520
does it does it can you smoke out of it

602
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,720
does it smoke

603
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:36,839
well is a more of a looker it's 100%

604
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,278
functional um but you know it's also

605
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,158
just an art piece you know uh it's never

606
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,159
been

607
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,880
smoked

608
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,278
and that's a little easier to travel

609
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,520
over International borders to get it

610
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,960
into shows that way it is easier you

611
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:57,200
know FedEx likes it better when it's

612
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:59,759
clean so uh totally um how is it for you

613
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,798
being a glass blower in America now that

614
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,798
you're starting to turn into Mordor down

615
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:06,759
there you know you're in like the the

616
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:08,839
land of the the dark and oppressive I

617
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:10,798
know that glass blowers are potentially

618
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:13,398
under a hell of a lot more pressure and

619
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,398
facing a lot more risk than they used to

620
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:17,519
yeah how is that for you in your world

621
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:19,079
and how's it changed like what are the

622
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,599
risks that you're facing now compared to

623
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:22,720
what you were a year ago or two years

624
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:26,038
ago well you know it's it's just a lot

625
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,079
different um before I don't think there

626
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:32,200
were any potential risks you know it's a

627
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:34,158
it was a non-issue and now I guess uh

628
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,360
there's certain States and even

629
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,760
federally uh people are saying it's

630
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,879
illegal to make

631
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:43,000
paraphernalia um which is kind of absurd

632
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,399
you know I view what we do as something

633
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,599
Beyond just paraphernalia you know if

634
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:48,879
you look at a lot of the pipes and

635
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,398
especially the pipe that you were just

636
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,840
talking about I think uh you know it's

637
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:56,599
beyond a functional level of art glass

638
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:59,038
it's something that um would not be

639
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:00,879
marketed to Children you you know it's

640
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,720
things that uh you know it's something

641
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,320
that you would see in a stock broker's

642
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,360
house or something yeah

643
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:11,119
absolutely um so what are the what are

644
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:13,119
the actual risks now to or or sort of

645
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:16,199
not so much the risks but the the

646
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,239
threats that of of what they could do to

647
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,759
glass blowers like I hate to dig for the

648
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,480
scandal of stories like do you know any

649
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,079
stories of glass blowers that have been

650
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,240
sort of facing nasty things recently

651
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,720
I've never personally met a glass blower

652
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,319
that's gotten in trouble blowing glass

653
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:36,159
um at least in Washington State uh you

654
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:38,960
have to you know intend it as

655
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,840
paraphernalia um for it to be considered

656
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,720
paraphernalia and so that's kind of a

657
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:46,759
fine line I think uh you know a lot of

658
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,640
police and Washington have seen glass uh

659
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:52,720
you know and not confiscated it you know

660
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:57,360
they appreciated his art I think you

661
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,319
know the laws passed by uh you know the

662
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,759
administration in the states right now

663
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:05,278
and Ashcraft you know it's uh it's not

664
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:08,158
something that represents the country as

665
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:11,319
a whole you know it's a it's a small

666
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,720
minority that thinks that way and uh

667
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:15,960
they happen to be the ones that have the

668
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,919
power at this point yeah so um have you

669
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,679
had your pieces in a show like this

670
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:23,679
before like a proper art show no this is

671
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,679
uh the most properly I'd say they've

672
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,200
ever been displayed um most galleries in

673
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:31,399
the states are afraid to bring in

674
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,519
something that could be construed as

675
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:36,278
paraphernalia

676
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,278
um so yeah this is the first time

677
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:40,200

767
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,200
real rough sketches and

768
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:19,479
um I really don't I can't really offer

769
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,240
much explanation for it it's just

770
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,120
something that I I made and I worked

771
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,480
through probably was about um a month in

772
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,839
the making just like different parts

773
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,519
that I'd make and I I knew it was all

774
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,638
coming together I didn't know EX L how

775
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,480
but um it was like a real rough sketch

776
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:37,000
and then made parts

777
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,360
and it's so stunning it's totally

778
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,200
stunning do you find that there's a

779
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:46,240
market for your nonm smokable

780
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:50,399
pieces that the one pipe that I have in

781
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:54,278
here is the second like

782
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:56,398
real pipe that I've made um bubblers

783
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:58,638
it's the second bubbler that I've made

784
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,119
and uh I made it

785
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:02,638
I made it for

786
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:04,359
myself and so I don't really have a

787
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:06,439
market as is right now I don't have a

788
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:09,319
market at all selling pipes because I

789
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,120
don't make them but I sell a lot of

790
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:13,879
vessels and some sculpture that I make

791
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,239
mostly like mostly vessels with

792
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,120
different

793
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:22,359
um different cane worked sections and

794
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,719
like I make teapots I make te- bowls um

795
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:26,519
I make teapots that you can put on the

796
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,278
stove and boil water with I make wine

797
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,599
glasses I make um I wish that we had a

798
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,200
teapot of yours here I would love to see

799
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,558
you when your teapot probably happen

800
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,960
that'll probably happen I need to

801
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:40,558
uh I'm I'm working on finding more um

802
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,038
venues to show my work and I'm really

803
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:45,918
excited about this gallery and this show

804
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:48,638
in particular um and really for me to

805
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,880
kind of to be in this is it's a little

806
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:52,439
bit uh it's different because like it's

807
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,399
it's a it's a movement that's been

808
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,038
happening for a little while and um and

809
00:33:55,398 --> 00:34:01,678
just like I guess I'm just in the show

810
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:03,679
because I made a pipe um it's cool and

811
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,240
I'm really I'm really excited about it

812
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,480
and I'm just excited about it I don't

813
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,039
know that's awesome yeah it seems to be

814
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,398
sort of a common theme that everybody's

815
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:14,800
really thrilled to be showcased as an

816
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:17,039
artist rather than next to the Rolling

817
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,639

overdue it's is really deserved this is

819
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,039

820
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,759
here is an underground art movement

821
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:29,159
that's just now like starting to get

822
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,440
attention and it's gaining momentum um I

823
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:35,079
think it's I think it's amazing and the

824
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,398
world is just is ready to see this it's

825

something else

826
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:41,440
and I don't know maybe it won't ever get

827
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:44,519
like really large mainstream attention

828
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,000

892
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,160
the vibe and that height is going to

893
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,599

00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:24,838
money that will spend

897
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,119

of Marcel looking at guns I'm like

899
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:29,358

907
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,439
to point at anybody in a bad way I

908
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,118
really don't see that's part of the

909
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,960
entire deal though that's one of the

910
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,559
best start pointing at somebody you're

911
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,838
like that check that out is that you

912
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,920
rais your whole life not to point

913
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:10,759
absolutely it's great you see how

914
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,280
uncomfortable I've already made you I

915
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,480
love it that's the whole what was the

916
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,440
idea you were saying about the Smoking

917
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,199
Gun part of your statement there it you

918
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,039
see your friends yeah check check out

919
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:24,279
Chris is our buddy look at

920
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:26,119
him what the [ __ ] is that why would I

921
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:30,240
put my mouth on a [ __ ] gun and

922
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:33,039
smoking out here you see how it works it

923
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,039
works so

924
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,079
well let me see that

925
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:55,079
thing so what is that is that a pipe I

926
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,240
like the way this one fits that

927
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,240
one it's a gun

928
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,519
why did you make a glass

929
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:08,920
gun that's a pipe to make people help

930
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:10,920
really so is it more did you make that

931
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,880
more as an art piece or more as just a

932
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,280
functional pipe it's a performance piece

933
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,280
how does it

934
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:21,358
work and

935
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,720
then how does the performance part of it

936
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:28,119
works you shoot yourself I think it's

937
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:30,159
interesting the way people hand the

938
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:32,240
you see the performance

939
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,879
involved it just shoot it at your

940
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:37,399
buddies and everything yeah gun your

941
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,760
friends down turn weapon on so what does

942
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,280
that to do with smoking what does that

943
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,680
to do with herbs and smoking why a gun

944
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,319
why why are you gunning your friends out

945
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:46,358
with a pipe why is it a pipe why you

946
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:47,800
need that part of the performance

947
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:49,960
there's not a pipe you won't stick it in

948
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,440
your mouth and you won't have the the

949
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,639
discomfort Associated watching people

950
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,679

951
00:41:54,639 --> 00:42:00,639

of let me ask you ham about your

957
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:16,480
motivation behind rebirth through

958
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:20,119
scavenger

959
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,119
tree what's up with that

960
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:25,880
piece yeah did you see the what do you

961
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,598
want you want the story or what yeah

962
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,760
what's here whatever why up with that

963
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,760
piece it's a pipe it's a sculpture what

964
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,400
I don't know it's a tree it's a

965
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,760
scavenger tree and it's found a pile of

966
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,480
some for gotten dead bones and it's

967
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:42,440
consuming them hungrily gly and it's

968
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,480
eating its bones but see the bones are

969
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,679
clean and there's no guilt associated

970
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,838
with these Bon tree didn't kill anything

971
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:50,399
it's just a

972
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:53,119
scavenger but through its consumption of

973
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:58,280
the bones it's

974
00:42:53,119 --> 00:43:00,640
uh it's causing the regrowth of

975
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,079
Man Bones it was but the guy is trying

976
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,558
to break

977
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:10,000
free he's struggling to get out of the

978
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:10,000
very thing that's uh leading to his

979
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:15,400
rebirth so what about the bowl and the

980
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,559
carb and the mouthpiece and the fact you

981
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,480
can smoke out of it why why make that

982
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:22,400
sculpture a pipe to express that what

983
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:26,159
does the pipe aspect have to do with it

984
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,160
you have to use it in

985
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:33,519
sitting on so is it meant to

986
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:33,519
function

987
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:41,159
ceremoni what about these other

988
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,880
pieces those pieces are old I don't

989
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:43,879
remember those

990
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:50,358
pieces what do you think of that Jason

991
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,960
leaes I think it's so cool look at it

992
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:56,598
it's awesome why is it cool

993
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,039
though because it's a thing not just a

994
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:59,039
bip

995
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:02,039
why why let me ask a question in terms

996
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,200
of your glass expressing yourself

997
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,558
through glass why bother making pipes

998
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:07,799
why bother why a pipe if you want to

999
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:09,519
exchange if you want to pass stuff

1000
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,800
around why not why not make it a goblet

1001
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:14,679
why not uh why is that the function cuz

1002
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:18,920
who else is so enthusiastic about cool

1003
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:21,358
glass then then people want to buy

1004
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:24,039
p

1005
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:27,199
no who else is so

1006
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:28,558
enthusiastic I don't know

1007
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:30,480
so like how did you get into blowing

1008
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,680
glass because of pipes

1009
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,920
or no I saw some guy at a county fair or

1010
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:40,318
something when I was like 11 years

1011
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,318
old and I knew that I was going to blow

1012
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,839
glass and so when did when did just

1013
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,680
start blowing glass like when the first

1014
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:48,679
time you ever put

1015
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:54,960
it I got a little butane torch once when

1016
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,880
I was about like 16 or something or 15

1017
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:01,000
