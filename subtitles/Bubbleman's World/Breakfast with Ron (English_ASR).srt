18
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,439

00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:03,558
years old and I was just starting my

20
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:06,599

21
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:08,399
little sick and I had heard rumors about

22
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,280

him before I went and asked for his help

40
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,640
and seeing these light bulbs just

41
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,478

00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,000
circles oh yeah yeah what did the police

51
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:19,079
think about all that uh they didn't like

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,680
it they they came and told me to they

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,680
didn't tell me they said listen we know

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,920
we can't stop you from doing it but uh

55
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,280
if you continue to do it say you get a

56
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:30,598
Breakin in your place we won't be able

57
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,280
to respond because we'll be blind

58
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:34,560
so uh maybe you could just do something

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,840
about it and uh or else we could uh or

60
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,120
we could park a police car in front of

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,280
your store your H your power store and

62

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,400
went there before and saw they did for

67
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,560
an hour or two once but they told me

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,280
they were going to bring a bus down one

69
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,959

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,800

71
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,640
there was in a park in front of my place

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,760
and leave it there and really like not

73
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:59,318
that you were like a really bad dude but

74
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,280
you just didn't have a good relationship

75
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:02,598
with those guys well no no no pot didn't

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,598
have a good relationship I didn't have

77
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,318
it either but I think I was had not a

78
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:08,679
bad relationship well they hated that

79
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,719
you loved pot if I could put it any more

80
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,640
simply than that do you know what I mean

81
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,318
they hated that you loved pot yes and it

82
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:21,598
was Winnipeg and not only did you love

83
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:24,919
it you see you seem to like educate and

84
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:27,479
execute pot better than most by what I

85
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,199
mean by that is like how well you grew

86
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,318
it how much you grew it and how many

87
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,679
people you T poot to grow it you know

88
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,119
this is why Mark emry is sitting in

89
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,920
prison right now in Mississippi he loves

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,920
it we both love it because he loves it

91
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,679
to a point where he not only wants to

92
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,399
share the information it got to the

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,400
point where Mark stepped to the next

94
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,400
level and was selling the beans you know

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,680
so many people have harshed on Mark

96
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,760
saying that um you know they've

97
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,159
criticized him oh he sold seeds and it

98
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,639
was a huge ripoff and he was um uh you

99
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:58,280
know making millions of dollars it's

100
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,438
like yes he sold seeds that were

101
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,199
extremely expensive and he did make

102
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:04,719
millions of dollars but here's the

103
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:08,759
different part with Mark that you don't

104
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:11,120
hear with many others and that is that

105
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,560
Mark gave all his money away Mark never

106
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,079
bought himself anything fancy he never

107
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,759
you know bought himself a a house or a

108
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,040
car or anything he's just basically

109
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,000
lived in his modest

110
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,680
apartment and gave all that money to

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,560
often American Growers that had been

112
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,079
busted and needed money for bail to get

113
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,959
out needed help with lawyer fees um it's

114
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,680
kind of like when you go to an auction

115
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,719
and a silent auction and you pay more

116
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,519
for the item than you're supposed to you

117
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,520
don't leave and complain that the silent

118
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,359
auction ripped you off you know that you

119
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,599
supported something that the money went

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,879
to a good cause MH and that's kind of

121
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,199
with Mark that you have to really give

122
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,639
it up to him I mean he just gave and he

123
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,800
did it in the times of uh when when I

124
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,918
was doing it I'm I'm an old dude sure

125
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,000
and Mark was doing with what didn't mark

126
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,680
used to have a bookstore he did and then

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,918
his bookstore went to his interest went

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,680
to pot and then and but he was in our he

129
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,839
he did it in a rough time he was the

130
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,120
Pioneer oh yeah he's always been also

131
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,319
much like you in the sense like

132
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,918
just he's always gone a little Against

133
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:16,038
the Grain right when there was when

134
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:18,839
there was a garbage um uh strike in

135
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,959
Toronto uh back in the 80s Mark was the

136
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:24,758
one that organized hiring like scabs and

137
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:27,399
basically oh I found that hash awesome I

138
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,160
found the hash he fired scabs and I

139
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:32,120
can't remember the tonnage but he moved

140
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,080
tonnage of garbage to the dumps from the

141
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,199
city on those hot summer days where the

142
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:40,719
garbage was just going to cause sickness

143
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,478
and stench and all these you know like

144
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,639
we don't need that in our city he did

145
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,399
the same thing when he was told he

146
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,439
couldn't sell certain types of magazines

147
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,359
you know that got him into bongs and not

148
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,918
being allowed to sell bongs and cannabis

149
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,800
so hey it's definitely um it's all about

150
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,519
the love that's what it is my passion

151

165
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,279
making all their lives much much better

166
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,240
he's passing the word around all down

167
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,519
there you know what Adam Bowen wrote a

168
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,759
song and I I think it's called something

169
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,240
about the Tricom inside the Tricom or in

170
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:42,080
the song he writes about Mark Emory and

171
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,680
how he collected the fists or sorry the

172
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,279
fingers of activism and made them into a

173
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,720
fist sort of a metaphor that we were all

174
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,478
sort of apart and away and and he

175
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,000
congealed Us and got everyone to sort of

176
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:59,038
do stuff and in the song he sings Uncle

177
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,720
Sam has ingested marijuana in the form

178
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,478
of mar emry and he basically sayings

179
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,440
that that's going to affect it was

180
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,120
amazing cuz he basically wrote that if

181
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,680
if the United States inhaled Mark Emery

182
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,120
into their system that he was literally

183
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,560
marijuana and that they would

184
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,360
change that he would change their system

185
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,519
from within and you can honestly say the

186
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,560
prosecuting attorney who prosecuted Mark

187
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:26,318
Emery is the same man who a year and a

188
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,038
half later or 2 and 1 half years later

189
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,800
was the promoter of legalization in

190
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,878
Washington

191
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,240
if you can wrap your head around

192
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:41,280
that so maybe they did ingest marijuana

193
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,478
now we've seen Colorado bring legal

194
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:47,279
cannabis to market we've seen California

195
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,639
there's a variety of other Vermont and

196
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,359
so they were sort of validating that

197
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,879
Mark did get all this rock and rolling I

198
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,439
mean it's hard to say right but it is

199
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,680
pretty unique they're saying they're

200
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,959
saying it he was he wrote it in a song a

201
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,959
few years before it happened any anyways

202
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,839
right on from Mark we'll see him soon I

203
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,959
guess this

204
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,158

original powerful you know like just

256
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,839

smelling like a rose every time you saw

258
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,560

when she stepped away jod really kind of

263
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,239
stepped into that position and I never

264
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,039
thought anyone would be able to sort of

265
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,759
step into that position cuz Hillary

266
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,278
would just you know she would pull it

267
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,838

271
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:37,039
BC Compassion Club um we met her years

272
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:40,360
before that when she worked with Mark

273
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:42,759
emry at the original hemp BC and she was

274
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,360
probably 17 years old when we first met

275
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:46,600
Hillary so yeah very cool she sat in

276
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,879
your on your in your living room that

277
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,120
one day I said I want to start something

278
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,399
that have for compassion for people yeah

279
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,959
well I remember her saying she didn't

280
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,240
like the word medical and she didn't

281
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,638
like the word marijuana so she wanted to

282
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,360
call it uh Cannabis Compassion yeah and

283
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,079
so she was kind of thinking about moving

284
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,000
to San Francisco to live with Todd

285
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:07,120
McCormick another well-known cannabis

286
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
activist who she was um dating at the

287
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,600
time but she was having some

288
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,399
difficulties I had just moved to British

289
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,920
Columbia this was

290
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,839
1996

291
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:21,319
1996 yeah it was 1996 and so she decided

292
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,279
it was either move down with Todd which

293
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm very glad she didn't Todd ended up

294
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,000
getting arrested in that Fiasco they

295
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,440
were growing in a mansion in Bair a

296
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,039
couple of properties over from the

297
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,320
Reagans that was the the Peter

298
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:36,719
McWilliams um grow as well where Peter

299
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,720
McWilliams uh ended up passing away and

300
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,680
all of that due to not being able to

301
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,639
take cannabis for anti- edic he he

302
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,319
choked on his own vomit uh they had

303
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,839
taken his mom's home away and told him

304
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,320
that they were going to keep you know if

305
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,279
he smoked cannabis that that they

306
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,320
weren't going to be releasing his home

307
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:55,720
just a terrible story Todd did 5 years

308
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,000
on Terminal Island for that Renee B was

309
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,480
wanted for a 10-year sentence she had to

310
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,799
escape up to Canada that's that's when

311
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,519
Chris Bennett met her and so all these

312
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,159
things were happening it was uh it was

313
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,759
just a real crazy time and Hillary

314
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,679
literally I had just moved to British

315
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:11,360
Columbia from Manitoba Hillary was my

316
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,799
one friend and I was just like I was

317
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,320
right behind her to start her Compassion

318
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,240
Club idea and of course the BC

319
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,079
compassion club's been around for 18

320
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,240
years now um I was one of their first

321
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,479
Growers I was happy to support them with

322
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,560
cannabis often at a lower cost than I

323
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,600
could find cannabis for myself but it

324
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,039
was definitely something that uh it was

325
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,320
a good thing when the Cannabis

326
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,679
