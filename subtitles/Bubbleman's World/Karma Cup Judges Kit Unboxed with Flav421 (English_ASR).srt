unboxing video together he brought these

20
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:13,859

21
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:18,719
glass real quick this one's a defi with

22
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:22,109
a punchy disc flip inside some cold work

23
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,450
action and some EXO's ball or yeah EXO

24
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:25,890
sure yeah EXO ball yeah I think that's

25
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,728
definitely what we've been calling it

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,469
mhm

27
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,719
this one though which is one of my

28
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:34,650
personal favorites in my collection it

29
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,359
was made by Jake a couple years ago it's

30
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,780
one of the unmarked there's no m/s

31
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,759
markings on it at all whatsoever

32
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,340
it was made as an homage for his father

33
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,689
to demonstrate all the various

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,469
techniques that he had learned over the

35
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:50,728
years and his leaf pattern work here

36
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:52,200
which has always been some of my

37
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:55,228
favorite stuff I've belt buckles and

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,549
pendants buy them with these it's really

39
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:58,649
a special piece is one of the first

40
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,469
times it's ever been out photographed or

41
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,759
in video is the first time yeah the very

42
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:05,819
first time actually yes the very first

43
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,098
time it has ever been so I thought no

44
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,449
better person than to have mark come and

45
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,299
photograph it

46
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,639
and smoke out of it I appreciate that

47
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,080
and we have photographed it yes we have

48
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,719
not yet smoked out of barrel so we're

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,400
gonna do that soon maybe we'll have a

50
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,930
blast and then we'll get to unboxing

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,569
this video fabulous

52
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,610
why don't we do that wait no let's unbox

53
00:02:24,568 --> 00:02:28,259
this video and then then have a blast

54
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,239
because we're gonna have things to test

55
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:32,789
and I just noticed we have everything on

56
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,860
the table except resin yes and so we

57
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,150
could potentially we've got a box of it

58
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,680
right here I don't know there's herb

59
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,860
samples in here there's gonna be

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,319
probably co2 in butane edibles and I'm

61
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,209
hoping just a few solvent list entries

62
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:47,609
in which case I can have a few rips

63
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,110
myself well what for how the solvent

64
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,519
list movement new Canada has progressed

65
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,170
over the last number of years I can

66
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,670
pretty much guarantee that somebody has

67
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:55,199
entered some colonies all of us some

68
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:57,179
yeah no there yeah I would say even

69
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,889
though we did so we're gonna clean off

70
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,129

74
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,879

75
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:15,930
open it so kept it in a nice cool dark

76
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:18,180
spot in the cellar and now we're opening

gun as you can see that was a pretty

270
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,449
impressive pile of samples like a flap

271
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:18,159
was saying off camera you wouldn't be

272
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,560
upset if you're if you bought no no if

273
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,629
you had paid to be a part of this cup

274
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,119
and and that's what you received I would

275
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:26,769
be fully satisfied you know like really

276
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,659
like the amount of the amount of entries

277
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:32,169
is awesome the amount of schwag is like

278
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:34,149
over the top so I'm happy yeah

279
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:36,459
definitely happy and even with nine

280
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:38,019
solvent less entries I'm pretty it's

281
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,490
pretty good I'm not gonna complain so we

282
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:41,169
do have all the solvent las' entries

283
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,210
sitting in the center on an ice pack

284
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:45,459
it's gotten to be a pretty warm day the

285
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,650
glass is pretty hot and we just want to

286
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,269
make sure that we're kind of giving you

287
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:51,579
the best I can do that we can but not

288
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:58,480
sacrificing the quality of the product

289
00:14:51,580 --> 00:15:00,460
itself so oh yeah feel that this is

290
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,080
entry one solvent the century let's get

291
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,460
our little business

292
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,500
I'm guessing nine of them are gonna be

293
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,500
rosin the first row yeah I'm going to

294

pressed Keef that's trippy dude yeah

295
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:25,429
interesting right off the bat it doesn't

296
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:28,409
look as bad as I at first thought a

297
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:31,199
little bit like kind of old material oh

298
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:32,399
yeah yeah farmers great kif yeah for

299
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,070

300
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,429
puff no but maybe we'll come back to

301
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,080
that

302
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:38,819
yeah there's number one yeah it looks

303
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,540
like a tumbled single screen here

304
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:45,570
farmer's grade sift will go into number

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,110
it be funny if we just like the thing

307
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,450
where we just sort of like we're not

308
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,970
popping any of this this is all but

309
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:57,000
we're also like it it looks also like

310
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,480
it's a lake it's oppressive chief oh

311
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,850

313
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:11,540
it is yeah you're right a little doctor

314
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,539

315
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,329
I'll take a picture of it so you guys

316
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:24,679
can see what we're talking about

317
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:24,680
yes yes yes obviously that's pretty good

318
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,549
looks a little furry doesn't look melty

319
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,190
no I'm gonna put that one to the side as

320
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:36,659
well how'd you clean it up certainly

321
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,040
well or someone for sure they could have

322
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:39,419
probably done it themselves if they went

323
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,699
on the internet and just learned a

324
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,779
little bit of information all right I

325
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,710
think I see the first one that we're

326
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:46,429
gonna be oh I don't even have to be

327
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:49,530
ripping these I'm so funny

328
00:16:46,429 --> 00:17:00,479
some don't open no it's true some don't

329
00:16:49,529 --> 00:17:03,990
open all right so whoa smells like a

330
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,110
nice like black licorice oh boy Wow

331
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:09,630
all right yeah like really so maybe we

332
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,549
it maybe we have one to try yeah let's

333
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:15,300
get a couple of dabs of this off if we

334
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:18,269
can I'm gonna put it on the on the cold

335
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:22,500
pack if you're gonna complement this

336
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:24,450
with this I suppose look at that how

337
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:29,700
nice it's coming off yeah the ice know

338
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:30,360
for sure all right take yourself however

339
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,180
much you like

340
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:33,509
I don't even pretend to be a champion

341
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,680
diver

342
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:39,329
I'm just taking reasonable-sized rips

343
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:44,340
whatever that is different to everyone

344
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:46,439
yeah different to everyone wow it really

345
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:48,959
has a smell though doesn't it mm-hmm and

346
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,850
really like the licorice it's so

347
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,100
licorice it's so licorice it's so

348
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:56,219
licorice it has me minorly nervous yeah

349
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:57,359
really though but you know what I'm

350
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,519
gonna give it a shot and try it out

351
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:04,379
maybe it's some real super terpene

352
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:06,150
awesome flavorful I guess we better kind

353
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,180
of write up in the book here to solvent

354
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,730
let's extract hybrid solvent extract is

355
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,680
it all all the surface okay right right

356
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:17,970
solvent list so we're in we just did

357
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:21,299
number one one and two or the pressed

358
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,920
key one and two with the press key so

359
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,619
we'll just kind of kind of put an extra

360
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:29,610
each of those number three we'll put an

361
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:31,439
Asst yeah and then so smell I mean what

362
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:34,679
are we doing is it one out of tens type

363
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,820
of thing here sure we could do one of 10

364
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,430
no but I'm wondering if that's what

365
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:39,980
their record rate the following entries

366
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:44,058
from one to nine okay

367
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,740
so I mean that smell initially was quite

368
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:48,288
nice yeah well I don't know if when I

369
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,519
hit it it's gonna be off mm-hmm so I

370
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:52,129
would give it a pretty high number for

371
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,808
smell maybe like a seven sure yeah

372
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,500
seemed pretty reasonable very reasonable

373
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:59,629
I'd say so okay and then below uh but

374
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,659
it's it's it's literally as if you had

375
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:07,370
fennel growing then you were chopping

376
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:10,070
fennel up yeah it is yeah it is very

377
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:12,349
strong so let's do some timing we're

378
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:16,788
gonna hit some only one of these torches

379
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:18,230
is actually filled with gas just do the

380
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:22,519
one I guess that's why the two torches

381
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:24,380
would have come in handy Hey yeah well

382
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,710
whatever you got your timer yeah I got

383
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:31,809
my timer what do you want first

384
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,808
brother you go first

385
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,548
interesting to see what this is going to

386
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:35,548
taste like

387
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:40,940
hmm

388
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,200
tiny a little bit dripped off my dabber

389
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:52,168
yep

390
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:53,909
it is so Fenelon and just it tastes

391
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:56,940
exactly like that it's it's pretty

392
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:58,769
trippy he always got to be wandering in

393
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,169
the cannabis community is it authentic

394
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:03,329
and it's a unique terpene profile or is

395
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:05,038
someone done something that they think

396
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:06,449
is gonna try and give them advantage

397
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,489
where they've added something or a

398
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,960
terpene that's from something else not

399
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:12,149
saying that's the case here this could

400
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,979
be totally solvent with rosin they've

401
00:20:12,148 --> 00:20:17,699
got pressed and flour or hash i have no

402
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:19,710
idea but it's 12 we'll know more once we

403
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,548
inhale it into our lungs that's for sure

404
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:25,139
really the consistency to me speaks of

405
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:31,229
flour yeah oh yeah it looks definitely

406
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:33,618
like a flower yeah alright so you've got

407
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:36,989
your own timer so that's great

408
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:39,868
yeah it's just the the fennel in these

409
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:42,558
stones it's it is overpower it's very

410
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:42,558
strong yeah

411
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:47,129
but let's see if it passes on to be like

412
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,100
it's true it's overpowering not in a bad

413
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:52,770
way I don't know if it's gonna taste

414
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:55,558
like that yes like if there's gonna be

415
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:56,900
some tweak of not so goodness in it so

416
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:59,250
we'll see what happens

417
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,620
how long you cooling for remember

418
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,569
outside eh oh yeah I'm gonna go 40

419
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:05,189
seconds yeah when you're outside it's

420
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:06,720
good to shave five or 10 seconds off

421
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,980
your time sometimes it doesn't work out

422
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,440
in your favor and you get the hot dab

423
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,190
like I got the other day at Stratasys

424
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:16,140
glass shop oh I take a hot tap that was

425
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,549
hot babs are us we were just talking

426
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,780
about hot dabs too and then I end up

427
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:24,720
taking like though that looked the

428
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:30,299
really proper temperature there this

429
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:32,339
pipe is just ridiculous by the way did

430
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:37,609
you get one the flavour does not

431
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:40,609
transfer through that interesting yeah

432
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:40,609
hmm

433
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,970
hmm

434
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:52,058
but tastes oxidized materialist not not

435
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:55,230
to hate on whoever produce this but

436
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:55,230
that's what it tastes like

437
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:00,269
yeah

438
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:15,829
yeah I definitely don't like taste

439
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,099
suspect faked herbs or anything like

440
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:19,309
that

441
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:22,609
no no the taste was very strong I almost

442
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:24,740
want to bump up the smell you know one

443
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:26,389
point just because it didn't transfer in

444
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,819
a negative way but it was kind of be a

445
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,440
little bit worried about illuminate yeah

446
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:32,689
I think that that is a great smell

447
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,610
that's unique it is very it's not

448
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,990
something that you and even the taste I

449
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:37,399
think I could give the taste the solid

450
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,079
six to seven I don't know what do you

451
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,000
want to say between a six seven

452
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:43,009
I like the weights grab my throat yeah

453
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,650
you know let's grab me a bud throw it a

454
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:49,400
little bit it's got some unique taste in

455
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:54,140
there what do you think what's B I'd

456
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:56,720
give it a six on the taste yep yeah I I

457
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:03,020
would feel very comfortable giving it a

458
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:05,779
six we provided this lovely dark crystal

459
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:08,059
plastic and I can give you a brand new

460
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:10,910
and shout out to Mick from Dark Crystal

461
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:14,299
yeah just sorted me out with some some

462
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:16,910
nice bottles of of his product our

463
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:19,279
crystal glass cleaner and as anyone

464
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:21,380
that's watching my show would know I'm a

465
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,940
huge proponent I'm surprised he actually

466
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,150
didn't sponsor this the karmic up

467
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,860
because one of these in every thing next

468
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,630
year might Mick it might be something

469
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:33,859
you want to look at 100 percent

470
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:36,230
alright so decent high on it yeah yeah

471
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:38,089
yeah no it's cerebral yeah it is

472
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,940
cerebral yeah so taste we're gonna give

473
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:45,859
it a 6 medicinal effects

474
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:51,680
oh I'd go as high as a 7.5 give it a 7

475
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:54,139
go 7 strength so pretty strong it's not

476
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,940
making me super uncomfortable visual

477
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,060
appeal that was a solid 8 it looks

478
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,670
beautiful when I cracked it open extra

479
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:04,369
texture was the same yes smooth this is

480
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:07,640
very I didn't talk too much at all let's

481
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:09,679
give it a 7 for smoothness ok residue

482
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,780
was fairly decent you know there really

483
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,019
wasn't much there was no char whatsoever

484
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:16,730
no truck so I mean residue but we also

485
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:17,869
hit it properly true I'm sure we're

486
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,339
gonna chart it out have we

487
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:21,379
thousand degree nails so this is where

488
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:22,970
all these variables come into play if

489
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,160
you're a hot dabber you're dabbing

490
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,950
everything at a thousand degrees well

491
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,509
you're gonna get you know residue that

492
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,860
looks a lot more intense than the

493
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:33,920
residue that we're getting because we're

494
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:35,719
just wiping oil off of off of the banger

495
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,990
I'll give it an 8 for residue that's the

496
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,120
way we're hitting it and enjoyment

497
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:42,349
mm-hmm

498
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:44,479
didn't make me want to go skiing or

499
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:46,159
anything but it's a six honestly the

500
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,710
enjoyment like like it was a decent

501
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,350
product but it's no I feel I feel like

502
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,600
it's all about strength yeah yeah and so

503
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:56,119
enjoyment for me is more than stronger

504
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:58,159
I'm looking for focus I'm looking for

505
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,928
for alertness I'm looking for

506
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,029
inspiration things that really make me

507
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:05,150
want to move and get up and go want to

508
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:09,079
continue to enjoy that product that's a

509
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:11,750
big one yeah and I I wouldn't continue

510
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:13,189
to consume that one yeah it's not one I

511
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,769
feel like I would go back to a lot of

512
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,870
times so you know we'll give it a maybe

513
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:20,869
we'll give enjoyment of five Shirky okay

514
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:23,029
yeah which in all reality isn't all that

515
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:24,109
bad considering how solid it's

516
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:26,480
interesting though that it could get

517
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:27,469
such high marks for the majority of all

518
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,269
these different things but then

519
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,049
enjoyment really is unique to itself

520
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:31,910
like I don't care

521
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:34,308
texture and smoothness and visual appeal

522
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:36,529
yeah are such a small part of my

523
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:38,058
enjoyment so true so they could be a 10

524
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:40,549
but it's not actually giving me that

525
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:42,019
inspiration that I'm less likely to we

526
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:44,690
don't know for sure I mean like I've

527
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:46,910
like you've seen the darkest like worst

528
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,529
looking hash ever be the melty as'

529
00:25:46,910 --> 00:26:06,980
tasting stuff when you actually smoke it

530
00:25:48,529 --> 00:26:08,960
yeah in this particular instance it's

531
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:14,049
got red white and black I'm not a big

532
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,049
fan of the silicone no I hate

533
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:21,250
I find it's hard to smell the resin

534
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:24,160
silicone yeah it absorbs the resin it

535
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:26,710
also leaves that white residue on some

536
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,370
of your resident hmm it's definitely

537
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:35,140
like hard to the touch it's nice little

538
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:37,419
piece also flower yeah it's on its way

539
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:41,170
to butter next year people bubble hash

540
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:43,330
rosin it's definitely an added thing

541
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,800
right that it makes it a little harder

542
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:46,389
for some people but agreed yeah I'll

543
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,980
sell you the bags I'll give you a rosin

544
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:52,360
discount that's your whole purpose but

545
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:53,940
oh you want to hit that sure let's see

546
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:57,849
what this one has to offer

547
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,620
yeah very hard we'll probably end up

548
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:02,919
doing is we'll go through all of these

549
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:05,559
different flavors we're not going to do

550
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,200
it all on camera I'll end up keeping

551
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:10,629
some of its secret for the karmic up and

552
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,819

589
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:33,039
the kermit cup is the best cup in the

590
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:37,269
country by leaps and bounds it's not

591
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,720
huge it's not the hugest cup but it's a

592
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:40,429
good one

593
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,990
this is good and I've never even gotten

594
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:44,450
this like I'm not I've done a solve

595
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,220
unless judging yep I've never gotten a

596
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,890
whole judges past before this is the

597
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:52,730
first for me and I've gone for I think

598
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:56,330
three of the last four years no it's

599
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:59,990
it's it's done proper it's done right

600
00:28:56,329 --> 00:29:03,019
mm-hmm all right let's see what you

601
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:05,298
think of this rib yeah this this smells

602
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:06,950
good yeah once he patted it out yeah

603
00:29:05,298 --> 00:29:08,808
what's he powdered it out and break a

604
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:12,048
little bit of the of the surface tension

605
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:13,849
I still smell this though - I know yeah

606
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:20,000
that's true just the tiniest bit you

607
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:22,699
know it's like a an afterthought suppose

608
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,950
like a pink such a beautiful warm day

609
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,440

00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:54,408
to to offer and it's just sitting in it

622

623
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:58,280

Sunday the day that I'm filming this and

627
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,650
I had to get this going

628
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,409
Sarah sent this to me about a week ago

629
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:12,320
or more now and so wanted to get this

630

are out on that side of the country

635
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:25,619
that's got a very pleasant taste I mean

636
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:33,579
it's like a death bubble okay all right

637
00:30:25,618 --> 00:30:35,108
but wasn't not bad no not too shabby no

638
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:40,058
I would rate it higher than that then

639
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:43,509
that third one okay but taste is very

640
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:45,578

00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:10,209
wonderful cannabis scene that we have

651
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:12,098
started so many years ago that has gone

652
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:13,839
into this growth spurt and it's just

653
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:16,538
expanding exponentially bringing

654
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:17,979
actively exponentially it's good though

655
00:31:16,538 --> 00:31:20,769
it's a little bit different in the sense

656
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:23,499
that maybe you know it's more worrisome

657
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:25,419
in regards to positioning but I think

658
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:27,278
that it's the power of cannabis that we

659
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:29,200
wanted as activists for so many years

660
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,179
does it for to affect people positively

661
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,038
and these are the results of that they

662
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:33,459
are and I mean there will be growing

663
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:36,009
pains

664
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:38,229
you know but that's like that is like

665
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:41,378
you know but we are moving towards

666
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:44,469
having our community being accepted

667
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:47,699
globally which is it's just huge it sure

668
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:50,798
beats getting thrown in jail oh I know

669
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:53,739
all your monetary success like getting

670

sued by the government only taxes and oh

671
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:57,669
yeah I don't think I think a lot of

672
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:59,888
people are forgetting how crazy it was
