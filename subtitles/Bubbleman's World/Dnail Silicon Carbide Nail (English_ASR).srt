2
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:24,300
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:27,868
and today we are doing a little review

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,380
from one of my favorite companies do you

5
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:34,338
nail thanks for the shirt boys a little

6
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,488
show-off there on the logo on the back

7
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:41,969
just receive this from my good friends

8
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:43,919
Brian Stevie over at D mail and working

9
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,780
with D mail for maybe the last year

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,489
since you guys have seen me whipping

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,198
around the world with these different

12
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:50,878
units and different nails you've seen me

13
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:53,070
with titanium nails you've seen me with

14
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:56,399
quartz nail ceramic inserts sapphire

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:01,768
inserts and today something different

16
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,149
today we have a silicon carbide that

17
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:06,409
they've been working on for the last

18
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:09,960
year flavor testing and terpene testing

19
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:13,679
thermal dynamics really putting more in

20
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:16,919
than the average bear into the focus on

21
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,840
how these things work and how the nails

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,728
should be heated and the distribution of

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,310
heat and how when it's applied a certain

24
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:25,560
way you would preserve more particular

25
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,519
terpenes everything they change changes

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,618
something with the taste so this unit is

27
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,089
I'm not sure if it's even available to

28
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:34,709
be honest I think it's an experimental

29
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,799
unit they not sure if they've released

30
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:40,500
it yet I would love to have it in a

31
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,989
drop-down my dropdowns not ready yet so

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,368
I'm waiting for that and you know I have

33
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:48,149
my straight fab that I traveled with

34
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:49,769
quite a bit and once my quartz Bowl got

35
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,978
broken I got pretty comfortable putting

36
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:55,530
the titanium nail into it and it fit

37
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:58,679
fairly tight this nail I like the way it

38
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,359
fits a lot better it's quite loose it

39
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:02,519
goes in loose and it's not until it

40
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,310
drops that quarter inch to half inch

41
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,618
into the joint that it actually kind of

42
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,439
gets snug so I'm not too worried about

43
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:12,479
the metal on on the glass I know a lot

44
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,039
of people that are some and I wish I had

45
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,799
the drop down for you guys I'd love to

46
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,780
have this down quite a bit more but for

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,020
the sake of doing the review and getting

48
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,259
it done because life moves fast and men

49
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,750
more things will show up I figured let's

50
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:28,879
do this I saw a 420k yesterday and today

51
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:33,379
and he brought me a really nice little

52
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:36,769
gift of some OG Kush DRI cept that is

53
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:40,969
right here and he also brought me some

54
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:42,710
New York City diesel man is that the

55
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:45,189
old-school New York City diesel that I

56
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:49,430
remember that just pungently orange

57
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:51,020
citrus winner so that's fun and that's

58
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:55,460
what we're gonna be testing today the OG

59
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:58,189
Kush and the New York City diesel one

60
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:02,420
has the flavor of orange citrus you know

61
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:04,280
that D limonene that Valens seen mersin

62
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:06,199
I'm sure there's probably half a dozen

63
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,780
or more that taste and smell like

64
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:11,539
different citrus lemons limes and

65
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,520
oranges and then the OG Kush which this

66
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:16,280
particular one is very earthy very

67
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,780
earthy it's it's like Dee was saying you

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,490
know it's like putting a little a

69
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,140
teaspoon of dirt in your mouth when you

70
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:25,430
take a rip of it it is really pretty

71
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:28,250
much that earthy and I guess just to

72
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:31,280
mention a few things with the silicon

73
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,050
carbide we don't use a metal tool and

74
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,729
scrape around they were saying not

75
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:38,660
really a good idea they actually sent me

76
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:40,639
this lovely little D mail wipe that I

77
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:43,099
guess when when it cools down just with

78
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,459
water and with this much the same way

79
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:48,229
you would use on a camera lens it comes

80
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,390
off real easy so I've only taken a few

81
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:52,399
hits so far so it's relatively clean I

82
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:56,989
managed to clean it with a little bit of

83
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,909
cloth I did some macro video of that in

84
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:02,110
slow motion so you can see the dry sift

85
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:04,609
falling off the off the dabber and

86
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,900
dumping into this dish I'll tell you one

87
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,780
thing about this dish this is like

88
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,370
Chicago deep-dish pizza compared to any

89
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,729
other nail that I've ever seen I mean

90
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:18,230
the it's no joke obviously you guys can

91
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:20,539
see the size of that bad boy quite quite

92
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,100
a nice size you could you know the guy

93
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,530
especially for these guys out there that

94
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,180
love taking the monster dabs you're

95
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:27,829
gonna be quite pleased with the size of

96
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,620
this dish I'm just going to be doing

97
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:31,490
reasonable size dabs and and of course

98
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,649
in the movie

99
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,090
that I made with the iPhone the 240

100
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:37,279
frames per second when you see the

101
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:39,379
melting and the bubbling there is a lot

102
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,409
of smoke coming up they did give me a

103
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,939
really nice carb cap with this nail

104
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,610
which I will show you in a second all

105
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:49,699
right which is right here so funky

106
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,288
little Devo style carb cap you can see

107
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,720
it just fits right on there quite nice

108
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:56,120
and then has a little hole right on top

109
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,410
there so quite a lovely little look to

110
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:04,490
it not huge on the metal myself although

111
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,680
I do appreciate the titanium in the

112
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,750
situation when I'm traveling I've had

113
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,030
the quartz break on me the quartz Briggs

114
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,610
it's like wow what do you do I have no

115
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:16,309
more quartz Bowl the titanium is an

116
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,780
exceptional alternative for traveling

117
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,228
especially because I can travel and not

118
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:24,258
really worry about about it breaking so

119
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:26,149
without further ado I think we're gonna

120
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:31,879
have a little hit of the New York City

121
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:33,679
diesel mmm so citrusy the first two rips

122
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:38,930
I took through this thing was beautiful

123
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,310
and tasty but I do feel that I lost a

124
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,019
little bit because I was unable to call

125
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,050
hate the idea of carving it for a video

126
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:48,379
and yeah I guess I am gonna use the

127
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,939
titanium carb and not the ceramics oh my

128
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:53,680
bad I forgot that they sent me one of

129
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:53,680
these so let's use the one they send me

130
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,629
[Music]

131
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:27,829
well I'll tell you one thing this guy

132
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:29,300
gets hot fast you would not want to

133
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:36,229
leave this carbine here for more than 30

134
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:38,750
seconds fits exceptional though well

135
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,129
it's got a tiny little lip on the on the

136
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,550
inside I'm not sure if you guys can see

137
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:47,290
that there but that tiny little lip just

138
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,290
fits in real real nicely

139
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:02,209
Wow exceptional flavor to taste to taste

140
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:06,829
test any kind of nail whether it was a

141
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:08,389
cords or a sapphire this strain I can't

142
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:10,609
say enough about how strong the taste is

143
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:13,038
and I've been listening to D 420k talk

144
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,169
about this in our own FaceTime

145
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,329
conversations and in Google+ and hashed

146
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:19,188
church where each time he takes a hit he

147
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:20,598
sits there and he he would go on about

148
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,149
oh my god I wish you guys could taste

149
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:25,338
this and I was always like wow come on

150
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:27,978
we've tasted great great stuff we know

151
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:30,168
we know but now as I say here and I

152
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:33,079
taste it I got to admit deep you were

153
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:34,748
right this is exceptional resin holy

154
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:38,269
Christ does it taste good on the lips

155
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:40,939
like in an orange grove and hitting it

156
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:45,588
off the new silicon carbide nail head

157
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:49,159
with the mothership fab egg just a

158
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:50,868
really nice combination treat oh really

159
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:55,459
and I think we're gonna get another one

160
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:58,729
ready soon one thing I would love that

161
00:07:55,459 --> 00:08:00,800
to know is what can I wipe it with right

162
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,300
away you know what can I kind of just

163
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,919
give it a quick little wife I used a

164
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,869
little paper towel that I dipped in

165
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,668
water and I believe that's what he said

166
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:10,430
in the letter that it would to use this

167
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:13,248
little Dino cloth that he sent me dipped

168
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:16,699
in water I'm pretty confident that

169
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:20,240
there's 80% of his dish left so why

170
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:24,288
don't we hit the OG Kush in a nice fresh

171
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,079
section we'll go double up on the I'll

172
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:28,668
see what this is now I hit these earlier

173
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,369
in the quartz and I have to say so far

174
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:34,338
the New York City diesel tasted the best

175
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:37,788
off the the silicon carbide egg I don't

176
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:39,110
know why I will try to learn and talk to

177
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:41,360
the guys and figure out what are the

178
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,038
thermal dynamics behind heating up the

179
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,720
nail in this particular way and having

180
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,990
it design this way with this size of a

181
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,230
dish and what exactly is silicon

182
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:54,230
carbides to offer that quartz or

183
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,360
sapphire or ceramic or titanium don't

184
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,840
one of the differences these things

185
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,820
interest

186
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,860
me and of course I'd love to bring that

187
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,780
information to you guys a little bit

188
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,430
more than just a simple review but going

189
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:06,860
into something a little bit deeper and

190
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:12,279
letting them know why is this better so

191
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,279
far pretty cool let's have another real

192
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:42,710
Wow Wow

193
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:52,439
the taste on the NY CD was much it was

194
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:56,539
increased from the intensity that I felt

195
00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:05,070
off of the courts it was a or intense

196
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:07,740
citrus taste but the og og was was this

197
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:10,980
earthy taste and that taste almost

198
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,560
brought it almost cleaned it up almost

199
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,720
cleaned up the earthy taste and it still

200
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,179
got an earthy taste but it's it's of a

201
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,610
cleaner earth if that makes any sense

202
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:22,409
geez I wish I would have had a couple of

203
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,659
other people's opinions here I'm sure

204
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:26,250
that would have been a cooler idea maybe

205
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:29,309
maybe I will do a little video the next

206
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,840
time I get together with Flav he's a

207
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:32,519
real connoisseur in that sense and we

208
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,470
can do a little taste testing because

209
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,139
I'll tell you there's something to be

210
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:40,410
said for this nail the taste on it is so

211
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:42,360
good that I consider using it even

212
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:45,179
though it's got the titanium body and I

213
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,039
love the idea anytime I can getting away

214
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:51,149
from metal I don't know why I just like

215
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:53,339
the idea quartz makes me happy the metal

216
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:56,340
look on this my mind I can feel is

217
00:10:53,340 --> 00:11:00,120
judging it yet over on the other side I

218
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:04,290
have the honest opinion that Wow does

219
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,810
that have an incredible flavor really

220
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:09,059
incredible now one thing I feel that

221
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:11,159
it's a little bit missing out on it in

222
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,469
the sense that there's not a tool that I

223
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,949
can scrape around on I've been told it's

224
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,629
not the best idea to scrape the surface

225
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,400
with a hard tool like titanium maybe

226
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:23,340
over time you scratch and it releases

227
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,959
dusts I'm not sure I'll try to find out

228
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,090
those things as well this is just a real

229
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,250
simple review for today and I'll come

230
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,899
back with a more intense backup once

231
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:34,320
I've talked to Brian and Stevie and

232
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,819
figured out exactly you know a little

233
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,470
bit more information for you guys on

234
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,800
this nail but from the bubble man's

235
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,080
perspective the taste was great not

236
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,049
stoked on the idea of metal in the pipe

237
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,980
but a simple drop down alleviates such a

238
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:52,409
worry as long as you know the weight

239
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,120
which isn't too bad it's not too too bad

240
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:56,490
I wouldn't put it on a drop down that

241
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,230
went out too far just in case but I

242
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,090
think on a drop down that goes

243
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,670
substantially down and up it'll sit

244
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:07,500
right here nicely and you know I think

245
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:10,559
it'll be fun it'll be fun well I want to

246
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,629
thank both Brian and Stevie all the

247
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,419
people at D nail for the great work that

248
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:17,939
they do you know thanks for supporting

249
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:20,639
me guys and allowing me to help you guys

250
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,350
out with doing cool things like this and

251
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,659
little reviews and given my honest

252
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,210
opinion they never asked me in any way

253
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:30,120
shape or form to sway they never asked

254
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,920
me to say my opinion is one thing or the

255
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,210
other they just really want my honest

256
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,189
opinion and that's how I know that

257
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,940
they're doing the good work and they're

258
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:41,180
looking to better the product constantly

259
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:44,370
so thanks guys for that thanks for the

260
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:46,049
silicon carbide nail I'm gonna give it a

261
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,389
shot for the next week I think I'm gonna

262
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:50,279
go back and forth with this and the

263
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:53,189
quartz and do a little taste testing and

264
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:56,459
see see what we can find in the

265
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,830
differences of low temp dabs versus high

266
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,860
temp dabs with this particular unit as

267
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:05,190
well so thanks for watching you guys can

268
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,200
check these products out on d-mail and I

269
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,600
believe I'm gonna be getting a discount

270
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,500
code so if you guys want to contact me
