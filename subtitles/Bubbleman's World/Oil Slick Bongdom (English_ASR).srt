00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,399
product it's like oh just if a good

28
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,198
chunk of the head shops pick this up

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,960
true the oil slick is definitely a great

30
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,719
product and today you've come by and

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,719
you're going to share a new product with

32
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,000
us another great idea dude I'm pretty

33
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,798
stoked on this one actually he just

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,560
showed me off camera and I thought man

35
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,040
we got to show that on camera that is so

36
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,040
simple and so for me a guy that goes to

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,079
a lot of shows I'm in Amsterdam at the

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,759
Cannabis Cup I'm down in Spain at the

39
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:25,399
spannabis I was at the stepping High

40
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,680
ganja Festival in NE Grill I'm smoking

41
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,478
with people all around the world and you

42
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,960
know this year there was a company that

43
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:36,840
had a product and it was kind of similar

44
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:39,399
to um it was a piece that fit into the

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,880
bong and then made you know its own

46
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,320
mouth piece it was a plastic piece

47
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,640
similar to what you guys make your oil

48
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,839
slick a silicone piece like a plug it

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,359
was a plug exactly but I

50
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,960
just I couldn't get around it I couldn't

51
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,399
I just didn't think like having this

52
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,679
giant it was like this big do you know

53
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,079
what I mean I'm like I just this seems

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,719
to me a much better concept and I I'll

55
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,279
just let you do sure explain it um oh

56
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,519
you've got your own that's right the the

57
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,159
Slick Shield is um it's a bong condom

58
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,400
that's what we call it around the shop a

59
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:13,640
bom a bong bong condom anyway we try to

60
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,360
uh try to stay uh classy with it so the

61
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,119
Slick Shield uh is something that we've

62
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,200
we've had around the office for a while

63
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,599
we really didn't know if it was

64
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,719
something people would would like to see

65
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:27,000
in mass production but we're all about

66
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:29,159
Elegance Solutions we like um we like

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,840
solutions that kind of slipstream fit in

68
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,759
with what people are normally doing

69
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,360
naturally doing um which is why a large

70
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,039
pendant Affair or something like that

71
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,239
doesn't really make sense to us and and

72
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,759
also you need to be frank um so we love

73
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,840
our glass right and like this Mothership

74
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,719
piece right here the idea of plugging

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,158
that hole and changing the dynamic of

76
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:51,878
the glass was something we couldn't even

77
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:53,239
kind of get our heads around um so uh it

78
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:56,359
it should only take me a second to show

79
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,239
off they come in these uh packages like

80
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,000
this just a basic little paper envelope

81
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,800
it's got a little rope tie thing on the

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,878
back with directions easy to open um the

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,360
directions are pretty simple you uh you

84
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,199
stretch it you press it and uh then you

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,040
release it so comes inside of a little

86
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,919
hygienic uh plastic pouch like this and

87
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,759
you open it up it's a sticky Platinum

88
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,598
cured silicone it's a medical gr

89
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:20,280
silicone it's very sticky right compare

90
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,639
that to like the containers that we make

91
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,919
where the PS it's very different um it's

92
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,759
also really stretchy and the reason why

93
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,438
it's stretchy you stretch it you press

94
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,079
it and then you release it and um I

95
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:34,639
don't know if your camera can pick up

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,280
that it's just basically like a film put

97
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,199
it even a little closer covering the if

98
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,080
you want to

99
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,759
show boom covering the hole um it

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,879
doesn't really impede

101
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,359
the the function or the draw then when

102
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,000
you're done hitting it you just peel it

103
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,000
off put it back in your uh

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,959
plastic inner shield and slip it back in

105
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,919
yeah um the idea behind this is that

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,280
unlike alcohol wipes which um they're

107
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,438
smelly but they're really like the best

108
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,919
solution that we have right for this

109
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,799
sort of deal uh yeah so you got to

110
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,598
stretch it I like it yeah nice that's

111
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,400
pretty neat dude yeah that's the clear

112
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:12,158
one uh that's really the one I prefer

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,319
but we do have like pink and blue and

114
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:17,879
stuff for the uh for the women for the

115
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,319
ladies the um the the thing about the uh

116
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,918
the alcohol wipes that was kind of a

117
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,719
deal is that you kind of depend on the

118
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,639
person with the rig to have those it

119
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,320
just gets old people stop doing it

120
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,360
eventually um so this is like my thing I

121
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:32,599
put it in my pocket I use it when I want

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,800
to and kind of puts it in my own um my

123
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,800
own

124
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:42,280
control somehow I missed my opportunity

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,280
to uh get it D that

126
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,240
hash had it all you took your piece off

127
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,519
yeah I did I did I it took my slick off

128
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,319
sck Shield you could have one now too

129
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:55,719
all right I will thank you so much

130
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,360
Mark how nice is that well that's pretty

131
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,080
interesting so it's Festival season

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,520
right now right and the cup cough is

133
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:03,319
something that like we all dread in fact

134
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,918
almost everybody I know go to these

135
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:09,599
things they don't even share pieces um I

136
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,879
I know I know so many um web celebs and

137
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,479
you know people who are like vlogging

138
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,959
and they're at these things all the time

139
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,959
and they they'll just carry their own

140
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:17,758
little pendy you've got so yeah you see

141
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,799
I've got the techque down yeah cuz I've

142
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,479
done it more than once I'm still

143
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,840
learning I I don't know how hard I could

144
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,359
stretch it but since people are going to

145
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,959
watch this video and when they when they

146
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,600
Google slick Shield they might find this

147
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,198
video stretch the [ __ ] out of it um it

148
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,240
is very stretchy you know what the the

149
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,840
the real H we put that on the package

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,478
the hole is small so basically you know

151
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,159
you want to get it much bigger so you

152
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,599
can get that rip I can say from just

153
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,960
ripping it one of the things that was

154
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,600
interesting is it is still the shape and

155
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,799
the feel of the pipe that you're hitting

156
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,960
it hasn't altered that mouthpiece feel

157
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,400
aside from just putting a nice little

158
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,279
coating over top of it which I'll tell

159
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:59,879
you you guys have seen me on my videos I

160
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:03,159
share bowls with a lot of people

161
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,199
so not a bad idea to just uh what a

162
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,919
beautiful rig to uh have them a little

163
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,280
