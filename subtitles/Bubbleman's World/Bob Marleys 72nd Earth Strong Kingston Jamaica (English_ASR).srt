00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,758

168
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,840
dude. Absolutely. So are those drums.

169
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,879
Yeah.

170
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,318
Sto got us worked.

171
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,439
I wonder what time Kittis is going to

172
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,560
get here.

173
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,639
Should you give him a call? We're going

174
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,518
to I'm going to buy this for sure. I'll

175
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,519
have the American

178
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,360
Drummond with the prince. today.

179
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:56,000
I noticed that, too.

180
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,759
All right, that's Matt from Sasquatch,

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,559
of course. He's going to be purchasing

182
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:04,919
some albums from Bongo Herman. There's

183
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,919
Jessica doing a little bag shopping.

184
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,959
All right. All right. All right.

185
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:26,819
[Music]

186
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,720
oil like coconut

187
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:39,319
oil. So I have to call I have to so why

188
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,320
that's important is

189
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,759
so the technology that was

190
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:50,719
develop Wednesday

191
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:52,319
and we're puffing at place on birthday

192
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,680
and and you know what here's the trick

193
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,680
too I landed today at 420s when I

194
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,679
stepped

195
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,639
yes it's wicked wicked

196
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:12,040
All right. Is there Is it already on?

197
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,039
You like that? Proper. There you go.

198
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,480
Okay.

199
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,480
So, that's a

200
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,480
tiny

201
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:36,480
[Music]

202
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,879
flavor. Took me a while to convince the

203
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,079
steamers that I wasn't burning. You

204
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,039
know, they were like, I don't know about

205
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:42,879
that. But I'm like, "No, I'm telling

206
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:48,278
you. I promise. It's a steam. It's a

207
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,278
steam." I wouldn't lie. How was that?

208
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,440
Yo, come a long way from the

209
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,600
mouse. Come a long way from the mouse.

210
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,399
It is serious. The challenge difference.

211
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,879
But it all started here. The steam pipe

212
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,200
started here. There is no other history

213
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,200
before that

214
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,640
if I

215
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:24,399
ever but if you have it and it's sitting

216
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:29,399
there what's neat about it is that you

217
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,399
can access this partic

218
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,919
We want to talk to

219
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,440
you

220
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:56,518
respect by the bubble man.

221
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,199
vegan.

222
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,079
[Music]

223
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,639
Beautiful. I owned a raw food cafe in

224
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,958
Vancouver. It was 100% vegan, organic,

225
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,799
and macrobiotic cuz I felt like if

226
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,239
you're going to be vegan, don't fly your

227
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,838
food on jet airplanes from the other

228
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,600
side of the world. That sort of it

229
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,000
defeats the purpose. So, yeah, you were

230
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,839
saying after you took the prana. We were

231
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,600
talking the fact that a lot of people

232
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,680
don't know these are when we talk about

233
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,159
vegan, these are actually vegan. So

234
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,479
there's no alcohol, there's no chemicals

235
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,399
used in the entire process, no animal,

236
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,720
no animal, there's no heat either. So

237
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,958
it's a hypoallergenic drop. And when

238
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,639
when when you're dealing with C8 and

239
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,399
C10, we were talking about special

240
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,639
blends of capric fatty acids. The

241
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,720
difference between coconut oils and MCTs

242
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,000
and then you start looking at, you know,

243
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,399
with C8, C9, C10, C1, C12, you'll find

244
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,200
different ratios within that that absorb

245
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,799
faster. So this particular combination

246
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,480
uh works really well for those that are

247
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,559
vegans and don't have any meat because

248
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,720
this this particular combination is

249
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,799
going to absorb super fast. So after you

250
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,480
took it, he asked you if you felt high

251
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,240
and I said, "No, I don't feel high. I

252
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,079
just feel a burst of energy. Real

253
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,919
natural energy." Beautiful. You feel

254
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:14,399
good from it. You tried the top.

255
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,319
You got that going on or what? All

256
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,639
right, Johnny B. Okay. You know what?

257
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,680
We're puff

258

turpp dip. Strawberry banana turf dip.

260
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,039
Tell us more about that. Well, we're

261
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,399
going to do some clementine. Got about a

262
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:33,039
ml of clementine right here.

263
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,399
Yeah, we got you, dude. Dab on puff

264
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:38,159
Wednesday with us. I'm going to hit this

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:41,159
one. Next.

Boom.

267
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,919
That's a puff puffy right there. Here we

268
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,639
are. Hey, this guy's being filmed by

269
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,799
other people. Got Tony in the house.

This guy's fixing the the Sasquatch here

271
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,519
we got going on. There we

[Music]

273
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:08,000
go. If you didn't get the coffin at the

274
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,759
end, right? I think

275
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I think it's my turn actually. Here. I

276
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,360
put this on my Wait a second.

277
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,720
See, that's what we're doing. We're

278
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,240
educating people here. We're talking

279
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,079
talking more about turkey profiling

280
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,440
cannabis and how it helps everybody.

281
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,439
Look at Look at the crew. Everybody's

282
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,720
quite interested. So, here we go. So,

283
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,279
you can So, those that are that is in

284
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,959
its raw.

285
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,679
It's a good enough. I wouldn't give this

286
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,439
to someone that never dabs, I would give

287
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,439
them a much smaller dab and let them

288
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,079
build up to the bioassay of how they

289
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,160
feel because it can take you many little

290
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,759
ones to feel the way you want. But if

291
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,639
you take too big of one, you're just

292
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:46,559
uncomfortable. It's like hitting a

293
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,959
steamer for the first time really good.

294
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,719
Like you lit it up and you're just like

295
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,359
So we're not really looking to do that

296
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,240
to people. That turns people off. Yeah,

297
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,120
I would advise that. We give people the

298
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,879
hits that they want to have. This is for

299
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,919
my partner. Dip that in the tur. Look

300
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:09,399
how easy that was.

301
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,399
Came right out.

302
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:15,039
That's the tool. How the hell did they

303
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,440
get that out? Easy.

304
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:21,319
Uhoh.

305
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,320
There you go, Johnny B.

306
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,399
Was that Johnny B?

307
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,560
The turfs on that are amazing. Yes, that

308
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,958
replaced 30 pharmaceutical pills that he

309
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,799
used to be on. He broke his neck, broke

310
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:46,399
his back, shattered his arm, shattered

311
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:48,240
his jaw, fell 30 ft off of a roof, and

312
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,000
uses only cannabis for his pain

313
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,560
management. Now, a little scared. I had

314
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,159
a neck surgery. So, this is kind of like

315
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,198
this is my medicine. This is what works

316
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,799
for me. It's what I like to tell the

317
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,399
world how cannabis helps me with all

318
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,559
different conditions. That's what it's

319
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,399
all about is the education on how we can

320
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,399
actually take the extraction through

321
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,039
plant. It's like what Mark always says

322
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,039
when you buy a

323
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:19,838
pizza putting into a formula to help you

324
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:23,399
with your condition and profound. You're

325
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,399
like wait a minute.

326
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,319
Oh yeah.

327
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,599
Steaming. Steamers are bubble. Go ahead.

328
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,759
Oh, beautiful.

329
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,759
Give thanks.

The plates will heat up fast. Yeah.

Yeah. Oh, cuz it's already hot out here.

That's right.

shut off after a while. No, I'm just

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,839
something. I'm thinking we're going to

361
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:13,519
press around 200. Oh, wow.

362
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,839
All right. We're pressing around 200.

Nice tasty butter. Why not? I know.

372
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,599
We are about to go. Look, we're about to

373
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,360
squish some rosin. I don't have any,

374
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,240
man. So, this is Get a front row seat

375
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:51,279
for that. Tiny little bit of bud inside

376
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,839
the the bag. They'll do 14 grams at a

377
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,639
time or you know more. put an ounce,

378
00:18:53,839 --> 00:19:00,399
easy ounce in here. But I like to do

379
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,240
less just to preserve your quality. Um,

380
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,840
less you go, you kind of pull out more

381
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,679
quality, but it takes you a lot more

382
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,678
time. So depending on how big of a

383
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,600
farmer you are is really depending on

384
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,440
how much you're going to want to put in

385
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,399
there. I mean, I see people putting two,

386
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,558
three oates, a quarter pound, you know,

387
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,640
and they're going to throw over the

388
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,720
Here's the bud in the in the farmer.

389
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,759
He's going to put the bud in the

390
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,079
project. He's going to slide it into

391
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,160
there and squish it. He's going to get

392
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,439
the oil for one time or do you want to

393
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,558
plant without using a chemical makeup?

Foot pump goes on. Oh, that's so nice,

398

Get it heated up a little bit.

400
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,480
Let me explain some science here. He's

401
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,360
essentially steeping out the oil that's

402
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,599
inside that bun. And that oil is getting

403
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,079
pushed out by the water. The oil and

404
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,279
water don't mix. And the oil Yeah. Do

405
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,678
you need a dabber to do that? Look at

406
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,678
this though.

407
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,759
So that's the oil coming off the flour.

408
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,240
That's serious oil. Yeah. For that

409
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,480
little bit of bud. It's going to drip.

410
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,839
It's going to drip. That's ital oil.

411
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,120
Like uh 70% THC or like that would make

412

you high really high or it'll heal you

413
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:37,959

00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,000
every day. You seen this before? I think

494
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,919
a few years into it will have a truly

495
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,919
nice. So, basically, we brought these

496
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,679
guys out. This is a technology that they

497
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,960
came up with. It's heated plates and

498
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,480
they're going to put that herb inside

499
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,720
the screen. You're going to put it

500
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,278
inside the parchment. Close down the

501
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,880
press for about 20 to 30 seconds. And

502
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,319
when you open it up, there's going to be

503
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,559
this incredibly clean oil that's steamed

504
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,359
off the plant. And when you hit that

505
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,918
oil, it is so much stronger than smoking

506
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:36,000
herb by itself that it's there's no

507
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,520
ceiling to it. So, it's I was explaining

508
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,679
it to the other dudes. It's like you're

509
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,519
sitting up closer. Like herb is kind of

510
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,919
like a middle back row thing. And then

511
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,558
you get up to the front row and all of a

512
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,159
sudden even front row. Oh, I could see

513
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,079
him singing. I could see him playing the

514
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,400
guitar and he was jamming on those keys.

515
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,798
It's a different experience. So there

516
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,400
you go.

517
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:01,038
Oh yeah. Just be careful.

518
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,798
Do you guys use your ears? Oh yeah. I I

519
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,480
listen. You hear it get tight. You don't

520
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,960
really need I also listen for the

521
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,159
steaming of the resin. Exactly.

522
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,960
Especially when you're pressing bubble

523
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,640
hash. I always press bubble hash resin.

524
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,960
start coming through the screen and

525
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,799
that's when I give it pressure, right?

526
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,558
Yeah. Yeah. Do a little pre-press,

527
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,759
especially he's using a foot pedal to

528
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:28,278
push down the 20 ton jack. Yeah. Thing

529
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,278
weighs like 130 lbs. Look at the oil.

530
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:36,599
That was maybe a gram and a half. Hot,

531
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,599
huh?

532
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,558
Just butter coming right out and this

533
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:45,359
humid humidity.

534
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:47,440
No choice. When you put a lot in, you'll

535
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:51,439
just see it dripping out, but they only

536
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:55,278
put a couple of grams of butter. Yeah.

537
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,558
Oh, yeah. It buttered out nice.

538
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,240
So, there's a couple of textures that

539
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,480
the rosin will come out. It can come out

540
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,480
real snap and pull and really consistent

541
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,159
like shatter. And then it also does the

542
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,759
sort of cake batter thing. Minor

543
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,600
blowout.

544
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,720
That's the moisture from it. Smells

545
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:13,678
incredible from the air. You know, I

546
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,880
packed it way tight, too. Probably

547
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:20,440
making oil at Bob's house. Very, very

548

00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:05,918
the color, the religion, no division.

660
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,519
Just the right decision. We complete the

661
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,679
mission. Yeah, man. There's one one

662
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,759
race. It's the human race and we're all

663
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:17,159
in a part of it to the brain and to the

664
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:17,158
heart of it.

665
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:26,519
I got a challenge. Plug it back in.

666
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,519
Don't get too high.

667
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,320

676
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,679

677
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,679
positive. I mean like next level

678
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,440
positive. He's got his two little kids

679
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,960
in front of him. They got dreads.

680
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,918
They're singing and dancing and they

681
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,599
look so happy and healthy.

682
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:17,358
When you go where? Yeah.

683
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:20,359
Little children.

684
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,358
Yeah.

685
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,200
Serious tabernacle in St.

687
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,559
Go down the July the 23rd and you go see

688
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,599

689
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,599
get that herb cut up.

690
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,638
Nice [ __ ] drip coming out of Let's go

691
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:49,678
see the essence of a plant. Let's get

692
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,480
this drip. I can tell I can tell it was

693
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,240
serious when the phones came out.

694
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,240
Dripping.

695
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,319
What? What butt is that? Not our That's

696
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,078
from Kevin. Oh, good. See, Kevin knows.

697
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,280
Kevin's a full-time steamer. He's not

698
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,839
joking around. He's committed. He's

699
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,320
jumped in with both feet.

700
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,880
You know what's great about what's great

701
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,800
about this machine is it's the word of

702
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,039
God when it comes to the quality of your

703
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,800
herb. You can think your herb is

704
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,679
whatever you want to think. But when it

705
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,200
comes out and gives you 10, 15, 20%

706
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:26,239
return and it's got that color like

707
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:28,239
caramel. I mean, that's just beautiful.

708
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:30,559
Good job, Joel. I don't know how hard I

709
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,159
want to hit it, but I think I think

710
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,159
you're killing it, bro. Like in a good

711
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,159
way.

712
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:45,079
Oh, yeah. All right. Open her up on

713
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,079
top. Great, dude.

714
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:54,000
Oh, yeah. Mild mild cleanup. And that's

715
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:56,399
that's good. It's nice.

716
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,599
Yeah. Smells good.

717
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,000
I think it's going to be going in that

718
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,240
chalice right here over here in the very

719
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,239
near future.

720
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,400
I think this is going to be stable just

721
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,000
from looking at it. Yeah. It's got to

722
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,400
cool down to 90°. Yeah. Right. Cool it

723
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,400
down to 90°.

724
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,480
Right on, dude. Right on.

727
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,880
Oh, he'll make it thicker.

728
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:02,400
I agree with you. You know, we we have

729
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:05,838
started the process of getting some

730
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:10,400
licenses in place. Yes. Um particularly

731
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:14,159
for the medicinal developments of Ghana

732
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,160
um and for other juices as well. But

733
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:19,519
it's it it's going to take a little

734
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:21,199
time. It has taken too long, but I'm

735
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:22,800
certain that within the coming months,

736
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,039
we're going to see some definitive

737
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,079
movements. That's right. And would you

738
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,759
try to get the machines here as well?

739
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,240
Well, well, once we give the give the

740
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,280
license, the the private developers

741
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:37,519
would bring in all the equipment that

742
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,440
are covered under that license. Thank

743
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:41,000
you very much. Have a very blessed day.

[Music]

748
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,880
Okay. After he left, when you talk back

749
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,480
again, that's a prime minister. Yeah.

750
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,559
You drilled me with the camera and then

751
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,760
he showed up and I was like, that's a

752
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:12,000
good lesson. That's a lesson. Yes.

753
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,640
I'm not speaking with the camera on

754
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,440
this. So that you so we will have a

755
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:18,440
Jamaican product.

756
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,639
You got to press some hash, boys. This

757
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,039
one's going to get a drip.

758

This one's going to get a drip.

759
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:33,519
He's like, "Yeah, press up some hash."

760
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,800
I'm like, "All right, we'll rock it

761
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,599
out." He's like, "Okay." Hey. He's like,

00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,920
"Here, like, well, we're going to have

We'll get it done. We can start working

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,159
tomorrow.

I can't wait to see this squish.

767
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,440
You want to come around this side? We're

768
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,440
probably going to have to to film it.

769
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,440
Yeah.

770
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,200
All right. This will be good.

771
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,519
Yeah. Right. Your footage will never end

772
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:08,319
up on my YouTube channel, but this one,

773
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:11,800
I would say. Oh, yeah.

774
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,800
Maybe 10.

775
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,639
Where's the hash man?

776
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,079
I You need to be seeing. That's Yeah.

777
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,759
See, that's what I mean by a little pre-

778
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,039
squish right there. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

779
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,960
Always always preheat and then

780
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,559
always apply pressure slowly. Always.

781
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,000
Especially when working with hash.

782
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:36,119
You're going to blow out bags if you

783
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,119
just try to slam the pressure.

784
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:43,199
Um faster than that.

785
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,920
It's kind of a light a lighter brown

786
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,919
color on the left there.

So if you can all this Jamaica will

789
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,760
become so rich

790
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,079
we're succeeding

791
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,079
so we don't we can't ex

792
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,640
out Jamaica we don't

793
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:22,838
need that

794
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,839
pretty trippy eh

795
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,599
So the finishing product

[Music]

797
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,118
sorry if you don't mind.

798
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,039
That's

799
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,240
from there. Where's the hash man?

800
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,680
You need to get up and see your own

801
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,800
product, man. Here's what we're able to

802
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:12,239
do. So, hash in the screen. Pressure and

803
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,519
the oil came right out. Solventless oil.

804
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:18,318
So, that's hash oil, not herb oil. It's

805
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:21,519
a little bit different. That's hash oil.

806
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:25,318
That's what hash oil is. So, it'll be

807
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,318
strong and thick.

808
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:33,000
And the quality of the hash depends on

809
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:39,679
the

810
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,679
return of 5 g of oil 50%

[Music]

812
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:53,119
oil. It has a

813
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:56,799
name. So that's what this one is.

814
00:41:53,119 --> 00:42:00,050
It's the essential oil and on the plant

815
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,139
that creates the medicine.
