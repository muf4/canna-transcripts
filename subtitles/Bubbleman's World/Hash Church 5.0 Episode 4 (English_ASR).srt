00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,520

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,439
Thomas from Grandmaster LED who kind of

25
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,718
walked me through it the other day and

26
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,798
uh that's amazing for those of you that

27
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:53,399
don't know what I'm talking about uh we

28
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,600
usually create a live

29
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,718
video on YouTube a week before the show

30
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:02,718
and what happens is is that when I go

31
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,519
live it almost always creates a

32
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,199
different link so all the people that

33
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,199
are waiting in the room have to move and

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,039
we have to uh you know go to another

35
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,560
room and today we didn't have to do that

36
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,479
so yeah look at that me and skunkman Sam

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,159
in the room just the two of us for now I

38
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,840
think we got a decent show happening

39
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,639
today we got a couple of new folks that

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,080
are going to be coming in for the

41
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:26,518
conversation we had a great show last

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,920
week for those of you that haven't

43
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:35,159
noticed I am broken in a way I have

44
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:37,280
broken my clavicle about 4 days ago I uh

45
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,719
was skateboarding at the skateboard park

46
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,318
in Whistler uh it was my son's 10th

47
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,919
birthday and I was having a blast just

48
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:46,158
ripping around the skate park uh and I

49
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,238
came down a real steep embankment I came

50
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:52,639
around the corner and I was flying and I

51
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,239
hit a rock and that rock utterly and

52
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,518
completely crushed me I'm just going to

53
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,480
mute you there real quick uh Sam uh that

54
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,599
rock actually just stopped me dead I

55
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,878
flew off my skateboard 10 to 15 feet

56
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,280
into the air uh and I landed on my

57
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,878
shoulder quite hard I would say the

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,400
equivalent of like your good buddy

59
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:16,399
hitting you with a bat at about

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,239
70% and uh now I'm now I've got a broken

61
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,400
uh clavicle so nothing shall stop us

62
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,560
here at hash Church nor rain nor shine

63
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,599
nor broken clavicle I will be here and

64
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,158
uh yeah that's what happens

65
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:35,438
Mojave so what did you do I broke my no

66
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:37,959
no oh my god dude wow and you did this

67
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:41,680
in the last week

68
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,799
yeah did you do it on August 27th no I

69
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,000
didn't and I'm sure it was not nearly as

70
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,840
fun as how you broke your clavicle dude

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,719
I'm telling you that but yeah I just

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,039
accidentally kicked the freaking

73
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:56,120
baseboard mess goofing around with my f

74
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,039
my son so I was also playing with my son

75
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,239
at the Whistler skate park he was it's

76
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:03,199
his 10th birthday him and his Budd are

77
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,640
all on scooters and I'm skateboarding

78
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,798
and uh yeah I just I hit a rock going a

79
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:11,399
super high speed it made that

80
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:14,959
sound and then I flew and when I landed

81
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,519
I just remember like o like the the most

82
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,879
insane sound and how I knew I was hurt

83
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,879
before I knew I was hurt because the

84
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,759
adrenaline pumps through your body so

85
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,519
fast was when I heard all the 20

86
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,800
somethings in the skate park like at

87
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:33,599
least 15 of them go o

88
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,038
when I heard that I was like oh that was

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,840
that was probably bad and so you know 20

90
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:42,279
minutes later I'm at like world class

91
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:45,198
Hospital top trauma people I got a tank

92
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,918
of nitrous oxide with my own regulator

93
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,919
you know she's I'm just sucking on that

94
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:50,758
nitrous oxide because I told them I

95
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:52,639
don't take the opioids they they you

96
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,919
know I I hyper metabolize those things

97
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,680
and they make me feel really really sick

98
00:04:54,918 --> 00:05:02,719
but uh I have to admit it was neat to

99
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,800
take um nitrous oxide not like at a fish

100
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,280
show it really

101
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,079
works yeah it's it's wild it didn't make

102
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,758
me dizzy it didn't usually any of that

103
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,399
stuff just makes me feel weird um I also

104
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,680
wasn't on a psychedelic so it was the

105
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:19,359
first time I think I'd ever tried

106
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,879
nitrous not tripping balls um so yeah it

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,639
was uh it was what it what it was what

108
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:28,399
it was both you and I uh are broken

109
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:32,360
today yeah did you have a gravity

110
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,279
event a gravity event yes I did have a

111
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,840
gravity event I had a I had a major

112
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:38,159
gravity event and uh let me tell you for

113
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,679
those people that don't believe in

114
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:46,720
gravity it's real I can I can assure you

115
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,800
it is real and uh it it hurts when uh

116
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,759
when you fall down like that I've never

117
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,800
broken a clavicle I've broken most of my

collar bone that was five weeks of

138
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:50,240
immobility this is uh not so bad pretty

139
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:53,160

140
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,639
talking about my broken

141
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,599
bone iPhone 64 is that uh Mas Edgar is

142
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,879
that you Masonic yeah that's me I'm

143
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,839
getting in here I'm learning how to use

144
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:07,319
this real quick there we go

145
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,439
boom boom what's up homie what's up G

146
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,680
how you guys doing good to have you on

147
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,639
bro all broken up but uh we've already

148
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,959
been through that so now it's uh

149
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,918
probably about starting to hit some dabs

150
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,918
and let me tell you about the

151
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,038
pain uh reducing benefits of cannabis

152
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:25,240
you really feel it when you crush

153
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,038
yourself and get hurt and I believe Wade

154
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,280
was talking about that either last week

155
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,918
or the week before you know spending so

156
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,439
much of his life really preparing

157
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,598
cannabis for for people who really need

158
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,399
it but being on the other side of it and

159
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,639
I believe that he said something like

160
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,560
you know I feel blessed that I'm now on

161
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,639
this side and I'm able to use cannabis

162
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,120
and see it from a really firsthand point

163
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,918
you know when you get something serious

164
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,680
like Wade has um I mean obviously we've

165
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,839
been preaching it but when you get into

166
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,400
it like even my wife was like are those

167
00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:00,679
gummies really helping you I'm like

168
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:04,439
unbelievably so no Tylenol no Ville no

169
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,519
Tylenol 3es just cannabis uh

170
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:10,158
wonderfulness hell yeah dude this really

171
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,680
works it's a thca bomb and a friend of

172
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:14,120
mine makes it and you know I'm I'm a

173
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,800
skeptic about everything in life you

174
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,120
know I like to know but this stuff

175
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,960
really works and for a while I was like

176
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,639
oh my buddy gave it to me and when I rub

177
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,638
it on my elbow of course I'm going to

178
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,478
think good thoughts and feel happy

179
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,840
emotions and you know cure my little

180
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:31,079
pains but after doing this for a while

181
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:34,519
this thca with some other little stuff

182
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:37,759
it amazing pain

183
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,918
relief yeah I agree man I I find that

184
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:43,639
some of the topicals um at high dose

185
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,319
milligrams like 7,000 CB you know 7,000

186
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:50,879
milligrams CBD

187
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:53,200
7200 really actually helps um and canono

188
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:56,639
as well but yeah that brings up a

189
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,278
problem because agreed medicinal dosage

190
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:03,679
is a higher dosage and your States side

191
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:05,200
we're limiting dosage right because uh

192
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,278
at least here in California you're

193
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:13,040
limited to 100 milligrams dosage per Etc

194
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:16,360
and so since 2018 it's been a problem

195
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:19,519
for my serious medical patients to find

196
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,800
quality high dosage

197
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,240
products you know because of exactly

198
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,078
what you stated you know Marcus uh I

199
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,720
broke something I'm in a lot of pain I

200
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:33,199
need something now and you can't you can

201
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,240
get that Marcus and I'm glad you can I'm

202
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,680
glad you're able to find dosages that

203
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,839
work but this is a conundrum on the

204
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,439
ground for the individual patient still

205
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,480
that we are unable to get the medicine

206
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,839
needed depending on the legislation

207
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,720
within the state so yeah you're not

208
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,000
wrong it's that way in Canada too

209
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,720
unfortunately we obviously have a weird

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,919
thing in Canada we've got this Federal

211
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,200
legalization thing going on we've got

212
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,879
medical so if you're a medical patient

213
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,720
there's sort of access obviously when it

214
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,039
was only medical and everyone was hiding

215
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,200
behind it to protect their grow I'm not

216
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:10,639
judging I'm just saying that's what was

217
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,680
happening um it was more accessible the

218
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:17,519
minute recreational came in all of the

219
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:20,319
medical people just jumped into message

220
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,519
just let mute you real quick um they

221
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,040
just it's not accessible here either

222
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,360
basically 10 milligrams is the limit uh

223
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,879
that you can get in Canada now you can

224
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,440
go to a Rec store and buy a grand of

225
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:36,399
live resin or live rosin or distillate

226
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,920
for anywhere from probably 15 to $30 so

227
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,919
if you have a little bit of knowledge

228
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:43,759
you can go buy extracts and crockpot it

229
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:45,759
in your own uh in your own uh you know

230
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,159
MCT or coconut oil or whatever else

231
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,078
you're choosing as a carrier but that's

232
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,639
unacceptable for patients you're you

233
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,319
know imagine if you were like oh well

234
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,919
you can buy insulin but you actually

235
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,760
have to prepare it like uh you just have

236
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,399
to prepare your insulin before it's

237
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:03,879
actually usable so it's a little un

238
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,440
unreasonable here still as well um I I'm

239
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,958
I'm truly a 10 milligram guy I can you

240
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,560
know when I'm hurt I'll probably take

241
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,159
you know four or five of those in a day

242
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:15,159
which is still only 50 uh milligrams

243
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:18,319
whereas my homie Thomas from Grandmaster

244
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:19,958
LED I mean he took 2400 milligrams on

245
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,440
the plane ride the last time I went to

246
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:25,599
Germany with him and didn't die like

247
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,800
didn't like wasn't a zombie wasn't uh

248
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,680
you know blubbering and slobbering and

249
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,199
like was completely 100% present and so

250
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,759
we all also have different

251
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,200
metabolization rates we all are affected

252
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:41,120
by cannabinoids uh differently and so

253
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,920
you know I I do feel for the patients

254
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,919
that have that sort of slow

255
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:49,039
metabolization like Thomas and and

256
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:52,000
really requires large

257
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:54,799
doses to to not have it be available is

258
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,120
a is a pretty big bummer for

259
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:59,879
sure yeah and I I have a high tolerance

260
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,399
to THC as well edible so it's like and I

261
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:05,078
make my own for that reason because I

262
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,919
don't want to ingest so much sugar you

263
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:08,199
know like when it's just like someone

264
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,599
gave me a drink and they're like 10

265
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,278
milligram drinks and I'm like man I have

266
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,759
to drink five of these and that's insane

267
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:15,278
or if they're gummies or whatever it's

268
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,799
like I have to drink eat all these it's

269
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,600
like just give me a therapeutic dose in

270
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,559
an edible form though it's nice to you

271
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,040
know yeah yeah no I I I shout out White

272
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,559
Rabbit because uh it's a local company

273
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,559
here I bumped into them a while ago you

274
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,278
know this dude Dave was just that event

275
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:32,679
I went to called the collector's cup and

276
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:33,958
he was way off in the corner and he was

277
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,599
giving away gummies and they were like

278
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,879
the square gummies and they kind of had

279
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,759
the little bit of you know cane sugar on

280
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:42,360
them so I'd seen this style before but

281
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,799
when I tasted his he had like habanero

282
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,000
mango and banana Maca and he had these

283
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,519
like he had an actual formulator working

284
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,078
with his company that was actually

285
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,759
producing these flavor profiles based on

286
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:54,559
the flavor profiles of the volatile

287
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,319
organic compounds that were present in

288
00:12:54,559 --> 00:13:00,759
the plant and I thought this is [ __ ]

289
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,920
awesome um no no real sugar a tiny

290
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,439
little bit of cane sugar he was

291
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,879
sweetening them with brown rice syrup uh

292
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,519
you know they were all vegan they were

293
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,039
all just like incredible like the the

294
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,440
quality in the caliber and I thought

295
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,319
well this is a good idea to you know

296
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,360
make this available there's other

297
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,278
gummies on the market I was I was taking

298
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,079
these pearls for a while but it's sugar

299
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:21,838
right and if you're consistently taking

300
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,399
these things you know and you're doing

301
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,880
it sort of for you know the benefit of

302
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,278
your health you it probably doesn't take

303
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,600
much to figure out that you know

304
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:32,198
consuming sugar on a daily basis any

305
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,879
extra considering they put it in your

306
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:37,919
bread and all your condiments and just

307
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:40,799
everything to to to consume a low amount

308
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,599
of sugar is truly to be a conscious

309
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,198
human being in today's day and age

310
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,079
because it is difficult I saw a guy the

311
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,639
other day and this I don't think we have

312
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:50,479
these up in Canada we might it was a

313
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,000
Dunkin Donuts and he got this pumpkin

314
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,480
latte spice thing it was like a big

315
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,559
milkshake and this thing had

316
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,440
185 gram of [ __ ] sugar now this is

317
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,039
like Diet diabetes all day long and now

318
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,199
that we're getting to the point where

319
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:09,759
people are starting to realize that type

320
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:12,078
3 diabetes is dementia that's

321
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:16,320
Alzheimer's disease that's the loss of

322
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:18,198
access to your uh memories and so as

323
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,040
they put that connection and I I think

324
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:22,719
it was I don't know if it was huberman

325
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,679
or one of these other podcast medical

326
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,839
guys that was the first person I saw

327
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:29,519
mention that no it was actually uh the

328
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:31,480
dude that uh turned Dana White Health

329
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,879
around I can't remember him he's another

330
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,278
uh kind of online doctor dude and I I

331
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,120
was like no that can't be true and the

332
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,879
more and more I searched it the more and

333
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,078
more I realized yeah like almost every

334
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,439
country in the world Associates type 3

335
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:46,278
diabetes with dementia and Alzheimer's

336
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,000
North America is kind of the only

337
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:51,838
countries that don't associate it as

338
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,600
that so I know this has a a special

339
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,000
place in in your heart Colin as you have

340
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:01,000
a loved one suffering from uh from

341
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,198
Alzheimer's and Dementia so just uh yeah

342
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,120
keep it's an interesting topic because

343
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,838
it's you know and Parkinson's really is

344
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,000
the main focus for us all the other

345
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,480
those dementia is setting in slowly but

346
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,120
you're it's it's interesting when you've

347
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,839
seen a healthy person go through a

348
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,120
neurological disease and then all this

349
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:22,720
other constituent start to cave in on it

350
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,000
and seeing cannaboids in the mix on that

351
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,959
at high doses I mean you're seeing I'm

352
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,600
seeing things that I can't explain like

353
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:33,198
Full Stop on Tremors

354
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,199
um being able to talk better um better

355
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,758
use of their muscles um it's just all

356
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:40,439
over man but it's yeah and that's where

357
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,839
I think just better product to your

358
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,199
point ATN is like it's just needed man

359
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,920
like we're just in a in a weird modality

360
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:50,000
right now where everyone it's not it's

361
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,679
not just that it's exactly what you're

362
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,879
talking about that scene it's not just

363
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:57,039
high dosage one of the earlier things we

364
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,720
learned in the medical community here in

365
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:02,679
California was that again all of our

366
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:06,600
products were made by patients because

367
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:11,000
of their medical needs so we had Suka we

368
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:14,399
had various types of natural sugar

369
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,919
products available low glycemic all

370
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,759
kinds of different things that people

371
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:23,120
were making unfortunately due to the

372
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,959
legalization here in California we lost

373
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,600
almost 99% of all those products and

374
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,719
product lines because they could not

375
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,120
make

376
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,839
that leap and so what you're talking

377
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,919
about dietarily especially due to sugar

378
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,240
is a huge problem in conundrum as you

379
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:44,039
said because what's the most easy to

380
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,240
find product on the market gummies

381
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:48,559
gummies are everywhere and every Gummy

382
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,839
has sugar in it if not then it has the

383
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:54,278
fake sugars and we know those fake

384
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:56,600
sugars are a huge problem depending on

385
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:57,919
your disease and Etc and what you're

386
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,120
going through and we know if you have

387
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:04,279
Cancers and things like that you should

388
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:07,199
be avoiding sugars Al together um you

389
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:09,199
know outright because sugar helps feed

390
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,558
those cancers depending on the type of

391
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:16,519
cancer Etc so you know proper

392
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:20,240
dietary uh choices just having non sugar

393
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:21,639
choices that are healthy where are they

394
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,359
are they accessible to you because

395
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,160
they're not accessible to me so much as

396
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,078
they used to be and that's a huge

397
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,360
conundrum when high I've just found out

398
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,240
I'm stage four

399
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:35,159
and the only thing available to me is

400
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,038
all sugar products so consumers watching

401
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,038
you need to talk to manufacturers and

402
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,599
demand these things that's why we

403
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:44,400
carried them originally when we realized

404
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,519
oh I'm diabetic and I need this type of

405
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,240
product because there's no other type of

406
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:51,558
product on the market for me and if you

407
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,519
don't know it then create it if you have

408
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:55,558
something that works for you that's why

409
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,519
a lot of these product manufacturers

410
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,720
started off they realize I don't have

411
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:02,599
access access I have to create it and

412
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,720
now that I have created it now I have to

413
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:08,158
manufacture it yeah but I think it goes

414
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,839
back to what you're saying it's like the

415
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:13,000
you know you have to be a super fan and

416
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:16,399
also really connected to the plant to

417
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,038
understand that need right and that it's

418
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,000
you know we talk about this a lot in

419
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:22,839
music where whole the industry basically

420
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,359
sold the cataloges to these streaming

421
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:26,879
services for Equitable positions in

422
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,558
those companies right and the only way

423
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,799
they get paid is through the streaming

424
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,000
which gives them better Equitable

425
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:34,400
positions right right and it's almost

426
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,839
the same situation in Canabis where

427
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,080
people like us who really care are

428
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,399
connected to it are not in

429
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,240
positions more often than the not we're

430
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,559
not in positions to make these products

431
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,839
because those people that are making

432
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:46,558
those products don't have the same

433
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:48,720
connection they don't understand the

434
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,440
same need of patients they're looking

435
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,798
at profit and loss we're looking at

436
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,279
patient needs right and then whatever

437
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:58,158
else comes after it it can even be taken

438
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,240
further back in the sense Colin and I

439
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:01,919
like the way pivoted this because it's

440
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,919
not just the products it's not just the

441
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,038
creation of the products it's really why

442
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,360
we invited Masonic into the room today

443
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,158
it's why we wanted to talk about

444
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,959
breeding it's about the bottom line is

445
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,000
is that these companies that would want

446
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,000
to control this and create these

447
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,159
products and bring them to Market and

448
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,880
stabilize and shelf you know all of

449
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:24,280
these different things they don't have

450
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,760
the connection to the production and the

451
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:29,839
creation of these unique volatile

452
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:33,158
organic compound profiles these unique

453
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:35,558
canabo profiles although a lot is thca I

454
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:40,760
will admit I you know even when we made

455
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:42,798
cultivars that had CBC and thcv and cbga

456
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:44,839
and all of these other canabo most

457
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,839
people in the dabbing World anyway just

458
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:49,839
thought it was weird it's got a weird

459
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:51,759
texture cbga in particular is a weird

460
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,359
texture if you're a big Dabber and you

461
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,679
start dabbing that you'll be like oh

462
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,719
this is this is waxy and weird I don't

463
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,640
think I like this very much but the

464
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,360
bottom line is is when you look at all

465
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,360
of these incredible cultivars that have

466
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:09,119
been produced and and I remember Wendy

467
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:11,399
uh Turner uh uh um what's his her son's

468
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:15,599
name how am I spacing on his name right

469
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:18,360
now uh Crohn's disease uh the Colton

470
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,319
exactly Colton Turner so when she came

471
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,439
in and she was like I thank you guys

472
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,000
because I said you're such a middle

473
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,279
American mom like you must look at us

474
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,279
like we're a bunch of hippies and she's

475
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,359
like I love you guys more than you'll

476
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:30,558
ever imagine you guys were the keepers

477
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:32,359
of the plant you guys were the ones that

478
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,399
kept these plants alive all of these

479
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:37,158
years so that Colton could come along

480
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,559
learn about this gain access to plants

481
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:41,480
and and be able to turn his Crohn's

482
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:43,879
around in a way that we had never seen

483
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,279
before so there's this connection of the

484
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,200
roots of the people who like skunkman

485
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,158
Sam who traveled to all these hash

486
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,240
producing countries who planted these

487
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:54,120
insane amount of seeds who collected

488
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,599
these

489
00:20:54,119 --> 00:21:00,158
incredible um you know cultivars in

490
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,558
order to use as breeding stock and now

491
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,720
you know we've gone down so many

492
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,839
generations and there's people like

493
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,120
Masonic and there's people like flux and

494
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,759
and Ramone and all of these incredible

495
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:16,038
people that are just keeping this work

496
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:17,720
alive to me that is the basis of all of

497
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:19,640
everything that we're talking about that

498
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,960
is the most important factor and that's

499
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,038
kind of what we're going to be talking

500
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,720
about today pheno hunting and breeding

501
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:29,519
and and how selection is done I know

502
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,079
that how Sam did it is probably very

503
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,359
different from how people are doing it

504
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:36,399
now with populations being so decreased

505
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:39,038
um a lot of people are doing incredible

506
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,240
work really in like their homes you know

507
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,440
whereas Sam was doing incredible work in

508
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,038
fields so I kind of just want to open up

509
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,159
that discussion welcome Masonic to to be

510
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:50,119
speaking about this uh with us I know

511
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,159
you've had some incredible lines dude I

512
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:54,599
know that some of the the cultivars that

513
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,880
you've produced have created just some

514
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,158
absolutely insane hashes so we're really

515
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,200
stoked to have you here today and

516
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,760
Stoke to uh maybe have you tell us a

517
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,360
little bit about kind of how you got

518
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:09,839
into this and where your specialty lies

519
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,599
in regards to how you um how you choose

520
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,199
your breeding stock and how you choose

521
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,199
your your

522
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:19,199
fenos yeah and the other thing I want to

523
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,720
say about Masonic is you know you know

524
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,159
we we met a few years ago in person and

525
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,440
we really kind of connected on this

526
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,760
concept of the love of of flavor

527
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,200
profiles and then we started talking

528
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:33,519
about music and you know one thing I

529
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,558
noticed about Edgar and Masonic is that

530
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,798
he he doesn't need permission he just he

531
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:39,399
does what he feels and I think that's

532
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,720
kind of the spirit of everyone here on

533
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,559
the panel is like what we came up in was

534
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,519
we didn't have permission it just was we

535
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,038
we were we were drawn to this in a way

536
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:51,480
that was it was it was bigger than us

537
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:54,000
right and you're you're continuing that

538
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,038
um that spirit in a way that allows you

539
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,480
to connect with culture make friends and

540
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,759
build your own little culture around

541
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,640
that and that's to me that's that's what

542
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,000
it's all about man you know and that's

543
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,759
that's it's great to see you so

544
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,079
connected and just loving what you're

545
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,240
doing like his genuine love that I see

546
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,558
you know so it's it's very cool to see

547
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,679
that and you know just he's working with

548
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:21,639
shis berry Marcus again and to hear like

549
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,919
that come up as a varietal 25 years

550
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,080
removed from when we touched it and had

551
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,520
like good success with it is is amazing

552
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,158
and kind of brings a full circle for me

553
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:31,839
so I think it'd be great I saw that this

554
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,600
morning dude and it made me talk about

555
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,959
all that and just kind

556
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:39,119
of go ahead yeah just tell us about it

557
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,960

558
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,798
that bid in there to give you give the

559
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,600
viewers you know the color that you know

560
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,558
you're doing your thing through passion

561
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:51,519
man you know yeah thank you guys uh for

562
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:54,639
starters for letting me be a part of

563
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,720
this I'm uh you know I I was on here

564
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,640
before but it's a night and day you know

565
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,720
you know from last time I was here I

566
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,720
feel as far as head space um but I I uh

567
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,360
I I started smoking weed like everybody

568
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,038
I'd imagine you know we we love smoking

569
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,918
weed and next thing you know I ran out

570
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:14,640
of this really quality bag of weed that

571
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,120
I had gotten one U High School summer

572
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,960
when I graduated my father gave me a

573
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:20,399
pound of Sour Diesel and I lost that

574
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,759
pound of Sour Diesel because I wasn't

575
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,600
necessarily the best Hustler I was more

576
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:27,278
so a consumer and you know next thing

577
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,079
you know the thing's gone and I'm like

578
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:29,919
yo how do we get this going again and

579
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,199
I'm like I'm going to have to start

580
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,880
growing it so I started like from like

581
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,720
I'm 18 years old and then I'm probably

582
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,600
growing for like till you know just

583
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,519
growing pumping out the yard to like

584
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:48,079
2016 and all I knew was I didn't know

585
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:51,918
anything about like you know

586
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:54,519
um males and females make seeds all I

587
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,600
knew was kill the ones that are males

588
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,599
and leave all the girls and you know

589
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:01,119
you'll be happy so that's what I did for

590
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:03,278
like 6 years and then I opened you know

591
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,918
I I found out about fors and little

592
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,440
forms like uh never got into any of them

593
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,759
though I would go look into it and I

594
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,519
would just look away I'd be like n

595
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,240
that's too much for me like I'm going

596
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:14,798
just go back to this remedial landscape

597
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,319
you know and I would just do my do my

598
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,519
gardening i' blow up the garden to the

599
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:22,240
best of my ability so that's what I was

600
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,480
doing and then 2016 came along and um

601
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,599
that's when I finally opened up

602
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,960
Instagram and it wasn't through YouTube

603
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,439
it wasn't through the fors it wasn't

604
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,399
through anything else that I seen this

605
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,080
Big World of uh Growers you know there's

606
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:35,079
just a bunch of people that are growing

607
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:36,639
and they're open about it you know even

608
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:38,918
around that time people were still kind

609
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,840
of like do we show this off do we not

610
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,278
show this off on Instagram and uh I I

611
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,439
was like oh cool this is cool a lot of

612
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,880
people to take a muse from so I started

613
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:52,798
just imitating the greats from there and

614
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,799
you know um the the breeding kind of

615
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:59,319
came cuz I had tools like I had a

616
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:00,558
Tropicana cherry pie Tangi before F2 was

617
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:02,960
invented which was one of the better

618
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:05,398
hash varieties so I was growing that

619
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,120
Tropicana on Instagram and people were

620
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:09,079
taking notice I didn't necessarily know

621
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,199
what I had at the time I just was

622
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:13,079
associating with people that vibed with

623
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,200
me so they gave me tools to help me in

624
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,480
my journey unknowingly that was Bloom at

625
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,519
the time you know so I'm just like cool

626
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,599
I'm already in good graces of Bloom

627
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,359
still am to this day he's one of my you

628
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,000
know first mentors first person that

629
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,839
ever gave me seeds and he's the guy

630
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,319
behind papaya Tropicana all that good

631
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:32,839
stuff so he had gave me the precursors

632
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:34,879
to the Tropicana F2 wave and I'm growing

633
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:36,558
them and people are taking notice and

634
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,360
I'm like cool I got something cool I

635
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,278
even noticed at the time jungle boys was

636
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:42,359
growing the same seed stock variety that

637
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:45,640
I was and I'm just like cool like I'm on

638

639
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,080
seeds got made with those seeds and I'm

640
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,599
like very transparent about my Approach

641
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,558
like I like I show everything I'm like

642

are like I'll take one you know and I'll

645
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,240
be like here I send it to a person

646
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,240
around the way and and keep in mind I've

647
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,120
been growing for like six years just

648
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,120
blowing up the backyard blowing up the

649
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,479
backyard filling up the garage you know

650
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,959
uh breaking down all the weed I would

651
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,079
blast a lot like since 2012 I was open

652
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,880
blasting I might have done a little five

653
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:21,439
gallon bucket wash here and there but it

654
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,919
it like the squeeze wasn't worth it I

655
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,200
was like n like let's not do that let's

656
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,559
just keep blasting it you know and so we

657
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,399
did open blasting for a very long time

658
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:32,678
like 20 12 till like I started till I

659
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,239
reached Instagram and back to the the

660
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,679
trop can cherry pangi those seeds got

661
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,278
made people started inquiring I started

662
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,320
kind of like liking it like oh that's

663
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:44,599
cool like that is that you know like oh

664
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:47,119
this is kind of like you know um part of

665
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:49,519
that plant is in this seed stock but I

666
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,038
always kept seeds from straight plants

667
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,399
anyway so it was always a thing that I

668
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:57,119
did but this time it was like people

669
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:59,038
were inquiring and then I had a mail and

670
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,759
even then I wasn't convinced sh I was

671
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,519
like N I don't want to make seeds yet

672
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:05,079
because I have to blast all this stuff

673
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,038
to make like anything worth it you know

674
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,439
in order to even consume it you know

675
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:10,240
because that's what it's all about

676
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,320
because I would smoke my own weed and I

677
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,839
just had enough to nickel and dime on

678
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,200
the you know Compton Boulevard I would

679
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:18,000
literally sell my weed and on Central in

680
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,399
Downtown LA like I would literally go to

681
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,599
the shadiest places to go sell my uh my

682
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:26,599
shatter that I made with my open Nug Run

683
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,558
but that's what I did and then I had a

684
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:30,519
Mel I'm I'm bouncing back and forth I

685
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,038
had a mail and I and I advertised it on

686
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:34,399
Instagram I was like yo who wants this

687
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:36,759

caner pangi mail who wants it somebody

689
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:40,720
raised their hand almost immediately I

690
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,398
gave them the mail I'm not thinking

691
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,200

692
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,079

744

Wilson was born that's banana OG papaya

752
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,919
Tropicana F2 so it everything just kind

753
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,200
of just natural organically with the

754
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,880
good graces of the breeder and then kind

755
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,679
of just being a team player you know and

756
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,919
that's how Wilson was born and that was

757
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,679
somewhere around like 17 I want to

758
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:20,000
say nice dude I love to hear the story

759
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,840
of how Wilson was born that's [ __ ]

760
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,558
awesome yeah I love how you got called

761
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:27,158
into it too you know there's so many

762
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:29,119
different ways to to feel the pull and

763
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:30,720
and you know kind of like Colin was

764
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,879
saying you don't have to you know just

765
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,839
go do your thing you know follow your

766
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,440
journey and let that journey lead you

767
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:39,278
towards it's these people who have this

768
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,919
Obsession what I've noticed is and I

769
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:43,359
don't know if we share like a heightened

770
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:47,000
o Factory or if it's just this utter and

771
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:49,719
complete passion and love of cannabis

772
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,119
that just you know just leads you down

773
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:55,319
this pathway and if you don't fight it

774
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,158
it's it it can be absolutely incredible

775
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:59,480
which I feel like everyone here on the

776
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:01,639
panel has fought it and has sort of

777
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,159
followed that pathway and we all kind of

778
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:06,319
ended up in different places we all look

779
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,760
up to each other at for different

780
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,720
aspects but uh yeah dude that is uh

781
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,638
that's a great story man Bill recognize

782
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:18,720
is real right we we see people with

783
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:22,558
passion right others who taught us

784
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,079
saw their passion in us and so they

785
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:27,158
lifted us up right and so that's our

786
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:29,960
responsibility and that's why we

787
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:32,399
volunteer time here at hash Church to

788
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,639
spread and teach because we were taught

789
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,719
many of us for free with the only

790
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:40,479
expense being pay it for it in the

791
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,600
future and we're very fortunate to have

792
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,919
the ability and the freedom now to speak

793
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:45,798
because all of us used to hide

794
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,600
underground just like you were talking

795
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:50,918
about you had to go find your people and

796
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,798
they had to absorb you and trust you you

797
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:54,720
have to build that trust and that is

798
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:57,079
something we were all forced to do

799
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,960
because it used to be illegal and so

800
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:01,079
that was another camaraderie that we

801
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,720
used to you know rally around I used to

802
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,158
only hire activists because we were

803
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,079
expecting to get arrested every day now

804
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:11,000
I don't have to do that because you know

805
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:13,038
we've changed and the things shifted but

806
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,440
you're carrying on the

807
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:18,398
noble and I consider the Growers the

808
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,960
most noblest of them all of us because

809
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:21,359
you're the ones that have been

810
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,759
perpetuating you're the ones who have

811
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,798
been taking the risk you are dealing

812
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:28,158
with the risk of how you grow where you

813
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:31,200
grow and what you grow to keep it safe

814
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,039
clean and proper and me and my patients

815
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,159

816
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:39,000

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,720
and great respect to all you Growers

818
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,159
yeah and Shout Out shout out to breeder

819
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Steve I saw that post you made today

820
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,720
Masonic put a smile on my face you know

821
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,079
that was that was the birth of Bubble

822
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:54,159
Bags the shisha Berry because I had

823
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:57,319
tried the isolator bags um the two bag

824
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,480
system and I just wasn't I wasn't stoked

825
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:03,240
this was in like 98 I guess I moved to

826
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,919
British Columbia in '96 from Manitoba

827
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,278
after doing that whole hemp thing out

828
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,838
there came out here the only friend I

829
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:13,480
really had was Hillary black and Hillary

830
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:16,440
linked me up uh pretty early on with um

831
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,679
with breeder Steve and so by 98 when I

832
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,200
was trying these bags and kind of sort

833
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,838
of figuring out that I might end up

834
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,878
doing my own bags what led me to that

835
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:26,559
was the first time I ever ran Shish

836
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,279
Berry cuz Steve had called me up and he

837
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,398
was like look I got some shish fishberry

838
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,679
it's the yellow line uh it's really

839
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,719
Frosty trim let's let's let's try those

840
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,240
bags and it actually produced a full

841
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:41,078
melt hash from a two bag system so

842
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:43,918
everything from the 190 went into like

843
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:46,480
the 70 Micron bag just full of

844
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:49,239
contaminant and was melting you know

845
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,679
probably not anything like what I when I

846
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:54,398
finally met Sam some years later and

847
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,000
smoked his dry sift and was like oh oh

848
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:59,078
so there are actual levels to this [ __ ]

849
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,800
but still was leading me in and it was

850
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:02,200
probably like a four star I was all

851
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,599
excited about it it was the first time

852
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:06,358
I'd really ever seen it but without that

853
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:08,160
shishkaberry and that shishkaberry I

854
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:09,960
mean I could tell a lot of stories

855
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,239
because Steve was very close I had

856
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,280
access to both the red and the yellow

857
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,439
and I smoked that weed all over the

858
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,680
world and had that weed for hash making

859
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,920
and it was just uh every time when I

860
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:24,679
first smelt um the Barb from um great

861
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,400
Gardener immediately knew it was Shish

862
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:31,440
Berry when I first smoked the Nicole

863
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,880
from maros in Colombia Al alesandro I

864
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,838
immediately knew that he used

865
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,760
shishkaberry it's just this crazy

866
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:40,838
dominant flavor profile that is

867
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,720
unmistakable yet I haven't seen actual

868
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:47,400
shisher in like 25 years so be nice to

869
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,399
see that come

870
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:54,279
back that's gota we gotta run those

871
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:55,358
seeds from you you know the the shisu

872
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,680
berry

873
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,318
sounds if you can find a shisu berry

874
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:01,000
leaner in there it seems like even with

875
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:04,719
your Wilson attached to it it seems like

876
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,719
it it may it may improve the line you so

877
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:12,598
the shis berry came through me U via

878
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:15,318
hash jar so uh triple og ice house melts

879
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:18,039
he he won Legends of hash first place

880
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:20,880
with a a pink 57 which is a shishka

881
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:23,039
berry old Widow that's that's what uh

882

that's what they have so he he came to

883
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,838
my house like be like around the time he

884
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:32,000
had won second place with the lemon dog

885
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:34,239
[ __ ] he came to my to my garden and he

886
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,079
whips out this jar and I'm like yo what

887
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,039
the [ __ ] is this like this is like like

888
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:40,519
in that papaya realm you know at the

889
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,519
time I was telling them like this is

890
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:44,639
that fruity stuff it's not there's no

891
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:46,480
light on this what is this he's like

892
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,960
that's shishka Berry you know and I'm

893
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,199
like I need this you know somehow some

894
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,920
way a shishka berry plant ended up in my

895
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:56,439
garden and then you know I made seeds

896
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,240
with it and just kept repopulating the

897
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,000
forward line towards all the peach

898
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:03,000
varieties that I thought looked better

899
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,119
than the initial so like that's what I

900
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,960
have as far as seed stock every time you

901
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,519
you hear anything shishco Berry from ma

902
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,079
is the seeds made with that clone but um

903
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:14,838
but that's how I got put on game with it

904
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,680
I smoked I was like yo I need that I

905
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:19,318
ended up with it and then a couple like

906
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,838
years later like a year later I ended up

907
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:24,279
at spannabis I'm just walking through

908
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,679

909

916
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:42,960

924
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,000
work I've done with it and as far as the

925

Clone the legends of hash winning

926

variety and the Barbara bud it's all the

927
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:09,440
same shade of gray you know and then the

928
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,559
Candy shishka Berry just won first place

929
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,679
again with the mix of a starburst and um

930
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,119
you know I could only imagine how good

931
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:19,639
that was but yeah the Shish Berry it's

932
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,160
something old that I'm spotlighting

933
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:22,799
right now like you know that's why I

934
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:24,519

936
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:27,719

937
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,519
breeder Steve I went on Facebook time

938
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:31,159
with him he talked to me like it was you

939
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,838
know one of the coolest combos I've had

940
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:35,639
with a person in the weed industry or or

941
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,559
the game or the culture whatever you

942
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:39,799
want to call it in in in a while but

943
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:42,440
it's just uh it's humbling you know I'm

944
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,720
very very thankful and it's uh it's a

945
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,280
blessing to be around people like that

946
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,879
and have those

947
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,640
Tools H yeah dude well it's important

948
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,318
work you know it's it is really

949
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,199
important work in the sense that it's

950
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:57,639
only the people who have this Obsession

951
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:01,039
that care enough to protect and create

952
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:03,480
these different you know flavor profiles

953
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,639
that are going to end up you know when

954
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,440
they end up in in certain hands they end

955
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:10,639
up becoming the foundation of this

956
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,039
entire medical cannabis you know like we

957
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,078
don't want swag we want like the best

958
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:18,318
that we can and it's interesting how it

959
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:20,039
translates that like the dankest herb

960
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:23,559
that you just can't put down that you

961
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:25,599
just want to keep smoking non-stop also

962
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:28,119
happens to translate to the best

963
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,680
medicine for people that actually don't

964
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:31,318
really have an interest in like the

965
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:32,639
maybe the flavor profiles and all these

966
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:35,599
other things but it's it's an

967
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:38,519
interesting invisible connection that

968
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,680
this Obsession and this love of cannabis

969
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:43,960
has this invisible tether to producing

970
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:46,480
you know these profiles that you know

971
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,599
are great for getting high and I never

972
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,960
uh I never you know that's that's not a

973
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,280
negative I'm like Sam I love getting

974
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,480
high I I would fight for people's rights

975
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,960
to get high there's just like a another

976
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,599
level to it when it's about someone

977
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,519
taking care of their health there's

978
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:02,880
there's it's always been that way for me

979
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:05,199
since I met Hillary black uh and she was

980
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,640
doing the BC Compassion Club and it was

981
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,399
like oh okay so this is different right

982
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:11,159
we over here we've got the hustle and

983
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,079
we're making and selling and flipping

984
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:16,279
and flopping but over here this is like

985
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,200
we gota we got to have there has to be a

986
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,480
level of philanthropy involved this

987
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:22,919
can't be the same over here as it is

988
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,599
over here and unfortunately in Canada

989
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,079
right now it's uh they're pretty much

990
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,480
the same yeah

991
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,039
s way in the states too man it started

992
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,400
out you know 215 we all you know you

993
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:38,440
know before even before 215 it just once

994
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,960
the structure came it just all kind of

995
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:44,639
it seemed to be a ploy to get to where

996
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,079
we're at but as I said before with the

997
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:50,559
music analogy it's sort of where the our

998
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:52,480
industry is at where no one truly owns

999
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,838
anything it's all VCS and a bunch of

1000
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,679
people that are investing and those that

1001
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:58,358
are hanging on are so small that it's

1002
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:01,440
hard to

1003
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:03,719
compete with that at that level and then

1004
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,039
you know it clouds the water right like

1005
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:07,919
who's who's right in that moment right

1006
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:10,960
so it's and then the

1007
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,559
consumer isn't really buying buying with

1008
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,920
their with their brain they're buying

1009
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:15,759
with their back pocket because they're

1010
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,680
going towards price not who they're

1011
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,160
buying it from so well that comes down

1012
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:24,598
to a huge problem and I actually applied

1013
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:26,440
to the dcc's actual oversight board

1014
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,760
because everybody say what's wrong with

1015
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,838
cannabis and they don't

1016
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,440
understand can can I go on a slight diet

1017
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:35,400
tribe for a second and give everybody

1018
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,838
why why we're [ __ ] up here in

1019
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,559
California the D doesn't know cannabis

1020
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:43,559
they don't use cannabis right so they

1021
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,880
don't understand that it's a simple

1022
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:47,920
product right okay let's see all right

1023
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,599
so I have a jar here right and I put a

1024
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,559
small bud in here that small Bud goes in

1025
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,640
this jar this jar is chalk full of

1026
00:41:54,559 --> 00:42:01,000
oxygen right what are the three things

1027
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:03,279
that kill cannabis oxygen light and heat

1028
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,920
right majority of everything of course

1029
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:10,200
is you know in glass containers so we've

1030
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:15,519
talked about this before but if you used

1031
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:18,759
a simple gas ratio of 80% nitrogen 20%

1032
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:21,519
Argon gas and you pumped it in instead

1033
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,680
of leaving this full of oxygen what's

1034
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,280
happened is a major shift and let me

1035
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:28,558
walk you back through some history

1036
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:34,280
people before 28

1037
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:38,280
I purchased from small farmers growing

1038
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:40,720
higher small batch cannabis I would take

1039
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,599
that cannabis I would hold it for three

1040
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:46,558
weeks where I would have it tested I

1041
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:49,559
would have it actually done with a plate

1042
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:52,240
test and then when those were clean then

1043
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:56,079
we would package it into Gams e and

1044
00:42:52,239 --> 00:43:00,519
ounces and maximum I would buy would be

1045
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:04,480
usually three to five kilos per batch

1046
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:08,318
tops Max usually one to two kilos

1047
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:12,559
per that packaged and sold would go out

1048
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:15,679
the door within two weeks maximum Word

1049
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,800
of Mouth Etc again before we're we're

1050
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:20,919
all now just 7-Eleven selling the same

1051
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,318
product prior I had local Regional

1052
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:26,480
farmers and local products like

1053
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:30,440
afgi constants that people would come to

1054
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:34,159
me for because it was fresh cine

1055
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:37,240
Rich small batch cannabis the problem

1056
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:41,440
that we have now post 2018 we've got

1057
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:46,118
large batch cannabis mid-grade some

1058
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,240
high-grade being absolutely uh massacred

1059
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:52,599
from its trimming it's basically

1060
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:55,719
massacred from trimming on down I see as

1061
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:57,760
I travel to large manufacturers they're

1062
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:01,959
putting all the same batch cannabis in

1063
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,559
one huge bag sometimes 10 kilos Plus in

1064
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,679
a bag okay and they're throwing these

1065
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,480
bags around like it's a [ __ ]

1066
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:12,318
football so you've got product being

1067
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:15,000
shaken up not being well taken care of

1068
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:17,920
in non refrigerated environments because

1069
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,440
as we know anything above the room

1070
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,039
temperature of the grow room it was in

1071
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,639
tpes dipin everything is starting to

1072
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:30,558
evaporate right if they're not actually

1073
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:32,879
kept in a safe environment so we're not

1074
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:35,319
refrigerating it keeping it the same way

1075
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,160
as a beer or something has where it's

1076
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:42,079
from manufacturing all the way to the

1077
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:45,078
end two we don't have quality product

1078
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:48,039
that's going out quickly it's it's

1079
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:51,280
tonnage sitting on shells in boxes being

1080
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:53,000
eaten with oxygen and that oxygen in

1081
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,880
that bottle remember as we've talked

1082
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,838
about has church every three months it

1083
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:01,280
chemically Chang es right so it's

1084
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:03,159
actually more CBN and it's degrading

1085
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,640
right well sometimes I get my products

1086
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:10,639
that are six months to a year old at my

1087
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:13,078
dispensary and so you're getting stale

1088
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:16,719
product you're getting fully oxygenated

1089
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:20,039
product in glass jars and not

1090
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:22,759
refrigerated so and of course the big of

1091
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:26,480
the issue of course then is 11% humidity

1092
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,839
for packaging right to do it properly so

1093
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,079
all of these these things are somehow

1094
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:34,078
the conundrum that the you know the the

1095
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,318
department of cannabis control cannot

1096
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,599
somehow understand but we all do because

1097
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:42,759
one I'm a patient two I was a grower and

1098
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,720
I have an understanding as how

1099
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,920
production manufacturing and selling

1100
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:50,558
works so where unfortunately why people

1101
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,440
are going to their local plug is because

1102
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,599
they're getting what they used to get

1103
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,838
fresh turpine Rich cannabis you know as

1104
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,800
opposed to that stale dun [ __ ] we're

1105
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,440
selling in California so that's why if

1106
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,720
people are wondering that's kind of a

1107
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,200
quick synapsis and the department of

1108
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,598
Canabis control doesn't want to force

1109
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:10,519
the manufacturers or Distributors to

1110
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,960
necessarily go through these types of

1111
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:15,920
expenses but if they did you see the

1112
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,199
quality change everything go up so other

1113
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,760
states that are listening we [ __ ] up

1114
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:22,919
you heard how we [ __ ] up do it

1115
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,839
differently than how we did it so that

1116
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,519
you're better dude you nailed that it's

1117
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:30,279
almost like you're an expert on this

1118
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:32,920
subject that's [ __ ] crazy dude can I

1119
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,400
add an anecdote to that aten I think is

1120
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,559
uh interesting is I'm not going to name

1121
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,119
the grower or the or the the product but

1122
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:44,079
I ran into someone who recently won an

1123
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:46,119
award at an event for some old

1124
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:50,400
flow and it's because he knows how to

1125
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:53,200
store his flow and literally it was past

1126
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,639
past doe past COA right but he entered

1127
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:56,000
it he's like dude this is the bomb's

1128
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:58,239
better than what I have he threw it in

1129
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,358
there and then like talking about the

1130
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:00,919
next competition he's like yeah I'm

1131
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,400
going to throw it in the next one

1132
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,519
too so it'll be like a year and a half

1133
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,119
old at that point but he's just like

1134
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,079
look dude I know how to store flour

1135
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,119
properly there's a way to do it there's

1136
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:14,000
right you know and it's like and and you

1137
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:17,880
can easily have shitty flour from three

1138
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,119
months ago that looks worse than three

1139
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,920
years ago if you do it right you know

1140
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:23,760
that's also true it's all it's all the

1141
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,039
supply chain the cold supply chain if

1142
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,359
you have a cold supply chain there it is

1143
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:30,480
it's like we're all sell spinach in a

1144
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:32,719
warm [ __ ] container and sending it

1145
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,199
across the country and just like oh it's

1146
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,279
sitting in the in the in the warehouse

1147
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,519
for a couple days it's 105 degrees

1148
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,119
Fahrenheit it should be good you open it

1149
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,559
up and it's just [ __ ] like liquid

1150
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:47,079
it's like we need a cold supply chain I

1151
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,480
tell in Canada it's [ __ ] crazy

1152
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:49,960
because when you when you go to the

1153
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,400
store in Canada and it's getting a

1154
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,760
little bit better now they have these

1155
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,960
little extraction fridges now uh that

1156
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,760
they never used to have but what you

1157
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,599
would generally see even like up to a

1158
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,079
year ago and still today in most of the

1159
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,559
shops is you'll see a little fridge and

1160
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,200
if you go to the little

1161
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:09,640
fridge it is full of beverages that have

1162
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:12,799
10 milligrams of distillate in it so the

1163
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:15,598
only thing they're keeping cold are 10

1164
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:18,240
milligram distillate shot you know

1165
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:21,160
nanoemulsified Beverages and that's what

1166
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:24,159
they're keeping cold all of the flour

1167
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:26,199
all of the hash everything is just off

1168
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:28,480
gassing like crazy some of the you know

1169
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:31,679
it's in gets hot in the summer man like

1170
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:34,280
30 40° in Saskatchewan and Manitoba this

1171
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:37,078
is like 100 plus Fahrenheit it's just

1172
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,119
cooking so yes there would be a cost to

1173
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:41,400
keep their vault cold in those in those

1174
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,680
months I think they only are allowed to

1175
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,280
display packaging so it's kind of like I

1176
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,399
mean you can put kind of buds out but

1177
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,040
people realize quick that the way the

1178
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,720
Canadian um you know regulatory

1179
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:54,440
framework works is if you take flour out

1180
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,959
and you have it on display you have to

1181
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,440
destroy said flour can't even give it

1182
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,199
away you can't like offer it for free or

1183
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,960
at a discount you have to destroy said

1184
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:05,480
flowers so it becomes very expensive for

1185
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,880
these shops to be opening up flour just

1186
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,199
so people can see it and not even

1187
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,760
basically smell it it's a it's a

1188
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:14,118
complete and total nightmare without the

1189
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,319
cold chain and with without it you you

1190
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:18,838
will never they are so obsessed with

1191
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,920
stabilizing cannabis that they don't

1192
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:24,078
realize that you cannot really stabilize

1193
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,960
cannabis the best that you can do is you

1194
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:29,920
can make it very cold and you can can

1195
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,838
reduce the you know that vibratory

1196
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,240
frequency that's basically off gassing

1197
00:49:32,838 --> 00:49:38,639
these volatile organic compounds without

1198
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:40,719
that without that slowing it down and uh

1199
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,838
uh Mojave is absolutely correct I had

1200
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:45,679
flour that I grew and

1201
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:48,318
dried well before the fresh frozen days

1202
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:49,838
I threw it in my freezer i c i sucked

1203
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:52,759
the air out of it I threw it in my

1204
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:55,078
freezer it was really not that hard it's

1205
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,440
not it really isn't I had it there for

1206
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:58,640
six years Sam six years I opened it up

1207
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,318
and people like dude what are you doing

1208
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,639
with that I'm like I this is this new

1209
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,480
process I'm G to you know make rosin out

1210
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,159
of it and this rosin that I made from

1211
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,039
this flower and it was actual flower

1212
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:12,279
rosin was like a baby diaper it stunk

1213
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:16,679
from like literally across the room it

1214
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,680
was so L well all all you really have to

1215
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:20,838
do

1216
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:27,159
yes he's teasing us he's skunkman Sam's

1217
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,519
trolling us

1218
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:34,920
yeah yes he's Frozen see he's talking

1219
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:38,798
the secret is put it in an inert gas

1220
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:42,119
keep it away from light and heat and uh

1221
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:45,079
I mean they do they do it with nuts in

1222
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:46,960
little foil packs right and in your

1223
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:49,400
coffee I mean that was the thing is

1224
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,679
originally the the thought was the 80%

1225
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:55,318
nitrogen 20% CO2 but when cannabis

1226
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:58,000
degrades it turns to CO2 so that was why

1227
00:50:55,318 --> 00:51:01,079
the suggestion of the Argon on to you

1228
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,239
know stabilize the air around it so no

1229
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,280
matter how it shifts if it's kept you

1230
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:08,798
know it would there be therefore be as

1231
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:11,599
sh self shelf stable as

1232
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:13,519
possible the other thing with theyed the

1233
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,798
reason why they used argon is because

1234
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:21,679
argon is heavier than air so you got to

1235
00:51:16,798 --> 00:51:23,679
remember air is 79% nitrogen right so

1236
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:26,719
the difference between just regular

1237
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:29,039
nitrogen 100% nitrogen is the oxygen

1238
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:31,000
that's in there so it's going to take

1239
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:33,719
longer to sweep out a container if

1240
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,599
you're just using nitrogen as opposed to

1241
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:39,798
argon argon's heavier than

1242
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:42,798
air that's why that's why in Canada when

1243
00:51:39,798 --> 00:51:46,400
we dry suit dive in the cold Pacific

1244
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:49,519
Ocean we use argon gas to inject it into

1245
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,160
our dry suits and it keeps us warmer and

1246
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:53,119
so there's another use for it shout out

1247
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:54,960
to Savvy turps for talking about noble

1248
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,760
gases about half an hour before we

1249
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,920
started talking about them in chat

1250
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,520
yeah I mean I use I've used it in uh in

1251
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,960
ovens before Mark to uh to keep the

1252
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:08,400
environment in that

1253
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,280
oven you know

1254
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:14,079
stely material stay in there in an open

1255
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,599
open container yeah um it's I've done

1256
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,920
some really interesting work doing that

1257
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:22,400
um I don't know if this is real but like

1258
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:24,559
about 10 years ago someone I know um

1259
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,400
maybe less maybe it was about eight

1260
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:30,920
years ago someone claimed to have bought

1261
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:33,000
the rights to the regional nitrogen

1262
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,280
packing that everyone was going to have

1263
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,199
to buy

1264
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,440
into if they did that in cannabis and he

1265
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,078
basically took me aside and he's like

1266
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,159
you realize that everyone thinks this is

1267
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,680
going to be the future but this is a

1268
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,759
patented process and the guy who holds

1269
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:48,480
that patent I just made a deal with for

1270
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,880
California and he thought he was going

1271
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,719
to make millions because the whole

1272
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:55,920
industry was going to go towards the

1273
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:57,118
Nitro packed um cans and and anyway I

1274
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,400
don't know if he was full of [ __ ] or not

1275
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,880
but it it was interesting to see like

1276
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,480
okay this is you know that's the kind of

1277
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,039
thought process you have to have in this

1278
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,119
business is be like way ahead of the

1279
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:10,318
curve yeah I mean need to be they're

1280
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:13,160
already doing it with potato chips right

1281
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:17,119
because when you fry potato chips and

1282
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:19,039
unsaturated oils they will degrade so

1283
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,559
the potato chip companies when they

1284
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:22,880
package potato chips you're blowing uh

1285
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:25,599
nitrogen in there I don't think it's

1286
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,599
argon I think it's nitrogen so it's

1287
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,559
coffee right

1288
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,640
excuse me they're doing with coffee is

1289
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,119
they they before they do with all your

1290
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,679
coffee and that's why it's open and you

1291
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:39,280
feel that rush in it's because there

1292
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:41,879
along the process uh of the Machinery

1293
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,519
there's a puff station right before the

1294
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,760
close station and it literally is the

1295
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:49,400
puff then seals in its clothes and it

1296
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,920
goes and that is keeping the oxygen out

1297
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,960
of your coffee so your coffee doesn't

1298
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,960
degrade if you weren't

1299
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,880
aware I don't drink coffee but

1300
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:03,119
that I

1301
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:06,519
know yeah yeah very good very good

1302
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,838
welcome uh gml just popped into the room

1303
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:09,960
who you in a desert or something dude

1304
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:12,000
yeah

1305
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,599
morning morning

1306
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,159
morning I don't drink coffee

1307
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:19,400
either I've never drank coffee my wife I

1308
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:20,519
both don't drink coffee people would

1309
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,000
stay at our house and be like Hey

1310
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:24,400
where's your coffee and we'd be like

1311
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,880
coffee like you can twist up a joint if

1312
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,960
you want and they just be like you could

1313
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,480
see the conern in their face bro like

1314
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,798
people really there's something about

1315
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,199
suppressing a denone like just like not

1316
00:54:33,798 --> 00:54:38,159
having that feeling in your mind I don't

1317
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:39,639
get it I don't know it but I certainly

1318
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:43,039
know there are a lot of people out there

1319
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:44,719
that uh Beyond love it it it was pushed

1320
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:46,480
on me when I was in like grade three and

1321
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:48,838
that's I just didn't like the taste and

1322
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,400
I still don't to this day damn you got

1323
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:53,400
you got hit up with the coffee dealers

1324
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,519
in grade three well sneaking out I

1325
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,960
remember sneaking out of the house uh

1326
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:58,440
with my cousin and grade three going

1327
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,480
down to Commercial Drive and playing

1328
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:05,280
Street Fighter 2 and then at the Italian

1329
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,838
coffee shop at the Hasty Market and uh

1330
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,680
yeah just remember them offering me

1331
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:13,400
coffee my wife cannot get up without

1332
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:15,639
coffee wow crazy so she's got the coffee

1333
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:19,639
maker in the bed with her

1334
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:20,960
or when you but if you uh if you freeze

1335
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:22,679
uh they make they sell these online

1336
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,039
freeze a there's like a metal ball you

1337
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:27,719
can freeze in the freezer or or even do

1338
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:29,839
it with a round I Ice Cube if you make

1339
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:32,318
espresso and have it pour over top of

1340
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:36,199
the the cold fre Frozen ice ice cube or

1341
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:39,960
a frozen piece of metal the coffee will

1342
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:42,519
have a much a much different taste to it

1343
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:45,318
because it's retaining more of the the

1344
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:48,119
the chemical compounds that are bringing

1345
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:50,719
that that aric property to life is that

1346
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:52,079
what you do with that Mojave these are

1347
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:53,480
these are yeah these are actually just

1348
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,318
well they're not they're for anything

1349
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:58,159
they're they're just steel um yeah

1350
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,838
Frozen you can freeze them and put them

1351
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:02,078
in anything in drinks whatever so

1352
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:04,480
they're they're kind of cool like if you

1353
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,839
ever need a bunch of ice cubes but you

1354
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,119
don't want a bunch of water after they

1355
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:11,358
lose their coldness um you get a bunch

1356
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:12,640
of just throw them in your cooler throw

1357
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:14,719
them and whatever they're fun probably

1358
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:16,480
not the best idea to replace your ice in

1359
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,558
the hash making process with those I'm

1360
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,599
guessing a lot of

1361
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:23,160
contamination yeah and pretty pretty

1362
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:25,318
aggressive as well hey one thing always

1363
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:29,318
wondered I wanted opinion on this

1364
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:31,798
especially from you Dr Mark um why don't

1365
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:34,558
good for those of us who chew on ice

1366
00:56:31,798 --> 00:56:38,199
right hey why don't people use oxygen

1367
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:41,519
absorbers in cannabis

1368
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:44,118
packaging well um if you have oxidation

1369
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:45,639
happening and

1370
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:51,200
oxidation

1371
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:55,719
is usually how tpes are going to degrade

1372
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:58,480
um you need oxygen so it's just a um

1373
00:56:55,719 --> 00:57:02,879
it's a hydrogen acceptor right so when

1374
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:06,079
when um if you look at uh if you've ever

1375
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:08,798
heated heated up THC disate and you see

1376
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,720
white smoke coming off that white smoke

1377
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:13,719
is actually

1378
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:16,598
water uh that's being formed from the

1379
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:21,159
degradation of THC which is turning into

1380
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:24,240
CBN and as THC turns into CBN it gives

1381
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:26,920
up two molecules of hydrogen and so

1382
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:30,479
those two molecules of hydrogen

1383
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:33,480
find the oxygen that's in the air and

1384
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:36,838
make water right

1385
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:39,000
H2O so um so the white smoke that you

1386
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:44,558
see is actually steam it's actually

1387
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:48,280
water so so yeah so oxygen is just uh

1388
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:49,839
well it oxidizes but it gets reduced so

1389
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,160
whenever something is oxidized

1390
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:55,279
something's reduced so in that case the

1391
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:58,519
molecular oxygen is being reduced to

1392
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:01,880
water but that means something was

1393
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:05,280
oxidized in order for that hydrogen to

1394
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:10,240
be available in the case of THC going to

1395
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:14,440
CBN you're oxidizing THC to CBN because

1396
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:16,759
it's losing those hydrogens and reducing

1397
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:20,200
molecular oxygen from

1398
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,960
Air yeah so you want to try to avoid air

1399
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:24,919
so is that the question you want to try

1400
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:27,599
to avoid oxygen no what my my question

1401
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:30,079
is like you see like in in most food

1402
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:32,838
products there's there's two packets one

1403
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:35,480
or two or both and it's usually silica

1404
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:37,960
or an oxygen absorber and the silica is

1405
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:40,559
for humidity and the oxygen absorbers

1406
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,440
specifically to combat oxidization and

1407
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,839
in cannabis like we adopted the whole

1408
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:47,318
Bova thing and the whole idea of like

1409
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:49,639
keeping a constant humidity in a

1410
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:51,920
packaged product but like other food

1411
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:53,838
products they know the big culprit for a

1412
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,280
lot of things is oxygen so I'm just

1413
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:58,078
wondering if there's a if there's a

1414
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:00,440
reason why oxygen absorbers haven't been

1415
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,280
adopted by cannabis or is it just that

1416
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:06,240
we haven't thought of it or is there an

1417
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:07,880
actual possible issue that might arise

1418
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:10,679
yeah well we we were we were talking

1419
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,358
about how the sour diesel bronzes out

1420
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:14,558
right and there's kind of like a a

1421
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:18,038
Browning that you know certain you know

1422
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:21,119
strains will will actually undergo

1423
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:22,960
during curing which is actually a

1424
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,400
controlled

1425
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,838
oxidation right you're actually when

1426
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,880
during Cur

1427
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:30,639
and and certainly like I I don't know I

1428
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,960
mean again it seems as though some of

1429
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:37,639
the more uh oxidized Tarpin could

1430
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:39,318
actually be forming in that curing

1431
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:40,480
process which is going to change the

1432
00:59:39,318 --> 00:59:43,038
overall

1433
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,599
Essence but I think in general I mean

1434
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:49,480
just like in food like if you think

1435
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:52,318
about like just ground beef for example

1436
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:55,480
uh when that oxidizes right it turns the

1437
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:56,599
beef brown right so if they can grab a

1438
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,798
couple more

1439
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:03,400
days of shelf life and keep that ground

1440
00:59:59,798 --> 01:00:05,759
beef red that's a big savings for them

1441
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:08,119
you know I mean they just they could

1442
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,880
just get a few more days of shelf life

1443
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:13,480
because you're just absorbing the oxygen

1444
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:17,079
and what's happening is that the thing

1445
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:19,119
that's making well ground beef if you

1446
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:21,400
want to talk about that for a second is

1447
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:24,480
the blood and that's the Heen that's in

1448
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:27,440
the blood which is the complex with iron

1449
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,798
and so when oxygen in filtrates that it

1450
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,960
changes the pigments color to Brown so

1451
01:00:29,798 --> 01:00:36,199
that's why aged ground beef will look

1452
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,240
more brownish than it does red but um

1453
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:40,439
but it would be like that for any

1454
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:43,000
bloodborne product so that's why I would

1455
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:45,159
imagine like in meat packaging for

1456
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,960
example you would have things that would

1457
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:51,399
absorb oxygen but like even in dairy

1458
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:53,280
products and other things where um well

1459
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:56,798
cheese for example you'd probably want

1460
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:59,280
to keep um cheese in the air environment

1461
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:02,000
or else it's going to start or continue

1462
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:06,039
to degrade right cheese is already

1463
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,079
degraded in a way so yeah I don't know

1464
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:09,480
if that if that's what you're asking

1465
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,920
yeah now it's just kind of it's just

1466
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,798
kind of something I wonder about if if

1467
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,880
there's a a a reason why certain

1468
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:19,038
products are so Trend towards oxygen

1469
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,280
versus humidity anyway guys I got I got

1470
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:22,400
to bounce out for a little bit but I'm

1471
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:25,559
hope to see you in a little in maybe 45

1472
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,160
or 50 I'll be back if you guys are still

1473
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:30,200
so Mark you know that's I'll see you

1474
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:32,639
soon mve um question I I wanted to jump

1475
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:36,480
into the the Browning aspect I have some

1476
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:39,239
gel that was harvested and that's

1477
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,920
actually it's very similar it Browns out

1478
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:43,279
it doesn't look like good herb but when

1479
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:46,318
you smoke it it's fantastic it's like

1480
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,880
unbelievable yeah right and so it loses

1481
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:50,759
the emerald color I mean like it just

1482
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,318
looks like just some normal like I

1483
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,359
should go grab it it just looks it's

1484
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:57,960
good or it's like when you open the bag

1485
01:01:55,358 --> 01:02:02,558
you're like hit with this overwhelming

1486
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:04,240
skunk gas Super Skunk is that pungent

1487
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:06,440
but when you look at it you'd be like

1488
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:09,719
this looks like some mediocre herb like

1489
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:12,159
to be real and but when you smoke it

1490
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:14,159
it's super flavorful and super delicious

1491
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:16,399
all the way down to the last hit like if

1492
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,038
you rolled a big Jo joint of it you

1493
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,798
wouldn't you you could taste it

1494
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:23,359
literally all the all the way down how

1495
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:26,880
many day C is something like that I

1496
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:30,358
think that's on that's a good that batch

1497
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,960
I think is a three- week here at this

1498
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:34,159
point see even that isn't that kind of

1499
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,119
pushing it though you need something

1500
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:39,000
more like about two months really it's

1501
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:41,278
still going like it's it's I'm just

1502
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
saying like where it's at right now like

1503
01:02:41,278 --> 01:02:45,079
yeah it's like it's at I think it's

1504
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,599
almost at four weeks now but

1505
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:50,720
it's it's yeah it'll it'll keep going

1506
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:53,838
you know but it just it's interesting

1507
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:56,439
because it's it's such dank herb but it

1508
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:58,880
doesn't like in terms of contemporary

1509
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,119
herb you wouldn't consider this you

1510
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,119
would look at it and be like I'm not

1511
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:04,079
going to smoke it because dude it makes

1512
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:06,358
me want to see it it makes me think that

1513
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,079
when we talking about herb yeah yeah

1514
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:10,119
when we're talking about herb especially

1515
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:13,200
if we're growing it I'd love to share

1516
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:15,880
people's grows or any hash making you

1517
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:17,439
know yeah exactly dude show show the

1518
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,798
flowers dude like we want to see the

1519
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,880
flowers up close I was going to chirp in

1520
01:03:19,798 --> 01:03:24,838
with this I actually keep this is my

1521
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:28,119
head stash jar of GMO I call it which is

1522
01:03:24,838 --> 01:03:31,440
GMO by gas mask and I got this at a

1523
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:33,599
coffee shop so this is a vac sealed jar

1524
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,039
that has like an analog little hand

1525
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,240
action

1526
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:40,599
back so it goes like this you can hear

1527
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:43,358
it kind of a thing it's got a vac

1528
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:45,278
release and you just twist turn and it

1529
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:46,880
keeps the nuggies good for quite a while

1530
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:50,639
I kind of go to the fridge with it even

1531
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:52,838
for longer hold but uh yeah and I've

1532
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:55,798
noticed the gas Types on me in the past

1533
01:03:52,838 --> 01:03:58,239
especially grown Sun grown whether e

1534
01:03:55,798 --> 01:04:00,480
gaster West that they seem to oxidate

1535
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:03,038
really quickly like you got like a twoe

1536
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,760
window seems to be a little bit more of

1537
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:10,079
a hold for the you know color from like

1538
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:12,720
a delicate indoor or whatnot holding

1539
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,519
it interesting I like the sound of that

1540
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:16,239
everyone's jar should sound like that

1541
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:18,199
when you when you show up a session and

1542
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:20,278
you open a jar and it does that people

1543
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:21,960
are like the [ __ ] that [ __ ]

1544
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:24,400
over there got like I want to go check

1545
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,838
that out I would think like deli style

1546
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:29,200
for Med shops Main still medical here

1547
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:30,759
and the recck so like these if you're

1548
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,000
going deli style you know and you're in

1549
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,680
and out of the jar you just give it the

1550
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,880
twist turn not trying to sell the

1551
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:37,558
company or anything I won't tell who

1552
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,599
makes it but like devices like this to

1553
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:42,319
keep the air out for head stash at least

1554
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:43,960
oh I think it's okay to tell who makes

1555
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:45,599
it I mean if people want to look for it

1556
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:48,199
and check it out we're not

1557
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,519
getting not a sponsor yeah it's called

1558
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:52,439
fellow and it's just at the local coffee

1559
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:56,519
shop you know to keep your highend

1560
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:58,318
coffee beans good so this is what

1561
01:04:56,519 --> 01:04:59,920
this is what the Cannabis world has been

1562
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:01,798
doing since the beginning of time we

1563
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,838
just adopt cool things from other

1564
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:06,199
Industries they pushed us out for so

1565
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:08,318
long it was like there's other things in

1566
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:10,439
the world that may not be marketed as a

1567
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:11,798
cannabis product but man it works so

1568
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,838
well I mean I'll tell you the first time

1569
01:05:11,798 --> 01:05:18,358
I made hash it was with a $20 cake mixer

1570
01:05:14,838 --> 01:05:21,920
from Walmart like just [ __ ] that hash

1571
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:23,239
was killer it's kind of why you know I

1572
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,880
obviously I'm a part of Whistler

1573
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:27,038
Technologies that's I'm a partner in

1574
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,599
that company uh and you know all these

1575
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,440
other guys like uh low temp and hashte

1576
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,798
and SoMo filtration and Delta

1577
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,358
separations there's all these different

1578
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:37,838
companies doing it and it's great it's

1579
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:39,318
commercial there's Colin with his I just

1580
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:42,558
think you could still make great house

1581
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:45,159
with a cake mixer that's the jel let me

1582
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:47,880
this like Diesel doesn't it's not the

1583
01:05:45,159 --> 01:05:50,759
bag appeal girl that everyone believes

1584
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:54,000
it to be it never was but man in terms

1585
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:56,160
of the flavor and to be real man it's a

1586
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,079
great breeding it's good breeding stock

1587
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:02,358
because there's just so much to to take

1588
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:05,240
from it and improve show again I I had

1589
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:06,798
Bri Brian was pinned my apologies these

1590
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:10,239
are small because this is all that's

1591
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:12,798
kind of dry right now but um it just

1592
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:15,318
doesn't look like weed that you'd be

1593
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:18,318
like yeah I'm gonna like I want a whole

1594
01:06:15,318 --> 01:06:20,920
lot this right but when you when you

1595
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:22,920
roll it up and you put it to your lips

1596
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:26,798
you're like this is all I want like what

1597
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:29,039
is this flavor profile and it's just

1598
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:31,679
you know like here's some here's some

1599
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:35,000
diesel here same thing

1600
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:37,879
like Diesel's a fantastic varial but you

1601
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,199
gotta grow it really well hey Colin

1602
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:42,240
what's the story with the diesel is that

1603
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:44,719
more like a mass Super Skunk sided yeah

1604
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:47,838
so it's a mass Super Skunk I think

1605
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:50,118
chmd yeah this is diesel this diesel is

1606
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:52,358
not really good

1607
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:56,680
um so and then

1608
01:06:52,358 --> 01:07:00,480
here got some OG over here too some

1609
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:02,199
Trinity um this is all really nice but

1610
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,599
this is yeah I mean all this stuff look

1611
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:08,199
needs to cure for like Mark said for a

1612
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:10,000
lot longer for smoking grade material

1613
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:14,118
but

1614
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,119
um the Diesel's looking

1615
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:25,159
good this is

1616
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:28,558
sour um dude we should be having like

1617
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:31,558
the USB microscope set up screen sharing

1618
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:33,680
pop that thing under the microscope show

1619
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:34,839
this is really this stuff is better

1620
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:38,480
without

1621
01:07:34,838 --> 01:07:38,480
curing what's that

1622
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:47,239
Sam we missed that Sam can you repeat it

1623
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:54,838
yeah something about cannabis is better

1624
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:57,838
without curing does anybody think that

1625
01:07:54,838 --> 01:08:01,358
cannabis is better without curing I know

1626
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:04,358
my haze I used to cure it for three

1627
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:07,199
months yeah I mean I feel very strongly

1628
01:08:04,358 --> 01:08:10,159
about Hayes in particular that letting

1629
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:12,719
those monot Turpin like release whatever

1630
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:14,920
that profile is and just letting that

1631
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:18,119
Underside bouquet pop up that's where

1632
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:24,079
you got that perfumey just

1633
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:26,439
incredible Haze flavors I I I never

1634
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:29,119
thought that uncured weed was better

1635
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:30,960
than cured weed although I will say that

1636
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:33,318
it's kind of what's happening with hash

1637
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,480
now both in the BHO realm and in the

1638
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:37,239
water hash realm it's all about slapping

1639
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:39,519
it while it's fresh frozen and making

1640
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:41,000
sure you run it really cold and make

1641
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,600
sure once you've run it that that goes

1642
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,439
into a freeze dryer and you keep your

1643
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:47,279
temperatures down as much as possible in

1644
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:48,838
the sublimation process and then you SE

1645
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,560
it right away to make sure there's no

1646
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:53,158
ice particles in there but get it right

1647
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:57,679
into a freezer to you know just stop

1648
01:08:53,158 --> 01:09:00,079
that that off gas of any kind so it's um

1649
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:04,000
I remember years ago uh we were up at

1650
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:06,000
Hank's apartment in the oh gosh I think

1651
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,880
it was in the lza plane he had an

1652
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,119
apartment above the uh his uh what was

1653
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,838
it the Bulldog his Cafe do you remember

1654
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:14,920
that apartment Sam you've probably been

1655
01:09:12,838 --> 01:09:18,359
there many times we were up there and I

1656
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:21,239
was with Tony from sagam Mara seeds and

1657
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:23,520
I had made some dry SI with sweet skunk

1658
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:26,158
for the great Gardener well I had

1659
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,000
cleaned it he had made it and it was old

1660
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:29,479
he had he had it sitting for a long time

1661
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,238
he had the plants sitting for a long

1662
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:33,559
time then he then he sifted them and

1663
01:09:31,238 --> 01:09:36,000
that sat for a while and it was just

1664
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,839
super well cured hash and then I cleaned

1665
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,880
it to

1666
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:43,158
99.9% heads and I gave uh Tony a rip of

1667
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,079
that and I'll never forget him just

1668
01:09:43,158 --> 01:09:47,599
leaning back on the couch and just

1669
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:49,479
exhaling it and being like Oh my God

1670
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,600
he's like he's like I think if the

1671
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:54,319
younger generation could smoke hash like

1672
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,079
this they they wouldn't go back to

1673
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:59,559
that cuz it was just so smooth you'd let

1674
01:09:57,079 --> 01:10:01,679
out a huge rip of this hash and it was

1675
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:06,239
sweet skunk so it was also already a

1676
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:08,359
very gentle soft and just like welcoming

1677
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:11,439
profile you know in the in the haze

1678
01:10:08,359 --> 01:10:14,920
lineage but certainly not as rank or

1679
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:18,599
dank but still just so [ __ ] enjoyable

1680
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:21,079
and so I I feel you yet on the flip side

1681
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,880
I love a good rip is some fresh frozen

1682
01:10:21,079 --> 01:10:24,479
you know that's that has been preserved

1683
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,400
all the way and that makes me cough and

1684
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:29,319
makes my eyes almost almost pop out so

1685
01:10:27,399 --> 01:10:31,599
who's to say it's cannabis just love

1686
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:31,599
what you

1687
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,840
love yeah there's a lot of different

1688
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:37,719
levels to it but yeah I think back to

1689
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,840
the genetics thing I wanted to kind of

1690
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:42,279
touch on some of the lines that um you

1691
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:45,319
know Masonic that you might be working

1692
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:48,399
on that you're stoked on now since

1693
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:50,960
you've worked Wilson through the lines

1694
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:52,639
that you have worked what are you seeing

1695
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,920
right now that you're like yo this is

1696
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,920
really unique

1697
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:05,519
all right so so I was doing a single

1698
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:08,359
male donor pollinations for uh a while

1699
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,120
with Wilson like it to the point where

1700
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:13,000
that's what I was identified as like oh

1701
01:11:10,119 --> 01:11:15,158
you only do Wilson Oh you only make hash

1702
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,479
trins it's it's like no like I cross

1703
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:19,559
Wilson to everything so I make

1704
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:22,000
everything you know I don't

1705
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:24,039
necessarily only grow one type of strain

1706
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
like I'm very open-minded about looking

1707
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:27,279
under every Rock so that's one thing

1708
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,279
that you know I'm always doing is

1709
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:31,479
looking for trying to see what

1710
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,920
everything is putting a smell to every

1711
01:11:31,479 --> 01:11:35,079
name out there like you guys are saying

1712
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:37,639
sweet skunk you guys are saying all

1713
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:39,600
these varieties like super Mass the the

1714
01:11:37,639 --> 01:11:41,440
jel I was looking at my drawer while

1715
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:45,480
you're saying jel because I have like a

1716
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:47,198
a rose flow jel variety that I visited

1717
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:49,439
five years ago seeds I made five years

1718
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:52,279
ago where my nose

1719
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:53,759
isn't in like as as it was five years

1720
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:55,719
ago where now I could like kind of spot

1721
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,119
things and label it quicker whereas 5

1722
01:11:55,719 --> 01:11:59,439
years ago I'm still learning [ __ ] you

1723
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:01,679
know so I'm like oh crap let me dig

1724
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:03,638
through this gel Rose flow see if I find

1725
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,840
anything significant but all that to say

1726
01:12:03,639 --> 01:12:08,440
is like what I'm working on uh so I did

1727
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:12,880
the single male donor Wilson

1728
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:15,279
pollinations for like 16 17 18 19 20 21

1729
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,199
is finally when I stopped doing single M

1730
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:20,119
donor pollinations with the Wilson I put

1731
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:22,839
it on the back burner and then that year

1732
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:24,559
something possessed me to just let

1733
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,360
everything just pollinate each other

1734
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,280
like every Single Seed stock that I had

1735
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:31,079
in that seed from That season from all

1736
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:34,359
these dope breeders honey banana hybrids

1737
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:36,198
Skittle hybrids B gear the list goes on

1738
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:37,880
and on you know land race variety

1739
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:41,238
straight from Thailand straight from

1740
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:43,359
India I just let it all rock you know

1741
01:12:41,238 --> 01:12:46,678
[ __ ] it I call it natural selection and

1742
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:48,479
that's what I did for 21 22 and then

1743
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:50,279
last year so for the past three years

1744
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:52,279
I've been doing these open pollinations

1745
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:54,279
with different Ms from different seed

1746
01:12:52,279 --> 01:12:55,719
stock it's totally random like that's

1747
01:12:54,279 --> 01:12:58,039
literally what it is

1748
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:59,880
and so I made seeds for 3 years and I

1749
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:01,399
was happy with all that progyny like I

1750
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,239
would pop it myself I'd be like dope

1751
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:06,759
like Mom's in there and even if it was

1752
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:09,479
like a mom that wasn't something that I

1753
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:10,800
like subjectively The Offspring from it

1754
01:13:09,479 --> 01:13:13,198
from that natural selection would be

1755
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,480
like oh like that's likable you know so

1756
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:17,559
it was like cool we're on to something

1757
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:19,678
but a lot of people weren't with it the

1758
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,560
ones that were with it God bless you I

1759
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:23,239
still love it they they they kept me

1760
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:26,440
through that three year the past three

1761
01:13:23,238 --> 01:13:29,479
years you know 22 23 two years but kind

1762
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:31,879
of like 21 is 22 23 for like two years

1763
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:33,839
that I've had it finally 24 comes along

1764
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,800
I'm like cool let's do something else

1765
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,920
now so I kind of just went with the

1766
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:40,159
algorithm of what everyone's kind of

1767
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,719
like looking at right now and uh

1768
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:43,439
Starburst I was like [ __ ] it let's rock

1769
01:13:41,719 --> 01:13:45,960
this Starburst Everyone likes Starburst

1770
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:47,559
right now I like Starburst right now um

1771
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,840
it's not something you can easily go

1772
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,560
grab no one's going to give me the

1773
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:53,360
starburst cut I don't like asking for

1774
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,639
stuff it's never ended up on my desk but

1775
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:59,479
Higher Ground sold Starburst f one seat

1776
01:13:55,639 --> 01:14:02,039
stock and F2 seat stock so I dedicated

1777
01:13:59,479 --> 01:14:04,799
um some indoor runtime to some Starburst

1778
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:07,519
varieties and I hunted one pack of f1s

1779
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,159
and two packs of f2s uh kept all the

1780
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:12,199
males kept all the females made my

1781
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:14,439
selections now I'm making uh now I made

1782
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:17,198
and I'm making more f3s with them so

1783
01:14:14,439 --> 01:14:19,079
right now I'm on a starburst war path as

1784
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:21,158
well as everything else like nothing is

1785
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:22,920
left unlooked like if a new breeder

1786
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:25,238
comes out with a pack I'm the first in

1787
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:28,158
line to grab it just cuz I I it's like

1788
01:14:25,238 --> 01:14:29,759

to being like when I was like 23 all

1804
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,719
right so this is one of two gardens this

1805
01:15:04,039 --> 01:15:07,920
I call the Discovery Garden because I

1806
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:10,119
don't do production here I don't do

1807
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:12,000
light depths here you know I literally

1808
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:14,238
just pop seeds and let everything Rock

1809
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,880
here so this is the this is the

1810
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:18,599
Discovery Garden so for starters massive

1811
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:22,119

1828
01:15:58,279 --> 01:16:01,759
literally go through this tunnel to get

1829
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,319
through the other

1830
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:07,199
side and then there's more weed over

1831
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:10,000
here and then there's more weed look

1832
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:10,000
those are the power

1833
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:15,238
lines it's they're growing in a kitty

1834
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:17,399
pool and there's more weed down here

1835
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:19,919
there's more look these I've been

1836
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:21,638
throwing plants in there just 10 times

1837
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:26,880
over just throw a plant in there let it

1838
01:16:21,639 --> 01:16:29,800
grow you go over here there's more more

1839
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:31,520
weed this is the you know just kind of

1840
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:34,920
using what I got you know I don't have a

1841
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,639
farm so this plant I didn't support it

1842
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,239
so it kind of just toppled over I'm just

1843
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:40,679
kind of just letting it Rock [ __ ] it

1844
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:42,718
I'll be all right I'll get some hash off

1845
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:46,039
with it we'll get like three ounces 4

1846
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:49,520
ounces of hash off of that bad boy just

1847
01:16:46,039 --> 01:16:50,719
chilling but this is my Discovery Garden

1848
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:53,600
this is

1849
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:55,279
it it's as big as the house this is

1850
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,719
inspirational you know what this is

1851
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:59,960
relatable this is uh you know it's you

1852
01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:01,800
don't like uh grow some weed like you

1853
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,840
said you know grow some weed find some

1854
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,560
flavors you don't need a multi-million

1855
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,920
dollar facility are you planting are you

1856
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:13,400
pollinating with multiple males on the

1857
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:16,440
same female so here uh am I multia with

1858
01:17:13,399 --> 01:17:20,000
multiple Ms from the same seed stock

1859
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:22,399
yes I think yes so like when I'm doing

1860
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,920
my natural selection open pollinations

1861
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:27,079
to make that seed stock it is different

1862
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:29,520
mels from that same seed stock I think

1863
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:29,519
that's what you

1864
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:36,000
asked cool did you say mels or males Sam

1865
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:39,960
were you asking if he was hitting

1866
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:42,520
multiple different males pollen to one

1867
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:44,960
female can't hit males so I figured you

1868
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:46,960
know you you you do it's the other way

1869
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,439
around you know no the reason I'm asking

1870
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,439
that is

1871
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:56,479
because oh my God why does his mic keep

1872
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:59,480
doing that no I'm I'm asking if he's

1873
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:01,799
using multiple different varieties of

1874
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:03,638
males on the same female that that's

1875
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,600
what I thought you so so more than

1876
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:08,000
likely that is what's going to happen

1877
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:10,480
right unless like I I can't tell right

1878
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,760
because it's it's happening by itself if

1879
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:14,479
there's five different males with one

1880
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,360
female growing with it I guess it's like

1881
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:18,638
a cat you know cats can have different

1882
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:20,799
dads when they have their their babies

1883
01:18:18,639 --> 01:18:23,359
right so I'm guessing it's more so that

1884
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:24,320
than oh you know just one of them hit it

1885
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:26,519
you know because there's there's

1886
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:28,880
different there's no telling you know

1887
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:31,199
you could pop the progyny and wonder

1888
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,679
what might have hit it but all in all I

1889
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:34,279
just take it for like everything it

1890
01:18:32,679 --> 01:18:36,199
could be anything you know if there's

1891
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:36,920
five males any of those males could have

1892
01:18:36,198 --> 01:18:39,399
hit

1893
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:41,760
it and this is just to get it like as

1894
01:18:39,399 --> 01:18:44,359
diverse as possible this is just to make

1895
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,159
seeds just making seeds and and and you

1896
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:48,039
can label it whatever you want after

1897
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:49,719
yeah to make it diverse as possible it

1898
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:52,319
just so happens that dude it's chaos

1899
01:18:49,719 --> 01:18:55,480
breeding I [ __ ] love it bro it's it's

1900
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:57,158
one of like one year two years of like

1901
01:18:55,479 --> 01:18:58,638
the next 80 years of breeding that I

1902
01:18:57,158 --> 01:19:00,559
have that I just kind of visited and it

1903
01:18:58,639 --> 01:19:02,039
worked it won first place Legends for

1904
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,800
Christ's sake the Candy shishka Berry

1905
01:19:02,039 --> 01:19:06,319
was a Natural Selections lineage you

1906
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,719
know so it's like it's not that that's

1907
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:10,439
like to prove that it's good but it's

1908
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:12,760
like well it's pretty good proof that

1909
01:19:10,439 --> 01:19:14,039
it's good dude a lot of things came from

1910
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,440
stuff that's like oh we don't know what

1911
01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:19,439
it

1912
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:20,759
is you know okay what Skittles nobody

1913
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:22,559
could tell you they could tell you all

1914
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:25,159
their lore what's you know a bunch of

1915
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,560
strains so that's kind of like the Credo

1916
01:19:25,158 --> 01:19:28,839
behind that is like oh we're just making

1917
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,639
seeds uh as far as receiving end is

1918
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:33,560
concerned cool I got half the story

1919
01:19:30,639 --> 01:19:36,039
locked in as far as the donor concerned

1920
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:37,639
I'll just yeah when I grow these seeds

1921
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:39,719
from when I know like oh if I see

1922
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:41,000
something that has Haze in it tie I

1923
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:42,439
could smell it almost immediately

1924
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,238
shishka Berry because there's shishka

1925
01:19:42,439 --> 01:19:46,319
Berry candy Shish Berry mels out there

1926
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:48,119
it's like oh [ __ ] I know it hit it

1927
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:49,960
almost immediately and that's a little

1928
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:52,000
selfish but I'm making seeds very

1929
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:54,079
transparently people ask me Yo Ma what

1930
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,399
were the mels out there I could explain

1931
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:57,960
a bunch of times but it's all like dude

1932
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:59,119
it's random even if I tell you you're

1933
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,279
not going to be able to know because

1934
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:01,800
you're you're going to learn down the

1935
01:20:00,279 --> 01:20:03,359
process and if you do know it's cuz

1936
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,600
you're a discerner you'd probably tell

1937
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:09,719
me before I tell you you

1938
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:11,520
know I smell Skittles I smell pepper oh

1939
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:13,079
[ __ ] probably Tom Hill hay F3 hit it you

1940
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,239
know I had a white Taho skunk that

1941
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:18,800
probably hit it and it's just like but

1942
01:20:15,238 --> 01:20:20,718
all that yeah it matters but that's my

1943
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,880
thing was like that this this year this

1944
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:26,639
Natural Selections Reas pollination

1945
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:26,639
didn't the reason I'm asking

1946
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:32,039
the the reason I'm

1947
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:39,679
asking yes the reason you're

1948
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:49,279
asking but the reason I'm asking is

1949
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:51,520
because I often use a mail uh a single

1950
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:54,000
male and I hit it towards hundreds of

1951
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:56,360
differ of females but I know what the

1952
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,079
male is

1953
01:20:56,359 --> 01:21:00,079
yeah that's what I did the previous five

1954
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:02,439
years with my Wilson M and then I

1955
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:04,920
decided to do as I'm doing the Natural

1956
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:07,158
Selections pollination I'm doing other

1957
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,520
single M donor pollinations at different

1958
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:12,479
spots just to like do my vision if it

1959
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:14,360
was up to me in a perfect world I do a

1960
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:16,359
whole lot of everything you know oh look

1961
01:21:14,359 --> 01:21:18,439
just cross these together and cross but

1962
01:21:16,359 --> 01:21:21,359
this is my way of like kind of in

1963
01:21:18,439 --> 01:21:23,079
essence doing all that at once per se

1964
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:25,439
you know just what what I have all at

1965
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:28,238
once and still work sing Le male donor

1966
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:29,519
pollinations on the side like I'm doing

1967
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:31,238
other pollinations like I'm doing a

1968
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,199
freak Show pollination right now as we

1969
01:21:31,238 --> 01:21:35,638
speak as I'm doing a starburst

1970
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:39,319
pollination as I'm doing this chaotic

1971
01:21:35,639 --> 01:21:39,319
breeding as some might deem you

1972
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:42,959
know it's all being done at the same

1973
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:45,400
time there's not just one thing that I

1974
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,399
do I do it all you know yeah well the

1975
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:50,079
bottom line is like you said cultivar is

1976
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:51,960
winning legends uh you talk about if

1977
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:55,000
it's if there's if it's making noise

1978
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:56,800
you've been making a ton of noise uh for

1979
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,158
for some years now people love what

1980
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:01,639
you're doing people love the Wilson

1981
01:21:59,158 --> 01:22:03,439
you've been able to fall into it with

1982
01:22:01,639 --> 01:22:05,480
the right you know meeting Bloom early

1983
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:07,638
on and getting you know those papayas

1984
01:22:05,479 --> 01:22:09,238
that's incredible I just think it's a

1985
01:22:07,639 --> 01:22:12,039
great way to do it in the sense of just

1986
01:22:09,238 --> 01:22:14,479
using your nose and and following you

1987
01:22:12,039 --> 01:22:18,039
know twocan Sam Style just follow your

1988
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:20,718
nose yeah very much so that's it's very

1989
01:22:18,039 --> 01:22:22,479
you know that chicken's bigger that

1990
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:24,198
chicken's bigger let's put them together

1991
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:25,359
let's make a big chicken like it's it's

1992
01:22:24,198 --> 01:22:26,879
and then

1993
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:28,799
the scientists and the people that are

1994
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,600
good with all the jargon they could back

1995
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,800
me up and be like oh this is why he did

1996
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,960
it and I'll be like yeah yeah yeah that

1997
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:37,400
is why I did it and then I'll resew that

1998
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:38,760
[ __ ] easy peasy you know but that that's

1999
01:22:37,399 --> 01:22:40,559
kind of the game for me like I'm I'm the

2000
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,119
guy in the garden just planning

2001
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,880
thousands of plants and taking care of

2002
01:22:42,119 --> 01:22:46,359
them myself with the little space that

2003
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:48,679
I've have but with the passion that you

2004
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:50,279

produced something worth running in

2057
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:55,400
terms of the hash realm so it's and it's

2058
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:58,080
rare to see that

2059

01:25:00,118 --> 01:25:06,479
do well um he's another one that's good

2062
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:10,159

yeah man it's it's cool and it's you

2065
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,158
gave me the the Natural Selections I ran

2066
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:20,399
like where

2067
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:22,719
rs1 um I think you gave me a

2068
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:24,079
GMO you gave me a bunch I have to go

2069
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:27,639
back on the list but there's a bunch of

2070
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:29,800
the I remember the rs1 vividly nice that

2071
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:32,440
was like very

2072
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:36,600
good that that came out very

2073
01:25:32,439 --> 01:25:38,919
good um so yeah even like the Willie

2074
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:42,199
Nelson not Wilsons that you gave us were

2075
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:45,279
like oddly good how long ago did you get

2076
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:47,479
those yeah a couple years ago I think

2077
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:51,319
yeah those are older I made those old

2078
01:25:47,479 --> 01:25:53,599
2018 2019 yeah and those like when I

2079
01:25:51,319 --> 01:25:55,279
made those trains like I'm just popping

2080
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,480

2082
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:02,678
South Central we didn't grow up on Hay

2083
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:04,840
we grew up on OG you know so it's like

2084
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:07,800
I'm just growing stuff even though

2085
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:09,960
everyone's like at the time 2018 no one

2086
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,679
was like getting props for growing hay

2087
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:14,439
unless you were in The In Crowd with

2088
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:16,639
like the mean jeans and like but like as

2089
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:18,719
far as like status quo hash heads

2090
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:20,400
they're like they disregard almost

2091
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,880
everything even nowadays everybody only

2092
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:24,559
wants like the the everyone agrees on a

2093
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,880
certain turban profile as far as like

2094
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,840
the mass people right and at the time

2095
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,719
I'm just kind of doing left field stuff

2096
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:32,679
doing stuff that I'm like you know what

2097
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:34,399
[ __ ] it and maybe it's all I had at the

2098
01:26:32,679 --> 01:26:36,639
time too it's like let's rock this let's

2099
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:39,000
rock this uh someone had gifted me those

2100
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:42,560
packs and he was held to a high regard

2101
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,158
and I was like cool people like him uh I

2102
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,480
like him he's a nice guy let me throw

2103
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:47,559
these in the ground and and it just kind

2104
01:26:45,479 --> 01:26:49,638
of happened like that like it was never

2105
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:50,880
like yo we're on a chase we need to grab

2106
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:52,480
that one because we're going to be

2107
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,359
rolling in D when we do that one you

2108
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:56,599
know it's always been like everything

2109
01:26:54,359 --> 01:26:58,799
natural throw it in the ground and

2110
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,079
Willie Nelson nl5 ended up becoming like

2111
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,960
one of the strains I threw on the back

2112
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:06,880
burner because at the time it smelt uh

2113
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:11,079
nothing like candy nothing gas nothing

2114
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:14,159
sour it was like a Evergreen floral hazy

2115
01:27:11,079 --> 01:27:15,559
Thai type Turk and I was just like

2116
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:16,839
whatever throw it on the back burner

2117
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:18,320
we're going to have I had like a one

2118
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,840
gallon bag full of these seeds so we

2119
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:21,118
would just give them away for free a lot

2120
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,039
of the times we'll sell them for 10

2121
01:27:21,118 --> 01:27:25,000
bucks and it ended up becoming one of

2122
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:26,158
the varieties that a lot of people like

2123
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,719
because it ended up being a better

2124
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:29,319
grower than most of the varieties

2125
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:31,359
because of the the lineage that it had

2126
01:27:29,319 --> 01:27:33,759
in it and I just learned along the way

2127
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:35,118
that like everybody likes everything I

2128
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,840
might like what I like so I ended up

2129
01:27:35,118 --> 01:27:39,920
becoming like a record store when it

2130
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:42,119
came to my seed varieties it's like yeah

2131
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:44,158
I like Skittles and candy and gas and

2132
01:27:42,118 --> 01:27:45,920
sour and that's all I'm going to buy

2133
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:48,559
when I'm making my purchases but it

2134
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:50,639
would be a disservice and it would suck

2135
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:52,679
for anything else not to exist like oh

2136
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:55,118
train wreck just one day doesn't exist

2137
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:57,480
so I I have all those offers as well I

2138
01:27:55,118 --> 01:27:59,000
make sure to lock in and make hybrids

2139
01:27:57,479 --> 01:28:01,279
whether it be with a single mail donor

2140
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,800
pollination or Natural Selections as far

2141
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:04,920
as receivers are concern and it's kind

2142
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:06,440
of like it's like a record store like oh

2143
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:09,039
I I literally tell people what do you

2144
01:28:06,439 --> 01:28:10,519
like oh I like candy oh you'd love these

2145
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:11,760
you know and it's and you know

2146
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:14,119
everything's great for what it is

2147
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:16,360
everything is and Everyone likes what

2148
01:28:14,118 --> 01:28:18,198
they like you know Shish Berry happens

2149
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:21,158
to be a safe one for a lot of people to

2150
01:28:18,198 --> 01:28:22,678
like at the moment I was actually

2151
01:28:21,158 --> 01:28:24,879
surprised to see you come back around to

2152
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:27,760
be honest with all the things in the

2153
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:32,199
world that have come you know

2154
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:34,400
but then again knowing what I know of it

2155
01:28:32,198 --> 01:28:37,158
maybe it been here all along we didn't

2156
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:39,679
know right it's kind of like papaya G if

2157
01:28:37,158 --> 01:28:41,719
nobody would have ever spotted papaya I

2158
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:44,520
think like the way Harry did it would

2159
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:46,840
have just PC brains right somebody else

2160
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:48,639
would have did it yeah he like so the

2161
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:50,800
way it happened with him is some dude

2162
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:53,000
smoked them out with Papaya some shatter

2163
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:55,440
and he's like yo what is this and the

2164
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,279
dude's like here's the CL

2165
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:59,919
and then he's like making

2166
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:01,000
FS right like it's it's kind of like and

2167
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,520
that's when it gets in more people's

2168
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,760
hands because it's harder to get the

2169
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:06,800
actual clone into people's hands whereas

2170
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:09,280
the seed stock it's like you could send

2171
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,360
it to Iran from here you know good luck

2172
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:13,880
sending the [ __ ] clone you know we've

2173
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:16,639
seen crazy things with s1s too man like

2174
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:18,840
we've been running um S1 sours that

2175
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:23,400
we've made just like ourselves and we're

2176
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:25,639
seeing like ridiculous plants that are

2177
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:29,399
very impressive that I didn't believe

2178
01:29:25,639 --> 01:29:32,840
could exist so it's just you got to hunt

2179
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:34,599
large populations of it to to Sam's

2180
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,520
Point I'm I'm having some technical

2181
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:39,520
difficulties right now guys it seems

2182
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:41,639
like the stream stopped um I tried to

2183
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:43,560
get it going again it says the custom

2184
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:46,639
live stream is going and we're still

2185
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:49,159
recording but I don't see it on YouTube

2186
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:51,760
I don't see the stream I can't find the

2187
01:29:49,158 --> 01:29:55,079
chat I can't find everyone so I just

2188
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:56,840
don't want to to yeah I don't want it

2189
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:58,479
yeah it shows that it's it's ended for

2190
01:29:56,840 --> 01:30:01,319
some reason

2191
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:04,039
um yeah and I can't find the chat so I

2192
01:30:01,319 --> 01:30:05,519
can easily just start this over real

2193
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:06,800
quick and I'll just you know what I'm

2194

going to do I'm going to do the way I

2195
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:11,000
usually do it I'm G to stop the live

2196
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:13,400
stream and then I'm going to live stream

2197
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,158
onto YouTube which will create a whole

2198
01:30:13,399 --> 01:30:16,759
new YouTube and then we can just

2199
01:30:15,158 --> 01:30:18,559
continue the conversation from here and

2200
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:20,880
if I have to splice them together that

2201
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:22,520
that's not a big deal either but uh yeah

2202
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,520
I don't want to miss the conversation so

2203

2207
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:39,399
stuff is ridiculous this is really

2208
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:42,159
really nice we washed this um in

2209
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:44,920
April

2210
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:46,519
this I grew this right here I'm sorry I

2211
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:47,920
got excited when we're talking about our

2212
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:51,760
hat oh hell

2213
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:54,719
yeah I grew this and I washed it uh in

2214
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:56,400
my backyard in Compton and I still doing

2215
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:58,480
so I noticed you're doing some air dry

2216
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:00,719
stuff which I love to see because it's

2217
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:03,599
honestly it's where I think all of this

2218
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:06,480
on at least on this panel here started

2219
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:09,800
so this is all air dry Fatso that I

2220
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:12,399
did I have air dry heads in the freezer

2221
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:14,600
and this is uh this was freeze dry

2222
01:31:12,399 --> 01:31:16,719
because I don't get me wrong I love my

2223
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:18,520
air dry technique but I do air dry

2224
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:20,079
because of lack of freeze dryer you know

2225
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:23,400
so we just kind of working our way up

2226
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:25,158
the ladder but we are like good at air

2227
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:26,920
drying as far as what we know we learned

2228
01:31:25,158 --> 01:31:28,319
from Pua I think Pua works for Nelson

2229
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:30,880
and Company I think you were showing off

2230
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:32,840
a jar earlier but but yeah that's who

2231
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,920
taught me how to air dry was Pua and

2232
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:36,880
he's a really dope hash maker but either

2233
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:39,319
he is he is a dope hash maker I met him

2234
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:42,239
in Barcelona years ago he's a good good

2235
01:31:39,319 --> 01:31:45,479
kid man shout out I always say like if

2236
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:49,039
you can master air drying um everything

2237
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:50,839
else is easy right um because you

2238
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:54,198
understand the inherent needs of that

2239
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:56,119
material on a level that you can't learn

2240
01:31:54,198 --> 01:31:58,678
the other way around and I wouldn't

2241
01:31:56,118 --> 01:32:00,000
learn it any other way like I I like if

2242
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:01,679
if someone gave me the freeze dryer I'd

2243
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,118
be like let's learn how to air dry first

2244
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:04,399
cuz that's just I'm like work from the

2245
01:32:03,118 --> 01:32:05,759
bottom on the way up and it's like

2246
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:07,799
reverse engineering it like you just

2247
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,719
kind of know every piece of the engine

2248
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:12,639
to an extent right well it makes you

2249
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:14,399
think about where Sam's mind was all

2250
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:16,359
those years ago when he was like well

2251
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:18,118
I'm just going to cure my herbs so good

2252
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:21,719
that when I go to sift

2253
01:32:18,118 --> 01:32:24,880
it it's like the best of all the worlds

2254
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:29,480
right which is like very very difficult

2255
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:33,199
to do that it's it's with the capital

2256
01:32:29,479 --> 01:32:35,198
V yeah you know starts with to grow all

2257
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:37,319
day like U you know that's what I found

2258
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:39,599
it's just like just grow the best flower

2259
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:42,198
you'll have the best hash you know and

2260
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,639
that's usually environmental you know in

2261
01:32:42,198 --> 01:32:45,719
a lot of cases you know cuz you could

2262
01:32:43,639 --> 01:32:47,880
have like the genetics subjectively you

2263
01:32:45,719 --> 01:32:49,760
could like care less for it but you know

2264
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:51,679
the clean resin at the end that's from

2265
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,480
my my personal uh experience you know

2266
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:55,319
I've been like oh man I could have you

2267
01:32:53,479 --> 01:32:57,079
know prevented more dust from kicking up

2268
01:32:55,319 --> 01:33:01,158
in the plants and that would have been

2269
01:32:57,079 --> 01:33:02,639
the the literal 50% you know better like

2270
01:33:01,158 --> 01:33:05,079
it would have just been that much better

2271
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:07,359
I think but um that that's how I look at

2272
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:09,399
it for sure but it start you're right

2273
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:12,359
like it starts with those the right

2274
01:33:09,399 --> 01:33:14,198
genetics and genetics nowadays a lot of

2275
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:15,479
stuff's great you'll get your 1%

2276
01:33:14,198 --> 01:33:17,000
everything washes you're just not going

2277
01:33:15,479 --> 01:33:19,559
to get what you want back on some of

2278
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,800
them you know like I washed the 500 gr

2279
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:24,119
of black lime reserve and we got like a

2280
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:27,159
grand back you know it's like it's that

2281
01:33:24,118 --> 01:33:29,000
type of thing but yeah still happens

2282
01:33:27,158 --> 01:33:30,439
today even with all the information we

2283
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,158
have out there and everybody talking to

2284
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:34,599
each other but that's where clones I

2285
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:36,519
think or lines that are known such as

2286
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:39,400
your you know your mail lines that you

2287
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:42,000
you created um that turned into the the

2288
01:33:39,399 --> 01:33:44,479
lines that you work um it's you know

2289
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:46,039
like skunk one Sam I'm sure you selected

2290
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:49,319
and leans in leaned into that for

2291
01:33:46,039 --> 01:33:51,238
reasons that were most likely towards

2292
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:53,039
the end of you know things you wanted to

2293
01:33:51,238 --> 01:33:54,519
make and profiles that you were looking

2294
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:57,920
for

2295
01:33:54,520 --> 01:34:01,080
um yeah the blr Wilson does dump as

2296
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:03,239
opposed to the blr mom itself and it's

2297
01:34:01,079 --> 01:34:04,559
just that's that's kind of the that's

2298
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:07,039
your answer right there it's like it's

2299
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:09,159
genetics you know but but everything

2300
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:11,399
washes is just blr Wilson dumps about

2301
01:34:09,158 --> 01:34:14,079
four five as opposed to blr by itself

2302
01:34:11,399 --> 01:34:17,479
where it only does one and blr Wilson

2303
01:34:14,079 --> 01:34:19,880
does still carry on that lime uh tinge

2304
01:34:17,479 --> 01:34:22,599
not as explosive as mom where it's more

2305
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:24,480
of a Sharp burn your eyes lime but the

2306
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,719
Wilson gives it like a cream back in but

2307
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:29,000
it's like a lime cream but either way

2308
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:31,000
like you know you got to kind of work it

2309
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,238
kind of kind of work it only Haze thing

2310
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,840
that I've seen told me the the black

2311
01:34:33,238 --> 01:34:39,279
lime to watch out for Herms if I ran

2312
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:41,800
seeds of it is that I ran what you saw

2313
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:43,920
seeds no no Herms no Herms Herms that's

2314
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:48,079
great no Herms that's cool I see Herms

2315
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:50,639
in in uh in in land race varieties more

2316
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:52,158
than anything I see Herms in my

2317
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:54,960
Greenhouse when I'm growing it in the

2318
01:34:52,158 --> 01:34:57,479
Summer with the with the doors closed uh

2319
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:59,560
I don't really see Herms when like I

2320
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:02,000
live in Compton California it never gets

2321
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:04,440
below 40 here it never gives it gets

2322
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,039
above like 105 you know it's like it's

2323
01:35:04,439 --> 01:35:09,599
always within that frame and it's like

2324
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:12,079
very forgiving for the plants so when I

2325
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:13,679
grow I've only noticed Herms when I'm

2326
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:16,399
growing plants in places where they

2327
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:18,039
shouldn't be growing like in the shade

2328
01:35:16,399 --> 01:35:19,839
where they're like getting confused with

2329
01:35:18,039 --> 01:35:21,399
the sun in the shade or in a in a

2330
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,760
greenhouse where the temperature is

2331
01:35:21,399 --> 01:35:24,799
fluctuating a little bit more than

2332
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:27,719
they're used to and and that's when I

2333
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:30,000
notice Herms uh and I also notice Herms

2334
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:32,279
in a lot of like feral land race

2335
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,520
varieties like I've grown some stuff

2336
01:35:32,279 --> 01:35:36,039
that was sent to me from sapon I've

2337
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:38,760
grown some stuff from that was sent to

2338
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:40,439
me from India I've grown some stuff from

2339
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:42,639
uh Thailand that was sent directly from

2340
01:35:40,439 --> 01:35:43,439
Thailand and I had to be a little bit

2341
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:45,239
more

2342
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:48,279
careful

2343
01:35:45,238 --> 01:35:50,718
uh you know growing those as opposed to

2344
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:53,079
you know just anything else but the blrs

2345
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:55,840
no I I literally paid pop dollar for

2346
01:35:53,079 --> 01:35:58,639
those seeds in the charity auction and I

2347
01:35:55,840 --> 01:36:01,039
and I allocated some F1 seed stock and I

2348
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:03,560
also bought the cut that skunk Tech and

2349
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:04,920
mean jeene were selling uh collectively

2350
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:06,520
that they were doing on a on an

2351
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:10,000
Instagram sale about four years ago and

2352
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:12,239
I still have both of my uh selections

2353
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,960
and theirs in my living Library as as

2354
01:36:12,238 --> 01:36:17,839
well as seat stock for sure skunk Tech

2355
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:20,719
has some really good stuff um that he

2356
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:24,159
had sent to the states that I received

2357
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:26,279
and then eventually sent to him um um I

2358
01:36:24,158 --> 01:36:29,399
believe they are from

2359
01:36:26,279 --> 01:36:32,079
chamira of Old Stock that he just popped

2360
01:36:29,399 --> 01:36:34,679
on um I saw some posts of those so there

2361
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:36,800
should be I think he should be probably

2362
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:38,960
releasing some of those too the trir

2363
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:41,400
stuff was always really good and Sam

2364
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:44,920
didn't you work with chamir

2365
01:36:41,399 --> 01:36:44,920
is is that

2366
01:36:48,039 --> 01:36:54,198
true Sam mentored

2367
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:57,118
Chimera he's known yeah he's known

2368
01:36:54,198 --> 01:36:59,399
Ryan for a very long time 25 plus years

2369
01:36:57,118 --> 01:37:02,479
I would guess at this point in

2370
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:04,839
time hey welcome to uh Wade laughter who

2371
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:07,279
popped in as well we had a little bit of

2372
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:11,119
we didn't breathe that much together

2373
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:15,439
what we actually did was uh we worked

2374
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:19,799
together primarily supplying seeds to uh

2375
01:37:15,439 --> 01:37:22,198
to to the ne to Canada we we sold to all

2376
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:25,199
the big dispensaries licensed

2377
01:37:22,198 --> 01:37:25,198
dispensaries

2378
01:37:28,198 --> 01:37:32,759
that's true they definitely had that

2379
01:37:29,479 --> 01:37:36,279
figured out before most there was a

2380
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:39,800
window there those guys sold a swack of

2381
01:37:36,279 --> 01:37:39,800
seeds into Canada for

2382
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:44,800
sure oh I can hear it in the background

2383
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:47,880
there I can hear Sam

2384
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:50,560
talking echoing on the YouTube that

2385
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:54,079
restarted it's funny so how how are you

2386
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:55,639
doing today Wade

2387
01:37:54,079 --> 01:37:57,158
you're muted oh there you go you're not

2388
01:37:55,639 --> 01:38:01,760
muted

2389
01:37:57,158 --> 01:38:06,118
sorry uh not so great um the

2390
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:08,520
chemotherapy has been uh harder road to

2391
01:38:06,118 --> 01:38:10,519
hoe than I had hoped it would

2392
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:13,320
be

2393
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:16,360
um but I

2394
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:19,079
uh yeah decided to dve myself out of bed

2395
01:38:16,359 --> 01:38:21,759
and uh see what was happening in hash

2396
01:38:19,079 --> 01:38:25,559
church because this is one of my deepest

2397
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:28,920
gloves for conc of this plant and what

2398
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:32,000
she can do for us I

2399
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:35,480
uh yeah that's that's all I have to

2400
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:39,960
report um I am in investing significant

2401
01:38:35,479 --> 01:38:43,919
quantities of CBG and CDN based on from

2402
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:47,880
science I saw a couple of weeks ago um

2403
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:50,920
hoping to see some results from that um

2404
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:53,199
but yeah most mostly mostly doing

2405
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:56,359

2410
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:10,039
here in the last couple of days so I'm

2411
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:14,000
uh dealing with a broken bone certainly

2412
01:39:10,039 --> 01:39:18,000
not anything compared but uh boy it

2413
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:20,679
hurts Yeah I broke I broke the cladal on

2414
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:24,238
this side opening a pill bottle a couple

2415
01:39:20,679 --> 01:39:27,079
of years ago oh my that that's what that

2416
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:30,079
was that broke I remember

2417
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:32,279
that well I flew off a skateboard going

2418
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:35,039
mock speed and landed on my shoulder at

2419
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:37,039
the Whistler skate park uh so it was uh

2420
01:39:35,039 --> 01:39:40,560
kind of like getting hit with a bat it

2421
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:40,560
was it was no

2422
01:39:41,599 --> 01:39:45,760
buyo I'm still trying to figure out this

2423
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:49,079
technical difficulty we had we lost

2424
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:52,039
about 175 live viewers we had over we

2425
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:54,479
had 368 people watching live and we're

2426
01:39:52,039 --> 01:39:56,359
back to about 150 3 so thank you guys

2427
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:58,919
for being the hardcores that came back

2428
01:39:56,359 --> 01:40:01,359
and hopefully we'll the rest of people

2429
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:03,639
will realize that we're back on tune I

2430
01:40:01,359 --> 01:40:05,880
you know in 10 years of doing hash

2431
01:40:03,639 --> 01:40:08,400
Church it hasn't just shut off on

2432
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:10,039
YouTube many times so that's maybe like

2433
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:12,439
the second or third time that's ever

2434
01:40:10,039 --> 01:40:14,039
happened so apologies for the technical

2435
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:16,079
difficulties I did do it differently

2436
01:40:14,039 --> 01:40:18,800
today and I'll probably just stick to

2437
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:20,238
doing it the same from now on because uh

2438
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,960
that was stressing me out I feel like a

2439
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:24,158
pro after 10 years because I was having

2440
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:26,079
a massive anxiety attack wondering where

2441
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:30,279
the stream went but I didn't want to

2442
01:40:26,079 --> 01:40:30,279
interrupt so thank you guys for your

2443
01:40:30,599 --> 01:40:35,840
patience maybe it's time to smoke some

2444
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:37,880
help with that Mark I'm curious have you

2445
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:41,639
tried any suppositories for your

2446
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:44,520
pain me yeah no I've been just eating

2447
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:47,279
gummies they've been pretty good I've uh

2448
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:49,040
you know just been CH chomping on on the

2449
01:40:47,279 --> 01:40:52,158
White Rabbit gummies the the the

2450
01:40:49,039 --> 01:40:54,039
sugar-free uh brown rice syrup sweetened

2451
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:55,759
vegan little gummies they're just 10

2452
01:40:54,039 --> 01:40:57,279
milligrams of pop but I you know I'll

2453
01:40:55,760 --> 01:41:00,719
eat like maybe five of them throughout

2454
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:02,679
the day and uh it's been pretty good I

2455
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:04,599
haven't had to take like Tylenols or

2456
01:41:02,679 --> 01:41:06,840
anything like that although I think it

2457
01:41:04,599 --> 01:41:08,480
was Thomas talking about suppositories

2458
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:11,719
last week in regards to how much it

2459
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:13,879
helped his uh his relative there with

2460
01:41:11,719 --> 01:41:14,760
the stage four liver cancer is that

2461
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:18,400
correct

2462
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:20,800
Thomas yes yes he um he was doing

2463
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:23,598
actually six weeks of a hyperbaric

2464
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:26,800
chamber um just like uh basic basically

2465
01:41:23,599 --> 01:41:28,760
compressed oxygen I guess and um or I

2466
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:30,840
don't know like going under pre oxygen

2467
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:33,560
under pressure and yeah he's been just

2468
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:35,279
taking like a a suppository dose every

2469
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:37,960
single day because he has no tolerance

2470
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:41,319
at all and he had all different types of

2471
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:43,118
tumors all over his liver and literally

2472
01:41:41,319 --> 01:41:45,479
um about six of them are gone and he's

2473
01:41:43,118 --> 01:41:47,118
down to two and in the last three months

2474
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:49,799
they haven't grown at all it's pretty

2475
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:51,439
mind-blowing so we've all been just like

2476
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:53,000
um like even the doctors are just like

2477
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:54,319
holy [ __ ] just keep on doing what you're

2478
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,158
doing and he's kind of taking like a

2479
01:41:54,319 --> 01:41:59,118
high dose of vitamin C and then just uh

2480
01:41:57,158 --> 01:42:00,799
yeah suppository dose every single or

2481
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:03,399
twice a day now we're just trying to

2482
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:05,599
load them up as much as possible what

2483
01:42:03,399 --> 01:42:08,879
are the doses he on for

2484
01:42:05,599 --> 01:42:12,039
suppositories um I just was making rosin

2485
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:14,279
and um making it as like putting just a

2486
01:42:12,039 --> 01:42:16,000
little bit of coconut oil like I don't

2487
01:42:14,279 --> 01:42:18,079
even know if he actually even needed any

2488
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,920
coconut oil but um like I had just been

2489
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:23,800
making pure rosin and just maybe about a

2490
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:25,359
10% ratio of coconut oil and then

2491
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:27,279
putting it in gel caps and he's been

2492
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:31,960
taking a couple of those a

2493
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:33,599
day so I don't I'm curious I'm Cur if I

2494
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:36,039
had to guess it's probably like at least

2495
01:42:33,599 --> 01:42:38,520
600 milligrams I would imagine or five

2496
01:42:36,039 --> 01:42:40,560
500 from each one I I just I haven't had

2497
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,719
it actually lab tested it but I'm I'm

2498
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:44,520
using like a good like it was made from

2499
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:47,439
flour too for the most part but it's

2500
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:51,040
decent flour I know I know one thing if

2501
01:42:47,439 --> 01:42:53,238
I made if I wanted uh Edibles I would

2502
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:56,399
never get Thomas to make them for me

2503
01:42:53,238 --> 01:43:00,439
holy [ __ ] [ __ ] this guy eats 2,000

2504
01:42:56,399 --> 01:43:04,679
milligrams at a time no no no that's

2505
01:43:00,439 --> 01:43:07,359
duration y I don't eat 2,000

2506
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:08,679
milligrams what what cultivar are you

2507
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:10,839
using for the rosin for these

2508
01:43:08,679 --> 01:43:13,279
depositories just I'm curious from a

2509
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:15,079
patient perspective uh it was actually

2510
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:17,158
it's been a combination of three it was

2511
01:43:15,079 --> 01:43:19,639
like this death Bubba strain that I've

2512
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:21,439
had for years and then the it was Mac

2513
01:43:19,639 --> 01:43:23,118
Daddy and a pink Kush was just what I

2514
01:43:21,439 --> 01:43:25,079
happened to have been growing so I just

2515
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:26,598
just been um from that one crop and I

2516
01:43:25,079 --> 01:43:29,158
just made like a bunch of oil from them

2517
01:43:26,599 --> 01:43:31,560
but we've um get running really really

2518
01:43:29,158 --> 01:43:34,479
low I you know I was thinking about like

2519
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:37,480
do I even need to mix coconut oil into

2520
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:39,678
it uh if someone's taking it suppository

2521
01:43:37,479 --> 01:43:41,399
I'm not even sure so I've about to make

2522
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:43,158
a whole bunch more for him though it's

2523
01:43:41,399 --> 01:43:45,279
like really uh well he was given like

2524
01:43:43,158 --> 01:43:48,158
months to live basically at some point

2525
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:49,719
like year and a half ago and um yeah

2526
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:51,359
it's like it's getting better so it's

2527
01:43:49,719 --> 01:43:53,239
pretty

2528
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:54,920
mind-blowing and like how's this

2529
01:43:53,238 --> 01:43:57,319
Constitution is he getting his energy

2530
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:59,279
back is he like how definitely

2531
01:43:57,319 --> 01:44:01,960
definitely he's like I I just saw him

2532
01:43:59,279 --> 01:44:03,719
two days ago and he like looked so good

2533
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:06,279
like I was surprised on how well he

2534
01:44:03,719 --> 01:44:08,960
looked compared to like six months ago

2535
01:44:06,279 --> 01:44:10,840
like where he was always sleeping like

2536
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:12,960
um usually people when they have it they

2537
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:15,360
get really really tired and yeah he's

2538
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,880
just doing really like he obviously

2539
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:18,920
still is a little bit tired and you know

2540
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:21,520
he he's completely cut out any type of

2541
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:23,719
sugar in his diet too and I'm just

2542
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:26,920
trying to eat as healthy as possible

2543
01:44:23,719 --> 01:44:29,439
and um

2544
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:33,960
yeah that's so exciting thanks for doing

2545
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:36,279
that for him oh yeah it's my pleasure um

2546
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:38,279
it's exciting to see like I said uh I

2547
01:44:36,279 --> 01:44:40,359
you know I was when he was doing the

2548
01:44:38,279 --> 01:44:42,198
hyperbaric chamber like it wasn't taking

2549
01:44:40,359 --> 01:44:44,799
it out like the same way that the

2550
01:44:42,198 --> 01:44:46,879
Cannabis has been anyways but I think

2551
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,000
that's anybody's best bet like I we lost

2552
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:51,440
somebody else in my family from it and I

2553
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,439
got them a bunch of Ro and or RSO and

2554
01:44:51,439 --> 01:44:54,598
they were afraid to take it and it's

2555
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:56,279
like cuz you know they're afraid of

2556
01:44:54,599 --> 01:44:58,159
getting high and it's just like no one

2557
01:44:56,279 --> 01:44:59,880
has an excuse not to take it suppository

2558
01:44:58,158 --> 01:45:01,399
why not use as many weapons as you

2559
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:03,400
possibly can if you get into this type

2560
01:45:01,399 --> 01:45:04,839
of situation it's what I recommend to

2561
01:45:03,399 --> 01:45:07,799
everybody and just push it on your

2562
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:10,000
family member just make them try

2563
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:12,000
it well it's like and obviously they

2564
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,679
play well together right like the V is

2565
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,920
it vitamin C like IV Therapy that

2566
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,560
they're doing as well uh I'm not sure

2567
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:19,719
about that part but I would imagine it's

2568
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:23,520
like a highgrade or I don't know I would

2569
01:45:19,719 --> 01:45:26,399
imagine it's like a good type of UV or

2570
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:29,080
I want to say UBC vitamin

2571
01:45:26,399 --> 01:45:32,319
C UBC

2572
01:45:29,079 --> 01:45:35,000
yes so I've been talking about UVC

2573
01:45:32,319 --> 01:45:37,880
lately so much just having a Thomas has

2574
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,560
UVC on the uh on the brain Selena those

2575
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:42,920
are the Predator lights that he's

2576
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:46,679
released that uh disrupt bug populations

2577
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:48,440
in a sort of uh pretty miraculous way

2578
01:45:46,679 --> 01:45:49,800
can you like I mean just for myself can

2579
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:50,638
you explain a little bit more about how

2580
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:54,920
that

2581
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:58,159
works um well you do get high from a

2582
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:59,920
suppository you you do you can if you

2583
01:45:58,158 --> 01:46:01,638
put it up too high like usually when

2584
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:02,920
we're talking about patient care I also

2585
01:46:01,639 --> 01:46:05,760
work with medical patients that use

2586
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:07,158
cannabis like to the first knuckle the

2587
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,520
higher you go the higher you'll get is

2588
01:46:07,158 --> 01:46:10,359
usually what I say there's a part of

2589
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:13,320
your your colon that correlates with the

2590
01:46:10,359 --> 01:46:15,880
liver and you can get quite high if uh

2591
01:46:13,319 --> 01:46:18,118
you insert it too so it depends and also

2592
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:21,199
you know your hydration level you know

2593
01:46:18,118 --> 01:46:23,519
your diet all these other factors um

2594
01:46:21,198 --> 01:46:25,158
really it makes a difference and how

2595
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:28,480
that suppository is going to be be

2596
01:46:25,158 --> 01:46:30,879
received or not I to be quite honest

2597
01:46:28,479 --> 01:46:33,718
I've never got into that part of the

2598
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:35,880
topic about how like how far how far to

2599
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:37,000
push it um I never even thought of that

2600
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,359
but I didn't definitely didn't think

2601
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:42,639
that it gets you high well like this guy

2602
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:44,759
or my cousin like he took 20 milligrams

2603
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:46,440
orally he'd be totally leveled so I

2604
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:49,639
guess he's it's keeping it at a level

2605
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:51,319
where he's not getting high yet well and

2606
01:46:49,639 --> 01:46:53,079
what I've also seen with some patients

2607
01:46:51,319 --> 01:46:54,880
that I've worked with is you know the

2608
01:46:53,079 --> 01:46:56,118
the degree of cancer that they're

2609
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,800
fighting or the degree of pain that

2610
01:46:56,118 --> 01:46:59,479
they're in it's almost like the medicine

2611
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:01,400
goes towards mitigating that first

2612
01:46:59,479 --> 01:47:03,919
before it presents as a Euphoria or

2613
01:47:01,399 --> 01:47:05,638
dysphoria so like we've had an example

2614
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:07,399
where somebody's cancer went into

2615
01:47:05,639 --> 01:47:08,560
remission they were taking the same dose

2616
01:47:07,399 --> 01:47:11,118
that they'd always take and all of a

2617
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,840
sudden they were very intoxicated from

2618
01:47:11,118 --> 01:47:14,039
the medicine and what we found is it was

2619
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:16,400
because the cancer had gone into

2620
01:47:14,039 --> 01:47:18,840
remission and it wasn't needed for

2621
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:20,638
fighting that cancer anymore um so I

2622
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:22,319
mean this plant is miraculous we really

2623
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:24,239
we don't fully know but I think it's

2624
01:47:22,319 --> 01:47:25,799
really cool that uh you know we're at

2625
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:27,718
least experimenting and people have

2626
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:29,079
access to it and you're providing that

2627
01:47:27,719 --> 01:47:31,880
option for your family I think it's

2628
01:47:29,079 --> 01:47:34,679
really important well just this topic

2629
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:37,239
got brought up earlier this week um

2630
01:47:34,679 --> 01:47:39,679
while there was like a someone had said

2631
01:47:37,238 --> 01:47:41,238
something about the legal market and the

2632
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:43,800
and you know the black market or the

2633
01:47:41,238 --> 01:47:45,479
Legacy market and before I made a post I

2634
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:46,719
actually went around and I like phoned a

2635
01:47:45,479 --> 01:47:49,000
whole bunch of different stores to just

2636
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:51,480
see like how much someone can get a gram

2637
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:53,599
of RSO if they need to fight cancer and

2638
01:47:51,479 --> 01:47:55,799
it's like you know at the cheapest I

2639
01:47:53,599 --> 01:47:58,760
could get was like $34 for something

2640
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:00,239
that's 650 milligrams and you know what

2641
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:01,960
percentage of the population can

2642
01:48:00,238 --> 01:48:04,479
actually afford to take that or do that

2643
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:07,520
twice a day it's it's just it's not it's

2644
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:09,118
not affordable for people but on the

2645
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:10,400
like on the Legacy side of things you

2646
01:48:09,118 --> 01:48:12,439
definitely can find stuff that's

2647
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:14,920
affordable for people so there's a real

2648
01:48:12,439 --> 01:48:16,439
issue it's um where well like the

2649
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:19,158
government or some people need to start

2650
01:48:16,439 --> 01:48:20,678
stepping up or advocating to subsidize

2651
01:48:19,158 --> 01:48:22,439
anybody if they if they legitimately

2652
01:48:20,679 --> 01:48:24,319
have cancer they should should be a

2653
01:48:22,439 --> 01:48:26,279
right they can get it like I know people

2654
01:48:24,319 --> 01:48:27,639
that are you know telling me that

2655
01:48:26,279 --> 01:48:28,880
they're you know they're trying to take

2656
01:48:27,639 --> 01:48:30,279
it as much as they can as they can

2657
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:33,039
afford it which is pretty crazy when

2658
01:48:30,279 --> 01:48:35,000
you're fighting for your life it's wild

2659
01:48:33,039 --> 01:48:37,279
and then to pay excise tax on top of it

2660
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,319
all is just such an insult especially

2661
01:48:37,279 --> 01:48:40,599
because it's

2662
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:42,198
medicine well I know when they subsidize

2663
01:48:40,599 --> 01:48:43,960
to the most stupidest other things you

2664
01:48:42,198 --> 01:48:46,359
would imagine like when you look at

2665
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:49,198
other things or other departments and

2666
01:48:46,359 --> 01:48:49,198
stuff

2667
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:53,519
yeah

2668
01:48:51,238 --> 01:48:55,198
um well that's where too you know like

2669
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:56,639
I'm I'm in a patient grow right now like

2670
01:48:55,198 --> 01:48:58,319
if patients have the option to grow

2671
01:48:56,639 --> 01:49:00,239
their own medicine obviously it's you

2672
01:48:58,319 --> 01:49:02,599
know the most cost-effective way to get

2673
01:49:00,238 --> 01:49:04,158
it but not everybody has the space or

2674
01:49:02,599 --> 01:49:05,639
has the capability especially if they're

2675
01:49:04,158 --> 01:49:08,198
in a certain you know weakened state of

2676
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:10,039
health um you know and time time is a

2677
01:49:08,198 --> 01:49:11,479
really big factor here so this is where

2678
01:49:10,039 --> 01:49:13,359
I think like the power of community is

2679
01:49:11,479 --> 01:49:15,000
really important being able to have you

2680
01:49:13,359 --> 01:49:17,000
know those neighbor grows that can share

2681
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,439
medicine and and share resources or

2682
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,920
having friends that have you know those

2683
01:49:18,439 --> 01:49:22,359
freezers full of extra product that

2684
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:23,719
they're not necessarily going to use and

2685
01:49:22,359 --> 01:49:25,880
being able ble to share that amongst the

2686
01:49:23,719 --> 01:49:27,359
community for people that really need it

2687
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:29,719
um I'd love to see more of those types

2688
01:49:27,359 --> 01:49:31,639
of channels happen on a on a larger

2689
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:36,840
scale I think it's a a great way to take

2690
01:49:31,639 --> 01:49:36,840
back our power as as humans as Sovereign

2691
01:49:37,198 --> 01:49:42,879
beings awesome well said for

2692
01:49:40,599 --> 01:49:46,079
sure I'm still trying to figure out how

2693
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:48,920
the show got cut off but we we're back

2694
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:50,679
to 200 viewers so we got back up there

2695
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:53,560
we're bumping up people are people are

2696
01:49:50,679 --> 01:49:55,399
coming back they're finding you yeah

2697
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:58,360
absolutely are you still having your

2698
01:49:55,399 --> 01:50:00,198
panic attack are you okay no no I'm

2699
01:49:58,359 --> 01:50:02,079
pretty relaxed other than you know the

2700
01:50:00,198 --> 01:50:05,399
the soreness butth I'll tell you there's

2701
01:50:02,079 --> 01:50:07,639
nothing like soreness or pain to really

2702
01:50:05,399 --> 01:50:09,519
force you to be in the moment you know a

2703
01:50:07,639 --> 01:50:11,719
lot of people spend a lot of time in the

2704
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:13,840
past or they spend a lot of time in the

2705
01:50:11,719 --> 01:50:16,880
future which of course causes anxiety

2706
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:18,279
Andor depression so it's good to uh just

2707
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:20,319
try to be present I think it's one of

2708
01:50:18,279 --> 01:50:22,238
the reasons why I love cannabis so much

2709
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:24,399
cuz cannabis is also a nice little like

2710

you pay attention to it and you actually

2712
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:30,960
just exist in it in that moment rather

2713
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:32,639

2742

about to have a heart attack yeah I used

2745
01:51:40,039 --> 01:51:44,560
to I called it hummingbird mode which I

2746
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:45,960
mean is appropriate sometimes but also

2747
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:48,320
you need to stop and like smell the

2748
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:50,639
flowers and enjoy life while it's

2749
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:52,960
happening well it would take me forever

2750
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:54,520
if I we were going at my speed like will

2751
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:56,198
get right in there and I'll like get in

2752
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:57,960
the elevator else i' be I'm letting

2753
01:51:56,198 --> 01:52:00,638
everybody go where everybody's just

2754
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:02,960
fighting for it so

2755
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:04,760
yeah he's oh yeah he's not messing

2756
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:06,399
around it's like I have to keep up and

2757
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:08,280
it's like he'll cut in front of one

2758
01:52:06,399 --> 01:52:10,000
person I'll have to get with him you

2759
01:52:08,279 --> 01:52:11,800
need like one of those like little kid

2760
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,078
like harnesses on him where he's got

2761
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:16,440
like the little vest with a little leash

2762
01:52:14,078 --> 01:52:19,399
yeah yeah that's that would be him at

2763
01:52:16,439 --> 01:52:21,158
the airport I I'm sure if those existed

2764
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:23,118
when I was younger I probably would have

2765
01:52:21,158 --> 01:52:25,479
had one cuz I'm sure I gave my parents

2766
01:52:23,118 --> 01:52:27,920
heart attacks kids are amazing you know

2767
01:52:25,479 --> 01:52:30,039
you don't think so but they they are so

2768
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:31,399
aware of when you're staring at them

2769
01:52:30,039 --> 01:52:33,560
when you're looking at them when you're

2770
01:52:31,399 --> 01:52:37,319
perceiving them and so the second you

2771
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:39,159
stop perceiving them and they bolt it's

2772
01:52:37,319 --> 01:52:40,799
like it's why you're like how could that

2773
01:52:39,158 --> 01:52:42,479
kid possibly have gotten away in that

2774
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:44,119
short a period of time it's like well

2775
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:45,839
just just have a couple and you'll find

2776
01:52:44,118 --> 01:52:48,359
out in a in they've been hyper

2777
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:51,960
vigilantly watching for you to just tune

2778
01:52:48,359 --> 01:52:53,880
over yeah yeah yeah and what you think

2779
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:56,279
is too seconds was actually like two and

2780
01:52:53,880 --> 01:53:00,118
a half minutes now your kid's like seven

2781
01:52:56,279 --> 01:53:02,078
aisles over hiding in the cereal boxes

2782
01:53:00,118 --> 01:53:05,799
think me it's so much fun while you

2783
01:53:02,078 --> 01:53:07,799
freak the [ __ ] out yeah all kids I got

2784
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:10,440
cat kids so it's a little different I I

2785
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:12,440
got a mouse this morning he came into my

2786
01:53:10,439 --> 01:53:14,479
room and presented me with a mouse at 2

2787
01:53:12,439 --> 01:53:16,598
am so that was a different kind of fun

2788
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:18,598
surprise well I get that every day

2789
01:53:16,599 --> 01:53:20,840
yesterday was a bird the day before was

2790
01:53:18,599 --> 01:53:23,279
a shrew the day before that was a mouse

2791
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:27,319
and it's just been consistent for like

2792
01:53:23,279 --> 01:53:28,319
say maybe the last 200 plus days my cat

2793
01:53:27,319 --> 01:53:30,799
is a

2794
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:33,639
murderer in fact when my cat gets

2795
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:35,840
consumed by like coyotes or whatever's

2796
01:53:33,639 --> 01:53:38,480
going to eat it I'll say what I said

2797
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:41,599
last time when people go oh aren't you

2798
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:43,479
sad and I'll say live by the gun die by

2799
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:46,159
the gun that murderous [ __ ]

2800
01:53:43,479 --> 01:53:49,919
killed thousands and now he too has been

2801
01:53:46,158 --> 01:53:52,158
murdered oh woe is me well and it's like

2802
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:54,000
the cycle of life right just continues

2803
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:55,920
you probably died doing what he loved

2804
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,279
murdering something else or chasing

2805
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:00,560
something else exactly and probably when

2806
01:53:58,279 --> 01:54:02,399
he finally when my original cat Dutch

2807
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:04,840
who got killed many many years ago by

2808
01:54:02,399 --> 01:54:08,118
coyotes and then flown out of my Village

2809
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:11,480
by a bald eagle um when Dutch passed

2810
01:54:08,118 --> 01:54:12,719
away he um I'm sure he realized he was

2811
01:54:11,479 --> 01:54:15,399
like

2812
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:18,480
oh this is what it's like to be on the

2813
01:54:15,399 --> 01:54:21,879
Dutch loved to like pull baby birds out

2814

of nests he was a Serial he was a serial

2815
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:28,078
killer he was the most sadistic cat ever

2816
01:54:25,198 --> 01:54:30,598
and uh I would be remiss I would be

2817

remiss if I didn't show a picture of

2818
01:54:30,599 --> 01:54:35,400
Dutch as I'm talking about Dutch because

murderous and he was awesome and he got

2821
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:41,279
eaten by

2822

Coyotes that's what I'm talking about

2823

01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,078
about two years ago and she was one and

2879
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:13,800
I I got her spayed and it was from the

2880
01:57:11,078 --> 01:57:15,519
surgery sorry it it was so crazy because

2881
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:17,079
like I had a bad feeling about the place

2882
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:18,800
we were going to like someone had said

2883
01:57:17,078 --> 01:57:21,039
something bad so then I went and found

2884
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:22,679
another vet who had the best reputation

2885
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:25,039
around they tested her did all these

2886
01:57:22,679 --> 01:57:27,039
tests before and then yeah she when I

2887
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:28,679
got got her home she bled out and I had

2888
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:31,279
another one believe it or not before

2889
01:57:28,679 --> 01:57:33,000
that that uh it was another Cane Coro

2890
01:57:31,279 --> 01:57:35,118
and it had like a bunch of defects and I

2891
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,840
spent like about seven Grand trying to

2892
01:57:35,118 --> 01:57:38,319
figure out what was wrong with him and

2893
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:39,599
he had something in a spinal cord and we

2894
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:42,399
had to put them down at like six months

2895
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:45,039
old it's crazy I can relate I'm a can

2896
01:57:42,399 --> 01:57:47,000
Corso guy yeah they're beautiful animals

2897
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:49,039
I got to know they're very patient and

2898
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,880
taught me like she was real really low

2899
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:54,238
pressure dog so it's kind of carried on

2900
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:57,118
and Spirit you know where it's like a

2901
01:57:54,238 --> 01:57:59,279
low pressure lifestyle and it really is

2902
01:57:57,118 --> 01:58:01,559
has kind of come in with like a lot of

2903
01:57:59,279 --> 01:58:04,158
Peace into my life so I got a good a

2904
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:06,800
good blessing from that baby I love the

2905
01:58:04,158 --> 01:58:08,479
canes too nice I was gonna say that's

2906
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:10,119
probably one of her gifts to you

2907
01:58:08,479 --> 01:58:12,598
especially in the afterlife now it just

2908
01:58:10,118 --> 01:58:14,598
carries through yeah right away very

2909
01:58:12,599 --> 01:58:16,360
Vivid is like more you know obviously

2910
01:58:14,599 --> 01:58:19,719
noticeable now that she's gone but it

2911
01:58:16,359 --> 01:58:24,118
was like immediate immediate transferral

2912
01:58:19,719 --> 01:58:24,118
there you know of energy so

2913
01:58:24,158 --> 01:58:29,879
well rip to our to our friends that have

2914
01:58:27,319 --> 01:58:33,679
that have come and Gone Gone both animal

2915
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:36,000
and uh human for that matter I always

2916
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:38,880
say to people when I hear them grieving

2917
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:41,198
uh I think of Dr Zeus who said uh don't

2918
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:42,239
be sad that they're gone be happy that

2919
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:46,559
they were

2920
01:58:42,238 --> 01:58:49,000
here I was like yeah dude no [ __ ] and

2921
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:50,800
then I saw I saw my friend Clint Young

2922
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,760
have posted recently he lost his father

2923
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:55,599
not too long ago and he wrote

2924
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:58,840
I miss you Dad I hate that you're gone

2925
01:58:55,599 --> 01:59:01,560
and so I wrote in the comment section or

2926
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:04,679
do you love that he was here and I think

2927
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:07,000
it's just this slight ever so slight uh

2928
01:59:04,679 --> 01:59:08,599
perspective change um which I'm sure

2929
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,520
it's probably one of the reasons we all

2930
01:59:08,599 --> 01:59:12,719
love cannabis you know shutting off the

2931
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:15,679
background sound and all the sort of

2932
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:17,319
manipulations and all that sort of

2933
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:19,279
whatever you want to call it it's almost

2934
01:59:17,319 --> 01:59:21,238
like good versus evil you just want to

2935
01:59:19,279 --> 01:59:23,238
shut off the evil for a little bit you

2936
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:25,598
have a little hoot you open your mind

2937
01:59:23,238 --> 01:59:28,000
and you can start becoming more open to

2938
01:59:25,599 --> 01:59:30,960
these Concepts and these ideas that uh

2939
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:34,198
life is a little deeper than uh than you

2940
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:37,239
may think I got to share uh my last my

2941
01:59:34,198 --> 01:59:39,118
only Academy trip I ever had a big shout

2942
01:59:37,238 --> 01:59:42,000
out to the Empower Health Group in

2943
01:59:39,118 --> 01:59:45,559
Vancouver um they did a a clinical staff

2944
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:48,158
day and part of my journey was grief and

2945
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:50,880
I found myself on the river sticks in my

2946
01:59:48,158 --> 01:59:52,279
journey on my my Cosmic canoe I called

2947
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,760
it because it it's this feeling that

2948
01:59:52,279 --> 01:59:55,920
you're constantly moving and you can't

2949
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:57,719
hold on to anything but I was on the

2950
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:59,920
river sticks and I was floating on the

2951
01:59:57,719 --> 02:00:02,359
grief River and the message to me was

2952
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:04,399
the grief is the love and the love is

2953
02:00:02,359 --> 02:00:07,598
the buoyancy that keeps you afloat on

2954
02:00:04,399 --> 02:00:09,118
this grief River and it's such a ative

2955
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:10,800
position but it's such a beautiful

2956
02:00:09,118 --> 02:00:13,359
compliment of each other right like you

2957
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:16,199
can't grief as deep if you didn't love

2958
02:00:13,359 --> 02:00:18,158
as much so that's why it hurts so much

2959
02:00:16,198 --> 02:00:20,359
and I think the beauty of grief too is

2960
02:00:18,158 --> 02:00:21,759
you know it's it's always with you you

2961
02:00:20,359 --> 02:00:23,920
know you carry it with you and even

2962
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:25,520
though more time goes by I love the the

2963
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:27,920
analogy that you know the grief is kind

2964
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:31,000
of like you know this the stone that you

2965
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:33,199
carry and it feels like so encapsulated

2966
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,800
right because it's so acute especially

2967
02:00:33,198 --> 02:00:36,279
in your situation you know your your

2968
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:38,320
beautiful dog passed away only three

2969
02:00:36,279 --> 02:00:39,840
months ago but it's like as time goes on

2970
02:00:38,319 --> 02:00:41,519
you have more space and time but that

2971
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:43,239
rock Remains the Same or that stone

2972
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:45,400
Remains the Same and that grief you get

2973
02:00:43,238 --> 02:00:47,319
to carry with you and and it is a

2974
02:00:45,399 --> 02:00:49,198
representation of your love and I think

2975
02:00:47,319 --> 02:00:51,118
it's just so beautiful and I think in

2976
02:00:49,198 --> 02:00:53,078
our culture we don't honor grief as much

2977
02:00:51,118 --> 02:00:54,519
as we should know or we have like

2978
02:00:53,078 --> 02:00:57,359
timelines on it or it should look a

2979
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:59,560
certain way grief is just so ineffable

2980
02:00:57,359 --> 02:01:01,279
and it's it's not linear you know

2981
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:03,480
sometimes you'll get a smell or a sound

2982
02:01:01,279 --> 02:01:05,920
or a song and it'll just take you right

2983
02:01:03,479 --> 02:01:07,479
back into those moments I really love

2984
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:11,199
your brief frame where you can celebrate

2985
02:01:07,479 --> 02:01:12,919
it you have I know I I know that for you

2986
02:01:11,198 --> 02:01:15,678
Selena that

2987
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:17,960
you really stared in the face of grief

2988
02:01:15,679 --> 02:01:19,359
in a different way doing end of life

2989
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:21,960
both your grandfather and your

2990
02:01:19,359 --> 02:01:25,439
grandmother in home that is like be

2991
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:27,840
Beyond like Angel status the paliative

2992
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:30,279
care that you offered them I'm sure that

2993
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:32,840
grief was being experienced through the

2994
02:01:30,279 --> 02:01:35,479
entire process obviously to the end and

2995
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:37,039
and and on but that is a unique thing

2996
02:01:35,479 --> 02:01:39,359
when you don't run away from something

2997
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:41,800
like that and you face it head on you

2998
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:44,399
can uh once again get you can get deeper

2999
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:46,360
in to the to the experience and I I was

3000
02:01:44,399 --> 02:01:48,519
terrified of grief I got hit with grief

3001
02:01:46,359 --> 02:01:50,479
when my father was was killed suddenly

3002
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:51,880
with his wife on a motorcycle that I had

3003
02:01:50,479 --> 02:01:54,439
bought him for his 50th birthday

3004
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:56,800
birthday and they had this accident and

3005
02:01:54,439 --> 02:01:59,598
and they both passed away and for me

3006
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:02,360
grief was like a shovel in my face I had

3007
02:01:59,599 --> 02:02:05,360
never really been forced to to stare at

3008
02:02:02,359 --> 02:02:07,439
it before and so it was uh it was a

3009
02:02:05,359 --> 02:02:09,439
little bit shocking I can see how people

3010
02:02:07,439 --> 02:02:11,279
would want to run away from it or maybe

3011
02:02:09,439 --> 02:02:15,078
get confused by it and think that it was

3012
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:18,000
a bad thing but uh I think as uh what's

3013
02:02:15,078 --> 02:02:20,759
his name here flound said here in chat

3014
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:23,880
what did he say the worst the worst that

3015
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:27,880
it is the lucky you were for your

3016
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:30,359
grief foul Bundy That's so powerful

3017
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:32,000
that's so powerful thank you for that

3018
02:02:30,359 --> 02:02:33,118
well and especially in your circumstance

3019
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,319
right like it what like with my

3020
02:02:33,118 --> 02:02:37,359
grandparents it was like a slow grief

3021
02:02:35,319 --> 02:02:39,439
process you know and with dementia you

3022
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:41,118
slowly watch this person slip away while

3023
02:02:39,439 --> 02:02:42,479
they're still alive whereas for you it

3024
02:02:41,118 --> 02:02:45,279
was like a shovel in the face it was

3025
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:47,158
like boom you know so were you able to

3026
02:02:45,279 --> 02:02:49,198
lean into it and go into it or did you

3027
02:02:47,158 --> 02:02:51,598
run from it for a while until it it

3028
02:02:49,198 --> 02:02:53,238
finally caught up no I don't think I did

3029
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:55,039
run run from it I think I pretty much

3030
02:02:53,238 --> 02:02:57,319
faced it right away I always say like at

3031
02:02:55,039 --> 02:02:59,158
the funeral I was kind of like the uh

3032
02:02:57,319 --> 02:03:00,920
the movie where you see the Italian

3033
02:02:59,158 --> 02:03:03,158
woman and all black with the veil over

3034
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:07,000
her face and she's like crying on top of

3035
02:03:03,158 --> 02:03:09,559
the casket I was basically her like just

3036
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:12,198
like I don't think I had cried for I

3037
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:13,719
don't even know like maybe 15 or 20

3038
02:03:12,198 --> 02:03:16,638
years or something so it was the most

3039
02:03:13,719 --> 02:03:18,719
incredible release of emotion uh and

3040
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:21,078
deep sadness and kind of just like whoa

3041
02:03:18,719 --> 02:03:22,679
like my dad and I I had a great

3042
02:03:21,078 --> 02:03:26,000

all of his e his ethics and morals got

3046
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:36,560
kind of put into me so I looked up to

3047
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:38,440
him he was a fireman so he was like a

3048
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:40,639
hero you know the day I was born he was

3049
02:03:38,439 --> 02:03:44,359
in his first fire he became the youngest

3050
02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:46,559
fire chief in Canada at 48 years old and

3051
02:03:44,359 --> 02:03:48,399
he did that because he went and took

3052
02:03:46,559 --> 02:03:50,079
while after leaving my mom getting

3053
02:03:48,399 --> 02:03:53,000
together with a new woman who also had

3054
02:03:50,078 --> 02:03:56,519
three kids plus his two kids he took his

3055
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:59,479
GED his M or his Bachelor of Science and

3056
02:03:56,520 --> 02:04:01,840
His Master's in business in like two and

3057
02:03:59,479 --> 02:04:04,598
a half years and I would see him at the

3058
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:06,840
kitchen table just like working so hard

3059
02:04:04,599 --> 02:04:08,840
like crazy style for like five hours

3060
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:10,279
after a full shift and then he also

3061
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:12,559
owned his own business so he was a

3062
02:04:10,279 --> 02:04:15,319
fireman but he drove semi for a buddy

3063
02:04:12,559 --> 02:04:17,760
who owned a semi he drove uh limousines

3064
02:04:15,319 --> 02:04:19,439
for herses from my grandpa who owned a

3065
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:21,360
funeral home and he owned his own

3066
02:04:19,439 --> 02:04:24,238
fencing and decking company so he built

3067
02:04:21,359 --> 02:04:25,880
Fen and decks and often the people that

3068
02:04:24,238 --> 02:04:28,439
wouldn't be able to afford those fences

3069
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:30,719
and decks he'd just swallow it so he was

3070
02:04:28,439 --> 02:04:33,158
like extremely hardworking if any of you

3071
02:04:30,719 --> 02:04:35,520
knew my dad you'd be like oh okay so

3072
02:04:33,158 --> 02:04:38,679
that's why you're kind of like that I

3073
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:41,480
get it so I I get to see him in me and I

3074
02:04:38,679 --> 02:04:44,679
get to see him in my sister and uh I'm

3075
02:04:41,479 --> 02:04:46,319
much more on the happy he was here than

3076
02:04:44,679 --> 02:04:47,760
uh sad that he's gone once you get

3077
02:04:46,319 --> 02:04:49,960
comfortable with it they're never really

3078
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:52,679
gone I mean if he was gone I wouldn't be

3079
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:54,399
talking about him right now

3080
02:04:52,679 --> 02:04:56,199
well and you keep him Alive by talking

3081
02:04:54,399 --> 02:04:58,000
about him by sharing those memories like

3082
02:04:56,198 --> 02:04:59,598
can I ask like what was one of the I

3083
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,520
mean I'm sure there's so many but what

3084
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:03,199
was one of the the gifts or the gems

3085
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:04,800
that you got out of having that

3086
02:05:03,198 --> 02:05:06,759
relationship with him obviously he's

3087
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:09,679
your dad but like what was some of the

3088
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:11,679
juice of what he was able to gift to you

3089
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:13,239
well you feel very safe when you grow up

3090
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:16,118
with a father like that you know you

3091
02:05:13,238 --> 02:05:18,718
learn about strength you learn about um

3092
02:05:16,118 --> 02:05:21,799
you know doing doing right by people and

3093
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:23,359
and proper manners and just you know his

3094
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:26,320
gifts were his

3095
02:05:23,359 --> 02:05:28,118
his uh sense of humor he was my dad was

3096
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:30,039
hilarious he would he had a classic

3097
02:05:28,118 --> 02:05:32,279
thing where he would kind of you know

3098
02:05:30,039 --> 02:05:33,800
tell a long joke hit the punchline get

3099
02:05:32,279 --> 02:05:35,479
the whole room laughing and then he'd

3100
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:37,320
kind of pull his pants up a couple of

3101
02:05:35,479 --> 02:05:39,479
times and walk out of the room and

3102
02:05:37,319 --> 02:05:41,479
although it sounds funny he literally

3103
02:05:39,479 --> 02:05:43,158
did that thousands of times I just

3104
02:05:41,479 --> 02:05:45,558
watched him do that it was just the way

3105
02:05:43,158 --> 02:05:48,319
his timing was with his jokes that he

3106
02:05:45,559 --> 02:05:50,679
kind of like leave the room when he hit

3107
02:05:48,319 --> 02:05:51,960
a real good punchline so that was uh

3108
02:05:50,679 --> 02:05:54,440
something that I'll always be

3109
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:55,760
reminiscent of and happy of just good

3110
02:05:54,439 --> 02:05:58,198
times you

3111
02:05:55,760 --> 02:06:00,239
know it's awesome I know one of the

3112
02:05:58,198 --> 02:06:02,000
things that I took from omop I mean they

3113
02:06:00,238 --> 02:06:04,678
both survived the Holocaust so that's

3114
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:06,158
pretty crazy [ __ ] but they always talked

3115
02:06:04,679 --> 02:06:08,039
about looking you know for the sunshine

3116
02:06:06,158 --> 02:06:09,920
in life looking on the the brighter side

3117
02:06:08,039 --> 02:06:12,198
of life always looking for that like

3118
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:14,480
little that little silver lining in

3119
02:06:12,198 --> 02:06:17,719
everything you know and considering they

3120
02:06:14,479 --> 02:06:19,839
had survived such horrific circumstances

3121
02:06:17,719 --> 02:06:21,760
it was always looking for like the the

3122
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:23,239
juice out of life of the moment you

3123
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:24,800
really enjoying that cake or really

3124
02:06:23,238 --> 02:06:26,638
enjoying that visit or really being

3125
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:28,199
present you know and just like the

3126
02:06:26,639 --> 02:06:32,159
simple things the things that you can't

3127
02:06:28,198 --> 02:06:33,558
buy yeah yeah I carry that with you well

3128
02:06:32,158 --> 02:06:36,000
the things that you can't buy it's

3129
02:06:33,559 --> 02:06:37,840
because money is the opposite it's like

3130
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,479
once you're focused on that and we all

3131
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:41,199
have to kind of be focused on it to a

3132
02:06:39,479 --> 02:06:44,319
degree I mean thoughts and prayers

3133
02:06:41,198 --> 02:06:46,638
haven't paid my mortgage ever I wish I

3134
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:48,359
wish that it did but I got to hustle and

3135
02:06:46,639 --> 02:06:50,199
I got to make money on the same on the

3136
02:06:48,359 --> 02:06:52,598
same uh side but it is definitely a

3137
02:06:50,198 --> 02:06:54,078
strange thing that the the working and

3138
02:06:52,599 --> 02:06:56,000
the making money unless you're really

3139
02:06:54,078 --> 02:06:58,679
doing something that you love can just

3140
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:00,760
Rob your your soul of all that juice

3141
02:06:58,679 --> 02:07:03,000
that you're actually here trying to find

3142
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:04,840
in the first place so and it's funny

3143
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,359
that you say the juice because today's

3144
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:08,078

02:07:23,078 --> 02:07:27,158

02:08:57,198 --> 02:09:01,000
just experiment like I'm so inspired by

3186
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:02,239
your garden oh my God you know even your

3187
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:04,960
plants that are laid over and you're

3188
02:09:02,238 --> 02:09:06,479
just letting them go I'm like yes um do

3189
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:08,559
you have any words of wisdom for people

3190
02:09:06,479 --> 02:09:10,959
that are watching this that are inspired

3191
02:09:08,559 --> 02:09:14,159
and want to get

3192
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:16,960
started I mean it's it's kind of uh

3193
02:09:14,158 --> 02:09:20,679
sounds cliche but like easy does it just

3194
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:22,118
do it pop some seeds you know uh a lot

3195
02:09:20,679 --> 02:09:25,000
of people try to

3196
02:09:22,118 --> 02:09:26,799
replicate like Perfection per se but

3197
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,238
like if it's your first time it's never

3198
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:32,239
going to be perfect you know my thing

3199
02:09:29,238 --> 02:09:34,558
was just it's it's like we can know all

3200
02:09:32,238 --> 02:09:36,519
the jargon all the info all the history

3201
02:09:34,559 --> 02:09:38,559
but it's going to be hard work it's

3202
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:42,000
going to be fill in pots up with dirt

3203
02:09:38,559 --> 02:09:43,639
and you know watering them every day so

3204
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,760
like it's hard work you know you could

3205
02:09:43,639 --> 02:09:48,039
do a little bit at a time and be special

3206
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:50,679
at that but you'll become more privy if

3207
02:09:48,039 --> 02:09:53,039
you're like you know just taking more

3208
02:09:50,679 --> 02:09:54,639
risk and putting more energy into it and

3209
02:09:53,039 --> 02:09:56,760
a lot of risk is involved because of

3210
02:09:54,639 --> 02:09:58,840
legality so it's like yeah you might

3211
02:09:56,760 --> 02:10:01,480
have to take a risk you know or else

3212
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:03,960
you're going to be subjected to Growing

3213
02:10:01,479 --> 02:10:05,118
six plants and you know that's not

3214
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:07,719
abundant at all you're not going to

3215
02:10:05,118 --> 02:10:09,719
learn much growing six plants so it's

3216
02:10:07,719 --> 02:10:12,800
like just do what you got to do it's up

3217
02:10:09,719 --> 02:10:14,679
to you finally to to like to to go where

3218
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:16,760
you want to go and sit where you want to

3219
02:10:14,679 --> 02:10:18,319
sit with you know all the Breeders and

3220
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:20,520
the who's who's or you could just be who

3221
02:10:18,319 --> 02:10:21,880
you want to be and just like kick back

3222
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:23,480
make dope [ __ ]

3223
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:26,960
you know and keep it amongst yourself

3224
02:10:23,479 --> 02:10:28,519
everyone knows what they got um you know

3225
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:30,599
that and and just like highlighting

3226
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:32,040
unique stuff or preserving dope stuff

3227
02:10:30,599 --> 02:10:37,078
like do what you want to do but just do

3228
02:10:32,039 --> 02:10:39,880
it super cliche but you just got to do

3229
02:10:37,078 --> 02:10:42,198
it I think it's accurate for the most

3230
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:45,559
part I think it's a good way to explain

3231
02:10:42,198 --> 02:10:47,399
to people that uh you know johnnyb

3232
02:10:45,559 --> 02:10:48,960
taught me exactly what you just said

3233
02:10:47,399 --> 02:10:50,558
which was uh you know everyone's trying

3234
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:53,198
to strive for Perfection when I started

3235
02:10:50,559 --> 02:10:55,199
my YouTube channel I was literally just

3236
02:10:53,198 --> 02:10:56,558
trying to make per not perfect videos

3237
02:10:55,198 --> 02:10:58,439
but I would definitely like clean

3238
02:10:56,559 --> 02:11:00,520
anything out of the shot I would control

3239
02:10:58,439 --> 02:11:03,078
the shot I would edit I would just make

3240
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:05,559
it I would I wanted it to be what I

3241
02:11:03,078 --> 02:11:06,920
wanted it to be right and then Johnny B

3242
02:11:05,559 --> 02:11:08,679
would come and he would film with me all

3243
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:10,520
the time and we we would get some views

3244
02:11:08,679 --> 02:11:13,399
and you know got the channel up to like

3245
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:15,639
100,000 at one point in time and uh at

3246
02:11:13,399 --> 02:11:16,960
that point John was like oh I'm gonna oh

3247
02:11:15,639 --> 02:11:20,078
I think actually the channel was up

3248
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:21,639
around 70,000 maybe 50 and John was like

3249
02:11:20,078 --> 02:11:22,840
I'm gonna I want to start you know doing

3250
02:11:21,639 --> 02:11:24,078
this too I'm like well you should dude

3251
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:25,679
this is the camera I have this is the

3252
02:11:24,078 --> 02:11:28,399
computer I have this is the software I

3253
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:30,440
use this is how I use it and so then he

3254
02:11:28,399 --> 02:11:32,118
went and started doing some cool videos

3255
02:11:30,439 --> 02:11:34,678
and his videos were different because

3256
02:11:32,118 --> 02:11:36,319
he's Johnny B he's super relatable he's

3257
02:11:34,679 --> 02:11:37,960
doing videos he's making hash in his

3258
02:11:36,319 --> 02:11:40,118
basement there's like dirty laundry

3259
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:42,840
hanging from the ceiling looks like a

3260
02:11:40,118 --> 02:11:45,839
bomb went off in this guy's house and

3261
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:48,078
it's just authentic and it's relatable

3262
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:51,880
and it's real and here I am creating

3263
02:11:48,078 --> 02:11:54,238
this unrelatable unreal you know over

3264
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:57,078
overlooking the ocean making hash on the

3265
02:11:54,238 --> 02:11:59,558
boat and it's I still got views but not

3266
02:11:57,078 --> 02:12:03,000
the way Johnny B got views Johnny B beat

3267
02:11:59,559 --> 02:12:05,599
me to 100,000 view uh followers on on

3268
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:07,520
YouTube and I was just driving me nuts I

3269
02:12:05,599 --> 02:12:09,599
was like what the [ __ ] I'm like putting

3270
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:10,880
all this work and energy into it and I

3271
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:13,199
think it might have been my wife that

3272
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:14,880
was kind of explained like yeah like

3273
02:12:13,198 --> 02:12:17,000
like Perfection like why are you so

3274
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:18,440
obsessed with this perfection even with

3275
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:21,760
hash Church the first time I started

3276
02:12:18,439 --> 02:12:23,879
hash church I did it 162 times in a row

3277
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:25,840
without missing a Sunday you cannot

3278
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:27,840
imagine how much stress and grief that

3279
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:30,400
caused me in different countries without

3280
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:33,039
internet like I would stress the [ __ ]

3281
02:12:30,399 --> 02:12:35,879
out and my wife would be like what is

3282
02:12:33,039 --> 02:12:37,679
your deal bro like what are you doing

3283
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:40,520
right now why are you so obsessed with

3284
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:42,800
doing the show at 9:00 a.m. PST when

3285
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:45,320
you're not even on the west coast you're

3286
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:48,279
in [ __ ] Amsterdam or Jamaica or

3287
02:12:45,319 --> 02:12:50,039
Panama for Christ's sake so it was a a

3288
02:12:48,279 --> 02:12:52,519
good lesson that Johnny B taught me it's

3289
02:12:50,039 --> 02:12:54,479
much more important to just do it and I

3290
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:56,040
think Instagram it's good to see you

3291
02:12:54,479 --> 02:12:58,039
using Instagram differently because I

3292
02:12:56,039 --> 02:13:00,840
think a lot of people use Instagram for

3293
02:12:58,039 --> 02:13:02,599
Podium wins it's all about not exposing

3294
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:04,360
your faults and not exposing your

3295
02:13:02,599 --> 02:13:06,239
mistakes and not exp and that's the

3296
02:13:04,359 --> 02:13:08,960
value that's the juice Selena was

3297
02:13:06,238 --> 02:13:10,319
talking about the mistakes are what we

3298
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:12,118
want to hear about I don't want to see

3299
02:13:10,319 --> 02:13:13,920
you on the podium that's great you're on

3300
02:13:12,118 --> 02:13:16,039
the podium every day I'm feeling great

3301
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:18,279
about my life I'm not that's how people

3302
02:13:16,039 --> 02:13:19,599
see that it's non-r but when they can

3303
02:13:18,279 --> 02:13:21,840
Johnny B would come out and he would

3304
02:13:19,599 --> 02:13:24,119
just be like well my Garden's got mites

3305
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:27,719
again you know just like just like

3306
02:13:24,118 --> 02:13:29,238
totally expose his [ __ ] oh I got powdery

3307
02:13:27,719 --> 02:13:30,679
mildew again I don't know if it's that

3308
02:13:29,238 --> 02:13:32,479
grape vine that's hanging out my house

3309
02:13:30,679 --> 02:13:33,679
that bubble man told me to cut down 15

3310
02:13:32,479 --> 02:13:35,919
years ago but I keep getting this

3311
02:13:33,679 --> 02:13:38,199
[ __ ] powdery mildew and people loved

3312
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:40,440
him for it it was like I have powdery

3313
02:13:38,198 --> 02:13:42,198
mildew on you know sure you're watching

3314
02:13:40,439 --> 02:13:44,598
those videos of perfect grows and

3315
02:13:42,198 --> 02:13:46,799
perfect Gardens but people that don't

3316
02:13:44,599 --> 02:13:48,719
have that that's not maybe it's giving

3317
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:51,079
them some inspiration but I think more

3318
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:52,439
so it's making them feel bad it seems

3319
02:13:51,078 --> 02:13:55,719
seems like the frequency of the

3320
02:13:52,439 --> 02:13:58,439
algorithm is that it creates envy and it

3321
02:13:55,719 --> 02:14:00,118
creates just a not a great Vibe what I

3322
02:13:58,439 --> 02:14:01,479
like about you Mace is that you're just

3323
02:14:00,118 --> 02:14:04,078
doing it you're just putting it out

3324
02:14:01,479 --> 02:14:06,078
there even showing your grow I also

3325
02:14:04,078 --> 02:14:08,439
loved it I thought that's great like it

3326
02:14:06,078 --> 02:14:11,880
doesn't have to be like this obsessive

3327
02:14:08,439 --> 02:14:14,439
compulsive Perfection like beauty comes

3328
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:17,520
out of the imperfect you know and I

3329
02:14:14,439 --> 02:14:20,479
think that uh it's also what I kids need

3330
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:22,360
to learn these days that imagination

3331
02:14:20,479 --> 02:14:23,799
comes out of boredom and if you don't

3332
02:14:22,359 --> 02:14:25,960
have boredom you will kill your

3333
02:14:23,800 --> 02:14:28,039
imagination so if you're watching get

3334
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:30,239
your kid off their [ __ ] tablet or a

3335
02:14:28,039 --> 02:14:32,399
or the phone or the computer because

3336
02:14:30,238 --> 02:14:35,198
that is the that is the murderer of

3337
02:14:32,399 --> 02:14:37,879
imagination and Imagination uh is the

3338
02:14:35,198 --> 02:14:40,399
creation of happy children well unless

3339
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:41,920
they're watching hash church right well

3340
02:14:40,399 --> 02:14:43,479
unless they're watching hash church just

3341
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:45,480

3357
02:15:26,118 --> 02:15:32,319

that son so it's it's been 10 years man

3359
02:15:32,319 --> 02:15:37,399

3360
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:40,559
remember Horatio hit me up I want you to

3365
02:15:49,319 --> 02:15:56,238
what he has to say oh my gosh gosh that

3366
02:15:53,078 --> 02:15:59,359
was uh yeah that was that was 10 years

3367
02:15:56,238 --> 02:16:03,158
ago it's hard to believe it's been 10

3368
02:15:59,359 --> 02:16:05,479
years so how many year how many years in

3369
02:16:03,158 --> 02:16:09,118
a row did you like how many consecutive

3370
02:16:05,479 --> 02:16:11,439
EP episodes was it it was like 162 I

3371
02:16:09,118 --> 02:16:16,598
think it was three years just over three

3372
02:16:11,439 --> 02:16:19,198
years of not missing um a Sunday right

3373
02:16:16,599 --> 02:16:20,960
yeah right or maybe just under three

3374
02:16:19,198 --> 02:16:22,960
years but it was a lot and I'll tell

3375
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:24,679
tell you I was very relieved even

3376
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:26,559
recently Sam earlier this morning was

3377
02:16:24,679 --> 02:16:28,199
like why did you decide to like stop

3378
02:16:26,559 --> 02:16:29,760
doing hash church and why did you decide

3379
02:16:28,198 --> 02:16:30,879
to start doing it again and I was like I

3380
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:33,200
don't know man I just go with the

3381
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:35,200
feeling it wasn't it wasn't hitting the

3382
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:36,760
same it was you know I just I thought

3383
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:39,599
everyone needs a break to go do their

3384
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:43,239
own thing and well then there was there

3385
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:46,760
was a 2.0 right so at some point you

3386
02:16:43,239 --> 02:16:49,679
brought it back and then at some point

3387
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:52,559
the channel Got Hijacked by some Bitcoin

3388
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:54,960
thing right or yes that that was bit bit

3389
02:16:52,558 --> 02:16:57,840
finance that was a scam and that was me

3390
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:59,959
at ski school in Whistler dropping my

3391
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:02,398
kid off and I get this YouTube video and

3392
02:16:59,959 --> 02:17:05,119
it it was like I got an email from

3393
02:17:02,398 --> 02:17:08,079
YouTube and I never get got by this

3394
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:10,280
stuff but I in an instant clicked the

3395
02:17:08,079 --> 02:17:13,318
the link and that was it the channel was

3396
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:15,200
gone in an instant and uh shout out to

3397
02:17:13,318 --> 02:17:17,119
the gentleman from Russia who helped me

3398
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:18,719
get the majority of my videos back

3399
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:21,479
because there was a guy from Russia who

3400
02:17:18,718 --> 02:17:23,598
had ripped all of the hash Church uh

3401
02:17:21,478 --> 02:17:25,718
videos like all of them and he said no

3402
02:17:23,599 --> 02:17:28,679
no not just all of hash Church Sor all

3403
02:17:25,718 --> 02:17:30,879
of my YouTube videos he got me like

3404
02:17:28,679 --> 02:17:33,638
hundreds of YouTube videos back because

3405
02:17:30,879 --> 02:17:36,199
towards the end of that scam the guy

3406
02:17:33,638 --> 02:17:38,239
started deleting my videos I I'd go on

3407
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:42,599
every day and I'd be like oh no so he he

3408
02:17:38,239 --> 02:17:45,519
deleted like 15 million views in videos

3409
02:17:42,599 --> 02:17:47,719
and that's why my views are like 32

3410
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:50,120
million or something instead of you know

3411
02:17:47,718 --> 02:17:52,759
the close to 50 that they would be at if

3412
02:17:50,120 --> 02:17:54,439
uh if those didn't get deleted but I

3413
02:17:52,760 --> 02:17:58,599
also learned in that experience when I

3414
02:17:54,439 --> 02:18:00,800
lost my YouTube channel that I do not

3415
02:17:58,599 --> 02:18:02,679
like my YouTube channel does not define

3416
02:18:00,799 --> 02:18:06,279
me and although I was bummed about it

3417
02:18:02,679 --> 02:18:07,920
more for um hash Church than anything I

3418
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:10,239
was also on the flip side like well I

3419
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:12,280
could just do this again I could just

3420
02:18:10,239 --> 02:18:14,079
start another Channel and the minute I

3421
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:16,920
accepted that way of

3422
02:18:14,079 --> 02:18:19,000
thinking the sooner I figured out like

3423
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:20,799
people reached out they gave me links to

3424
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,920
click on I actually got in touch with

3425
02:18:20,799 --> 02:18:25,079
someone at YouTube they got me my

3426
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:26,760
YouTube channel back with you know 600

3427
02:18:25,079 --> 02:18:28,638
of the Thousand videos that were on

3428
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:30,359
there and then this Russian dude popped

3429
02:18:28,638 --> 02:18:32,358
out of nowhere and was like hey I've got

3430
02:18:30,359 --> 02:18:34,920
like at least four or 500 of your videos

3431
02:18:32,359 --> 02:18:37,840
and I think he was maybe missing like

3432
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:40,398
like a dozen so it's it's neat how the

3500
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:39,640
flora DNA um some of you may be familiar

3501
02:21:35,879 --> 02:21:42,599
with them they do uh path pathogen

3502
02:21:39,639 --> 02:21:44,519
testing for things like hot L and woid

3503
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:46,120
for Growers and such

3504
02:21:44,520 --> 02:21:49,159
so

3505
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:51,079
um right now we're we're working on uh

3506
02:21:49,159 --> 02:21:54,439
establishing a platform

3507
02:21:51,079 --> 02:21:58,559
to uh Gene edit uh cannabis for trait

3508
02:21:54,439 --> 02:21:59,680
Improvement or to offer new traits to

3509
02:21:58,559 --> 02:22:02,039
readers and

3510
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:04,760
Growers um we've had

3511
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:09,080
some uhin the last year we've had some

3512
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:10,840
success with developing this protocol um

3513
02:22:09,079 --> 02:22:13,840
and we have some regenerating tissue

3514
02:22:10,840 --> 02:22:17,359
culture that has Gene edits using

3515
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:21,559
crisper um can see if I can

3516
02:22:17,359 --> 02:22:24,079
share a photo everybody

3517
02:22:21,559 --> 02:22:27,840
see yeah let me make sure that sharing

3518
02:22:24,079 --> 02:22:30,039
is uh on oh oh I mean if if you'd like

3519
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:32,159
or not but oh of course I would like but

3520
02:22:30,040 --> 02:22:35,080
sometimes Zoom has these weird defaults

3521
02:22:32,159 --> 02:22:36,200
where it says only I can can share so I

3522
02:22:35,079 --> 02:22:38,280
just wanted to make sure it was turned

3523
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:39,479
on oh I can uh yeah I can just send you

3524
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:41,399
the photo and then you can share it if

3525
02:22:39,478 --> 02:22:43,159
You' like no I've set it up so you can

3526
02:22:41,398 --> 02:22:45,239
share man much easier then you can

3527
02:22:43,159 --> 02:22:46,559
control what you want to share your

3528
02:22:45,239 --> 02:22:47,840
camera's off too I'm not sure if you

3529
02:22:46,559 --> 02:22:51,478
realize that or not you don't have to

3530
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:54,120
turn it on by any means oh yeah no it's

3531
02:22:51,478 --> 02:22:55,599
it's fine I prefer to have it off but

3532
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:57,560
let's

3533
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:59,640
see

3534
02:22:57,559 --> 02:23:02,039
uh well we're not all sitting in

3535
02:22:59,639 --> 02:23:02,039
beautiful

3536
02:23:02,318 --> 02:23:06,840
gardens right see yet

3537
02:23:09,020 --> 02:23:12,190
[Music]

3538
02:23:12,239 --> 02:23:16,639
yet all right we got a few people one

3539
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:18,239
second yeah no problem take your time

3540
02:23:16,639 --> 02:23:19,920
got a few people that say they have

3541
02:23:18,239 --> 02:23:21,840
questions about crisper and cannabis

3542
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:23,040
technology so I'll save those for after

3543
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:26,680
you've explained what you're going to

3544
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:29,160
show and maybe we can get into that

3545
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:30,760
welcome back Mojave hey thanks for

3546
02:23:29,159 --> 02:23:33,079
having me

3547
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:34,680
back you know hey while we're waiting

3548
02:23:33,079 --> 02:23:36,920
for our T to get that fired up I just

3549
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:38,600
wanted to also mention to Masonic man

3550
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:40,040
because we dropped off before I got to

3551
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:42,439
see a chance I I didn't get to meet you

3552
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:44,760
but I did go to your free seed Day event

3553
02:23:42,439 --> 02:23:47,520
man and I was just the other day

3554
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:48,800
cataloging all my seeds and I had just

3555
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:50,640
all these I was like where did these

3556
02:23:48,799 --> 02:23:52,879
come from all these packs I'm like pack

3557
02:23:50,639 --> 02:23:54,719
pack like oh dude free seed day and just

3558
02:23:52,879 --> 02:23:56,879
what a great thing you do to put

3559
02:23:54,719 --> 02:23:58,760
together this event brings all these

3560
02:23:56,879 --> 02:24:01,199
people together and you guys give away

3561
02:23:58,760 --> 02:24:03,359
so many seeds and you create a space for

3562
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:05,840
people to do their thing so just like

3563
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:08,079
big props for you on that man no doubt

3564
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:10,359
man thanks for coming and supporting

3565
02:24:08,079 --> 02:24:12,039
appreciate it I want to get one out on

3566
02:24:10,359 --> 02:24:15,479
the East Coast with you brother we got

3567
02:24:12,040 --> 02:24:18,359
to talk about it no doubt no doubt we

3568
02:24:15,478 --> 02:24:20,639
got to run one up together for sure yeah

3569
02:24:18,359 --> 02:24:23,279
for sure

3570
02:24:20,639 --> 02:24:27,519
all right what is this

3571
02:24:23,279 --> 02:24:31,439
do this is a regenerating uh cannabis

3572
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:34,479
plantlet uh that we transformed with

3573
02:24:31,439 --> 02:24:38,239
crisper and we targeted a gene called

3574
02:24:34,478 --> 02:24:41,879
phyto desaturase or PDS for short and so

3575
02:24:38,239 --> 02:24:44,799
when you mutate this Gene uh typically

3576
02:24:41,879 --> 02:24:46,839
the phenotype you see is an albino plant

3577
02:24:44,799 --> 02:24:50,398
so this is just simply for proof of

3578
02:24:46,840 --> 02:24:53,318
concept for our protocol and so now

3579
02:24:50,398 --> 02:24:55,559
we've also had some some results with uh

3580
02:24:53,318 --> 02:24:57,959
other Gene targets uh one specifically

3581
02:24:55,559 --> 02:25:00,680
for Drought

3582
02:24:57,959 --> 02:25:02,959
resistance and we're kind of right now

3583
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:06,159
trying to get some insight from from

3584
02:25:02,959 --> 02:25:09,478
Growers and and um other scientists on

3585
02:25:06,159 --> 02:25:13,159
what kind of traits the Market's looking

3586
02:25:09,478 --> 02:25:16,959
for um that we can Target

3587
02:25:13,159 --> 02:25:21,039
so if you you guys have any insights be

3588
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:24,879
appreciated mold resistant early finish

3589
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:28,520
big yields on hash Drome content oil

3590
02:25:24,879 --> 02:25:32,039
content you yeah yeah there's a few that

3591
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:37,520
I've considered for those um traits

3592
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:40,760
um there's one one Locus Gene Locus that

3593
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:42,760
gives Pottery mdeo resistance it's been

3594
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:46,680
shown in several other plants

3595
02:25:42,760 --> 02:25:49,920
so and um as far as far as tricomes

3596
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:53,359
there's also one that if you target it

3597
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:55,920
we predict uh specific Gene um predict

3598
02:25:53,359 --> 02:25:59,640
that uh triome density will

3599
02:25:55,920 --> 02:26:02,079
increase so what about type of triome

3600
02:25:59,639 --> 02:26:03,358
production like less bulbous and more

3601
02:26:02,079 --> 02:26:07,200
capitate

3602
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:09,520
Cil okay yeah um I have to look into

3603
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:13,439
like what kind of genes

3604
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:15,680
um uh the triome uh development are

3605
02:26:13,439 --> 02:26:19,000
involved in

3606
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:21,200
so it's cool in that pathway what was

3607
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:23,239
that very it's just cool that you can do

3608
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:26,040
it it's a neat way to be able to look at

3609
02:26:23,239 --> 02:26:27,680
the plant and go you know deeper I'll

3610
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:29,720
always think of Terence mckenny when he

3611
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:33,639
said how come the deeper in you go the

3612
02:26:29,719 --> 02:26:37,159
bigger it gets oh yeah more questions

3613
02:26:33,639 --> 02:26:38,840
arise afterwards right Wade had his hand

3614
02:26:37,159 --> 02:26:42,239
up oh

3615
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:45,799
thanks yeah um I couldn't help but jump

3616
02:26:42,239 --> 02:26:49,439
in I uh know a little bit about crypto

3617
02:26:45,799 --> 02:26:52,559
technology and uh I'm assuming you're

3618
02:26:49,439 --> 02:26:55,600
doing good prce practices on making sure

3619
02:26:52,559 --> 02:26:58,199
some wild variant doesn't get out into

3620
02:26:55,600 --> 02:27:00,520
the greater cannabis plant

3621
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:02,920
population and then the other thing I

3622
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:06,680
wanted to say is

3623
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:11,079
um hopefully hopefully you're exploring

3624
02:27:06,680 --> 02:27:12,960
some of the finer minor phyto conoids uh

3625
02:27:11,079 --> 02:27:15,879
the hemp industry is certainly exploring

3626
02:27:12,959 --> 02:27:19,398
a lot of that but as a patient and as a

3627
02:27:15,879 --> 02:27:20,719
person who uh pursues minor canid for my

3628
02:27:19,398 --> 02:27:24,478
own benefit

3629
02:27:20,719 --> 02:27:27,639
um would love to see stronger plants

3630
02:27:24,478 --> 02:27:28,519
producing conoids that are of interest

3631
02:27:27,639 --> 02:27:31,318
to

3632
02:27:28,520 --> 02:27:36,399
Patient thank

3633
02:27:31,318 --> 02:27:39,478
you um yeah so we uh have standard

3634
02:27:36,398 --> 02:27:41,159
practices to PR prevent the release of

3635
02:27:39,478 --> 02:27:43,438
of these of these plants generative

3636
02:27:41,159 --> 02:27:45,600
plants everything is in in a confined

3637
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:47,200
space and we're actually just doing

3638
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:50,520
tissue tissue culture right now at the

3639
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:53,040
moment we don't actually grow to seed to

3640
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:54,920
flowering um and it doesn't it never

3641
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:57,800
leaves the lab into an open field or

3642
02:27:54,920 --> 02:28:01,840
anything like that and as far as uh

3643
02:27:57,799 --> 02:28:04,398
other phyto cannaboid Pathways Pathways

3644
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:07,799
we are looking at those as well um

3645
02:28:04,398 --> 02:28:09,760
possibility of confer conferring

3646
02:28:07,799 --> 02:28:12,199
different cannaboid

3647
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:14,478
profiles um but it it get it gets very

3648
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:15,960
tricky when you start perturbing those

3649
02:28:14,478 --> 02:28:17,959
Pathways because we we're not sure

3650
02:28:15,959 --> 02:28:20,599
what's going to happen you know you have

3651
02:28:17,959 --> 02:28:24,039
all these turpine syntheses you have you

3652
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:28,479
know the there's a lot like the CHC

3653
02:28:24,040 --> 02:28:31,439
synthes and other cannaboid syntheses um

3654
02:28:28,478 --> 02:28:34,039
are are very redundant so if you perturb

3655
02:28:31,439 --> 02:28:35,680
one the other one might uh compensate

3656
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:38,279
for for the loss of the other one things

3657
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:40,960
like that so those are exactly the kind

3658
02:28:38,279 --> 02:28:43,680
of concerns that I have our buo so thank

3659
02:28:40,959 --> 02:28:46,679
you for articulating that

3660
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:46,680
yeah

3661
02:28:47,239 --> 02:28:50,559
sure yeah those are valid concerns for

3662
02:28:49,639 --> 02:28:55,199
sure

3663
02:28:50,559 --> 02:28:57,318
absolutely I'm uh I'm I I'm cautious on

3664
02:28:55,200 --> 02:29:00,120
both sides I love the idea of using

3665
02:28:57,318 --> 02:29:01,920
science to go deeper in and if we can

3666
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:05,079
you know if there's new ways in the

3667
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:06,879
future that this technology can access

3668
02:29:05,079 --> 02:29:10,639
information that we've sort of been

3669
02:29:06,879 --> 02:29:12,358
blind to or maybe not blind to but that

3670
02:29:10,639 --> 02:29:14,760
took it just seems like everything's

3671
02:29:12,359 --> 02:29:17,040
about either access or speeding up the

3672
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:19,040
access um I know that's what it's been

3673
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:21,040
like for hash making for the longest

3674
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:23,319
time it's you know once we figured out

3675
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:26,760
how to isolate tricomes to a

3676
02:29:23,318 --> 02:29:30,478
99.9% ratio at right after that it just

3677
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:30,478
became well how fast can you do

3678
02:29:31,398 --> 02:29:35,719
it yeah I mean in some respect I feel

3679
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:38,319
like breeding was there in the early

3680
02:29:35,719 --> 02:29:41,478
2000s where everyone was racing to find

3681
02:29:38,318 --> 02:29:44,278
like these fast finishers right because

3682
02:29:41,478 --> 02:29:47,199
you could you know you could flip them

3683
02:29:44,279 --> 02:29:50,600
faster um and then it we got away from

3684
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:53,640
that and then you know 2010 happened and

3685
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:56,279
we started focusing on Flavor right so I

3686
02:29:53,639 --> 02:29:58,559
think that's you know flavor and then

3687
02:29:56,279 --> 02:30:01,359
potency as well is really really first

3688
02:29:58,559 --> 02:30:02,879
potency now now flavor I should say but

3689
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:05,359
um but it's really you know we're at

3690
02:30:02,879 --> 02:30:08,159
this real dichotomy right now where the

3691
02:30:05,359 --> 02:30:11,000
plants themselves may not be the best

3692
02:30:08,159 --> 02:30:14,359
plants for growing you know at scale

3693
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:16,520
because they're not resistant to the

3694
02:30:14,359 --> 02:30:19,120
problems that we see from pest pressure

3695
02:30:16,520 --> 02:30:22,040
or you know pathogen path you know

3696
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:24,000
pressure Etc Etc and then on the last

3697
02:30:22,040 --> 02:30:26,520
ass church we talked a lot about clone

3698
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:28,840
houses I thought was a good topic

3699
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:31,680
because in some respect and the reason I

3700
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:33,960
wanted to bring Ma on is because you

3701
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:36,200
know if you if you continually just buy

3702
02:30:33,959 --> 02:30:38,478
trays of things that exist that other

3703
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:41,040
people have already ran you're you're

3704
02:30:38,478 --> 02:30:43,519
bottlenecking not only yourself but also

3705
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:45,760
the the consumers around you and you're

3706
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:49,159
making an environment that's undesirable

3707
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:52,200
for them to go buy it so you know

3708
02:30:49,159 --> 02:30:55,600
exploring those varietals and it going

3709
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:57,760
deeper to look deeper at what perhaps

3710
02:30:55,600 --> 02:31:00,880
you might be be able to do as a farmer

3711
02:30:57,760 --> 02:31:04,079
from let's say you know 100 seeds or a

3712
02:31:00,879 --> 02:31:06,398
thousand seeds from from Masonic or

3713
02:31:04,079 --> 02:31:09,120
others um you know we're talking about

3714
02:31:06,398 --> 02:31:11,079
s1's earlier a little bit where I feel

3715
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:12,720
like csi's s1's are some of the best

3716
02:31:11,079 --> 02:31:14,200
seeds I've seen in a long time I was

3717
02:31:12,719 --> 02:31:16,639
kind of Blown Away when we first ran

3718
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:19,720
some of his work I was like this was

3719
02:31:16,639 --> 02:31:21,799
really eye openening for me you know um

3720
02:31:19,719 --> 02:31:23,358
his historically you know in our our

3721
02:31:21,799 --> 02:31:25,478
community and circles we used to talk

3722
02:31:23,359 --> 02:31:26,800
down on Sans you know we used to be like

3723
02:31:25,478 --> 02:31:28,559
oh they're not as strong they're not

3724
02:31:26,799 --> 02:31:31,039
going to be as strong they're they're

3725
02:31:28,559 --> 02:31:34,359
weaker you know and it's just our lack

3726
02:31:31,040 --> 02:31:38,479
of understanding and of of what you know

3727
02:31:34,359 --> 02:31:41,279
genomics really truly is so um I think

3728
02:31:38,478 --> 02:31:43,199
you know we're I think someone said said

3729
02:31:41,279 --> 02:31:45,960
it last week you know we used to say we

3730
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:48,520
know a lot about a little now we know or

3731
02:31:45,959 --> 02:31:51,959
we know lot a lot about a little about a

3732
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:53,720
lot and a about a little you know and I

3733
02:31:51,959 --> 02:31:55,639
think Mark said somebody said that and I

3734
02:31:53,719 --> 02:31:58,000
think we're our way to knowing nothing

3735
02:31:55,639 --> 02:32:00,318
about everything yeah and that's kind of

3736
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:02,478
where we're at and I think it's amazing

3737
02:32:00,318 --> 02:32:04,799
with all that all our expertise we're

3738
02:32:02,478 --> 02:32:06,478
we're still searching for things that

3739
02:32:04,799 --> 02:32:09,199
quite frankly I think we've seen before

3740
02:32:06,478 --> 02:32:11,318
but we're not isolating enough and now

3741
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:12,800
that there's more people growing plants

3742
02:32:11,318 --> 02:32:13,959
you know we're kind of bottlenecking

3743
02:32:12,799 --> 02:32:17,079
things so I

3744
02:32:13,959 --> 02:32:19,398
think you know looking at the gene po

3745
02:32:17,079 --> 02:32:20,398
looking at what even going back to what

3746
02:32:19,398 --> 02:32:23,680
Sam is

3747
02:32:20,398 --> 02:32:25,959
contributed and all those years ago like

3748
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:28,000
it's incredible that we're today looking

3749
02:32:25,959 --> 02:32:29,879
at the gene pool that we have right now

3750
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:31,799
you know and still pulling from things

3751
02:32:29,879 --> 02:32:34,199
and then we're all of us are buying from

3752
02:32:31,799 --> 02:32:35,318
clone houses you know because it's

3753
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:36,960
there's seeds out there that are

3754
02:32:35,318 --> 02:32:40,680
incredible that's what I'm getting at

3755
02:32:36,959 --> 02:32:42,478
and I think that Masonic you Edgar you

3756
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:44,159
and others are really providing a

3757
02:32:42,478 --> 02:32:45,840
pathway for people to really do it

3758
02:32:44,159 --> 02:32:48,879
they're just not taking the time to do

3759
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:51,840
it you know a lot of people are aiming

3760
02:32:48,879 --> 02:32:53,519
for that person perfect you know so or

3761
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:54,920
it's just you know that's that's what

3762
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:56,960
people are safe with you know you go

3763
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:59,559
grab the Clone you flip it you know why

3764
02:32:56,959 --> 02:33:01,959
would you go well that's been the

3765
02:32:59,559 --> 02:33:04,719
standard right the problem is there

3766
02:33:01,959 --> 02:33:07,079
isn't a whole array of genetics

3767
02:33:04,719 --> 02:33:09,438
available at a longitude and latitude

3768
02:33:07,079 --> 02:33:12,600
that will max out in the way that you

3769
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:14,359
need now for there are they are working

3770
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:16,439
on that I just got off of meeting with

3771
02:33:14,359 --> 02:33:18,359
the guy from The usda's germplasm

3772
02:33:16,439 --> 02:33:21,559
Institute and you know they're growing

3773
02:33:18,359 --> 02:33:24,079
over 500 variants so uh in two weeks

3774
02:33:21,559 --> 02:33:27,318
I'll give yall a report along with

3775
02:33:24,079 --> 02:33:28,840
pictures of the garden um to give an

3776
02:33:27,318 --> 02:33:30,879
understanding about you know what

3777
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:33,398
they're doing uh because they've been

3778
02:33:30,879 --> 02:33:36,398
collecting seed crops from around the

3779
02:33:33,398 --> 02:33:38,398
world and they're seeing early

3780
02:33:36,398 --> 02:33:41,278
expressions of full seeded plants

3781
02:33:38,398 --> 02:33:43,159
already and it's the end of August and

3782
02:33:41,279 --> 02:33:44,359
those are he said from like when Nepal

3783
02:33:43,159 --> 02:33:48,680
and Pakistan

3784
02:33:44,359 --> 02:33:50,479
Mojave so you know um it's also you know

3785
02:33:48,680 --> 02:33:52,720
latitude that's what Rob was saying on

3786
02:33:50,478 --> 02:33:56,719
our meeting you know it's a key issue

3787
02:33:52,719 --> 02:33:58,438
that isn't uh being discussed because a

3788
02:33:56,719 --> 02:33:59,719
lot of people are taking those European

3789
02:33:58,439 --> 02:34:02,398
genetics and thinking they're going to

3790
02:33:59,719 --> 02:34:04,959
get that full expression in Louisiana

3791
02:34:02,398 --> 02:34:07,119
Mississippi or you know in other areas

3792
02:34:04,959 --> 02:34:09,759
and they're finding that their what

3793
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:12,319
their expectation is versus the reality

3794
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:15,680
they're getting is two different things

3795
02:34:12,318 --> 02:34:17,278
yeah yeah I mean go ahead sorry I was

3796
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:18,639
just GNA say one one of the the big

3797
02:34:17,279 --> 02:34:22,680
problems in our industry is that you

3798
02:34:18,639 --> 02:34:24,639
know a lot of the the breeding work and

3799
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:27,200
cultivation Tech and stuff has been done

3800
02:34:24,639 --> 02:34:29,599
in controlled egg and in controlled egg

3801
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:32,840
we have a very limited understanding of

3802
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:35,559
um photo period and night Interruption

3803
02:34:32,840 --> 02:34:37,559
and trigger points so there's kind of an

3804
02:34:35,559 --> 02:34:39,478
arbitrary thing that that bleeds over

3805
02:34:37,559 --> 02:34:41,680
from a lot of crops which is just add

3806
02:34:39,478 --> 02:34:44,879
four to six hours of extra light and

3807
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:46,600
your plants won't flower so so that's

3808
02:34:44,879 --> 02:34:47,920
what people do so that for a lot of

3809
02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:49,239
different crops so it's just like add a

3810
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:51,200
bunch of light and you guaranteed if

3811
02:34:49,239 --> 02:34:53,318
you're growing a short day plan it won't

3812
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:56,439
flower and then the other thing that we

3813
02:34:53,318 --> 02:34:58,439
do which is like an arbitrary thing is

3814
02:34:56,439 --> 02:35:02,000
that if you give them 12 hours of light

3815
02:34:58,439 --> 02:35:04,120
they will flower so over the past 30 you

3816
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:06,520
know almost 40 years we've been doing

3817
02:35:04,120 --> 02:35:08,720
that as an industry and by following

3818
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:12,239
those guidelines we lost a lot of data

3819
02:35:08,719 --> 02:35:15,559
points which is how many hours a day

3820
02:35:12,239 --> 02:35:18,318
does this really need to not flower each

3821
02:35:15,559 --> 02:35:20,359
cul of our right because that's what

3822
02:35:18,318 --> 02:35:23,278
tells you what latitude you can grow

3823
02:35:20,359 --> 02:35:25,520
them that tells you how many day hours

3824
02:35:23,279 --> 02:35:28,680
they can absorb in terms of photons

3825
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:33,000
right a lot of plants can easily flower

3826
02:35:28,680 --> 02:35:35,239
13 13 and a half 14 hours 15 hours 16

3827
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,760
hours of daylight and they still flower

3828
02:35:35,239 --> 02:35:40,079
but they're not aof flowers anyway so

3829
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:42,200
that that little that one piece of data

3830
02:35:40,079 --> 02:35:44,520
that the USDA is like collecting on all

3831
02:35:42,200 --> 02:35:46,399
these different sessions that helps

3832
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:47,920
shape the industry and we weren't we

3833
02:35:46,398 --> 02:35:49,680
weren't able to do that because we were

3834
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:51,840
all just in the closet or just running

3835
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:53,920
in green houses with this arbitrary

3836
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:55,120
number but like I've been screwing

3837
02:35:53,920 --> 02:35:57,799
around with night Interruption with

3838
02:35:55,120 --> 02:36:01,319
cannabis for years and I never add more

3839
02:35:57,799 --> 02:36:03,478
than 20 minutes A Night to keep it from

3840
02:36:01,318 --> 02:36:05,278
triggering U but what I don't do is I

3841
02:36:03,478 --> 02:36:07,159
don't collect the data on every cultivar

3842
02:36:05,279 --> 02:36:10,520
that says you know at what point will

3843
02:36:07,159 --> 02:36:11,520
this one trigger you know so there's a

3844
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:13,239
lot of there's a lot of really

3845
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:15,120
interesting stuff that we can do when we

3846
02:36:13,239 --> 02:36:18,398
can do large scale trials at multiple

3847
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:19,920
locations of the same variety you know

3848
02:36:18,398 --> 02:36:22,079
but and I'll just add one of thing on

3849
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:25,000
the seed thing is back in the 90s man in

3850
02:36:22,079 --> 02:36:26,680
the Dutch seed world the people who came

3851
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:29,600
they all wanted the same thing they all

3852
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:32,200
wanted you know what what you have that

3853
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:34,960
that yields a lot is incredibly potent

3854
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:36,880
really early and resistant to mold you

3855
02:36:34,959 --> 02:36:39,358
know it's like they wanted the perfect

3856
02:36:36,879 --> 02:36:41,358
scenario and there were a few varieties

3857
02:36:39,359 --> 02:36:43,800
that did that but the reality is most

3858
02:36:41,359 --> 02:36:45,960
people didn't really focus for 30 years

3859
02:36:43,799 --> 02:36:49,679
the past 30 years they could have of

3860
02:36:45,959 --> 02:36:50,919
perfecting all of that in one plant you

3861
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:53,439
know and that's really what ultimately

3862
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:56,079
Farmers want they want just a few plants

3863
02:36:53,439 --> 02:36:57,559
that have all the traits that they want

3864
02:36:56,079 --> 02:36:59,000
instead of having to pick through

3865
02:36:57,559 --> 02:37:00,398
thousands of different plants and

3866
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:03,318
thousands of different phenoh hunts in

3867
02:37:00,398 --> 02:37:05,920
order to get to their ingame which is a

3868
02:37:03,318 --> 02:37:08,278
successful crop not a failed crop you

3869
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:09,879
know a crop that they can sell but

3870
02:37:08,279 --> 02:37:11,680
anyway that's why I think everyone I

3871
02:37:09,879 --> 02:37:13,920
think that's we're now all collectively

3872
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:15,479
working on that now Out of The Shadow so

3873
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:18,079
it's like it's a really promising time

3874
02:37:15,478 --> 02:37:20,920
to be in cannabis research well it's

3875
02:37:18,079 --> 02:37:23,520
it's what the market is asking for so Dr

3876
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:25,359
Ortega what is the industry asking of

3877
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:27,800
your company if you're dealing in

3878
02:37:25,359 --> 02:37:30,439
crisper and cannabis what are they

3879
02:37:27,799 --> 02:37:35,959
asking y'all to do or what does the

3880
02:37:30,439 --> 02:37:35,960
industry ask of the crisper technology

3881
02:37:36,719 --> 02:37:43,478
currently um right now

3882
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:47,799
um uh we've had some

3883
02:37:43,478 --> 02:37:50,199
uh requests for uh tpine profiles

3884
02:37:47,799 --> 02:37:54,398
flavors things like that

3885
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:56,800
and um also um resistance to certain

3886
02:37:54,398 --> 02:38:00,760
diseases like hotblade viroid and

3887
02:37:56,799 --> 02:38:03,719
powdery mildew things like that um and

3888
02:38:00,760 --> 02:38:05,200
that's that's about it for now but um

3889
02:38:03,719 --> 02:38:07,959
we're just trying to get more insight

3890
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:10,560
from from other for more PE from more

3891
02:38:07,959 --> 02:38:14,639
people uh in the Cannabis industry to

3892
02:38:10,559 --> 02:38:18,039
kind of guide us to our next projects

3893
02:38:14,639 --> 02:38:21,439
once we now that we have this uh

3894
02:38:18,040 --> 02:38:21,439
protocol pretty much established

3895
02:38:21,799 --> 02:38:27,639
so yeah I have a question too I'm

3896
02:38:24,879 --> 02:38:29,759
curious like from your Vantage Point

3897
02:38:27,639 --> 02:38:31,358
where would you like to see this go what

3898
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:33,520
kind of advancements would you like to

3899
02:38:31,359 --> 02:38:34,800
develop or how do you think that we can

3900
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:36,640
have these in like real world

3901
02:38:34,799 --> 02:38:38,079
applications you know like for example

3902
02:38:36,639 --> 02:38:40,840
you know patients with certain types of

3903
02:38:38,079 --> 02:38:42,959
cancer or Parkinson's disease or or this

3904
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:45,439
this symbiotic relationship between

3905
02:38:42,959 --> 02:38:46,799
cannabis as a plan and and humanity and

3906
02:38:45,439 --> 02:38:48,318
how can we contribute to that I'm just

3907
02:38:46,799 --> 02:38:50,599
curious where do you see this going and

3908
02:38:48,318 --> 02:38:53,959
and what are you excited about

3909
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:57,960
um so I see this going to um generating

3910
02:38:53,959 --> 02:39:01,079
new traits for uh beneficial um

3911
02:38:57,959 --> 02:39:03,039
molecules you know definitely you know

3912
02:39:01,079 --> 02:39:08,159
the plant itself right now cannabis

3913
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:09,960
plant um creates it's very beneficial U

3914
02:39:08,159 --> 02:39:12,799
molecules for for

3915
02:39:09,959 --> 02:39:13,719
patients um and where I want to see it

3916
02:39:12,799 --> 02:39:18,119
go

3917
02:39:13,719 --> 02:39:20,959
is uh bringing out those those very um

3918
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:23,880
those molecules that are not as abundant

3919
02:39:20,959 --> 02:39:26,559
as like THC or CBD those kind of like

3920
02:39:23,879 --> 02:39:30,159
hidden cannaboids or even other things

3921
02:39:26,559 --> 02:39:31,680
like flavonoids there's a can flaven I

3922
02:39:30,159 --> 02:39:35,398
don't know if you guys have heard of

3923
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:36,760
that um it's a flavonoid that um has

3924
02:39:35,398 --> 02:39:38,478
some

3925
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:39,840
anti-inflammatory uh and potential

3926
02:39:38,478 --> 02:39:44,879
anti-cancer

3927
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:48,559
properties so I I see it um I see this

3928
02:39:44,879 --> 02:39:49,879
going more towards the medical side um

3929
02:39:48,559 --> 02:39:51,719
and then the second

3930
02:39:49,879 --> 02:39:52,920
thing would be like uh you know

3931
02:39:51,719 --> 02:39:54,599
improving

3932
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:59,239
or

3933
02:39:54,600 --> 02:40:02,359
uh augmenting the you know drug type uh

3934
02:39:59,239 --> 02:40:06,439
cannaboids like TC things like that for

3935
02:40:02,359 --> 02:40:10,800
consumers for consumers sorry

3936
02:40:06,439 --> 02:40:12,680
um as well as um you know generating

3937
02:40:10,799 --> 02:40:15,719
more sustainable

3938
02:40:12,680 --> 02:40:19,639
traits uh for Growers you know uh what

3939
02:40:15,719 --> 02:40:23,679
if Growers use half or a quarter of the

3940
02:40:19,639 --> 02:40:26,478
amount of fertilizer or water in the in

3941
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:29,639
uh in their grows and that leads to more

3942
02:40:26,478 --> 02:40:31,119
sustainability you know uh disease

3943
02:40:29,639 --> 02:40:34,639
resistance what if you can generate a

3944
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:36,600
disease resistant resistant variety uh

3945
02:40:34,639 --> 02:40:40,519
so the you know Growers don't have to

3946
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:45,559
use pesticides or or uh you know other

3947
02:40:40,520 --> 02:40:46,760
compounds um uh in their grows so so to

3948
02:40:45,559 --> 02:40:51,199
sum it

3949
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:54,040
up um I see going to uh medical

3950
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:55,840
applications and also sustainability

3951
02:40:54,040 --> 02:40:58,240
applications and that's what I'm most

3952
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:58,239
excited

3953
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:06,000
about That's so exciting thank you so Dr

3954
02:41:03,719 --> 02:41:08,398
artura I was talking about this earlier

3955
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:11,359
in regards to you

3956
02:41:08,398 --> 02:41:15,478
know it seems like some of the most

3957
02:41:11,359 --> 02:41:18,159
incredible Cult of ours come out of that

3958
02:41:15,478 --> 02:41:21,879
wreck Market it comes from these um

3959
02:41:18,159 --> 02:41:23,478
obsessive compuls of cannabis lovers

3960
02:41:21,879 --> 02:41:25,639
that just are so obsessed with it and

3961
02:41:23,478 --> 02:41:28,000
it's connected to probably their old

3962
02:41:25,639 --> 02:41:30,840
factory and their level of sensory

3963
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:32,760
science that they're actually able to

3964
02:41:30,840 --> 02:41:35,799
perform and they're finding these

3965
02:41:32,760 --> 02:41:37,200
incredible flavor profiles um and then I

3966
02:41:35,799 --> 02:41:39,239
see what you're doing on that side of

3967
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:41,840
things as well do you ever look at you

3968
02:41:39,239 --> 02:41:44,439
know cultivars that are grown from the

3969
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:45,520
black and gray Market you know that are

3970
02:41:44,439 --> 02:41:47,960
all these different sort of seed

3971
02:41:45,520 --> 02:41:49,880
breeders to see you know these flavor

3972
02:41:47,959 --> 02:41:52,478
profiles that are winning these contests

3973
02:41:49,879 --> 02:41:54,398
like Legends of hash and the you know

3974
02:41:52,478 --> 02:41:56,278
there's a hundred of these different

3975
02:41:54,398 --> 02:41:58,318
contests now that you can go to and you

3976
02:41:56,279 --> 02:42:00,120
can enter your product into and if it's

3977
02:41:58,318 --> 02:42:03,278
done properly there's this there's just

3978
02:42:00,120 --> 02:42:05,279
this real high level of of enjoyment

3979
02:42:03,279 --> 02:42:07,880
that comes from the recre recreational

3980
02:42:05,279 --> 02:42:11,720
Market that I think has a huge and

3981
02:42:07,879 --> 02:42:13,478
profound impact on the medical Market

3982
02:42:11,719 --> 02:42:15,478
it's not coming from like farma

3983
02:42:13,478 --> 02:42:17,478
companies you know they're it's fine you

3984
02:42:15,478 --> 02:42:19,840
can split and do all this science and

3985
02:42:17,478 --> 02:42:22,599
it's amazing but you can what you're

3986
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:24,559
doing to what these breeders are doing

3987
02:42:22,600 --> 02:42:26,559
and growing these unique cannabis

3988
02:42:24,559 --> 02:42:29,039
cultivars where you where you do where

3989
02:42:26,559 --> 02:42:30,639
you find things through that that the

3990
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:32,399
plant is naturally producing and then

3991
02:42:30,639 --> 02:42:34,559
you go back to crisper technology and

3992
02:42:32,398 --> 02:42:37,358
sort of put those two things together I

3993
02:42:34,559 --> 02:42:40,000
don't know if I I made that you know an

3994
02:42:37,359 --> 02:42:42,960
understanding question no I understand

3995
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:45,840
um yeah that's actually what we want we

3996
02:42:42,959 --> 02:42:49,759
want to do we are a very young company

3997
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:53,600
um we just had our Oney year anniversary

3998
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:55,279
uh earlier this month um so we wanted to

3999
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:58,000
establish this this protocol this

4000
02:42:55,279 --> 02:43:00,640
procedure first before we kind of delve

4001
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:03,840
into um all these Growers that have

4002
02:43:00,639 --> 02:43:06,639
these uh specific varieties that you

4003
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:09,239
know have their flavor profiles and

4004
02:43:06,639 --> 02:43:12,000
their cannaboid profiles um that's

4005
02:43:09,239 --> 02:43:15,199
definitely something that we want to tap

4006
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:17,318
into um and work with with those

4007
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:20,640
readers it's funny I was watching Point

4008
02:43:17,318 --> 02:43:22,478
Break last night so it's like you know

4009
02:43:20,639 --> 02:43:23,680
you got to become the surfer now you

4010
02:43:22,478 --> 02:43:28,000
know

4011
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:29,559
oh what the k re version or you got to

4012
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:32,799
become the surfer now like you got to

4013
02:43:29,559 --> 02:43:35,719
just dive in there and like ride the w

4014
02:43:32,799 --> 02:43:37,959
go to go to Legends go to Emerald go go

4015
02:43:35,719 --> 02:43:39,760
like get in the trenches find out

4016
02:43:37,959 --> 02:43:42,559
literally what everybody fan there's

4017
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:44,120
literally key note flavors that

4018
02:43:42,559 --> 02:43:45,318
everybody likes you know and that's how

4019
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:46,520
they identify them they don't

4020
02:43:45,318 --> 02:43:48,398
necessarily call them by their

4021
02:43:46,520 --> 02:43:50,120
scientific name they'll grab a butt and

4022
02:43:48,398 --> 02:43:52,439
tell you it smells like Skittles smells

4023
02:43:50,120 --> 02:43:54,240
like blue dream and it'll be easier for

4024
02:43:52,439 --> 02:43:56,680
you to do your job I don't know I'm

4025
02:43:54,239 --> 02:43:58,719
thinking just knowing these like things

4026
02:43:56,680 --> 02:44:01,159
that we identify as and kind of just

4027
02:43:58,719 --> 02:44:03,559
getting in the trenches and learning our

4028
02:44:01,159 --> 02:44:05,200
jargon and applying it to your uh

4029
02:44:03,559 --> 02:44:07,278
science and then it just be that much

4030
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:08,960
easier for you to explain too like yo

4031
02:44:07,279 --> 02:44:10,880
blue dream I don't know if you're

4032
02:44:08,959 --> 02:44:12,559
familiar with it but like that's a very

4033
02:44:10,879 --> 02:44:14,079
general like that just helps

4034
02:44:12,559 --> 02:44:15,879
automatically with that and then as far

4035
02:44:14,079 --> 02:44:17,559
as new streams are concerned like

4036
02:44:15,879 --> 02:44:20,039
there's all these new ones coming from

4037
02:44:17,559 --> 02:44:21,680
the archives the blooms so like you'd go

4038
02:44:20,040 --> 02:44:23,319
grab some of the more newer strains that

4039
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:25,120
people are messing with even though they

4040
02:44:23,318 --> 02:44:26,760
might be like a derivative of something

4041
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:30,000
old but like a honey banana you know

4042
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:31,439
that's from like 2016 2014 but it might

4043
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:33,200
be new to you it's new to a lot of

4044
02:44:31,439 --> 02:44:36,880
people you know so it's all like just

4045
02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:39,319
kind of just being privy to Cycles yeah

4046
02:44:36,879 --> 02:44:41,639
and just applying it to the science and

4047
02:44:39,318 --> 02:44:44,318
just grab like why does everybody love

4048
02:44:41,639 --> 02:44:45,959
Skittles and rainbow belts and all these

4049
02:44:44,318 --> 02:44:47,680
hybrids of it you know why does every

4050
02:44:45,959 --> 02:44:49,799
why did candy shishkaberry win first

4051
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:51,279
place why is Starburst good and you just

4052
02:44:49,799 --> 02:44:53,519
grabb all these you know and then you

4053
02:44:51,279 --> 02:44:55,079
would have to know and be in good graces

4054
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:56,560
cuz this is like a different culture

4055
02:44:55,079 --> 02:44:58,120
where we're like oh you don't have the

4056
02:44:56,559 --> 02:45:00,760
real one you know like we're still in

4057
02:44:58,120 --> 02:45:02,840
that day and age but but but money talks

4058
02:45:00,760 --> 02:45:05,880
in industry and as long as you go to the

4059
02:45:02,840 --> 02:45:08,279
guy Mr Skittles Mr orange Mr what

4060
02:45:05,879 --> 02:45:10,719
whoever made it Mr Wilson you know Mr

4061
02:45:08,279 --> 02:45:13,000
Tropicana Mr papaya and you grab the

4062
02:45:10,719 --> 02:45:15,438
nitty-gritty that'd be better for your

4063
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:17,520
science cuz you'd be alluding to like

4064
02:45:15,439 --> 02:45:19,159
the original piece you know as opposed

4065
02:45:17,520 --> 02:45:21,760
to like oh I got this from a dudy said

4066
02:45:19,159 --> 02:45:23,799
it's papaya well it's probably papaya

4067
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:26,840
bag seed not that it's less of or more

4068
02:45:23,799 --> 02:45:29,318
of but it'd be better for the it's not

4069
02:45:26,840 --> 02:45:30,920
yeah it might not be the original yeah

4070
02:45:29,318 --> 02:45:33,278
that's just my my two cents from

4071
02:45:30,920 --> 02:45:35,159
listening to that merge you know it'd be

4072
02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:36,920
a merge of you just getting in the

4073
02:45:35,159 --> 02:45:38,200
trenches that that's definitely

4074
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:41,120
something that we have to do you know

4075
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:43,399
we're just you know we're not as steep

4076
02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:46,600
in in the Cannabis world as as most of

4077
02:45:43,398 --> 02:45:49,559
yall so um that's definitely deficiency

4078
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:53,079
that we have um and

4079
02:45:49,559 --> 02:45:55,519
we're we're coming to a a point where we

4080
02:45:53,079 --> 02:45:57,879
would want to start that conversation

4081
02:45:55,520 --> 02:46:01,000
with with with people and kind of get

4082
02:45:57,879 --> 02:46:02,079
out there to to these um reunions and

4083
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:04,559
meetings and

4084
02:46:02,079 --> 02:46:07,159
conferences or just you know just by

4085
02:46:04,559 --> 02:46:10,159
randomly meeting Growers that have

4086
02:46:07,159 --> 02:46:11,920
certain varieties or you know uh Legacy

4087
02:46:10,159 --> 02:46:14,159
varieties that they might have that

4088
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:19,159
they've never shared with

4089
02:46:14,159 --> 02:46:23,039
anybody uh things like but um

4090
02:46:19,159 --> 02:46:25,879
yeah I got a question Sam you're the

4091
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:28,040
you're the genetics master of Masters

4092
02:46:25,879 --> 02:46:30,278
what would you like to see done with

4093
02:46:28,040 --> 02:46:32,840
crisper or what would you do with the

4094
02:46:30,279 --> 02:46:32,840
crisper

4095
02:46:35,719 --> 02:46:41,000
technology he's muted right now let's

4096
02:46:38,040 --> 02:46:41,000
just see if he can

4097
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:47,680
unmute it's a good question though I'd

4098
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:49,799
like to hear the answer to it as well

4099
02:46:47,680 --> 02:46:51,760
I'll answer for him

4100
02:46:49,799 --> 02:46:53,318
was it didn't he say years ago like Tri

4101
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:57,760
chromes the size of grapes that you

4102
02:46:53,318 --> 02:47:01,920
could just pluck off yeah he did that

4103
02:46:57,760 --> 02:47:01,920
yes hey Arturo what's that

4104
02:47:01,959 --> 02:47:07,438
possibility well uh I was looking at a

4105
02:47:04,680 --> 02:47:11,000
gene to Target that could possibly have

4106
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:14,239
the tricomes grow not just on the buds

4107
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:16,120
and increase the triome density so that

4108
02:47:14,239 --> 02:47:19,079
it's definitely a possibility but it's

4109
02:47:16,120 --> 02:47:21,279
some charted Waters right now so I I

4110
02:47:19,079 --> 02:47:25,680
have one for

4111
02:47:21,279 --> 02:47:27,880
you I want no clusters I want the plant

4112
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:30,559
just to produce tricomes from the stock

4113
02:47:27,879 --> 02:47:33,839
all the leaves everything no clusters at

4114
02:47:30,559 --> 02:47:36,439
all and we can grow like billions of

4115
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:38,520
them next to each other like just plant

4116
02:47:36,439 --> 02:47:41,040
as many seeds as we can so we can you

4117
02:47:38,520 --> 02:47:42,319
can just and it's just leaves right yeah

4118
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:44,920
and then you you don't have to wait to

4119
02:47:42,318 --> 02:47:46,879
for flowering right that'd be right awes

4120
02:47:44,920 --> 02:47:48,879
wait zero flowering time because that

4121
02:47:46,879 --> 02:47:50,239
just never happens right and then on on

4122
02:47:48,879 --> 02:47:51,799
top of that you have better surface area

4123
02:47:50,239 --> 02:47:57,559
for hash washing because you're just

4124
02:47:51,799 --> 02:47:59,079
opening that up um so yeah um yeah this

4125
02:47:57,559 --> 02:48:00,600
this Gene I've been thinking of

4126
02:47:59,079 --> 02:48:02,279
targeting

4127
02:48:00,600 --> 02:48:07,200
um it

4128
02:48:02,279 --> 02:48:08,720
was it was um studied in tobacco as well

4129
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:12,800
and was found that when they knocked

4130
02:48:08,719 --> 02:48:14,239
this Gene out it um did somewhat like

4131
02:48:12,799 --> 02:48:17,239
what you're talking about where the

4132
02:48:14,239 --> 02:48:20,639
triom started growing more on the leaves

4133
02:48:17,239 --> 02:48:22,199
yeah um not on the stock but um on the

4134
02:48:20,639 --> 02:48:25,478
leaves itself

4135
02:48:22,200 --> 02:48:28,439
so and then the reverse of that is no

4136
02:48:25,478 --> 02:48:31,559
leaves on the flower right like the ABC

4137
02:48:28,439 --> 02:48:33,880
plant does that well if youve seen any

4138
02:48:31,559 --> 02:48:37,559
stuff that CSI did with

4139
02:48:33,879 --> 02:48:40,639
um it was the ABC times like KMD or GSC

4140
02:48:37,559 --> 02:48:43,398
or something there was a lot more runs

4141
02:48:40,639 --> 02:48:46,079
than success rates in that population

4142
02:48:43,398 --> 02:48:47,799
but of what I saw that was successful

4143
02:48:46,079 --> 02:48:49,600
there was just big clusters of flowers

4144
02:48:47,799 --> 02:48:52,679
with like two or three fan leades coming

4145
02:48:49,600 --> 02:48:54,159
off and like from a finishing

4146
02:48:52,680 --> 02:48:56,398
commercialization point of view you

4147
02:48:54,159 --> 02:48:59,200
could just like snip two you know trim

4148
02:48:56,398 --> 02:49:00,519
two little cuticles and you're done you

4149
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:05,920
know what I mean

4150
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:09,479
so yeah that would be to unfortunately

4151
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:11,879
yeah because because of um the

4152
02:49:09,478 --> 02:49:14,119
restrictions on on cannabis you know

4153
02:49:11,879 --> 02:49:18,039
legally there was not a lot of research

4154
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:21,160
done until recently on on the genes and

4155
02:49:18,040 --> 02:49:24,479
Pathways that might be associated with

4156
02:49:21,159 --> 02:49:27,119
you know uh flower architecture flower

4157
02:49:24,478 --> 02:49:29,000
formation right um things like that so

4158
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:31,640
that's something that we will'll have to

4159
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:33,079
empirically kind of figure out um but

4160
02:49:31,639 --> 02:49:34,398
you can take information from other

4161
02:49:33,079 --> 02:49:37,079
plants that have been studied and kind

4162
02:49:34,398 --> 02:49:39,639
of kind of guess what you know if you

4163
02:49:37,079 --> 02:49:42,000
target this Gene it might result in this

4164
02:49:39,639 --> 02:49:44,920
phenotype you know like oh you know if

4165
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:46,478
you want a shorter in innerlength nodes

4166
02:49:44,920 --> 02:49:49,159
you know what I mean

4167
02:49:46,478 --> 02:49:51,398
like what I'm alluding to is like what

4168
02:49:49,159 --> 02:49:54,559
ma said it's like go get the plan go

4169
02:49:51,398 --> 02:49:58,079
basically go get that cross go sequence

4170
02:49:54,559 --> 02:50:00,559
it go look at it oh yeah yeah right

4171
02:49:58,079 --> 02:50:04,120
understand what's there from a genic

4172
02:50:00,559 --> 02:50:07,760
point of view right and then you could

4173
02:50:04,120 --> 02:50:09,239
then that there's your Baseline right as

4174
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:12,439
you know but you got to get it from

4175
02:50:09,238 --> 02:50:14,920
reliable sources you know right right

4176
02:50:12,439 --> 02:50:16,800
and kind of see like uh you can use a

4177
02:50:14,920 --> 02:50:19,760
technology called mapping by

4178
02:50:16,799 --> 02:50:22,879
sequencing and kind of see which

4179
02:50:19,760 --> 02:50:24,680
you know genes might be involved so so

4180
02:50:22,879 --> 02:50:26,879
you like you get a segregating

4181
02:50:24,680 --> 02:50:29,680
population of your the phenotype that

4182
02:50:26,879 --> 02:50:32,879
you're talking about right and you kind

4183
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:34,720
of like coordinate the the potential

4184
02:50:32,879 --> 02:50:37,799
genes that are involved in that fenal

4185
02:50:34,719 --> 02:50:40,199
type right so yep exactly so you should

4186
02:50:37,799 --> 02:50:41,840
um I text Kevin mccar and I was like you

4187
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:45,040
should really come on right now because

4188
02:50:41,840 --> 02:50:48,159
this would be a two wizards in the room

4189
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:50,600
um be great to get you guys talking

4190
02:50:48,159 --> 02:50:53,879
because we've done some stuff probably

4191
02:50:50,600 --> 02:50:55,200
be helpful to your work and it's kind of

4192
02:50:53,879 --> 02:50:57,039
towards at least the work I've been

4193
02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:58,600
doing it's towards the end of sort of

4194
02:50:57,040 --> 02:51:01,000
this ideology where it's like we're

4195
02:50:58,600 --> 02:51:03,120
pulling out certain traits and we're

4196
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:05,478
looking at them and isolating

4197
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:06,960
them but you know the other thing I want

4198
02:51:05,478 --> 02:51:10,159
to bring up is like okay so we're

4199
02:51:06,959 --> 02:51:12,959
talking about the future we're you know

4200
02:51:10,159 --> 02:51:15,439
we're really excited but what are the

4201
02:51:12,959 --> 02:51:17,438
dangers of that right what is you know I

4202
02:51:15,439 --> 02:51:19,479
think of like Herbert berer I think of

4203
02:51:17,439 --> 02:51:23,920
Stanley Cohen

4204
02:51:19,478 --> 02:51:26,318
um Rudolph J jck is I'm pronouncing his

4205
02:51:23,920 --> 02:51:28,398
last name right or um I'm thinking these

4206
02:51:26,318 --> 02:51:30,278
people that started the GMO world right

4207
02:51:28,398 --> 02:51:33,719
they're like the inventors of this and

4208
02:51:30,279 --> 02:51:37,200
and I read some things about them like a

4209
02:51:33,719 --> 02:51:39,679
year ago or so a book about how they

4210
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:42,239
were mandated to make these changes

4211
02:51:39,680 --> 02:51:45,760
based on the desires of their clients

4212
02:51:42,238 --> 02:51:48,719
like don't bruise look you know tomatoes

4213
02:51:45,760 --> 02:51:50,639
need to look redder but they didn't look

4214
02:51:48,719 --> 02:51:51,719
at the health impacts of what that did

4215
02:51:50,639 --> 02:51:53,959
to the

4216
02:51:51,719 --> 02:51:57,438
actual plants and the fruit that it

4217
02:51:53,959 --> 02:51:59,119
brought to life and I think that if

4218
02:51:57,439 --> 02:52:00,600
you're going to look at this and I've

4219
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:02,680
been thinking about this a lot because

4220
02:52:00,600 --> 02:52:03,880
of the work that I've seen medical

4221
02:52:02,680 --> 02:52:06,639
genomics

4222
02:52:03,879 --> 02:52:09,879
do it's your duty to be very careful

4223
02:52:06,639 --> 02:52:12,079
about what you're doing and why and I

4224
02:52:09,879 --> 02:52:14,719
think it's important to think about this

4225
02:52:12,079 --> 02:52:18,639
as you move forward because you are

4226
02:52:14,719 --> 02:52:21,000
holding a very dangerous but helpful

4227
02:52:18,639 --> 02:52:22,719
you know call it concept right you

4228
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:24,398
you've got through your concept phase

4229
02:52:22,719 --> 02:52:27,318
you you think you can do

4230
02:52:24,398 --> 02:52:30,278
it but I invite you to look at that

4231
02:52:27,318 --> 02:52:33,199
because of you know don't repeat

4232
02:52:30,279 --> 02:52:35,880
history um is what I'm getting at so and

4233
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:37,920
and have you thought about that you know

4234
02:52:35,879 --> 02:52:40,238
right yeah I've thought about the you

4235
02:52:37,920 --> 02:52:44,000
know ethical and moral implications of

4236
02:52:40,238 --> 02:52:47,959
what we're doing and I for

4237
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:50,439
one am thinking about that when I'm kind

4238
02:52:47,959 --> 02:52:50,438
of planning

4239
02:52:50,520 --> 02:52:56,600
uh proposing projects um there's

4240
02:52:54,359 --> 02:52:59,680
definitely so right now we do everything

4241
02:52:56,600 --> 02:53:01,880
confined so there's no nothing escapes

4242
02:52:59,680 --> 02:53:03,880
we autoclave our tissue after we're done

4243
02:53:01,879 --> 02:53:06,799
with it and everything but in the future

4244
02:53:03,879 --> 02:53:09,759
once we get to the point where we're you

4245
02:53:06,799 --> 02:53:12,238
know doing field trials outside or you

4246
02:53:09,760 --> 02:53:15,000
know giving this a variety that's been

4247
02:53:12,238 --> 02:53:18,840
gened to a breeder or a

4248
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:22,040
grower there is that potential of uh

4249
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:25,559
escaping and pollinating another another

4250
02:53:22,040 --> 02:53:27,160
grow somewhere you know next to wherever

4251
02:53:25,559 --> 02:53:31,959
you're growing or something is it

4252
02:53:27,159 --> 02:53:31,959
potential or is it um like

4253
02:53:34,079 --> 02:53:39,120
guaranteed guarantee guys like we I

4254
02:53:36,719 --> 02:53:41,639
would think so it's hard to like control

4255
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:43,399
pollen Hawai sustainable brought this up

4256
02:53:41,639 --> 02:53:44,840
about 10 minutes ago in the chat he said

4257
02:53:43,398 --> 02:53:46,799
oh these people obviously don't

4258
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:48,920
understand the drawbacks and limitations

4259
02:53:46,799 --> 02:53:51,278
of GMO which he follow followed up with

4260
02:53:48,920 --> 02:53:53,478
a quote from Cho which is offt Target

4261
02:53:51,279 --> 02:53:55,800
mutagenesis is an emerging problem when

4262
02:53:53,478 --> 02:53:59,599
inducing sight specific DNA breaks for

4263
02:53:55,799 --> 02:54:02,079
genome editing so what um what let's

4264
02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:04,399
speak on that a little bit right so

4265
02:54:02,079 --> 02:54:09,439
there's other so like you you try to

4266
02:54:04,398 --> 02:54:10,840
Target a specific Gene with crisper but

4267
02:54:09,439 --> 02:54:14,200
there might be

4268
02:54:10,840 --> 02:54:16,840
other uh sequences that in in the Genome

4269
02:54:14,200 --> 02:54:19,359
of the of the plant that might be very

4270
02:54:16,840 --> 02:54:20,880
similar to your Gene Target

4271
02:54:19,359 --> 02:54:24,159
and so those can be also targeted by

4272
02:54:20,879 --> 02:54:27,398
crisper so uh there's there's you know

4273
02:54:24,159 --> 02:54:31,079
computational methods that we can use to

4274
02:54:27,398 --> 02:54:35,639
of predict offt Target effects

4275
02:54:31,079 --> 02:54:38,959
and before you release a geneed variety

4276
02:54:35,639 --> 02:54:40,920
um you kind of try to also genotype

4277
02:54:38,959 --> 02:54:41,959
those those of Target potential off

4278
02:54:40,920 --> 02:54:45,159
Target

4279
02:54:41,959 --> 02:54:50,119
sites uh and see if they've actually

4280
02:54:45,159 --> 02:54:51,920
been been affected or not um

4281
02:54:50,120 --> 02:54:53,479
uh it it really depends on your Dean

4282
02:54:51,920 --> 02:54:56,359
Target whether you're going to have off

4283
02:54:53,478 --> 02:54:59,199
Target sites sometimes you have a

4284
02:54:56,359 --> 02:55:01,159
specific uh we call it a guide RNA which

4285
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:04,479
shuttles the crisper to your target site

4286
02:55:01,159 --> 02:55:07,439
so it can it can uh Target your Gene so

4287
02:55:04,478 --> 02:55:09,920
sometimes a specific Gene Target uh has

4288
02:55:07,439 --> 02:55:12,920
low potential for offt Target sites and

4289
02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:15,920
some have a higher potential and so we

4290
02:55:12,920 --> 02:55:20,520
consider that when we when we design our

4291
02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:22,760
our crisper um guide rnas

4292
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:25,560
um but yeah like going back to what you

4293
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:29,079
were saying about um whether it's

4294
02:55:25,559 --> 02:55:30,920
potential or guaranteed yeah so you know

4295
02:55:29,079 --> 02:55:34,719
wind pollination and things like that

4296
02:55:30,920 --> 02:55:37,600
you will definitely make it almost

4297
02:55:34,719 --> 02:55:38,920
guaranteed um so that that's something

4298
02:55:37,600 --> 02:55:41,359
that we have to address once we get

4299
02:55:38,920 --> 02:55:42,439
there whether we're just going to have

4300
02:55:41,359 --> 02:55:44,800
all of this

4301
02:55:42,439 --> 02:55:47,040
confined to a space that's going to be

4302
02:55:44,799 --> 02:55:51,398
sterile and you know there's going to be

4303
02:55:47,040 --> 02:55:53,040
procedures to to contain the cannabis

4304
02:55:51,398 --> 02:55:54,920
plants that have been gen edited and

4305
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:56,399
make sure that the pawn doesn't get out

4306
02:55:54,920 --> 02:55:58,600
it's it's a tough one you know because

4307
02:55:56,398 --> 02:56:00,680
we just said like the best things come

4308
02:55:58,600 --> 02:56:02,439
from our mistakes but as we get into

4309
02:56:00,680 --> 02:56:04,720
these dangerous areas where your

4310
02:56:02,439 --> 02:56:06,680
mistakes can have these drastic effects

4311
02:56:04,719 --> 02:56:08,159
it's just human nature so if you land on

4312
02:56:06,680 --> 02:56:09,520
something and it has any negative

4313
02:56:08,159 --> 02:56:11,398
everyone will jump on your throat and

4314
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:13,200
say I told you so and if you create

4315
02:56:11,398 --> 02:56:15,079
something that's lifechanging and really

4316
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:17,159
affects people's lives on a massive

4317
02:56:15,079 --> 02:56:18,680
scale people will be like oh yeah you

4318
02:56:17,159 --> 02:56:20,398
know I pretty much fig figured it was

4319
02:56:18,680 --> 02:56:22,680
going to go that way like I was a big

4320
02:56:20,398 --> 02:56:26,039
supporter of this technology the entire

4321
02:56:22,680 --> 02:56:27,960
time so it's this is why Dr aruro is

4322
02:56:26,040 --> 02:56:30,120
part of my science group and works with

4323
02:56:27,959 --> 02:56:32,599
Rob and Mojave and as is because he's

4324
02:56:30,120 --> 02:56:35,120
ethical and we're ethical and we want to

4325
02:56:32,600 --> 02:56:37,800
keep that ethical stewardship so that's

4326
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:40,040
why I brought him here as well so that

4327
02:56:37,799 --> 02:56:42,039
the world could be aware of the work

4328
02:56:40,040 --> 02:56:44,600
that he's doing but also understand that

4329
02:56:42,040 --> 02:56:46,720
we're also trying to make sure the

4330
02:56:44,600 --> 02:56:49,200
ethics and the proper stewardship are

4331
02:56:46,719 --> 02:56:53,159
followed along the way and we're as

4332
02:56:49,200 --> 02:56:55,600
curious as well so you know it Arturo I

4333
02:56:53,159 --> 02:56:58,359
think Dr Arturo you understand you know

4334
02:56:55,600 --> 02:57:00,040
the gravity and the fear I mean and

4335
02:56:58,359 --> 02:57:01,318
that's why I brought you here was to

4336
02:57:00,040 --> 02:57:04,040
dispel some of the fear because there's

4337
02:57:01,318 --> 02:57:06,478
a lot of misinformation about G

4338
02:57:04,040 --> 02:57:07,279
misinformation and now at the tip of

4339
02:57:06,478 --> 02:57:10,599
that

4340
02:57:07,279 --> 02:57:13,000
spear so this by exposure is putting

4341
02:57:10,600 --> 02:57:16,520
sunlight on it so that we could disuade

4342
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:18,719
these fears and so um knowledge can uh

4343
02:57:16,520 --> 02:57:21,079
rule the day as opposed to

4344
02:57:18,719 --> 02:57:23,119
uh shadows and fears and lies well I

4345
02:57:21,079 --> 02:57:26,000
love what you're doing at in the sense

4346
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:28,279
of bringing like mentoring in a sense

4347
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:30,959
guiding offering guidance offering kind

4348
02:57:28,279 --> 02:57:34,760
of our perspective from our community to

4349
02:57:30,959 --> 02:57:37,478
uh Dr Arturo it's better than judging

4350
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:39,719
trolling you know like kind of causing

4351
02:57:37,478 --> 02:57:42,159
just like oh blah blah blah blah it's

4352
02:57:39,719 --> 02:57:43,799
like okay look these perspectives are

4353
02:57:42,159 --> 02:57:46,318
incredibly important and we should

4354
02:57:43,799 --> 02:57:48,278
definitely bring them with us but what

4355
02:57:46,318 --> 02:57:49,920
we don't want to do is isolate ourselves

4356
02:57:48,279 --> 02:57:51,840
completely from all of the people that

4357
02:57:49,920 --> 02:57:55,439
are doing this work and really have no

4358
02:57:51,840 --> 02:57:58,559
say or no guidance or no helpful

4359
02:57:55,439 --> 02:58:00,479
Direction um from the perspective of the

4360
02:57:58,559 --> 02:58:02,199
grower the breeder the hash maker the

4361
02:58:00,478 --> 02:58:04,559
community if you

4362
02:58:02,200 --> 02:58:06,239
will it's a it's a really important

4363
02:58:04,559 --> 02:58:08,639
Point Marcus I really I really believe

4364
02:58:06,238 --> 02:58:12,159
that because and and I on our last last

4365
02:58:08,639 --> 02:58:13,840
week's call you know I I definitely I I

4366
02:58:12,159 --> 02:58:15,920
I I felt the energy around you know

4367
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:18,359
there's a lot of protection we all feel

4368
02:58:15,920 --> 02:58:19,960
like we have this um we're steward words

4369
02:58:18,359 --> 02:58:22,760
and we feel like this entitlement to

4370
02:58:19,959 --> 02:58:25,039
protect the plant and but on the flip

4371
02:58:22,760 --> 02:58:27,279
side of that is it is it is what it is

4372
02:58:25,040 --> 02:58:29,600
it's the industry is what it is the

4373
02:58:27,279 --> 02:58:31,560
direction it's heading is what it is and

4374
02:58:29,600 --> 02:58:33,840
the people who are in charge it's a

4375
02:58:31,559 --> 02:58:35,920
whole new wave and we want to have a

4376
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:39,079
seat we want to continue to have a seat

4377
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:41,520
we've been along through this big arch

4378
02:58:39,079 --> 02:58:43,000
that this cannabis has gone through and

4379
02:58:41,520 --> 02:58:44,880
on the other end of that Arch is going

4380
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:47,079
to be something else and we that's kind

4381
02:58:44,879 --> 02:58:48,438
of what we've all been fighting for but

4382
02:58:47,079 --> 02:58:51,200
whether it's whe whether it's

4383
02:58:48,439 --> 02:58:54,520
participating or getting just a seat at

4384
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:57,560
the table with the USDA or understanding

4385
02:58:54,520 --> 02:58:59,399
new technologies new Innovations and

4386
02:58:57,559 --> 02:59:02,079
understanding how other Industries have

4387
02:58:59,398 --> 02:59:03,959
treated all other plants that's just

4388
02:59:02,079 --> 02:59:07,159
acknowledging that this is the direction

4389
02:59:03,959 --> 02:59:09,919
that cannabis is now in and our role is

4390
02:59:07,159 --> 02:59:12,840
really has has a big impact maybe the

4391
02:59:09,920 --> 02:59:15,279
greatest impact is in that seat at the

4392
02:59:12,840 --> 02:59:17,398
table transition I really believe that

4393
02:59:15,279 --> 02:59:19,399
you know because we see how industry

4394
02:59:17,398 --> 02:59:22,159
goes we've seen what has happened to

4395
02:59:19,398 --> 02:59:24,079
other crops in the past you know it's

4396
02:59:22,159 --> 02:59:26,200
just the nature of capitalism it's the

4397
02:59:24,079 --> 02:59:28,639
nature of the in the world we live in

4398
02:59:26,200 --> 02:59:31,720
the commodity driven International

4399
02:59:28,639 --> 02:59:33,119
Market so I think you know it's it's

4400
02:59:31,719 --> 02:59:36,159
important that's why you know Canada had

4401
02:59:33,120 --> 02:59:38,920
a really big role and how um the

4402
02:59:36,159 --> 02:59:41,639
international market unfolded right you

4403
02:59:38,920 --> 02:59:44,840
know and California had a big role and

4404
02:59:41,639 --> 02:59:46,760
how the US market is unfolding and the

4405
02:59:44,840 --> 02:59:49,398
people who've taken the Reigns you know

4406
02:59:46,760 --> 02:59:52,000
they need we need to still have a role

4407
02:59:49,398 --> 02:59:54,519
in their understanding of the plan I

4408
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:56,559
think it's important hey Sam can you can

4409
02:59:54,520 --> 02:59:58,399
you turn off the sorry Selena can you

4410
02:59:56,559 --> 03:00:00,079
turn the video off in the background

4411
02:59:58,398 --> 03:00:02,039
because it's echoing through your

4412
03:00:00,079 --> 03:00:06,000
microphone that's why I keep muting your

4413
03:00:02,040 --> 03:00:07,760
microphone had a how the US market okay

4414
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:09,040
I'll mute it until you can turn that off

4415
03:00:07,760 --> 03:00:11,318
then we want to hear from you for sure

4416
03:00:09,040 --> 03:00:12,560
go ahead Selena so I'm just curious well

4417
03:00:11,318 --> 03:00:14,478
not curious one of the things I wanted

4418
03:00:12,559 --> 03:00:16,000
to add is um I think that's why it's so

4419
03:00:14,478 --> 03:00:19,159
important to ask why are

4420
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:22,000
we know you talked about

4421
03:00:19,159 --> 03:00:23,478
here we go sorry uh you had talked about

4422
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,920
um you know having these guard rails in

4423
03:00:23,478 --> 03:00:26,358
place which I think is really important

4424
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:27,600
but I think the bigger question is you

4425
03:00:26,359 --> 03:00:29,159
know why are we doing what we're doing

4426
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:30,680
are we really just you know trying to

4427
03:00:29,159 --> 03:00:32,439
find turps are we really just looking

4428
03:00:30,680 --> 03:00:34,880
for effects like what are we actually

4429
03:00:32,439 --> 03:00:36,800
what what is the end goal you know and I

4430
03:00:34,879 --> 03:00:38,599
like to imagine and Marcus you know this

4431
03:00:36,799 --> 03:00:40,199
I'm very altruistic I'm hoping that you

4432
03:00:38,600 --> 03:00:42,399
know on a larger scale we're helping to

4433
03:00:40,200 --> 03:00:44,560
liberate the plant we're producing

4434
03:00:42,398 --> 03:00:46,599
different um cultivars and phenotypes

4435
03:00:44,559 --> 03:00:48,920
that maybe we haven't seen before um

4436
03:00:46,600 --> 03:00:50,359
we're able to benefit human

4437
03:00:48,920 --> 03:00:52,359
um but I think it's really important too

4438
03:00:50,359 --> 03:00:54,238
to to get back to the core of the

4439
03:00:52,359 --> 03:00:55,680
question because you know if if at the

4440
03:00:54,238 --> 03:00:57,279
end of the day the thing that's driving

4441
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:59,720
us is let's make more money today than

4442
03:00:57,279 --> 03:01:02,359
yesterday that's a a much different why

4443
03:00:59,719 --> 03:01:04,438
than how can we benefit um humanity and

4444
03:01:02,359 --> 03:01:05,920
the planet as a whole so I'm curious you

4445
03:01:04,439 --> 03:01:07,960
know from your company's perspective

4446
03:01:05,920 --> 03:01:09,398
like what is your ethos and and I'm so

4447
03:01:07,959 --> 03:01:12,759
happy that we're having this talk about

4448
03:01:09,398 --> 03:01:15,519
ethics um because it's it's it's crucial

4449
03:01:12,760 --> 03:01:18,559
especially at this time um how are you

4450
03:01:15,520 --> 03:01:21,120
guys um defining your why

4451
03:01:18,559 --> 03:01:21,119
what is your

4452
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:26,120
why

4453
03:01:23,120 --> 03:01:29,840
um our why is so

4454
03:01:26,120 --> 03:01:32,920
we we definitely are doing what we're

4455
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:35,680
doing and in order to provide or

4456
03:01:32,920 --> 03:01:37,680
improve uh not you know not just

4457
03:01:35,680 --> 03:01:40,200
cannabis but in the future other crops

4458
03:01:37,680 --> 03:01:43,760
things like that for the benefit of of

4459
03:01:40,200 --> 03:01:47,520
humanity um specifically in cannabis

4460
03:01:43,760 --> 03:01:49,680
for um uh medical reasons like I said

4461
03:01:47,520 --> 03:01:51,920
before

4462
03:01:49,680 --> 03:01:56,159
um

4463
03:01:51,920 --> 03:02:00,040
uh it's definitely U so so we definitely

4464
03:01:56,159 --> 03:02:03,238
want um the Cannabis Community to kind

4465
03:02:00,040 --> 03:02:05,239
of guide us um we don't want to just be

4466
03:02:03,238 --> 03:02:07,680
like cynically just oh just for the

4467
03:02:05,238 --> 03:02:09,840
money kind of thing and me specifically

4468
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:13,600
as well so like that's that's

4469
03:02:09,840 --> 03:02:15,520
my um life philosophy I guess um you can

4470
03:02:13,600 --> 03:02:17,960
say but

4471
03:02:15,520 --> 03:02:20,000
um you know we don't we don't just want

4472
03:02:17,959 --> 03:02:24,079
want uh you know this technology just to

4473
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:25,959
belong to you know one company that's

4474
03:02:24,079 --> 03:02:29,920
going to have all the patent rights to

4475
03:02:25,959 --> 03:02:32,679
you know to be able to develop um you

4476
03:02:29,920 --> 03:02:34,760
know cannabis using this procedure so we

4477
03:02:32,680 --> 03:02:37,960
definitely want to you know develop

4478
03:02:34,760 --> 03:02:41,880
something that the community can can use

4479
03:02:37,959 --> 03:02:46,000
the canas community and

4480
03:02:41,879 --> 03:02:48,519
um we so this one of the reasons I I

4481
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:51,719
came on is to kind of

4482
03:02:48,520 --> 03:02:52,640
extend my you know invitation to to hear

4483
03:02:51,719 --> 03:02:55,199
from

4484
03:02:52,639 --> 03:02:58,079
everybody um in the Canabis Community

4485
03:02:55,200 --> 03:02:59,640
what their insights are um because what

4486
03:02:58,079 --> 03:03:00,520
we're doing is kind of uncharted waters

4487
03:02:59,639 --> 03:03:03,799
right now

4488
03:03:00,520 --> 03:03:07,238
so you know what I mean

4489
03:03:03,799 --> 03:03:09,278
so do you mind if I ask too like you

4490
03:03:07,238 --> 03:03:10,959
know beyond way you'd already shared

4491
03:03:09,279 --> 03:03:12,439
what are some of the guard rails to

4492
03:03:10,959 --> 03:03:14,238
ensure that you guys are you know

4493
03:03:12,439 --> 03:03:16,318
operating as ethically and sustainably

4494
03:03:14,238 --> 03:03:18,398
as possible and really like setting that

4495
03:03:16,318 --> 03:03:20,238
tone and and carving that pth for you

4496
03:03:18,398 --> 03:03:22,879
know other people or other organizations

4497
03:03:20,238 --> 03:03:26,119
that want to get involved at this

4498
03:03:22,879 --> 03:03:29,159
scale um so you know as scientists we

4499
03:03:26,120 --> 03:03:32,000
have to develop um St standard operating

4500
03:03:29,159 --> 03:03:35,760
procedures for for the things that we

4501
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:41,040
do um and we kind of used

4502
03:03:35,760 --> 03:03:43,639
um you know previous protocols for other

4503
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:46,160
crops to kind of guide us into what we

4504
03:03:43,639 --> 03:03:48,199
we have to do uh with respect to

4505
03:03:46,159 --> 03:03:50,559
cannabis like you know make sure it

4506
03:03:48,200 --> 03:03:52,680
doesn't get out from our lab you know

4507
03:03:50,559 --> 03:03:57,719
make sure the tissue is dead before we

4508
03:03:52,680 --> 03:04:03,279
dispose of it um also kind of use like

4509
03:03:57,719 --> 03:04:06,398
the usda's guidelines um as well uh for

4510
03:04:03,279 --> 03:04:11,399
for dealing with a potential transgenic

4511
03:04:06,398 --> 03:04:13,959
or Gene edited uh plant right

4512
03:04:11,398 --> 03:04:16,439
so um yeah who's to say it's not out

4513
03:04:13,959 --> 03:04:18,159
there already who's to say that it

4514
03:04:16,439 --> 03:04:22,920
hasn't you know it's it's it's

4515
03:04:18,159 --> 03:04:22,920
interesting I think uh when we form our

4516
03:04:23,079 --> 03:04:28,079
opinions our our understanding of Any

4517
03:04:25,959 --> 03:04:30,438
Given subject even if considered an

4518
03:04:28,079 --> 03:04:33,279
expert in the subject is still very

4519
03:04:30,439 --> 03:04:35,639
small and so it's it's easy to judge

4520
03:04:33,279 --> 03:04:38,159
these conversations there's people that

4521
03:04:35,639 --> 03:04:41,760
get triggered by even the mere mention

4522
03:04:38,159 --> 03:04:45,520
of chrisberg really quite kind of almost

4523
03:04:41,760 --> 03:04:47,880
reminds me a little bit of the um uh the

4524
03:04:45,520 --> 03:04:49,479
the vaccinated nonvaccinated convers

4525
03:04:47,879 --> 03:04:51,559
ation in regards to the tension that

4526
03:04:49,478 --> 03:04:53,920
gets created and the Judgment that gets

4527
03:04:51,559 --> 03:04:55,478
clearly pushed through uh just the

4528
03:04:53,920 --> 03:04:57,439
digital screen Wade has something he

4529
03:04:55,478 --> 03:04:59,519
wants to say try to try to lift your mic

4530
03:04:57,439 --> 03:05:03,840
up if you can wait it hasn't been very

4531
03:04:59,520 --> 03:05:03,840
clear today but I we'd love to hear from

4532
03:05:06,159 --> 03:05:10,879
you let's see turn off these

4533
03:05:14,920 --> 03:05:18,439
headphones can you guys hear me all

4534
03:05:16,959 --> 03:05:22,438
right

4535
03:05:18,439 --> 03:05:27,479
yep yeah way better now so much better

4536
03:05:22,439 --> 03:05:30,520
okay um I want to start by saying um

4537
03:05:27,478 --> 03:05:33,398
thank you Arturo for doing that work I

4538
03:05:30,520 --> 03:05:36,238
um thank you I expressed earlier my

4539
03:05:33,398 --> 03:05:39,559
concerns about it I have I have some

4540
03:05:36,238 --> 03:05:46,478
friends who are in who are doing similar

4541
03:05:39,559 --> 03:05:49,719
work um elener K and uh Karen Bentley uh

4542
03:05:46,478 --> 03:05:52,879
at leg um anyway so I know a little bit

4543
03:05:49,719 --> 03:05:56,398
about crisper and what I'm on the one

4544
03:05:52,879 --> 03:05:59,119
hand I feel cautious and I appreciate

4545
03:05:56,398 --> 03:06:02,478
what I'm hearing and your concern about

4546
03:05:59,120 --> 03:06:05,640
keeping things in hand if you will I'm

4547
03:06:02,478 --> 03:06:09,278
excited on the otherand because over the

4548
03:06:05,639 --> 03:06:10,439
years we have bred cannabis plants for

4549
03:06:09,279 --> 03:06:11,960
various

4550
03:06:10,439 --> 03:06:14,040
reasons

4551
03:06:11,959 --> 03:06:17,238
um but there are

4552
03:06:14,040 --> 03:06:20,680
limitations to some extent on what we

4553
03:06:17,238 --> 03:06:24,000
can accomplished with straightup

4554
03:06:20,680 --> 03:06:27,040
standard old school breeding like Sam

4555
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:30,840
does you are bringing a whole other

4556
03:06:27,040 --> 03:06:33,840
possible realm of like I was saying

4557
03:06:30,840 --> 03:06:37,680
earlier minor phoc canono I'm pretty

4558
03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:41,398
sure that the cannabis plant produces

4559
03:06:37,680 --> 03:06:45,200
compounds that uh will end up being a

4560
03:06:41,398 --> 03:06:48,159
great interest in the medical community

4561
03:06:45,200 --> 03:06:52,120
and in patients uh

4562
03:06:48,159 --> 03:06:55,200
um yes and

4563
03:06:52,120 --> 03:06:57,560
um so there's my excitement I I feel

4564
03:06:55,200 --> 03:07:00,439
like what's likely is we'll end up with

4565
03:06:57,559 --> 03:07:03,799
some uh canono that have alpha numeric

4566
03:07:00,439 --> 03:07:06,920
names for a while um that turn out to be

4567
03:07:03,799 --> 03:07:10,920
really Mar remarkably effective DD mui

4568
03:07:06,920 --> 03:07:13,478
in Israel uh found a alphan numeric

4569
03:07:10,920 --> 03:07:16,719
canono that had really remarkable

4570
03:07:13,478 --> 03:07:18,760
properties against 18 of 20 cancer cell

4571
03:07:16,719 --> 03:07:22,478
lines he was testing

4572
03:07:18,760 --> 03:07:25,318
so there you go it's a balancing act on

4573
03:07:22,478 --> 03:07:29,559
the one hand deep appreciation for your

4574
03:07:25,318 --> 03:07:32,959
ethics around thank you and the patience

4575
03:07:29,559 --> 03:07:35,799
and from my own point of view excitement

4576
03:07:32,959 --> 03:07:39,199
about what you might find in this plant

4577
03:07:35,799 --> 03:07:40,719
we love so much and I'll stop there and

4578
03:07:39,200 --> 03:07:43,479
go back to listening thank you so much

4579
03:07:40,719 --> 03:07:45,920
for this conversation oh thank you um

4580
03:07:43,478 --> 03:07:48,318
yeah there's definitely so many things

4581
03:07:45,920 --> 03:07:53,238
that we can discover from this this this

4582
03:07:48,318 --> 03:07:56,359
one plant I mean the cannaboid and tping

4583
03:07:53,238 --> 03:08:00,039
pathways are are they're like a

4584
03:07:56,359 --> 03:08:04,559
web um they're so interconnected and so

4585
03:08:00,040 --> 03:08:05,680
complex so it's exciting and also very

4586
03:08:04,559 --> 03:08:10,119
um

4587
03:08:05,680 --> 03:08:11,639
hopeful right um for the future um you

4588
03:08:10,120 --> 03:08:13,359
know some of these molecules that you

4589
03:08:11,639 --> 03:08:16,959
know these lesser fetto Canon noids you

4590
03:08:13,359 --> 03:08:21,800
can potentially be used for uh as a

4591
03:08:16,959 --> 03:08:24,398
template for developing a new drug for

4592
03:08:21,799 --> 03:08:27,318
you know whatever disease you know

4593
03:08:24,398 --> 03:08:30,398
cancer or some inflammatory disease

4594
03:08:27,318 --> 03:08:33,278
chronic diseases things like that and

4595
03:08:30,398 --> 03:08:35,278
with regards to crisper um I know some

4596
03:08:33,279 --> 03:08:39,960
people have you know their misgivings

4597
03:08:35,279 --> 03:08:41,720
and they're cautious about it um so what

4598
03:08:39,959 --> 03:08:43,599
we do with

4599
03:08:41,719 --> 03:08:48,358
chrisper

4600
03:08:43,600 --> 03:08:51,279
um um you know Gene editing of certain

4601
03:08:48,359 --> 03:08:54,238
genes of the of the plant is something

4602
03:08:51,279 --> 03:08:56,600
that would could potentially happen over

4603
03:08:54,238 --> 03:08:59,520
thousands and millions of years

4604
03:08:56,600 --> 03:09:01,880
naturally we're just kind of taking a

4605
03:08:59,520 --> 03:09:04,439
shortcut um and that's what the

4606
03:09:01,879 --> 03:09:06,119
technology allows us to do we're not

4607
03:09:04,439 --> 03:09:09,040
doing anything or we're not putting like

4608
03:09:06,120 --> 03:09:12,600
a gene from you know I don't know like a

4609
03:09:09,040 --> 03:09:15,640
beetle or or from a bacteria or anything

4610
03:09:12,600 --> 03:09:18,399
like that into the plant and leaving it

4611
03:09:15,639 --> 03:09:21,159
there indefinitely you

4612
03:09:18,398 --> 03:09:23,559
know um

4613
03:09:21,159 --> 03:09:26,559
so we're just taking a shortcut in a

4614
03:09:23,559 --> 03:09:30,238
sense and we're we're we're

4615
03:09:26,559 --> 03:09:33,519
using an enzyme that's found in nature

4616
03:09:30,238 --> 03:09:36,159
and we're arming it to Target the genes

4617
03:09:33,520 --> 03:09:39,399
that we want to Target and for the per

4618
03:09:36,159 --> 03:09:41,959
for the benefit of humanity so and

4619
03:09:39,398 --> 03:09:44,680
crisper hasn't only been used in Plants

4620
03:09:41,959 --> 03:09:47,839
as you probably know it's been used in

4621
03:09:44,680 --> 03:09:52,800
in the medical field um in the past year

4622
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:55,439
I think uh to cure uh some some I forget

4623
03:09:52,799 --> 03:09:58,079
what it was but is somebody that was

4624
03:09:55,439 --> 03:10:00,040
blind and they had cured their their

4625
03:09:58,079 --> 03:10:02,879
blind there was a specific condition

4626
03:10:00,040 --> 03:10:05,359
that they had they used crisper to to

4627
03:10:02,879 --> 03:10:07,959
cure them and I believe they're also

4628
03:10:05,359 --> 03:10:10,238
trying to use it for SLE cell anemia as

4629
03:10:07,959 --> 03:10:10,238
well

4630
03:10:10,559 --> 03:10:16,318
so but

4631
03:10:12,559 --> 03:10:20,519
um yeah I understand people's hesitation

4632
03:10:16,318 --> 03:10:22,920
to kind of adopt this technology

4633
03:10:20,520 --> 03:10:24,880
um but I I I just want people to know

4634
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:27,920
that there's there's scientists and

4635
03:10:24,879 --> 03:10:30,159
people that are involved in in this you

4636
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:33,238
know the crisper world that are ethical

4637
03:10:30,159 --> 03:10:36,439
and and and moral and and and you know

4638
03:10:33,238 --> 03:10:39,238
if there's any controversy or issue you

4639
03:10:36,439 --> 03:10:42,960
know scientists as a community will

4640
03:10:39,238 --> 03:10:45,719
will uh uh what's it called uh they

4641
03:10:42,959 --> 03:10:48,679
they'll put in a moratorium on certain

4642
03:10:45,719 --> 03:10:52,079
things like um you know Gene editing

4643
03:10:48,680 --> 03:10:53,559
using crisper and humans for for uh

4644
03:10:52,079 --> 03:10:57,559
Eugenics and things like that that's

4645
03:10:53,559 --> 03:10:59,799
definitely something that um Community

4646
03:10:57,559 --> 03:11:04,879
the the scientific Community has kind

4647
03:10:59,799 --> 03:11:07,719
of uh as a whole um tried to prevent or

4648
03:11:04,879 --> 03:11:10,119
and I think uh with terms of uh with

4649
03:11:07,719 --> 03:11:13,760
regards to crops there's something also

4650
03:11:10,120 --> 03:11:14,720
similar to where you know scientists

4651
03:11:13,760 --> 03:11:18,279
want

4652
03:11:14,719 --> 03:11:21,639
to I guess ethically use the crisper

4653
03:11:18,279 --> 03:11:24,200
technology to not confer any traits in

4654
03:11:21,639 --> 03:11:25,559
Plants that'll that'll be like uh

4655
03:11:24,200 --> 03:11:28,359
damaging to the environment or

4656
03:11:25,559 --> 03:11:30,439
ecosystems and also to human health

4657
03:11:28,359 --> 03:11:32,800
which is why you know in the past

4658
03:11:30,439 --> 03:11:35,479
Whenever there was a GMO that was

4659
03:11:32,799 --> 03:11:38,278
deployed uh in a crop there was um

4660
03:11:35,478 --> 03:11:39,799
several years of testing beforehand and

4661
03:11:38,279 --> 03:11:40,760
field trials and things like that before

4662
03:11:39,799 --> 03:11:43,679
it was

4663
03:11:40,760 --> 03:11:47,478
given uh brought to the market

4664
03:11:43,680 --> 03:11:49,639
so anyway

4665
03:11:47,478 --> 03:11:51,879
well it's uh definitely creating a

4666
03:11:49,639 --> 03:11:54,079
conversation in the chat room for anyone

4667
03:11:51,879 --> 03:11:55,759
wants to read that they can check it out

4668
03:11:54,079 --> 03:11:59,159
yeah it's not a bad conversation it's

4669
03:11:55,760 --> 03:12:01,559
just you people's opinions so with that

4670
03:11:59,159 --> 03:12:04,159
said you know the the I keep going back

4671
03:12:01,559 --> 03:12:08,840
to what I read

4672
03:12:04,159 --> 03:12:11,959
when you know essentially Herbert Boyer

4673
03:12:08,840 --> 03:12:14,799
and his other constituents were again

4674
03:12:11,959 --> 03:12:17,438
much like you getting approached by con

4675
03:12:14,799 --> 03:12:19,559
you know they're respectfully your

4676
03:12:17,439 --> 03:12:22,600
clients and they're like hey we need a

4677
03:12:19,559 --> 03:12:26,039
sour diesel we need a

4678
03:12:22,600 --> 03:12:28,439
papaya um and the way you went about

4679
03:12:26,040 --> 03:12:31,000
it and are going or they were going

4680
03:12:28,439 --> 03:12:33,760
about it in their terms was they were

4681
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:35,799
going after less bruising easier

4682
03:12:33,760 --> 03:12:38,719
Transportation faster flowering times

4683
03:12:35,799 --> 03:12:40,719
Fring times Etc but again they didn't

4684
03:12:38,719 --> 03:12:42,398
think about the other aspects of things

4685
03:12:40,719 --> 03:12:45,438
and sure they did all those testings to

4686
03:12:42,398 --> 03:12:47,478
your point and they did all these trials

4687
03:12:45,439 --> 03:12:50,359
but they weren't asking other questions

4688
03:12:47,478 --> 03:12:51,879
that were perhaps more important down

4689
03:12:50,359 --> 03:12:54,000
the line that we didn't really realize

4690
03:12:51,879 --> 03:12:55,920
at the time or more importantly they

4691
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:58,520
didn't realize at the time and as smart

4692
03:12:55,920 --> 03:13:01,639
as they are and as brilliant as the team

4693
03:12:58,520 --> 03:13:03,000
was they created crops and things that

4694
03:13:01,639 --> 03:13:05,238
are less

4695
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:07,120
nutritious actually ended up doing the

4696
03:13:05,238 --> 03:13:10,600
opposite in the long

4697
03:13:07,120 --> 03:13:12,840
run and we're in a dichotomy with with I

4698
03:13:10,600 --> 03:13:14,920
would say farming right now where we're

4699
03:13:12,840 --> 03:13:16,680
looking backwards we're looking towards

4700
03:13:14,920 --> 03:13:18,120
regenerative farming practices and

4701
03:13:16,680 --> 03:13:20,639
learning

4702
03:13:18,120 --> 03:13:23,720
you know what what that looks like and

4703
03:13:20,639 --> 03:13:25,840
you know you know have you you know

4704
03:13:23,719 --> 03:13:28,639
again I just we've talk lot we talked a

4705
03:13:25,840 --> 03:13:31,079
lot about what you can do but have you

4706
03:13:28,639 --> 03:13:32,278
are there any risks and of those risks I

4707
03:13:31,079 --> 03:13:34,760
guess more

4708
03:13:32,279 --> 03:13:36,359
precisely of those risks what is what

4709
03:13:34,760 --> 03:13:40,000
have you found have you found anything

4710
03:13:36,359 --> 03:13:43,479
that is like hey we we shouldn't do

4711
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:47,120
this um there's nothing that I can think

4712
03:13:43,478 --> 03:13:48,478
of that we've considered that might be

4713
03:13:47,120 --> 03:13:49,960
that we're trying to Target that might

4714
03:13:48,478 --> 03:13:52,559
be a

4715
03:13:49,959 --> 03:13:54,519
danger um to the environment or human

4716
03:13:52,559 --> 03:13:58,000
health anything like that

4717
03:13:54,520 --> 03:13:59,760
um how would you know like how could you

4718
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:02,159
how could you know that like whether it

4719
03:13:59,760 --> 03:14:04,120
would or not it seems like U an

4720
03:14:02,159 --> 03:14:06,238
impossibility I'm kind of on the fence

4721
03:14:04,120 --> 03:14:08,600
you know I like the conversation people

4722
03:14:06,238 --> 03:14:10,760
are very staunch in their belief systems

4723
03:14:08,600 --> 03:14:13,279
they're either on one way or the other

4724
03:14:10,760 --> 03:14:14,760
I'm sort of I'm similar to Wade in the

4725
03:14:13,279 --> 03:14:17,238
sense that it's like yeah definitely

4726
03:14:14,760 --> 03:14:19,960
frightens me the potential the you know

4727
03:14:17,238 --> 03:14:21,799
the human eror but then I think like you

4728
03:14:19,959 --> 03:14:23,238
know I think on this one conversation

4729
03:14:21,799 --> 03:14:25,519
okay it's crisper but then it's like but

4730
03:14:23,238 --> 03:14:27,439
everyone's like consuming seed oils on a

4731
03:14:25,520 --> 03:14:30,159
daily basis and people smoke rad

4732
03:14:27,439 --> 03:14:32,279
radioactive tobacco and people like

4733
03:14:30,159 --> 03:14:34,398
consume alcohol as their number one

4734
03:14:32,279 --> 03:14:38,439
recreational drug which is just like

4735
03:14:34,398 --> 03:14:40,439
holy [ __ ] yeah just like a a brain cell

4736
03:14:38,439 --> 03:14:42,840
killing like I'll never forget growing

4737
03:14:40,439 --> 03:14:46,439
up smoking weed and drunk adults being

4738
03:14:42,840 --> 03:14:49,680
like that shit'll kill your brain cells

4739
03:14:46,439 --> 03:14:49,680
right right all right

4740
03:14:49,840 --> 03:14:55,079
buddy so yeah it's it's an interesting

4741
03:14:52,478 --> 03:14:57,639
uh conversation I definitely can see how

4742
03:14:55,079 --> 03:14:59,120
it uh it's very human right it's like

4743
03:14:57,639 --> 03:15:01,278
you've got humans that want to live in

4744
03:14:59,120 --> 03:15:02,560
tepps and live off the land and then you

4745
03:15:01,279 --> 03:15:05,000
have other humans that want to build

4746
03:15:02,559 --> 03:15:07,478
rocket ships and explore space and

4747
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:09,520
generally the ones that live off the

4748
03:15:07,478 --> 03:15:10,920
land are worried about the ones who are

4749
03:15:09,520 --> 03:15:13,040
building the rocket ships that they're

4750
03:15:10,920 --> 03:15:15,960
going to D inadvertently destroy the

4751
03:15:13,040 --> 03:15:18,439
land so it seems like that's the kind of

4752
03:15:15,959 --> 03:15:20,519
go ahead Mojave did I just comment on

4753
03:15:18,439 --> 03:15:22,520
Arturo and obviously you you're more of

4754
03:15:20,520 --> 03:15:25,640
an expert than me but maybe just comment

4755
03:15:22,520 --> 03:15:27,520
on what Colin had mentioned um what you

4756
03:15:25,639 --> 03:15:32,318
were specifically talking about is a

4757
03:15:27,520 --> 03:15:34,840
bottlenecking through um a large a teac

4758
03:15:32,318 --> 03:15:36,840
breeding to create a better product a

4759
03:15:34,840 --> 03:15:38,719
better commodity versus a better banana

4760
03:15:36,840 --> 03:15:40,398
or something that's more nutritious and

4761
03:15:38,719 --> 03:15:44,238
I think that that that's an interesting

4762
03:15:40,398 --> 03:15:46,719
dichotomy with that and crisper style

4763
03:15:44,238 --> 03:15:49,799
breeding and specifically which is that

4764
03:15:46,719 --> 03:15:52,478
they bottlenecking an entire genome by

4765
03:15:49,799 --> 03:15:54,478
saying this banana shipped better forget

4766
03:15:52,478 --> 03:15:55,760
all the other diversity it all got

4767
03:15:54,478 --> 03:15:58,238
packaged in here because what they're

4768
03:15:55,760 --> 03:16:01,439
really looking for was mold resistance

4769
03:15:58,238 --> 03:16:04,039
shipping blah blah blah whereas what I'm

4770
03:16:01,439 --> 03:16:07,398
assuming what crisper can can do is they

4771
03:16:04,040 --> 03:16:09,439
actually Target that particular trait so

4772
03:16:07,398 --> 03:16:12,119
it's not about bottlenecking the entire

4773
03:16:09,439 --> 03:16:13,960
genome into one commodity product it's

4774
03:16:12,120 --> 03:16:16,560
about saying okay well if we could

4775
03:16:13,959 --> 03:16:18,719
identify for instance what that was that

4776
03:16:16,559 --> 03:16:20,680
we didn't want in the banana that

4777
03:16:18,719 --> 03:16:23,079
shipping longevity whatever ripening

4778
03:16:20,680 --> 03:16:24,720
speed or whatever and then apply that to

4779
03:16:23,079 --> 03:16:27,279
all the other crops then we didn't have

4780
03:16:24,719 --> 03:16:29,198
to bottleneck the entire gene pool we

4781
03:16:27,279 --> 03:16:31,600
could actually and with cannabis what I

4782
03:16:29,199 --> 03:16:34,479
think makes an interesting discussion

4783
03:16:31,600 --> 03:16:37,960
around crisper is we haven't selected

4784
03:16:34,478 --> 03:16:39,559
the cultivars yet there's thousands and

4785
03:16:37,959 --> 03:16:41,879
thousands of cannabis cultivars that are

4786
03:16:39,559 --> 03:16:43,719
in constant rotation that's not the way

4787
03:16:41,879 --> 03:16:46,278
it's going to work forever eventually

4788
03:16:43,719 --> 03:16:48,920
there has to be a finite number so all

4789
03:16:46,279 --> 03:16:50,359
the breeding work that's been done you

4790
03:16:48,920 --> 03:16:51,600
have to pick your lane so like for

4791
03:16:50,359 --> 03:16:54,199
instance you look at the companies that

4792
03:16:51,600 --> 03:16:55,720
have put a lot of money into triploids

4793
03:16:54,199 --> 03:16:57,600
right that's a great idea it's a great

4794
03:16:55,719 --> 03:16:59,438
concept right but if you didn't pick the

4795
03:16:57,600 --> 03:17:02,960
right cultivars and the right parent

4796
03:16:59,439 --> 03:17:04,359
stock to do that improvement work on and

4797
03:17:02,959 --> 03:17:05,759
then three years later millions of

4798
03:17:04,359 --> 03:17:08,000
dollars spent like oh that's not what

4799
03:17:05,760 --> 03:17:10,760
the kids want to smoke this year back to

4800
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:14,279
the drawing board but it but with with

4801
03:17:10,760 --> 03:17:16,960
Gene editing I'm assuming in theory that

4802
03:17:14,279 --> 03:17:19,520
that one thing like what they learned

4803
03:17:16,959 --> 03:17:22,039
with wheat or other crops about

4804
03:17:19,520 --> 03:17:23,520
branching applied to all the other crops

4805
03:17:22,040 --> 03:17:25,880
because they identified that one

4806
03:17:23,520 --> 03:17:27,479
branching Gene and said we just have to

4807
03:17:25,879 --> 03:17:30,238
find that same branching Gene in all

4808
03:17:27,478 --> 03:17:33,478
these different crops so the isolated

4809
03:17:30,238 --> 03:17:36,639
nature of the selection it makes it even

4810
03:17:33,478 --> 03:17:40,278
less risky in a sense than having to

4811
03:17:36,639 --> 03:17:41,920
lump all genes together into one

4812
03:17:40,279 --> 03:17:44,680
cultivar

4813
03:17:41,920 --> 03:17:47,920
variety I'm GL went through that yeah

4814
03:17:44,680 --> 03:17:50,559
and Dr Toro if you could expand on that

4815
03:17:47,920 --> 03:17:53,040
for even the listeners so they

4816
03:17:50,559 --> 03:17:55,198
understand and again I'm asking these

4817
03:17:53,040 --> 03:17:57,520
questions to up to te it up for you to

4818
03:17:55,199 --> 03:18:01,079
talk deeper about what your work is and

4819
03:17:57,520 --> 03:18:03,000
why you feel like it's important to the

4820
03:18:01,079 --> 03:18:06,318
work that all of us continue to do in

4821
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:07,920
the industry and you know it's I think

4822
03:18:06,318 --> 03:18:11,398
it's important to explain it because

4823
03:18:07,920 --> 03:18:13,238
it's it's not um it's misunderstood in a

4824
03:18:11,398 --> 03:18:17,198
huge way and I think genomics in general

4825
03:18:13,238 --> 03:18:19,520
and cannabis are so far behind and to

4826
03:18:17,199 --> 03:18:21,920
mojave's point where you alluded to

4827
03:18:19,520 --> 03:18:24,279
we're just we're not we've billions of

4828
03:18:21,920 --> 03:18:26,120
her Idols are found every day I mean

4829
03:18:24,279 --> 03:18:29,880
chemotypes phenotypes found every single

4830
03:18:26,120 --> 03:18:33,840
day yeah so I steing that down is like a

4831
03:18:29,879 --> 03:18:37,159
you know sounds impossible right

4832
03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:39,520
impossible for for what to to distill it

4833
03:18:37,159 --> 03:18:42,840
down into let's say 10 varials right

4834
03:18:39,520 --> 03:18:45,479
Mojave like oh right asking Rob Clark

4835
03:18:42,840 --> 03:18:47,639
like hey man do you think we ever find

4836
03:18:45,478 --> 03:18:50,238
like value in sativa ever again he's

4837
03:18:47,639 --> 03:18:53,599
like if we turn back time I guess we

4838
03:18:50,238 --> 03:18:57,920
could you know right yeah

4839
03:18:53,600 --> 03:18:59,279
um well um speaking back to what Mojave

4840
03:18:57,920 --> 03:19:03,719
mentioned about

4841
03:18:59,279 --> 03:19:07,279
bottlenecking um so with this chrisper

4842
03:19:03,719 --> 03:19:09,238
technology you edit one gene or you can

4843
03:19:07,279 --> 03:19:11,279
edit more than one

4844
03:19:09,238 --> 03:19:12,559
simultaneously and that can be applied

4845
03:19:11,279 --> 03:19:14,560
to not just one

4846
03:19:12,559 --> 03:19:17,639
variety um to several different

4847
03:19:14,559 --> 03:19:19,799
varieties of cannabis so the

4848
03:19:17,639 --> 03:19:21,439
the potential for bottlenecking is not

4849
03:19:19,799 --> 03:19:23,679
there right it's not like how he

4850
03:19:21,439 --> 03:19:25,960
mentioned with with banana you know

4851
03:19:23,680 --> 03:19:27,079
banana the Cavendish banana is just one

4852
03:19:25,959 --> 03:19:29,278
clonal

4853
03:19:27,079 --> 03:19:32,478
population so it's one

4854
03:19:29,279 --> 03:19:35,760
genotype so there's you know if a if a

4855
03:19:32,478 --> 03:19:39,238
fungal pathogen that's hyper virent

4856
03:19:35,760 --> 03:19:43,639
comes it can devastate the entire banana

4857
03:19:39,238 --> 03:19:46,959
uh crop industry in the entire world so

4858
03:19:43,639 --> 03:19:50,599
um what we're looking at uh like we want

4859
03:19:46,959 --> 03:19:54,198
to Target uh uh genes and

4860
03:19:50,600 --> 03:19:56,079
cannabis um it's definitely something

4861
03:19:54,199 --> 03:19:58,760
um

4862
03:19:56,079 --> 03:20:02,120
it's it's I guess it's traits that can

4863
03:19:58,760 --> 03:20:03,760
be deployed in not just one variety if

4864
03:20:02,120 --> 03:20:05,720
you get what I mean

4865
03:20:03,760 --> 03:20:08,840
like uh I don't know like give me two

4866
03:20:05,719 --> 03:20:11,879
different varieties you're thinking of

4867
03:20:08,840 --> 03:20:14,880
like let's go with papaya and Sour

4868
03:20:11,879 --> 03:20:16,759
Diesel slow what are the like chemo

4869
03:20:14,879 --> 03:20:20,398
types or

4870
03:20:16,760 --> 03:20:23,359
what are their properties I

4871
03:20:20,398 --> 03:20:27,159
mean each one would ex you know one

4872
03:20:23,359 --> 03:20:30,040
expresses more of a

4873
03:20:27,159 --> 03:20:34,279
kopling uh

4874
03:20:30,040 --> 03:20:36,520
mercing heavy dominant profile with

4875
03:20:34,279 --> 03:20:37,359
uh you know and the other one's more of

4876
03:20:36,520 --> 03:20:41,040
a

4877
03:20:37,359 --> 03:20:43,318
fruity I'd say has it's more of an

4878
03:20:41,040 --> 03:20:44,640
exotic fruit category I guess that's

4879
03:20:43,318 --> 03:20:46,039
that's you know in terms of the

4880
03:20:44,639 --> 03:20:48,559
constituents that are in there in terms

4881
03:20:46,040 --> 03:20:51,000
of the tpine profiles I think would

4882
03:20:48,559 --> 03:20:52,600
vary

4883
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:55,920
right

4884
03:20:52,600 --> 03:20:58,559
um so like say for

4885
03:20:55,920 --> 03:21:01,559
example like a trait that's not even

4886
03:20:58,559 --> 03:21:03,278
involving like the you know the the

4887
03:21:01,559 --> 03:21:05,920
chemotype or anything that we want in

4888
03:21:03,279 --> 03:21:10,040
the background we can apply it to both

4889
03:21:05,920 --> 03:21:11,840
varieties like say for example like uh

4890
03:21:10,040 --> 03:21:12,720
the drought tolerance Gene that we're

4891
03:21:11,840 --> 03:21:14,559
looking

4892
03:21:12,719 --> 03:21:17,039
into

4893
03:21:14,559 --> 03:21:20,079
um it's something that we can

4894
03:21:17,040 --> 03:21:22,319
potentially apply to different varieties

4895
03:21:20,079 --> 03:21:24,680
you're not just like homing in on one

4896
03:21:22,318 --> 03:21:29,398
variety and then that's it and you can

4897
03:21:24,680 --> 03:21:30,840
also like say you have a a certain

4898
03:21:29,398 --> 03:21:33,079
variety that you want to use as breeding

4899
03:21:30,840 --> 03:21:36,199
stock you can just Target that one and

4900
03:21:33,079 --> 03:21:38,199
then do a breeding trial afterwards with

4901
03:21:36,199 --> 03:21:39,960
to try to generate something different

4902
03:21:38,199 --> 03:21:41,760
you know what I mean so so it sounds to

4903
03:21:39,959 --> 03:21:43,559
me like there's so there's two different

4904
03:21:41,760 --> 03:21:45,920
asss so like the last guy has more

4905
03:21:43,559 --> 03:21:49,600
consumer forward right like I want this

4906
03:21:45,920 --> 03:21:52,520
profile to taste like this right and

4907
03:21:49,600 --> 03:21:55,479
what you just spoke on is more of a I'm

4908
03:21:52,520 --> 03:21:58,479
a cultivator I have run you know right

4909
03:21:55,478 --> 03:22:00,840
business and I've got x amount to spend

4910
03:21:58,478 --> 03:22:02,840
on my crop this year and I need a

4911
03:22:00,840 --> 03:22:04,960
varietal that is trout resistant I need

4912
03:22:02,840 --> 03:22:08,520
to spend less on my nutrient inputs

4913
03:22:04,959 --> 03:22:11,000
right right so there so it's a lot more

4914
03:22:08,520 --> 03:22:13,880
complicated than that like I can't you

4915
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:18,199
know if a grower comes to me and says I

4916
03:22:13,879 --> 03:22:21,278
want this specific flavor put it in this

4917
03:22:18,199 --> 03:22:24,920
variety that I have

4918
03:22:21,279 --> 03:22:26,920
um you wouldn't be able to do that with

4919
03:22:24,920 --> 03:22:29,318
with crisper really because it's so

4920
03:22:26,920 --> 03:22:31,840
complicated so

4921
03:22:29,318 --> 03:22:34,318
complex so I

4922
03:22:31,840 --> 03:22:36,520
mean so what I'm hearing is like it'd be

4923
03:22:34,318 --> 03:22:39,478
better you a use case for what your

4924
03:22:36,520 --> 03:22:43,199
technology does is better use use would

4925
03:22:39,478 --> 03:22:46,799
be on the a side where hey I want to be

4926
03:22:43,199 --> 03:22:48,199
mold resistant drought resistant

4927
03:22:46,799 --> 03:22:49,438
um because perhaps you're doing dry

4928
03:22:48,199 --> 03:22:52,199
farming you're in a part of the world

4929
03:22:49,439 --> 03:22:53,600
where you don't have much water um

4930
03:22:52,199 --> 03:22:55,479
that's historically where cannabis was

4931
03:22:53,600 --> 03:22:57,720
grown at scale

4932
03:22:55,478 --> 03:23:00,879
arguably um places where didn't have a

4933
03:22:57,719 --> 03:23:03,959
ton of water but had

4934
03:23:00,879 --> 03:23:06,198
enough you know um you c yeah I mean you

4935
03:23:03,959 --> 03:23:09,039
can Target the you know the the

4936
03:23:06,199 --> 03:23:10,279
chemotype and the flavor profile but

4937
03:23:09,040 --> 03:23:12,160
it's just that you know when you target

4938
03:23:10,279 --> 03:23:13,920
those genes involved with

4939
03:23:12,159 --> 03:23:15,879
that

4940
03:23:13,920 --> 03:23:17,318
um you're just not you're not going to

4941
03:23:15,879 --> 03:23:20,559
know what you're going to get until you

4942
03:23:17,318 --> 03:23:22,359
do it right yeah of course I mean so

4943
03:23:20,559 --> 03:23:24,959
here's even another question like let's

4944
03:23:22,359 --> 03:23:28,159
say you did all this you had varidol you

4945
03:23:24,959 --> 03:23:31,398
made a new papaya let's say I grabbed a

4946
03:23:28,159 --> 03:23:35,639
10 pack of masonic seeds Wilson

4947
03:23:31,398 --> 03:23:38,760
f2s I cross that to your genan edited or

4948
03:23:35,639 --> 03:23:41,119
your crisper edited varietal what

4949
03:23:38,760 --> 03:23:43,040
then then you have to empirically look

4950
03:23:41,120 --> 03:23:47,079
at the phenotype of the

4951
03:23:43,040 --> 03:23:50,160
progyny like you have to that but I'm

4952
03:23:47,079 --> 03:23:54,079
what I'm saying is like because you did

4953
03:23:50,159 --> 03:23:58,439
crisper on that let's say it's a

4954
03:23:54,079 --> 03:24:00,199
female is that Gene pull somehow limited

4955
03:23:58,439 --> 03:24:03,120
or is

4956
03:24:00,199 --> 03:24:03,880
it what what would become of that in

4957
03:24:03,120 --> 03:24:06,319
your

4958
03:24:03,879 --> 03:24:08,839
opinion would it just go back to a

4959
03:24:06,318 --> 03:24:13,079
generation you know

4960
03:24:08,840 --> 03:24:15,359
so so mutations are we adding destroying

4961
03:24:13,079 --> 03:24:17,760
the that's what I'm getting let's just

4962
03:24:15,359 --> 03:24:19,880
like imagine like we do a crisper edit

4963
03:24:17,760 --> 03:24:22,600
of one gene in a

4964
03:24:19,879 --> 03:24:25,959
variety and then so it's going to be

4965
03:24:22,600 --> 03:24:27,680
homozygous mutate mutation so then we

4966
03:24:25,959 --> 03:24:32,358
cross it right with what whatever you

4967
03:24:27,680 --> 03:24:34,079
want to cross it with um from what I've

4968
03:24:32,359 --> 03:24:36,359
uh learned about cannabis um certain

4969
03:24:34,079 --> 03:24:38,680
varieties are very heterozygous around

4970
03:24:36,359 --> 03:24:42,640
the you know on the entire genotype

4971
03:24:38,680 --> 03:24:44,199
right the genome yep y um so it's still

4972
03:24:42,639 --> 03:24:47,478
going to be something

4973
03:24:44,199 --> 03:24:51,880
new uh in the progy because of all that

4974
03:24:47,478 --> 03:24:53,920
background uh heteros zygosity yep right

4975
03:24:51,879 --> 03:24:55,639
yep so you're saying like you were

4976
03:24:53,920 --> 03:24:58,639
asking if there's a potential for there

4977
03:24:55,639 --> 03:25:02,358
like to be a bottlenecking of not just

4978
03:24:58,639 --> 03:25:04,760
bottlenecking or just you're we're

4979
03:25:02,359 --> 03:25:09,840
editing the gene so things are missing

4980
03:25:04,760 --> 03:25:12,079
by by Design right right in the progy

4981
03:25:09,840 --> 03:25:14,199
it's going to be you know the the

4982
03:25:12,079 --> 03:25:16,959
mutation that you put in and then the

4983
03:25:14,199 --> 03:25:18,920
the wild type mutation from the other

4984
03:25:16,959 --> 03:25:21,478
variety right so you can see what

4985
03:25:18,920 --> 03:25:24,840
happens when you do that maybe there's

4986
03:25:21,478 --> 03:25:27,358
like a you know Middle Ground where you

4987
03:25:24,840 --> 03:25:30,279
get the you know a mild effect of

4988
03:25:27,359 --> 03:25:31,640
whatever you're trying to make and then

4989
03:25:30,279 --> 03:25:34,880
the homozygous

4990
03:25:31,639 --> 03:25:35,599
one in the subsequent progeny will have

4991
03:25:34,879 --> 03:25:39,438
the

4992
03:25:35,600 --> 03:25:42,439
full uh phenotype that you're looking

4993
03:25:39,439 --> 03:25:42,439
for

4994
03:25:42,959 --> 03:25:48,879
um just like imagine that it's just just

4995
03:25:46,478 --> 03:25:51,879
just picture like just a random mutation

4996
03:25:48,879 --> 03:25:55,959
in a variety and you're just introducing

4997
03:25:51,879 --> 03:25:58,879
that variety into you

4998
03:25:55,959 --> 03:26:00,238
know and Crossing it with this other

4999
03:25:58,879 --> 03:26:03,238
Vari that you

5000
03:26:00,238 --> 03:26:03,238
have

5001
03:26:05,879 --> 03:26:10,679
um I think

5002
03:26:08,559 --> 03:26:12,039
um I don't know maybe some people have

5003
03:26:10,680 --> 03:26:14,920
the impression

5004
03:26:12,040 --> 03:26:16,880
that um when you target some like a one

5005
03:26:14,920 --> 03:26:18,879
gene or one

5006
03:26:16,879 --> 03:26:21,079
Target uh with

5007
03:26:18,879 --> 03:26:23,719
crisper it's like this really

5008
03:26:21,079 --> 03:26:24,959
complicated like it's going to change

5009
03:26:23,719 --> 03:26:28,318
the entire

5010
03:26:24,959 --> 03:26:30,000
genome and make something fixed right

5011
03:26:28,318 --> 03:26:32,600
but that's not really the case

5012
03:26:30,000 --> 03:26:35,040
especially when you just Target one

5013
03:26:32,600 --> 03:26:38,040
gene

5014
03:26:35,040 --> 03:26:39,000
um like to say for the like the PDS Gene

5015
03:26:38,040 --> 03:26:40,760
that I

5016
03:26:39,000 --> 03:26:43,478
showed

5017
03:26:40,760 --> 03:26:45,760
um that's going to be consistent

5018
03:26:43,478 --> 03:26:47,318
throughout every variety no matter what

5019
03:26:45,760 --> 03:26:50,199
the genetic background

5020
03:26:47,318 --> 03:26:54,439
because that Gene is so crucial for

5021
03:26:50,199 --> 03:26:55,960
chlorophyll pigment formation right so

5022
03:26:54,439 --> 03:26:57,559
but that that won't necessarily be the

5023
03:26:55,959 --> 03:27:00,318
case for every Gene that you

5024
03:26:57,559 --> 03:27:02,238
target sometimes you you mutate a gene

5025
03:27:00,318 --> 03:27:04,519
and then there's another Gene that's

5026
03:27:02,238 --> 03:27:07,680
very similar or related to it that will

5027
03:27:04,520 --> 03:27:11,359
compensate for its loss so you kind of

5028
03:27:07,680 --> 03:27:12,920
have to um after you edit a gene you

5029
03:27:11,359 --> 03:27:16,318
have to kind

5030
03:27:12,920 --> 03:27:18,879
of evaluate the phenotype

5031
03:27:16,318 --> 03:27:20,840
so you know it's not perfect right you

5032
03:27:18,879 --> 03:27:24,639
can't you you you can't really say like

5033
03:27:20,840 --> 03:27:26,120
oh okay um if I Target this Gene I know

5034
03:27:24,639 --> 03:27:28,039
exactly what's going to happen in the

5035
03:27:26,120 --> 03:27:32,760
subsequent

5036
03:27:28,040 --> 03:27:37,600
um uh generation right so do you think

5037
03:27:32,760 --> 03:27:40,000
you'll be able to edit a CBD synthes so

5038
03:27:37,600 --> 03:27:41,000
it doesn't produce any THC the way it

5039
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:43,398
does

5040
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:47,719
now

5041
03:27:43,398 --> 03:27:52,159
yes uh you can knock it out

5042
03:27:47,719 --> 03:27:53,959
um from what I I uh know about this the

5043
03:27:52,159 --> 03:27:57,439
CB synthes it's very

5044
03:27:53,959 --> 03:27:59,839
similar uh to the THC synas right

5045
03:27:57,439 --> 03:28:04,960
there's some homology there

5046
03:27:59,840 --> 03:28:07,318
so um so you you want to not you don't

5047
03:28:04,959 --> 03:28:12,079
want CBD synthes to make CB or to make

5048
03:28:07,318 --> 03:28:14,318
THC to what any zero THC correct oh you

5049
03:28:12,079 --> 03:28:16,600
you you you don't want any THC in the

5050
03:28:14,318 --> 03:28:21,039
specific variety is that what you're

5051
03:28:16,600 --> 03:28:24,760
correct I I want a CBD only variety

5052
03:28:21,040 --> 03:28:27,760
oh I have I have CBD varieties that are

5053
03:28:24,760 --> 03:28:31,318
about 40 to one the highest I've ever

5054
03:28:27,760 --> 03:28:34,680
seen right but anything more than 10%

5055
03:28:31,318 --> 03:28:38,119
CBD also has

5056
03:28:34,680 --> 03:28:42,920
THC right yeah that's that's

5057
03:28:38,120 --> 03:28:44,319
uh that's um certainly doable but it's

5058
03:28:42,920 --> 03:28:47,040
not going to be as simple as just

5059
03:28:44,318 --> 03:28:50,039
targeting and knocking out the

5060
03:28:47,040 --> 03:28:53,479
the CBD synthes Gene you'd have to go in

5061
03:28:50,040 --> 03:28:55,439
there and do precise edits on the amino

5062
03:28:53,478 --> 03:28:59,599
acids that are in the

5063
03:28:55,439 --> 03:29:02,760
protein um and you

5064
03:28:59,600 --> 03:29:07,318
know that way you can if you could you

5065
03:29:02,760 --> 03:29:12,800
could make 30% CBD varieties with zero

5066
03:29:07,318 --> 03:29:15,198
TC right exactly so that's going to

5067
03:29:12,799 --> 03:29:18,039
so that would take some time to kind of

5068
03:29:15,199 --> 03:29:18,040
figure out because

5069
03:29:18,159 --> 03:29:23,760
um since the CBD synthes enzyme is very

5070
03:29:21,439 --> 03:29:26,238
similar to the THC synthes one You' have

5071
03:29:23,760 --> 03:29:30,478
to do very precise edits in the sequence

5072
03:29:26,238 --> 03:29:32,439
so that it doesn't um kind of uh doesn't

5073
03:29:30,478 --> 03:29:35,879
use the precursor to those cannabinoids

5074
03:29:32,439 --> 03:29:37,159
to to direct it to to make THC that's

5075
03:29:35,879 --> 03:29:39,759
gonna be tricky but it's certainly

5076
03:29:37,159 --> 03:29:42,799
doable with crisper yeah I I i'

5077
03:29:39,760 --> 03:29:46,639
suspected it was but uh most of the

5078
03:29:42,799 --> 03:29:50,559
other canono do not produce m multiple

5079
03:29:46,639 --> 03:29:53,719
cannaboids the way syn

5080
03:29:50,559 --> 03:29:56,879
right um You can also

5081
03:29:53,719 --> 03:30:02,119
um potentially you could Target

5082
03:29:56,879 --> 03:30:06,039
a an enzyme that uh is up the pathway so

5083
03:30:02,120 --> 03:30:08,680
before you get to the CBD and the TC

5084
03:30:06,040 --> 03:30:12,479
synthesis um you can you can edit that

5085
03:30:08,680 --> 03:30:17,040
one and then I I do know that

5086
03:30:12,478 --> 03:30:19,318
um for CBD they're they uh in the tpine

5087
03:30:17,040 --> 03:30:21,640
biosynthesis pathways uh there's there's

5088
03:30:19,318 --> 03:30:25,719
a molecule that gets shunted to the

5089
03:30:21,639 --> 03:30:27,159
CBB um pathway so there there's

5090
03:30:25,719 --> 03:30:27,840
potential of doing it that way kind of

5091
03:30:27,159 --> 03:30:31,398
like

5092
03:30:27,840 --> 03:30:33,719
circumventing the THC pathway that way

5093
03:30:31,398 --> 03:30:33,719
right

5094
03:30:33,959 --> 03:30:38,639
so I was just looking at the hedes ofs

5095
03:30:36,398 --> 03:30:42,879
city of the moms that I have and they're

5096
03:30:38,639 --> 03:30:42,879
all around like one% to

5097
03:30:43,040 --> 03:30:49,160
1.37% one of them is 1.4 and that's the

5098
03:30:46,159 --> 03:30:50,639
tter Roa so sorry to interrupt uh Wade

5099
03:30:49,159 --> 03:30:52,279
had his hand up did you still have a

5100
03:30:50,639 --> 03:30:54,760
question Wade or did we move too far

5101
03:30:52,279 --> 03:30:54,760
away from

5102
03:30:59,799 --> 03:31:07,639
that oh I can't hear you oh there can

5103
03:31:02,920 --> 03:31:10,120
you hear me now yes sir yes okay

5104
03:31:07,639 --> 03:31:11,760
um one of the things that I understand

5105
03:31:10,120 --> 03:31:16,439
about crisper that I haven't heard you

5106
03:31:11,760 --> 03:31:19,680
say Arturo is that most genes

5107
03:31:16,439 --> 03:31:22,479
have more than one effect in the

5108
03:31:19,680 --> 03:31:25,359
organism in which they are found it's

5109
03:31:22,478 --> 03:31:26,959
pretty rare that a gene only does one

5110
03:31:25,359 --> 03:31:29,640
thing isn't that

5111
03:31:26,959 --> 03:31:33,119
correct right in most cases yeah it

5112
03:31:29,639 --> 03:31:36,000
might have multiple

5113
03:31:33,120 --> 03:31:38,120
functions um so that is one of the one

5114
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:41,478
of the ways if you will that you explore

5115
03:31:38,120 --> 03:31:42,800
new territory right with organisms and

5116
03:31:41,478 --> 03:31:46,398
chis

5117
03:31:42,799 --> 03:31:50,719
technology thank you

5118
03:31:46,398 --> 03:31:53,000
right it's so sometimes um especially in

5119
03:31:50,719 --> 03:31:55,398
Plants you have you can have duplication

5120
03:31:53,000 --> 03:31:57,478
events so a gene will be

5121
03:31:55,398 --> 03:31:59,238
duplicated while you know the plant's

5122
03:31:57,478 --> 03:32:02,079
evolving or the organisms

5123
03:31:59,238 --> 03:32:04,198
evolving it or it gets you know the

5124
03:32:02,079 --> 03:32:05,840
duplication gets crossed over into a

5125
03:32:04,199 --> 03:32:08,520
different chromosome or something like

5126
03:32:05,840 --> 03:32:12,639
that and so you have the copy of that

5127
03:32:08,520 --> 03:32:15,960
original Gene and that the new copy um

5128
03:32:12,639 --> 03:32:18,559
evolves into something else right and

5129
03:32:15,959 --> 03:32:21,318
that new Gene might have a new whole new

5130
03:32:18,559 --> 03:32:23,519
function that benefits the plant or

5131
03:32:21,318 --> 03:32:26,799
produces a new

5132
03:32:23,520 --> 03:32:29,920
molecule so in a way um that's something

5133
03:32:26,799 --> 03:32:29,920
you can do with crisper as

5134
03:32:30,439 --> 03:32:36,680
well but in just a short as kind of a

5135
03:32:33,879 --> 03:32:36,679
shortcutting I

5136
03:32:36,719 --> 03:32:40,159
guess so the only thing you're cutting

5137
03:32:39,159 --> 03:32:43,159
off is

5138
03:32:40,159 --> 03:32:43,159
time

5139
03:32:43,520 --> 03:32:50,439
right oh Selena has has a

5140
03:32:47,120 --> 03:32:52,359
question yeah I was just curious um how

5141
03:32:50,439 --> 03:32:53,600
do we prove it out over time so you

5142
03:32:52,359 --> 03:32:56,600
talked about you know your end goal

5143
03:32:53,600 --> 03:32:58,600
being you know about benefiting patients

5144
03:32:56,600 --> 03:33:01,238
so let's say you know to Colin's point

5145
03:32:58,600 --> 03:33:03,600
we we grow it out um and that's another

5146
03:33:01,238 --> 03:33:05,359
piece of this that I'm curious about

5147
03:33:03,600 --> 03:33:06,680
anybody that wants to comment on this is

5148
03:33:05,359 --> 03:33:09,238
you know the actual culture that we're

5149
03:33:06,680 --> 03:33:11,520
growing the plant in you know so if it's

5150
03:33:09,238 --> 03:33:13,840
living soil or if it's in Coco like what

5151
03:33:11,520 --> 03:33:15,479
are we doing and and then looking at

5152
03:33:13,840 --> 03:33:17,559
that like proving out so let's say that

5153
03:33:15,478 --> 03:33:19,000
we're um Gene editing for a certain

5154
03:33:17,559 --> 03:33:21,920
expression to help you know certain

5155
03:33:19,000 --> 03:33:23,520
patients maybe mitigate certain um

5156
03:33:21,920 --> 03:33:26,040
symptoms that are going through like

5157
03:33:23,520 --> 03:33:27,840
cancer therapy for example how do we

5158
03:33:26,040 --> 03:33:30,000
prove it out over time like what could

5159
03:33:27,840 --> 03:33:31,520
those types of trial processes look like

5160
03:33:30,000 --> 03:33:34,079
and and how do we actually ultimately

5161
03:33:31,520 --> 03:33:36,800
know that when you're editing here it's

5162
03:33:34,079 --> 03:33:38,639
going to have this effect over here um

5163
03:33:36,799 --> 03:33:40,840
indefinitely and like you said too you

5164
03:33:38,639 --> 03:33:42,920
know you can you can edit over here but

5165
03:33:40,840 --> 03:33:44,680
it might have some um other effects that

5166
03:33:42,920 --> 03:33:46,398
we're not aware of so I'm wondering how

5167
03:33:44,680 --> 03:33:49,398
do you isolate that and how would you

5168
03:33:46,398 --> 03:33:54,039
prove it out the only way is human

5169
03:33:49,398 --> 03:33:56,238
trials yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah with

5170
03:33:54,040 --> 03:33:57,840
respect to um you know editing a gene

5171
03:33:56,238 --> 03:34:02,559
and getting something completely

5172
03:33:57,840 --> 03:34:05,760
different um some effect or new

5173
03:34:02,559 --> 03:34:08,439
function you'd have to you can like

5174
03:34:05,760 --> 03:34:10,199
let's say for like a chemotype or things

5175
03:34:08,439 --> 03:34:13,359
like that you

5176
03:34:10,199 --> 03:34:17,199
can uh evaluate the the profile of those

5177
03:34:13,359 --> 03:34:20,520
chemicals of those molecules by hlc Mass

5178
03:34:17,199 --> 03:34:22,600
Spec um uh

5179
03:34:20,520 --> 03:34:25,000
experiments and kind of compare that to

5180
03:34:22,600 --> 03:34:30,238
your original uh wild type

5181
03:34:25,000 --> 03:34:33,318
plant and then um you know let's say you

5182
03:34:30,238 --> 03:34:37,439
produce a gene edited plant

5183
03:34:33,318 --> 03:34:40,000
that that uh it really overproduces this

5184
03:34:37,439 --> 03:34:42,920
certain molecule that's very beneficial

5185
03:34:40,000 --> 03:34:44,920
and that scientists are looking at as an

5186
03:34:42,920 --> 03:34:46,760
anti-cancer uh potential drug or

5187
03:34:44,920 --> 03:34:48,639
something

5188
03:34:46,760 --> 03:34:50,920
then you would pass that off to those

5189
03:34:48,639 --> 03:34:52,439
scientists you know that are more geared

5190
03:34:50,920 --> 03:34:54,840
towards like the medical field and they

5191
03:34:52,439 --> 03:34:59,359
would do some additional

5192
03:34:54,840 --> 03:35:03,559
research and then um So

5193
03:34:59,359 --> 03:35:06,720
eventually if if those preliminary um

5194
03:35:03,559 --> 03:35:08,398
experiments are uh's successful or

5195
03:35:06,719 --> 03:35:09,599
they're promising then they do the

5196
03:35:08,398 --> 03:35:11,920
trials

5197
03:35:09,600 --> 03:35:14,238
right uh medical trials which I don't

5198
03:35:11,920 --> 03:35:16,520
know anything about but how they're

5199
03:35:14,238 --> 03:35:18,279
conducted but um

5200
03:35:16,520 --> 03:35:21,800
yeah it would definitely be a very long

5201
03:35:18,279 --> 03:35:23,840
process but if the if it's a very

5202
03:35:21,799 --> 03:35:25,719
beneficial uh molecule and it has a lot

5203
03:35:23,840 --> 03:35:28,040
of potential I think it's

5204
03:35:25,719 --> 03:35:31,159
worthwhile I I just want to mention

5205
03:35:28,040 --> 03:35:34,399
Arturo I saw all your work on LinkedIn

5206
03:35:31,159 --> 03:35:38,279
the first day and uh I I thought it was

5207
03:35:34,398 --> 03:35:41,358
really really interesting uh I I I hope

5208
03:35:38,279 --> 03:35:43,720
you can move on to uh other traits that

5209
03:35:41,359 --> 03:35:48,318
you can uh

5210
03:35:43,719 --> 03:35:49,879
edit yeah uh we're considering um

5211
03:35:48,318 --> 03:35:53,000
several different

5212
03:35:49,879 --> 03:35:57,639
traits um and I definitely like to hear

5213
03:35:53,000 --> 03:36:01,478
from from you guys um for traits that

5214
03:35:57,639 --> 03:36:04,599
uh might be be

5215
03:36:01,478 --> 03:36:07,679
worthwhile to Target but I think a few

5216
03:36:04,600 --> 03:36:10,600
of us have uh maybe pondered this uh few

5217
03:36:07,680 --> 03:36:13,559
million million hours in our minds their

5218
03:36:10,600 --> 03:36:17,800
existence in our life oil yield oil

5219
03:36:13,559 --> 03:36:22,000
yield triome yield yeah I mean just

5220
03:36:17,799 --> 03:36:23,519
increasing the overall oil production in

5221
03:36:22,000 --> 03:36:26,439
the

5222
03:36:23,520 --> 03:36:30,199
plant I I would say is like should be

5223
03:36:26,439 --> 03:36:37,159
number one right because Mark I've seen

5224
03:36:30,199 --> 03:36:40,520
chrisper edited plants which uh I or or

5225
03:36:37,159 --> 03:36:45,680
maybe it was GMO I I forget which it was

5226
03:36:40,520 --> 03:36:46,760
but they were using the genes in tobacco

5227
03:36:45,680 --> 03:36:50,120
that make

5228
03:36:46,760 --> 03:36:53,000
tricomes and that made four times as

5229
03:36:50,120 --> 03:36:56,600
many tricomes I thought the heads each

5230
03:36:53,000 --> 03:37:00,318
individual head was a little bit smaller

5231
03:36:56,600 --> 03:37:04,559
but it it say it it also increased uh

5232
03:37:00,318 --> 03:37:06,039
tpine and conoid content so it's a step

5233
03:37:04,559 --> 03:37:09,238
in the right

5234
03:37:06,040 --> 03:37:12,120
direction I I have a question so we've

5235
03:37:09,238 --> 03:37:16,238
all you know we've seen really deeply in

5236
03:37:12,120 --> 03:37:18,359
photography the you know the

5237
03:37:16,238 --> 03:37:19,600
the you know the the capitate stock that

5238
03:37:18,359 --> 03:37:22,399
is

5239
03:37:19,600 --> 03:37:24,920
Created from the the actual

5240
03:37:22,398 --> 03:37:26,159
plant in the resin itself now I'm

5241
03:37:24,920 --> 03:37:28,600
wondering I'm just asking the question

5242
03:37:26,159 --> 03:37:30,039
of the group is there more room for more

5243
03:37:28,600 --> 03:37:31,840
and how would that even happen because

5244
03:37:30,040 --> 03:37:35,520
it seems like surface area would be the

5245
03:37:31,840 --> 03:37:37,318
constituent for allowing more to more at

5246
03:37:35,520 --> 03:37:40,640
least more resin to happen right it

5247
03:37:37,318 --> 03:37:43,278
seems oh but but each resin head is also

5248
03:37:40,639 --> 03:37:46,198
different sized depending on the variety

5249
03:37:43,279 --> 03:37:49,000
and the method grown so

5250
03:37:46,199 --> 03:37:52,199
uh yeah the the ones that I saw

5251
03:37:49,000 --> 03:37:55,359
definitely had by volume four times as

5252
03:37:52,199 --> 03:37:58,040
many because they were counted I I think

5253
03:37:55,359 --> 03:38:00,040
I you've seen that article on

5254
03:37:58,040 --> 03:38:03,880
LinkedIn

5255
03:38:00,040 --> 03:38:07,520
right right um also

5256
03:38:03,879 --> 03:38:11,278
um I think I mentioned before about the

5257
03:38:07,520 --> 03:38:12,960
uh this specific Gene in in tobacco

5258
03:38:11,279 --> 03:38:16,720
where they where they knocked it out and

5259
03:38:12,959 --> 03:38:20,519
increased the trackco density

5260
03:38:16,719 --> 03:38:22,478
um the C cannabis has a homologue in its

5261
03:38:20,520 --> 03:38:25,640
Genome of that specific

5262
03:38:22,478 --> 03:38:27,478
Gene so that could you know Not only

5263
03:38:25,639 --> 03:38:30,039
would it could potentially increase the

5264
03:38:27,478 --> 03:38:32,358
trackone density but it could have it

5265
03:38:30,040 --> 03:38:34,439
have the cannabis plant uh produce trom

5266
03:38:32,359 --> 03:38:36,960
on the

5267
03:38:34,439 --> 03:38:41,279
leaves but

5268
03:38:36,959 --> 03:38:43,679
um yeah um I do know that the you know

5269
03:38:41,279 --> 03:38:46,960
there's several genes involved in in the

5270
03:38:43,680 --> 03:38:50,279
triome formation so so those that's also

5271
03:38:46,959 --> 03:38:53,398
another another potential pathway that

5272
03:38:50,279 --> 03:38:56,560
we could Target um to kind of I I think

5273
03:38:53,398 --> 03:38:59,879
somebody mentioned a different type of

5274
03:38:56,559 --> 03:39:04,559
of triome like a bigger bulb or

5275
03:38:59,879 --> 03:39:06,959
something bulb is stocked yeah so is

5276
03:39:04,559 --> 03:39:09,920
that would that be more beneficial to

5277
03:39:06,959 --> 03:39:12,639
produce that instead of well it just has

5278
03:39:09,920 --> 03:39:15,799
a it has a big head so to just give you

5279
03:39:12,639 --> 03:39:18,079
a a quick little photo that can show you

5280
03:39:15,799 --> 03:39:19,759
this is a Astro Boy I grew some years

5281
03:39:18,079 --> 03:39:21,760
ago and it's just got the two kind it's

5282
03:39:19,760 --> 03:39:24,840
got the capitate stocked and it has the

5283
03:39:21,760 --> 03:39:26,559
cile which is kind of over here um it

5284
03:39:24,840 --> 03:39:28,238
doesn't have well the bulbous ones are

5285
03:39:26,559 --> 03:39:31,039
on this leaf and you can kind of see

5286
03:39:28,238 --> 03:39:34,719
them as blurry circles but they're not

5287
03:39:31,040 --> 03:39:37,960
really noticeable from a perspective of

5288
03:39:34,719 --> 03:39:40,079
hash making using mechanical sifting uh

5289
03:39:37,959 --> 03:39:43,238
even liquid nitrogen and getting

5290
03:39:40,079 --> 03:39:45,879
extremely cold using water extraction uh

5291
03:39:43,238 --> 03:39:47,799
these heads the capitate stock they just

5292
03:39:45,879 --> 03:39:50,719
come off the easiest and so to the

5293
03:39:47,799 --> 03:39:52,799
capitate cels the bulbous because they

5294
03:39:50,719 --> 03:39:54,760
don't have a stock although they do sit

5295
03:39:52,799 --> 03:39:56,799
on a single stpe cell you can't really

5296
03:39:54,760 --> 03:39:59,920
see it with the naked eye or even a

5297
03:39:56,799 --> 03:40:02,799
microscope uh you end up uh they don't

5298
03:39:59,920 --> 03:40:04,840
release as easy they don't come off and

5299
03:40:02,799 --> 03:40:08,238
what I noticed as a hash maker that when

5300
03:40:04,840 --> 03:40:10,880
I isolated them and and did get them off

5301
03:40:08,238 --> 03:40:13,359
uh they weren't good they were like not

5302
03:40:10,879 --> 03:40:17,519
what I would consider like highquality

5303
03:40:13,359 --> 03:40:19,840
inhalable uh Tricom heads um I I also

5304
03:40:17,520 --> 03:40:22,000
believe this is my own complete and

5305
03:40:19,840 --> 03:40:25,840
total Theory and it may be just cocky

5306
03:40:22,000 --> 03:40:28,120
Pock um but when I ran cultivars through

5307
03:40:25,840 --> 03:40:30,880
Dry sifting or wet washing that were CBD

5308
03:40:28,120 --> 03:40:32,680
dominant the yields were incredibly low

5309
03:40:30,879 --> 03:40:35,920
uh and I always thought that was because

5310
03:40:32,680 --> 03:40:38,639
a they were 50 plus percent bulbous

5311
03:40:35,920 --> 03:40:41,840
heads under a microscope I was thinking

5312
03:40:38,639 --> 03:40:43,959
that's where that CBD was uh in in those

5313
03:40:41,840 --> 03:40:47,680
uh in those

5314
03:40:43,959 --> 03:40:52,159
heads when and I did dry sift and water

5315
03:40:47,680 --> 03:40:54,040
hash uh with uh CBD varieties cuz we

5316
03:40:52,159 --> 03:40:57,840
developed the world's first CBD

5317
03:40:54,040 --> 03:41:01,000
varieties they uh they all consistently

5318
03:40:57,840 --> 03:41:01,000
yielded lower for

5319
03:41:01,879 --> 03:41:07,000
me yeah I mean obviously with a solvent

5320
03:41:04,559 --> 03:41:09,000
or CO2 or some other way you can get

5321
03:41:07,000 --> 03:41:11,680
those it was also kind of what led me to

5322
03:41:09,000 --> 03:41:14,120
that theory was the BHO Community

5323
03:41:11,680 --> 03:41:16,040
obviously I would I always had huge

5324
03:41:14,120 --> 03:41:17,840
interactions with the B ho o Community

5325
03:41:16,040 --> 03:41:19,760
people would be like you know I ran this

5326
03:41:17,840 --> 03:41:21,559
and got like a this is back in the dry

5327
03:41:19,760 --> 03:41:23,318
Days by the way we weren't running fresh

5328
03:41:21,559 --> 03:41:26,719
frozen yet people would be like oh I got

5329
03:41:23,318 --> 03:41:29,359
like a 133% yield when I made water hash

5330
03:41:26,719 --> 03:41:31,959
out of it but I got a 24% yield when I

5331
03:41:29,359 --> 03:41:33,920
made oil out of it so it's like oil wins

5332
03:41:31,959 --> 03:41:35,879
I'm doing oil I was like all right well

5333
03:41:33,920 --> 03:41:38,040
that's [ __ ] interesting and I try to

5334
03:41:35,879 --> 03:41:41,438
figure it out and it's kind of what led

5335
03:41:38,040 --> 03:41:44,880
me to looking for hash making cultivars

5336
03:41:41,439 --> 03:41:47,439
that had less of a vis visual production

5337
03:41:44,879 --> 03:41:49,719
of bulbus heads if I had my microscope

5338
03:41:47,439 --> 03:41:51,920
out and it was just stacks of of

5339
03:41:49,719 --> 03:41:54,438
capitates and cils I'd be like that's

5340
03:41:51,920 --> 03:41:56,760
the plant for me uh you know nine out of

5341
03:41:54,439 --> 03:41:58,840
10 times anyway and if it had a super

5342
03:41:56,760 --> 03:42:00,880
high percentage of bulbous heads I just

5343
03:41:58,840 --> 03:42:02,478
found that I didn't get the yields and

5344
03:42:00,879 --> 03:42:06,920
the yields that I did get just weren't

5345
03:42:02,478 --> 03:42:10,639
as juicy and as as melty as um the ones

5346
03:42:06,920 --> 03:42:13,478
I got from I I constantly selected four

5347
03:42:10,639 --> 03:42:16,318
as big a heads as possible but on the

5348
03:42:13,478 --> 03:42:17,719
end of a stem

5349
03:42:16,318 --> 03:42:19,680
yeah absolutely well I'll tell you

5350
03:42:17,719 --> 03:42:22,478
something and I've said it before and

5351
03:42:19,680 --> 03:42:24,158
I'm not blowing smoke up his ass I've

5352
03:42:22,478 --> 03:42:27,719
never smoked anything stronger than

5353
03:42:24,158 --> 03:42:30,478
skunkman Sam's skunk number one pure dry

5354
03:42:27,719 --> 03:42:32,840
sip that [ __ ] like it almost knocked me

5355
03:42:30,478 --> 03:42:34,959
out of my Consciousness I almost left my

5356
03:42:32,840 --> 03:42:37,158
body and I remember trying very hard I

5357
03:42:34,959 --> 03:42:39,158
was like I can't pass out at Sam's house

5358
03:42:37,158 --> 03:42:41,000
I better not [ __ ] myself I hope I don't

5359
03:42:39,158 --> 03:42:42,398
puke like these were legitimate thoughts

5360
03:42:41,000 --> 03:42:43,799
going through my head when he first

5361
03:42:42,398 --> 03:42:46,358
invited me over and was like here have a

5362
03:42:43,799 --> 03:42:48,278
bong RP and he's definitely trying to

5363
03:42:46,359 --> 03:42:51,040
destroy me like this was Sam's nature

5364
03:42:48,279 --> 03:42:52,720
back then 1,000% he loaded that [ __ ]

5365
03:42:51,040 --> 03:42:54,880
thing up fired it up with a couple of

5366
03:42:52,719 --> 03:42:57,000
matches he was looking for utter and

5367
03:42:54,879 --> 03:42:58,478
complete destruction Sher probably had a

5368
03:42:57,000 --> 03:43:00,478
camera hidden under the cushion to

5369
03:42:58,478 --> 03:43:03,079
record it all once I [ __ ] shimmed and

5370
03:43:00,478 --> 03:43:04,959
had a seizure on his uh uh living room

5371
03:43:03,079 --> 03:43:07,920
floor you give me some bit if you give

5372
03:43:04,959 --> 03:43:09,719
me some Bitcoin I won't put it public

5373
03:43:07,920 --> 03:43:11,439
and I'll tell you the day after I was at

5374
03:43:09,719 --> 03:43:14,079
his house the first time I was at the

5375
03:43:11,439 --> 03:43:15,600
milk V at with at my booth and I don't

5376
03:43:14,079 --> 03:43:18,920
know if you remember this there was a

5377
03:43:15,600 --> 03:43:21,120
guy next to me selling selfemployed hemp

5378
03:43:18,920 --> 03:43:23,520
ployed t-shirts he was a dude from

5379
03:43:21,120 --> 03:43:25,640
America I can't remember where but Sam

5380
03:43:23,520 --> 03:43:27,399
stopped by he was like hey you want to

5381
03:43:25,639 --> 03:43:29,318
smoke some hash yeah of course gave me

5382
03:43:27,398 --> 03:43:31,079
another rip I took a big rip this guy

5383
03:43:29,318 --> 03:43:33,519
took a rip and this guy was no

5384
03:43:31,079 --> 03:43:35,840
lightweight this guy hit the floor so

5385
03:43:33,520 --> 03:43:38,720
hard and shook for like five to eight

5386
03:43:35,840 --> 03:43:40,760
seconds before he got up oh yeah Selena

5387
03:43:38,719 --> 03:43:42,478
this was like happening for real he got

5388
03:43:40,760 --> 03:43:44,199
back up and he was pale white and he

5389
03:43:42,478 --> 03:43:46,478
looked at Sam and he was like I want you

5390
03:43:44,199 --> 03:43:49,640
to do that to this guy and I remember

5391
03:43:46,478 --> 03:43:51,318
Sam was like no you can't do that to him

5392
03:43:49,639 --> 03:43:53,799
and I a couple of my buddies were like

5393
03:43:51,318 --> 03:43:55,600
did you hear what Sam said dude that was

5394
03:43:53,799 --> 03:43:58,278
legendary like back in the day this is

5395
03:43:55,600 --> 03:43:59,680
like 20 some odd years ago that was like

5396
03:43:58,279 --> 03:44:02,279
that meant something to me I was like I

5397
03:43:59,680 --> 03:44:05,000
felt like I earned a stripe on my belt

5398
03:44:02,279 --> 03:44:06,960
because uh and after that I will tell

5399
03:44:05,000 --> 03:44:08,840
you that I I cannot count how many

5400
03:44:06,959 --> 03:44:10,879
people I knocked unconscious with bubble

5401
03:44:08,840 --> 03:44:14,040
hash at the Cannabis Cup it was a weird

5402
03:44:10,879 --> 03:44:15,839
time where yeah there was oil but oil

5403
03:44:14,040 --> 03:44:17,720
was made by a weird guy with dirty

5404
03:44:15,840 --> 03:44:19,639
fingernails in his garage and no one

5405
03:44:17,719 --> 03:44:22,478
ever got to see the process and it was

5406
03:44:19,639 --> 03:44:24,398
just like the 70s and the 80s oil guys

5407
03:44:22,478 --> 03:44:26,278
it came in a bottle cap and sometimes

5408
03:44:24,398 --> 03:44:29,439
they didn't even take the plastic out it

5409
03:44:26,279 --> 03:44:31,199
wasn't good this was way before BHO days

5410
03:44:29,439 --> 03:44:33,318
hit and that people were like excited

5411
03:44:31,199 --> 03:44:35,520
about oil so really the strongest you

5412
03:44:33,318 --> 03:44:37,600
could get unless you were skunkman Sam

5413
03:44:35,520 --> 03:44:39,560
was like some shitty you know single

5414
03:44:37,600 --> 03:44:43,399
screen Farmers hash that was

5415
03:44:39,559 --> 03:44:46,119
like honey oil in the 70s from

5416
03:44:43,398 --> 03:44:48,760
Afghanistan it was rare

5417
03:44:46,120 --> 03:44:50,079
potent it was rare here you know the

5418
03:44:48,760 --> 03:44:51,639
fact that someone went there and knew

5419
03:44:50,079 --> 03:44:53,359
what they were doing and filtered that

5420
03:44:51,639 --> 03:44:55,238
through probably with like activated

5421
03:44:53,359 --> 03:44:56,880
charcoal or something to like clean that

5422
03:44:55,238 --> 03:44:58,398
color out I don't know maybe they used

5423
03:44:56,879 --> 03:45:02,278
cold solvents and they had some of the

5424
03:44:58,398 --> 03:45:04,519
tricks but in in in Manitoba in the 70s

5425
03:45:02,279 --> 03:45:07,238
and 80s like you got some hash you saw

5426
03:45:04,520 --> 03:45:09,960
hash from those countries um but

5427
03:45:07,238 --> 03:45:12,600
generally there was nothing like bubble

5428
03:45:09,959 --> 03:45:15,398
has available to the masses and bubble

5429
03:45:12,600 --> 03:45:16,840
has and BHO basically came out within a

5430
03:45:15,398 --> 03:45:19,318
couple of months of one another so

5431
03:45:16,840 --> 03:45:22,199
suddenly but bubble hash is what really

5432
03:45:19,318 --> 03:45:24,760
changed the world because people still

5433
03:45:22,199 --> 03:45:26,880
didn't know about the static Tech so

5434
03:45:24,760 --> 03:45:29,439
they weren't able to create the dry SI

5435
03:45:26,879 --> 03:45:32,039
as as high quality as you and I know how

5436
03:45:29,439 --> 03:45:34,439
to make no they that's true and you're

5437
03:45:32,040 --> 03:45:38,319
the anomaly of growing exceptional flour

5438
03:45:34,439 --> 03:45:40,639
that process works really only best with

5439
03:45:38,318 --> 03:45:43,000
exceptional flower and as you use flow

5440
03:45:40,639 --> 03:45:45,198
that's less than exceptional the process

5441
03:45:43,000 --> 03:45:47,398
seems less and less magical and less

5442
03:45:45,199 --> 03:45:49,158
exceptional whereas when you do it with

5443
03:45:47,398 --> 03:45:51,920
like you what you were growing in your

5444
03:45:49,158 --> 03:45:54,520
Greenhouse holy [ __ ] dude the amount of

5445
03:45:51,920 --> 03:45:57,279
heads stuck to the hand the purity of

5446
03:45:54,520 --> 03:45:59,199
those heads was absolutely insane that

5447
03:45:57,279 --> 03:46:01,880
changed the game dude because I don't

5448
03:45:59,199 --> 03:46:05,520
even think I took macro photographs of

5449
03:46:01,879 --> 03:46:08,039
pure bubble hash before those pure dry

5450
03:46:05,520 --> 03:46:10,560
sift hash shots water has changed the

5451
03:46:08,040 --> 03:46:13,000
game CU you could get it to

5452
03:46:10,559 --> 03:46:14,398
Bubble absolutely it definitely did I

5453
03:46:13,000 --> 03:46:17,079
won't say that it didn't but this

5454
03:46:14,398 --> 03:46:19,478
picture the first time I shared it in

5455
03:46:17,079 --> 03:46:21,719
2008 nobody could [ __ ] believe it

5456
03:46:19,478 --> 03:46:24,238
dude they were just like what the actual

5457
03:46:21,719 --> 03:46:27,119
[ __ ] and that's some proper skunkman Sam

5458
03:46:24,238 --> 03:46:29,198
skunk number one like pure dry sift tiny

5459
03:46:27,120 --> 03:46:31,479
little bit of stalks he probably only

5460
03:46:29,199 --> 03:46:33,800
did like three or four passes you can

5461
03:46:31,478 --> 03:46:36,840
tell yeah it's well cured exactly

5462
03:46:33,799 --> 03:46:41,238
because otherwise instead of handling

5463
03:46:36,840 --> 03:46:43,719
grapes you hand to handle oil that was

5464
03:46:41,238 --> 03:46:46,760
smear and it's

5465
03:46:43,719 --> 03:46:48,599
horrible yeah no I agree but that that

5466
03:46:46,760 --> 03:46:50,079
photo was a game changer for people no

5467
03:46:48,600 --> 03:46:52,960
one would stop thinking about the

5468
03:46:50,079 --> 03:46:54,719
process for a decade the whole the photo

5469
03:46:52,959 --> 03:46:56,839
was definitely a part of how people

5470
03:46:54,719 --> 03:47:00,478
eventually kind of got on to it and

5471
03:46:56,840 --> 03:47:02,960
figured it out with guys like uh tan and

5472
03:47:00,478 --> 03:47:05,039
and M who was one of the first to really

5473
03:47:02,959 --> 03:47:08,478
sort of show it with the uh parchment

5474
03:47:05,040 --> 03:47:10,080
wrapped around the DVD case uh d420 K

5475
03:47:08,478 --> 03:47:12,198
was a part of it it was a whole group of

5476
03:47:10,079 --> 03:47:15,318
people just playing around and focusing

5477
03:47:12,199 --> 03:47:17,239
and and enjoying these these discoveries

5478
03:47:15,318 --> 03:47:20,238
and I wonder sometimes you know that was

5479
03:47:17,238 --> 03:47:21,959
an accidental Discovery these sometimes

5480
03:47:20,238 --> 03:47:23,719
these accidental discoveries are just

5481
03:47:21,959 --> 03:47:26,119
the greatest thing that you could

5482
03:47:23,719 --> 03:47:30,438
possibly ask for I'll never forget was

5483
03:47:26,120 --> 03:47:34,319
it an accidental Discovery right but the

5484
03:47:30,439 --> 03:47:38,120
guy who was actually doing the work uh

5485
03:47:34,318 --> 03:47:40,639
with his hand that it was the the the

5486
03:47:38,120 --> 03:47:44,040
high quality tricomes were sticking to

5487
03:47:40,639 --> 03:47:45,680
his hand from static Tech he didn't even

5488
03:47:44,040 --> 03:47:49,239
realize it

5489
03:47:45,680 --> 03:47:52,359
I saw it I realized it and I went back

5490
03:47:49,238 --> 03:47:54,879
to Amsterdam and wham bam I had it

5491
03:47:52,359 --> 03:47:56,238
working really good really fast well

5492
03:47:54,879 --> 03:47:58,238
I'll tell you how that changed my

5493
03:47:56,238 --> 03:48:00,158
perspective when you finally broke down

5494
03:47:58,238 --> 03:48:02,000
and showed me that and I hope I didn't

5495
03:48:00,158 --> 03:48:04,439
bug you too much for you to do so

5496
03:48:02,000 --> 03:48:07,158
because I always tried to show respect

5497
03:48:04,439 --> 03:48:08,439
um no I I wanted to tell you just in

5498
03:48:07,158 --> 03:48:11,439
case I

5499
03:48:08,439 --> 03:48:14,079
died I want to make sure somebody would

5500
03:48:11,439 --> 03:48:16,040
pass it on well I deeply appreciate to

5501
03:48:14,079 --> 03:48:19,318
being that guy dude because that day in

5502
03:48:16,040 --> 03:48:22,080
your house was a mindblower and when I

5503
03:48:19,318 --> 03:48:24,119
saw that I I just started going down

5504
03:48:22,079 --> 03:48:27,439
this Rabbit Hole I was like oh my God

5505
03:48:24,120 --> 03:48:30,199
like there are great secrets out there

5506
03:48:27,439 --> 03:48:32,199
that people hold that because of it it

5507
03:48:30,199 --> 03:48:34,359
change it it can change the way you live

5508
03:48:32,199 --> 03:48:36,399
if you knew that secret and it really

5509
03:48:34,359 --> 03:48:38,079
opened me up to this like that there's

5510
03:48:36,398 --> 03:48:41,079
way more going on in the world that

5511
03:48:38,079 --> 03:48:42,840
people could possibly understand it's

5512
03:48:41,079 --> 03:48:45,000
not until you learn one of these very

5513
03:48:42,840 --> 03:48:48,199
very simple secrets that really nobody

5514
03:48:45,000 --> 03:48:50,398
knows that you realize like holy [ __ ]

5515
03:48:48,199 --> 03:48:52,199
like this is crazy there's definitely

5516
03:48:50,398 --> 03:48:55,000
great secrets out there you know this is

5517
03:48:52,199 --> 03:48:57,279
kind of metaphorically that are just if

5518
03:48:55,000 --> 03:48:58,639
we could discover them it would change

5519
03:48:57,279 --> 03:49:01,199
everything it would change our

5520
03:48:58,639 --> 03:49:03,358
conversations it would change you know

5521
03:49:01,199 --> 03:49:06,239
our understanding and it would change

5522
03:49:03,359 --> 03:49:07,880
and pivot our Pathways it certainly

5523
03:49:06,238 --> 03:49:10,680
changed mind we're learning about the

5524
03:49:07,879 --> 03:49:14,278
canabo pretty good I think it's the

5525
03:49:10,680 --> 03:49:18,079
tping canono combination that will

5526
03:49:14,279 --> 03:49:22,359
really be interesting the next uh step

5527
03:49:18,079 --> 03:49:26,039
well that and stuff like crisper and uh

5528
03:49:22,359 --> 03:49:29,680
double haids I mean scientific breeding

5529
03:49:26,040 --> 03:49:31,840
will lead the future uh doesn't mean

5530
03:49:29,680 --> 03:49:35,800
everybody has to smoke a scientifically

5531
03:49:31,840 --> 03:49:38,680
bread plant uh but uh it will be The

5532
03:49:35,799 --> 03:49:40,438
Cutting Edge well and you know what as

5533
03:49:38,680 --> 03:49:42,880
you say it will be The Cutting Edge it

5534
03:49:40,439 --> 03:49:45,680
may very well be but today The Cutting

5535
03:49:42,879 --> 03:49:47,839
Edge is [ __ ] Edgar Compton in his

5536
03:49:45,680 --> 03:49:49,559
backyard [ __ ] tossing seeds down like

5537
03:49:47,840 --> 03:49:52,920
a [ __ ] telling everyone it's

5538
03:49:49,559 --> 03:49:55,158
cliche man but just [ __ ] do it that

5539
03:49:52,920 --> 03:49:57,680
is The Cutting Edge today no matter what

5540
03:49:55,158 --> 03:49:59,920
anyone says put those flavors against

5541
03:49:57,680 --> 03:50:00,960
anything anyone's done with a crisper or

5542
03:49:59,920 --> 03:50:04,520
any other

5543
03:50:00,959 --> 03:50:06,679
scientific uh uh process and they don't

5544
03:50:04,520 --> 03:50:09,720
they just don't hold up right now so for

5545
03:50:06,680 --> 03:50:13,398
now Edgar you

5546
03:50:09,719 --> 03:50:17,398
win Ed and because of it we win how many

5547
03:50:13,398 --> 03:50:17,398
seeds do you produce in a

5548
03:50:20,478 --> 03:50:27,959
year you're muted Edgar so so any so

5549
03:50:25,439 --> 03:50:29,960
like I'm allocated to so much space and

5550
03:50:27,959 --> 03:50:32,398
like when I do a pollination you know

5551
03:50:29,959 --> 03:50:35,519
it's just gung-ho let it let it hit

5552
03:50:32,398 --> 03:50:38,799
everything so it's it's it's it's not

5553
03:50:35,520 --> 03:50:40,279
like you know on on it's a lot of seeds

5554
03:50:38,799 --> 03:50:41,719
it's a lot of seeds I don't have a

5555
03:50:40,279 --> 03:50:43,319
number I don't know how many plants I

5556
03:50:41,719 --> 03:50:46,079
have at any given moment I'm I just

5557
03:50:43,318 --> 03:50:48,398
always I'm always popping always cloning

5558
03:50:46,079 --> 03:50:50,279
uh so it's a lot of seeds it's a lot of

5559
03:50:48,398 --> 03:50:52,599
seeds I I don't have a number for it I

5560
03:50:50,279 --> 03:50:55,319
honestly don't I made an average of five

5561
03:50:52,600 --> 03:50:57,880
or 10 million a year that's that's

5562
03:50:55,318 --> 03:51:00,198
massive I I probably don't even for

5563
03:50:57,879 --> 03:51:02,039
decades I don't probably make a million

5564
03:51:00,199 --> 03:51:04,399
a year it's I'm only I only do it in my

5565
03:51:02,040 --> 03:51:06,239
backyard so we'll probably make like uh

5566
03:51:04,398 --> 03:51:08,920
every year we probably make like

5567
03:51:06,238 --> 03:51:12,279
250,000 to 500,000 or something like

5568
03:51:08,920 --> 03:51:15,040
that just like I gave a lot away and I

5569
03:51:12,279 --> 03:51:16,960
sold them all for less than 10 cents

5570
03:51:15,040 --> 03:51:18,159
beautiful I'm yeah well when you're

5571
03:51:16,959 --> 03:51:20,919
growing five

5572
03:51:18,158 --> 03:51:23,359
million

5573
03:51:20,920 --> 03:51:25,719
yeah yeah that I I I kind of take from

5574
03:51:23,359 --> 03:51:28,920
that Credo where it's all like I I have

5575
03:51:25,719 --> 03:51:31,398
500,000 seeds I don't mind selling them

5576
03:51:28,920 --> 03:51:33,520
for you know you know less than a buck

5577
03:51:31,398 --> 03:51:35,599
of seed sometimes you know and let alone

5578
03:51:33,520 --> 03:51:38,199
the free seed day where it's all like I

5579
03:51:35,600 --> 03:51:40,760
divy up a thousand packages of my own

5580
03:51:38,199 --> 03:51:44,319
gear that I make and I encourage others

5581
03:51:40,760 --> 03:51:46,520
to do the same and we just like all team

5582
03:51:44,318 --> 03:51:49,680
up and we just give away seeds and we

5583
03:51:46,520 --> 03:51:51,520
revolve a day around it so I take a a

5584
03:51:49,680 --> 03:51:54,559
page out of both of those and you know

5585
03:51:51,520 --> 03:51:58,600
respects to the ogs for sure I used to

5586
03:51:54,559 --> 03:52:01,639
walk in the Million Man March in uh

5587
03:51:58,600 --> 03:52:04,199
Amsterdam and I would take a kilo or two

5588
03:52:01,639 --> 03:52:06,439
kilos of my skunk seeds and hand them

5589
03:52:04,199 --> 03:52:09,158
out to anybody that wanted them along

5590
03:52:06,439 --> 03:52:12,120
the way and all the time I would hear

5591
03:52:09,158 --> 03:52:15,398
people in Dutch saying oh these can't be

5592
03:52:12,120 --> 03:52:18,159
good they must be hen up seeds and uh

5593
03:52:15,398 --> 03:52:20,840
I'd answer them no no they're skunk

5594
03:52:18,158 --> 03:52:23,840
number one I'm the skunk man and you

5595
03:52:20,840 --> 03:52:27,158
just got handed a billion for the seed

5596
03:52:23,840 --> 03:52:29,158
have fun that's dope that's super cool

5597
03:52:27,158 --> 03:52:30,478
what do you got there Mojave uh I just

5598
03:52:29,158 --> 03:52:32,600
wanted to show you guys this plant since

5599
03:52:30,478 --> 03:52:36,358
we were talking about breeding and stuff

5600
03:52:32,600 --> 03:52:39,199
um so Jim Goodwin gave me some uh Mel

5601
03:52:36,359 --> 03:52:42,040
Frank gave me some flour couple years

5602
03:52:39,199 --> 03:52:43,880
ago five years ago or so this Cambodian

5603
03:52:42,040 --> 03:52:45,760
which I really enjoyed it was really

5604
03:52:43,879 --> 03:52:47,639
nice someone had given it to him and he

5605
03:52:45,760 --> 03:52:49,600
trusted the source it was pretty

5606
03:52:47,639 --> 03:52:53,238
interesting unique flower very

5607
03:52:49,600 --> 03:52:55,640
equatorial the way the the plant grew um

5608
03:52:53,238 --> 03:52:57,279
and uh anyway I liked out smoking it and

5609
03:52:55,639 --> 03:53:00,920
then he he had it tested and it turned

5610
03:52:57,279 --> 03:53:02,680
out it was a one to one uh CBD THC but

5611
03:53:00,920 --> 03:53:05,040
it was a one to one with a really

5612
03:53:02,680 --> 03:53:08,199
interesting kind of narrow Leaf profile

5613
03:53:05,040 --> 03:53:10,760
it wasn't your typical harlean ACDC

5614
03:53:08,199 --> 03:53:13,120
Afghan based one to one so it was a

5615
03:53:10,760 --> 03:53:15,359
really nice refreshing high and anyway

5616
03:53:13,120 --> 03:53:16,760
so I got some seeds out of the flow and

5617
03:53:15,359 --> 03:53:19,000
then he gave me some more seeds and then

5618
03:53:16,760 --> 03:53:21,318
I popped them and I got this one that I

5619
03:53:19,000 --> 03:53:23,840
selected what I really liked but then I

5620
03:53:21,318 --> 03:53:27,278
had one little sport that shot off that

5621
03:53:23,840 --> 03:53:32,359
had this m this mutation that would go

5622
03:53:27,279 --> 03:53:34,720
either fully albino or half and half or

5623
03:53:32,359 --> 03:53:36,279
it would go just really beautiful Mosaic

5624
03:53:34,719 --> 03:53:40,840
which really I like as just an

5625
03:53:36,279 --> 03:53:43,199
ornamental plant um but the cool thing

5626
03:53:40,840 --> 03:53:45,478
is that it's a mutation but it's only in

5627
03:53:43,199 --> 03:53:49,600
the sport right it's only in the

5628
03:53:45,478 --> 03:53:51,079
offshoot so I had cut it off and um put

5629
03:53:49,600 --> 03:53:53,000
it in a glass of water and just was

5630
03:53:51,079 --> 03:53:55,238
leaving there just kind of just looking

5631
03:53:53,000 --> 03:53:57,879
at it on my desk for a couple weeks and

5632
03:53:55,238 --> 03:54:00,359
then I was on a call with Rob and ATN

5633
03:53:57,879 --> 03:54:02,879
and this other plant scientist I'm like

5634
03:54:00,359 --> 03:54:05,238
oh [ __ ] I probably should have cloned

5635
03:54:02,879 --> 03:54:06,799
that huh and and then quickly right

5636
03:54:05,238 --> 03:54:09,318
after the call I went and dipped it in

5637
03:54:06,799 --> 03:54:11,639
some and and I cloned it and it made it

5638
03:54:09,318 --> 03:54:14,398
after weeks of just sitting in water so

5639
03:54:11,639 --> 03:54:17,079
now I have this mutation which

5640
03:54:14,398 --> 03:54:21,119
consistently will show this weird

5641
03:54:17,079 --> 03:54:23,799
variegation and Mosaic and albinism but

5642
03:54:21,120 --> 03:54:26,359
it's only in this sport so I have I have

5643
03:54:23,799 --> 03:54:29,679
this cloned in other versions that are

5644
03:54:26,359 --> 03:54:31,158
just completely green um but anyway I

5645
03:54:29,680 --> 03:54:33,238
just love it just because for as an

5646
03:54:31,158 --> 03:54:35,559
ornamental plant or as an interesting

5647
03:54:33,238 --> 03:54:38,840
just what cannabis can do and how many

5648
03:54:35,559 --> 03:54:40,318
plants come from sports like if in the

5649
03:54:38,840 --> 03:54:43,520
wine industry you know all the penino

5650
03:54:40,318 --> 03:54:47,198
ggio and all the white penino plants are

5651
03:54:43,520 --> 03:54:49,319
Pino Noir that stopped producing pigment

5652
03:54:47,199 --> 03:54:51,840
or that particular pigment and became a

5653
03:54:49,318 --> 03:54:53,719
new mutation which became a new clone

5654
03:54:51,840 --> 03:54:55,680
which eventually was reproduced millions

5655
03:54:53,719 --> 03:54:57,760
and millions and millions of times so

5656
03:54:55,680 --> 03:54:59,920
that's just the fun part of breeding and

5657
03:54:57,760 --> 03:55:04,040
selection where you get little weird

5658
03:54:59,920 --> 03:55:05,639
little mutations well looks like a HP

5659
03:55:04,040 --> 03:55:08,600
vroid but

5660
03:55:05,639 --> 03:55:10,398
not yeah no no exactly it's not no it's

5661
03:55:08,600 --> 03:55:13,399
a mosaic I mean it reminds me of like a

5662
03:55:10,398 --> 03:55:16,278
cadium or other ornamental plants and

5663
03:55:13,398 --> 03:55:20,318
stuff like that but yeah maybe maybe the

5664
03:55:16,279 --> 03:55:23,680
virus is mosaic virus causing the spot

5665
03:55:20,318 --> 03:55:27,639
the spark the leaves that are not white

5666
03:55:23,680 --> 03:55:30,000
or green but mixed yeah exactly and the

5667
03:55:27,639 --> 03:55:33,158
the thing is when I made the Clones the

5668
03:55:30,000 --> 03:55:34,478
ones that had too much uh too yellow

5669
03:55:33,158 --> 03:55:37,279
they just don't root because there's no

5670
03:55:34,478 --> 03:55:39,519
chlorophyll they just wi in the

5671
03:55:37,279 --> 03:55:41,720
propagator so you can only when you're

5672
03:55:39,520 --> 03:55:43,960
collecting your next Generation every

5673
03:55:41,719 --> 03:55:47,318
time you got to collect one that has a

5674
03:55:43,959 --> 03:55:49,079
little bit like these ones on top here

5675
03:55:47,318 --> 03:55:51,318
and a little green and a little yellow

5676
03:55:49,079 --> 03:55:53,359
but if I collected from this Branch it

5677
03:55:51,318 --> 03:55:56,600
would just go back to just being green

5678
03:55:53,359 --> 03:55:58,399
again so or or possibly going back to

5679
03:55:56,600 --> 03:56:01,120
being green anyway it's just it's a yeah

5680
03:55:58,398 --> 03:56:03,559
funny and it's also um Sam you might

5681
03:56:01,120 --> 03:56:06,040
like this it's yellow stem halfway

5682
03:56:03,559 --> 03:56:08,000
yellow stem so you can see on the line

5683
03:56:06,040 --> 03:56:11,600
it's yellow stem on one side and then

5684
03:56:08,000 --> 03:56:15,120
green on the other as that's pretty cool

5685
03:56:11,600 --> 03:56:15,120
for Dr Bo

5686
03:56:15,199 --> 03:56:21,120

you for growing this beautiful plant and

5699
03:56:43,439 --> 03:56:46,398
for sharing the seed seeds and for those

5700
03:56:44,879 --> 03:56:48,398
of you that are watching please share as

5701
03:56:46,398 --> 03:56:50,318
many seeds as you possibly can I know

5702
03:56:48,398 --> 03:56:52,119
the spirit of this plant is with us all

5703
03:56:50,318 --> 03:56:54,318
and I think it's just really cool that

5704

um we're just so inspired to share so

5705
03:56:54,318 --> 03:56:58,079
free seed day I feel like we should do

5706
03:56:56,040 --> 03:57:00,199
that every day um but just thank you

5707

to get you back as well [ __ ] every

5733
03:58:00,000 --> 03:58:03,719
anytime you're doing a new release or

5734
03:58:02,000 --> 03:58:05,359
you know you got something new on the go

5735
03:58:03,719 --> 03:58:08,158
which sounds like every minute of every

5736
03:58:05,359 --> 03:58:10,120
day uh just [ __ ] come by and and

5737
03:58:08,158 --> 03:58:12,199
share with us man everyone love to have

5738
03:58:10,120 --> 03:58:14,359
you next time if you do come in try to

5739
03:58:12,199 --> 03:58:16,800
come in on a computer it makes it easier

5740
03:58:14,359 --> 03:58:18,760
then you can also open up the YouTube uh

5741
03:58:16,799 --> 03:58:20,799
live because people were asking

5742
03:58:18,760 --> 03:58:22,840
questions and talking about your packs

5743
03:58:20,799 --> 03:58:26,039
in there and uh I think you would have

5744
03:58:22,840 --> 03:58:28,398
done quite well to uh engage in the chat

5745
03:58:26,040 --> 03:58:30,159
while you weren't talking in this

5746
03:58:28,398 --> 03:58:32,639
particular chat so we'll get you on

5747
03:58:30,158 --> 03:58:34,760

coming out you know I really appreciate

5749
03:58:34,760 --> 03:58:39,478
everyone and uh I appreciate all the

5750
03:58:37,040 --> 03:58:41,319
people we have 265 people we got almost

5751
03:58:39,478 --> 03:58:42,840
everyone that was watching live back

5752
03:58:41,318 --> 03:58:45,478
over the course of the last couple of

5753
03:58:42,840 --> 03:58:48,079
hours so people do appreciate the

5754
03:58:45,478 --> 03:58:51,519
conversation um I love it I like the

5755
03:58:48,079 --> 03:58:53,799
idea of just uh having everyone open to

5756
03:58:51,520 --> 03:58:56,319
dialogue if I saw one thing during the

5757
03:58:53,799 --> 03:58:58,559
covid-19 lockdowns was that the division

5758
03:58:56,318 --> 03:59:01,719
and the shutting down of a part of the

5759
03:58:58,559 --> 03:59:05,559
conversation in any subject is

5760
03:59:01,719 --> 03:59:07,920
absolutely um detrimental to the to the

5761
03:59:05,559 --> 03:59:09,719
benefit of of humans it's best for us to

5762
03:59:07,920 --> 03:59:11,680
always be able to have these

5763
03:59:09,719 --> 03:59:14,158
conversations whatever they are you may

5764
03:59:11,680 --> 03:59:15,800
not agree with them but uh it's it's

5765
03:59:14,158 --> 03:59:20,000
about learning and I said it earlier in

5766
03:59:15,799 --> 03:59:22,840
chat you know um without free will you

5767
03:59:20,000 --> 03:59:25,040
know you you you can't have just good

5768
03:59:22,840 --> 03:59:28,359
with free will Free Will involves both

5769
03:59:25,040 --> 03:59:30,000
good and bad uh and it's only really our

5770
03:59:28,359 --> 03:59:31,920
perspective that makes them one or the

5771
03:59:30,000 --> 03:59:34,439
other they're a very thin veil they live

5772
03:59:31,920 --> 03:59:36,158
very close together and uh the bottom

5773
03:59:34,439 --> 03:59:38,600
line is is you can't have free will

5774
03:59:36,158 --> 03:59:40,639
without both of them so I appreciate the

5775
03:59:38,600 --> 03:59:42,720
conversation today and the dialogue and

5776
03:59:40,639 --> 03:59:45,000

you guys have a lot of similarities

5798

5800

you're coming from with this process I

5824
04:01:23,120 --> 04:01:28,000
totally respect people's visions of

5825
04:01:25,600 --> 04:01:30,000
being slightly afraid of it and as they

5826
04:01:28,000 --> 04:01:31,199
are with AI and any other change I

5827
04:01:30,000 --> 04:01:32,719
remember when we first came out with

5828
04:01:31,199 --> 04:01:34,760
rosin people said we were ruining the

5829
04:01:32,719 --> 04:01:36,358
resin we were heating it up it's way too

5830
04:01:34,760 --> 04:01:38,439

5837

community and you've helped birth so

5838
04:01:52,600 --> 04:01:57,318
much of so much of what all of us are

5839
04:01:55,000 --> 04:01:59,439
doing uh and I think it's important to

5840
04:01:57,318 --> 04:02:01,519
respect and acknowledge that uh when our

5841
04:01:59,439 --> 04:02:03,600
