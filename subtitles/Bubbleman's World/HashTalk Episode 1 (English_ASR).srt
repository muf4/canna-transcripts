00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,590
of hash talk first episode ever

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,270
on this Friday 4/20 should probably get

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,250
our bombs going because we don't have

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,850
much time I'm going to admit a few

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,189
people into the room and we are gonna

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,429
smoke because it is 4/20 so welcome

12
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:52,920

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,620

beautiful welcome welcome everyone let's

16
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:06,840

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:10,549
shall we super stoked to have you all

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,549
here we've got the best friend farm

19
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:19,460
Scott tasted Cascadia we've got the

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,459
Great Lakes

21
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:29,250
what extractions is in the house brother

22
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:31,140
good to see you man a little bit of

23
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:37,259
noise in the beginning because hey we

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:40,290
can't start a 420 joint like that

25
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,000
chillin like that bowl blast that banger

26
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,490
or whatever it is that you prefer to do

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,799
because we are here to talk about hash

28
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:48,118
today and a lot of people have been

29
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,250
bothering me over the years

30
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,409
what does hash talk in it when is TAS

31
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,709
Church gonna talk about hash I'll admit

32
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,200
we do go off on some crazy tangents the

33
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:00,989
focus on this conversation is going to

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,780
remain hashish related so we were going

35
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:06,118
to talk about all things hash today I

36
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,769
don't have three to four hours to put

37
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,050
into it unfortunately today I got to

38
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,939
drive up to Whistler here in a short

39
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,140
period of time probably an hour and a

40
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:14,939
half maybe is what I could

41
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,859
probably pull off I'm gonna mute

42
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,780
everyone that is not muted because that

43
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,870
makes it so much nicer in my ears not to

44
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,810
have to hear all that stuff and my

45
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:29,909
banger is ready so here we go first show

46
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:33,060
I guess I should share this in the other

47
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:34,020
YouTube chat there we go we'll just put

48
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,689
that in there

49
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:54,660
so they can all come see us over here

50
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:57,120
let's hit it up and yes it's gonna be

51
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:05,099
quiet when I'm taking a rip because wow

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:07,050
it's the one time I can't talk alright

53
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,829
great so let's get right into it

54
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,680
everybody we're not going into a big

55
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,060
introduction let's get heavy ice in here

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:20,430
we got someone else coming in under the

57
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:25,860
name iPad what's going on brother are

58
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:29,700
you doing welcomewelcome that says

59
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,799
what's up Oh what's good what's good

60
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,859
what's good welcome welcome we're just

61
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,110
starting this first episode we got some

62
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,170
new folks in the house coach Kirk is in

63
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,150
the house give you great to see you

64
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:45,208
brother good to see everyone

65
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,739
hell yeah what's good brother I'll tell

66
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,129
you what's good right off the bat is

67
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:53,939
Instagram is good Instagram has brought

68
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:56,549
the hash game to a place where it really

69
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,859
needed to be we started well we started

70
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,250
in caves practically we got onto

71
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,959
websites eventually like overgrow and

72
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,759
cannabis culture and cannabis calm and

73
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,349
cannabis world calm that was kind of a

74
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,750
late eighties scene where you could

75
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:12,259
trade this information but Instagram

76
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,969
really blew it off the hinges

77
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:16,769
being so mainstream of an app and it's

78
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:20,879
really how I met the majority of you

79
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:24,269
guys I asked I asked Instagram to tag

80
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,259
hash makers that would be worthy of a

81
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,689
panel

82
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,639
for hash Church and you guys were guys

83
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,920
and gals were the names that came up and

84
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,289
so we did a little hash church last

85
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,780
Sunday and I felt like we really barely

86
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,600
barely tipped the iceberg in the

87
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:41,069
conversation started going and I we

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,740
squeezed out all the people who were

89
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:45,269
coming in for the rosin panel which

90
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,980
we're gonna do a hash search down the

91
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:49,490
road for that but it really showed me

92
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,560
how much of this conversation is still

93
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:57,240
really urging to happen and I feel that

94
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,610
there is a almost a reamer gence of of

95
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,620
hash making of solvent list extraction

96
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,660
if you will even though it's the

97
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,090
craziest misnomer of a name for us to

98
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,020
use it's them it's the misnomer we use

99
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:11,459
solvent list is what we call I guess

100
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:13,789
petrochemical with extraction free

101
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,870
whereas water is the universal solvent

102
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,580
hydrocarbons which make up the terpenes

103
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,040
of the plant and the building blocks of

104
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:23,069
all the cannabinoids are also solvents

105
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,110
themselves so I want to stay mildly

106
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,819
scientific in the terminology where we

107
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,350
kind of are accurate with the words that

108
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:29,670
we're using but at the same time I

109
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,830
understand that we're still gonna

110
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,629
sometimes called a cultivar a strain and

111
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:35,729
sometimes we're gonna use the

112
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:37,259
terminology solvent list I think it's

113
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,870
the worst just a little bit of a

114
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,909
misnomer so I've got a bit of a list

115
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,620
here guys in regards to kind of

116
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:47,490
conversations I wrote a little bit about

117
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:50,490
I mean as a hash maker if you're the

118
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,900
grower and you are finding the cultivars

119
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,120
and you're finding the fie nose and

120
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:55,889
you're using your olfactory to find that

121
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,439
terpene profile and then you're actually

122
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:00,329
growing it producing and creating the

123
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,060
inputs to grow that plant and then

124
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:05,399
washing it well I mean what can be said

125
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,720
that's just you're you're a rock star if

126
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,699
you're doing all that that's that's

127
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,230
that's the full that's the full meal

128
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,269
deal and that's I have a full

129
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,430
appreciation and a respect for that a

130
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:17,849
lot of hash makers are not that and

131
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,800
that's okay but we do have to sort of

132
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,480
pay attention to probably the most

133
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,069
important thing as a hash maker because

134
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,920
the quality has already been taken care

135
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:27,839
of for us if we're lucky all we really

136
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,480
have to do is isolate it which the

137
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,909
process does very very simply which

138
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,270
becomes then our only job really becomes

139
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,430
to dry it and I'm sure many of you have

140
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:40,889
seen in the years of dry

141
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,509
cannabis you can take beautiful cannabis

142
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,479
and dry it incorrectly cure it

143
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:47,219
incorrectly and and ruin it and really

144
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,520
drop it down multiple grade points I

145
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,320
feel the same is is true for hash so I

146
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,509
thought let's start out the conversation

147
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,370
today with drying weather you guys want

148
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,659
to talk about sieving versus micro

149
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,939
planing whether you want to talk about

150
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,410
air drying versus freeze dryers I'm down

151
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,180
for whatever I just thought that would

152
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,590
be kind of a good starting point as it's

153
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,660
probably one of the most important

154
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:10,799
things as a hash maker if you're not

155
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,380
doing all the other things that I

156
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,379
mentioned the drawing is probably really

157
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:19,610
the most important aspect of what you

158
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:23,459
should be paying attention to totally

159
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:26,220
agreed anyone got any thoughts on how to

160
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:28,259
start that conversation yeah totally I

161
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:33,270
was actually gonna say I got some hand

162
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:34,889
dried hatch right here and there's like

163
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:39,180
such a funny story about it like where

164
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:42,779
it almost died out on my part we're just

165
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,569
the people that are purchasing you know

166
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:49,469
like they just want the freeze-dried

167
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:52,110
because of the look you know but the

168
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,290
hand dried is such a traditional side of

169
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,509
it that I don't want to let go and keep

170
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:00,360
it like keep it around is really I think

171
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:02,399
important and it shows that somebody

172
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,680
doesn't need to rely on like a machine I

173
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,859
mean having a machine is good at all but

174
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,780
uh one I mean there's just a skill when

175
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,879
you you can use your hands to do the

176
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:15,179
same job type of thing I think it goes

177
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,620
to show that somebody that does do it

178
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,530
obviously is a little bit more like

179
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,180
passionate about it and dedicated to the

180
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:28,289
craft a little bit more which also says

181
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:30,750
a lot too yeah I agree I like that I'm

182
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,420
always a little bit funny about making

183
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,000
any comparisons about who does which in

184
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,769
whatever way I air dry I definitely been

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,620
freeze drying I used three jars at the

186
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:44,939
beginning in 2015 it's been an awful

187
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:47,700
super long time for some of us and I

188
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,310
don't think it indicates anymore I

189
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,940
wasn't more passionate about hash making

190
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:53,529
when I was air drying the

191
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,060
now that I'm freeze-drying or when I go

192
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:56,649
back to your drawing I think that's an

193
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:58,750
irrelevant part in the conversation I

194
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:01,539
think what's really important is I

195
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,460
myself I you know based on what I do I

196
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:05,620
get a lot of cash from a lot of

197
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,350
different people all over the world and

198
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,620
last week Marcus you mentioned that when

199
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:13,210
you had told people mistakenly so you

200
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,190
know roll up the hash a lot of times

201
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,540
people rolling up a sweat and that's

202
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,240
what I'm seeing whether it's

203
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:21,819
freeze-dried people are very much using

204
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,129
very small amount of numbers for their

205
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,140
hours for drying as if that's making

206
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:28,570
their hash any better and at the end of

207
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,279
the day I let you to sit out because I

208
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,110
want to know if I'm gonna write about it

209
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,360
and there's a lot of stuff that's just

210
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,740
not dry so whether you air dry and

211
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,810
you're doing some kind of seven to nine

212
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,279
day process or you live in Colorado and

213
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,409
it's done in three days or you have your

214
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,579
free dry tech dialed in at the end of

215
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:44,439
the day as long as you're putting out

216
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,759
good medicine good recreational whatever

217
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,010
you want to call it as long as it's dry

218
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,139
then it'll be good hash however you do

219
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:52,169
it is no way indicative of what you care

220
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:52,169
about

221
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:00,870
I think the like how the resin was grown

222
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,919
has a lot to do with it too

223
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:07,899
everything to do with it on my in my

224
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:09,639
opinion right I just went when when Kirk

225
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,529
was saying that it kind of reminded me

226
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,659
of like I get asked about macro

227
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:17,980
photography all the time but I do i do

228
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:20,769
my macro photography handheld some of

229
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,050
you do but I don't use a rail system I

230
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:25,419
don't use a tripod

231
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:27,219
I don't like build this giant thing that

232
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:30,129
I'm pushing a button to move my camera

233
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,769
half a millimeter at a time and because

234
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,990
of that I feel that that skill is a real

235
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:38,679
value to photographers to learn before

236
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:41,139
they get a rail system and I kind of

237
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,479
attributed to cush Kirk saying what he

238
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:45,639
said in a very much like I understood

239
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,430
what he meant by that like yeah there is

240
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:50,889
something about you know not all of us

241
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:53,229
are selling hash first of all it's not

242
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:55,179
all what everyone is just making hash to

243
00:10:53,230 --> 00:11:05,139
sell it to people some of us are just

244
00:10:55,179 --> 00:11:05,649
hash makers okay I mean truthfully okay

245
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,119
you know

246
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,129
don't have any issue about passion but

247
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:11,559
I'm saying we have a tendency to divide

248
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:12,909
ourselves when we're like oh I do it

249
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:14,259
this way I do it that way and this way

250
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:15,938
is better than that way at the end of

251
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:25,209
the day we will all want to provide good

252
00:11:15,938 --> 00:11:27,068
medicine more than I had to shoulders

253
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,688
from injury from 20 years ago that

254
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:31,178
doesn't necessarily mean anything so

255
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:34,149
sometimes you know I do believe I do

256
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:38,619
believe that we should display skill no

257
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:40,629
matter what we should be able to like

258
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:42,850
make hats in the bushes as long as we

259
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:45,069
can get some ice and water you know I

260
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,720
mean I definitely believe that but those

261
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:48,549
who have decided to go through the

262
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,528
machines especially when you're doing

263
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:59,828
large large batches I don't think we

264
00:11:50,528 --> 00:12:01,480
should look down on them at all when you

265
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:19,240
push a few buttons it's a lot easier

266
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:23,499
than doing it by hand you got to learn

267
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:26,230
to like do it through losing a lot like

268
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:28,240
I've lost a lot of yeah that's how you

269
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,649
learn you don't really learn just by

270
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,058
getting [ __ ] handed to you on a silver

271
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:41,470
platter these days I mean if you do well

272
00:12:34,058 --> 00:12:43,120
they so you only understood certain

273
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,649
cultivars in certain situations and

274
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,328
that's why when something came out

275
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:49,600
totally different you just didn't know

276
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:50,948
what to do right Oh 1,000% 1,000% people

277
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,178
gonna open up their eyes and know the

278
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:53,708
plant before they even start working

279
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:55,600
with it on a detailed level like we're

280
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:58,419
talking about it's like and that's the

281
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,149
thing nobody really does they all just

282
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:03,519
jump to you know 0 to 100 real quick and

283
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:06,220
try to get that money so I just don't

284
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:10,028
think that sometimes people necessarily

285
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,470
do take those steps that are required I

286
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:13,298
think that will make you

287
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,920
I think I'm not just a better hash maker

288
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:17,078
but more knowledgeable in the plant and

289
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,759
more understanding and not get

290
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:20,679
frustrated when she don't go writers

291
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,360
you know don't blame somebody else like

292
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:25,839
the grower or something you know like

293
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,930
there's so many variables yeah I like I

294
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:33,360
like the idea of being able to finesse

295
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:36,039
the resin through a sieve by hand

296
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:42,659
you know observing everything you're

297
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:45,129
doing and just like observing the resin

298
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:47,259
throughout the drying process and

299
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:49,179
obviously like you said there are times

300
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:52,330
that you know when you don't have the

301
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:55,239
process down pat that it gets too warm

302
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:57,220
in the room or too humid in the room and

303
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,560
something happens to the resin and it's

304
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:04,529
kind of interesting to see you know what

305
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:07,689
what happens and obviously change that

306
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:09,750
but I love I liked the idea I used to

307
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,040
microplane but I like the idea of

308
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:16,269
finessing it through a through a sieve

309
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:19,480
and that's what we do can you guys hear

310
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:21,850
me yes okay yeah I would agree with that

311
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,759
as well I have always loved sieving the

312
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:27,639
hash micro planing was something that we

313
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,580
kind of discovered when we allowed

314
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:33,000
really high quality hash to gum up and

315
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,590
goop up before it was properly sieved

316
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,870
allowing too much water to wick out of

317
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,550
the hash and so we would freeze and we

318
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,409
would microplane and I remember kind of

319
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:43,899
doing it and I'll never forget the day

320
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:45,879
the conversation started like well isn't

321
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:47,439
that shredding the heads this was just

322
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:49,779
right around the time macrophotography

323
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,610
was coming in and people that were doing

324
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:54,579
it were like no no it doesn't shred the

325
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:59,610
heads and the first time I photographed

326
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:03,340
a microplane head I was shocked at how

327
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:05,500
shredded and flayed it was and it made

328
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,899
me understand immediately like well

329
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,080
here's this one more thing like fresh

330
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:13,360
frozen microplane your hash these are

331
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,020
two ways to acquire what I like to call

332
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,750
pro mount your [ __ ] won't melt if it's

333
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,610
dry so you need to well let's run it

334
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,769
fresh maybe we'll save some turps that

335
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,450
will give us that melt that glassy look

336
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:27,309
you know and then it's like oh well

337
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,350
maybe uh maybe if we might proclaim the

338
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:31,569
heads when the flame hits if all that

339
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,080
resin will be already outside of the

340
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,510
head and

341
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,180
appear to be melty er than it actually

342
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:39,819
is now I'm not saying all microplaned

343
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:41,709
hash is that I've seen six target

344
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,810
microplane that drips into a liquid and

345
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:47,170
you know drops right through the

346
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:49,059
tightest of screens but I will say that

347
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:51,610
a lot of people have taken into account

348
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:54,459
both fresh frozen and the microplane

349
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,200
hash to give them an appearance of a

350
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:00,759
hash that's maybe a little bit better

351
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:03,490
than it really is okay jump in on that

352
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,230
just for a second um you know it's

353
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,940
always good that new people are coming

354
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,830
into hash making people should be making

355
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,630
their own medicine top to bottom you

356
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:12,759
know I like super believe that at the

357
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:15,220
same time in the last year I have to

358
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,480
tell you I have met some many movies I'm

359
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,129
somewhat people haven't done a single

360
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,649
run and they're making their first run

361
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:25,090
first run fresh frozen and I just feel

362
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:26,199
like I'm how it's like just messing with

363
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,480
their head or something because they

364
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,160
don't understand that fresh frozen can

365
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,139
be a lot harder and at the same time

366
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,539
they're putting a lot of money on the

367
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:36,399
line but again I wanted to get that into

368
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:38,230
the cloud and be able to flex like

369
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,269
they've done something they jumped in to

370
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,889
do this fresh frozen and like this is

371
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:43,329
for me not about cured versus fresh

372
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:45,129
frozen because I will do both of them

373
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:48,670
but I just feel like people should start

374
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:50,350
off with cured because again as Kirk

375
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:52,899
said you have to be able to be willing

376
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,610
to lose a lot of [ __ ] like lose a lot of

377
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:56,110
[ __ ] in order to be good well I'll tell

378
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,940
you the funniest thing when fresh frozen

379
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,190
happened because I was right in the

380
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,110
middle of it all people going from using

381
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,910
dry material people loved bubble bags

382
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,970
when they use dry material because they

383
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:09,279
got real returns and now they're using

384
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,650
this [ __ ] that's really four times its

385
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,629
weight in water and so like you're lucky

386
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,790
to get a three or a four or a five if

387
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,860
it's really great whereas you know like

388
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:20,859
when you're pulling that actual 5 in

389
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:22,119
dried material that is 20% yield and let

390
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:25,088
me tell you when you pull that out of a

391
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,979
20 micron 20 gallon like 90 micron bag

392
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:29,349
there is something beautiful about that

393
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,870
that just can't be that just can't be

394
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:34,599
compared all the first hash I made was

395
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:36,369
all bone dry material the first full

396
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:39,039
melt I ever made was from bone dry

397
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:42,059
material so now it's not really known in

398
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:45,539
the world of making hash a lot of people

399
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:48,599
are constantly asking is it possible to

400
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:50,639
make like can you use dry material it's

401
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,559
like of course you can use dry material

402
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,140
when it's been grown actually like

403
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,740
baller style and the genetics is super

404
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:01,680
OnPoint that resin shines regardless of

405
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,269
whether it's fresh frozen or and I'm

406
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,490
also like maybe I'm old school but that

407
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:07,049
whole fresh frozen thing and I get the

408
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,019
importance of it for a lot of people

409
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:13,409
these are the very terpenes we cured out

410
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:15,629
of cannabis for decades we cured them so

411
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,120
when we smoked it it wasn't caustic and

412
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,710
harsh and now it seems as though when

413
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:24,179
people take dabs they're looking for a

414
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:26,819
cost of harsh dab my opinion I I see it

415
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,430
a lot out there who would think what's

416
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:31,369
that I agree I mean I was going to say

417
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:35,279
that I agree with that that the cultivar

418
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:38,669
as far as the way we do it is air dried

419
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:41,129
and into a slow and patient here on it

420
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:44,279
to kind of let the resin speak in terms

421
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,960
of its terpene profile really when it

422
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:47,819
comes to how loud it is the deterring

423
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,980
profile we know the resins there and

424
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:52,049
we'll take the time honestly I feel like

425
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,099
the cured resin bubble hash really

426
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:58,139
speaks truth for what the cultivar is

427
00:18:55,099 --> 00:19:01,740
and like I agree with you it's there's a

428
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:04,290
lot of fresh poppin zesty you know I'm

429
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,880
tripping heavy and really isolated in

430
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:08,730
the fresh frozen state which I do a

431
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,350
little fresh frozen work also but our

432
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,839
majority is cured resin because as a

433
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:15,240
breeder into the cultivation to see what

434
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:18,899
the strain really is in its in its

435
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,579
patient true essence and you know that I

436
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,490
believe that's how we like the cured

437
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:25,379
resident let the plant speak and just

438
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:29,900
finish out the full way to maturity it

439
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:33,330
needs to yeah like that

440
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:36,210
welcome Colin and archive Fletcher in

441
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:38,220
the house sup guys thanks for having me

442
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,960
pleasure to be here damn it's because

443
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,299
everybody doing tonight it's been a bit

444
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,579
since I've seen Fletcher like for real

445
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,869
I'm kind of like barely recognizing you

446
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:50,309
but right now man and it's going good

447
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:53,099
Colin thanks for asking and welcome this

448
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:55,558
is this is a great topic I remember when

449
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:57,240
I first got bubble back from you Marcus

450
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:00,028
that was gosh it may be your first set

451
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,909
ever it's the I have that I still have

452
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:07,589
the set it's that long the 25 bag that

453
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:10,860
was soft was it was it pink it was pink

454
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:13,798
man I could probably go and that was

455
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:16,229
that was a 2001 and the reason that bag

456
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:20,509
was pink is it signified the birth of my

457
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:24,538
daughter that's beautiful 18 years old

458
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:28,169
yeah so 18 years years ago you know that

459
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:30,690
was my my first set from you and all I

460
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:32,759
did was washed dried material because at

461
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,590
the time that's all we really we'd never

462
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:37,019
even thought to freeze material it just

463
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:38,849
wasn't in our it would just wasn't in

464
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,700
our thought process at that point in

465
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:43,798
time but you know to to what to the

466
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,740
point the other guy was was making about

467
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:48,628
the dried heads are are really important

468
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,149
to give you a true essence of what that

469
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:54,449
particular progeny can actually do for

470
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:56,489
you long term because drying you know

471
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,080
there's several ways to do all of this

472
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,669
to get to that end goal to get that

473
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,678
maximum terpene profile that you're

474
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:03,299
looking for and there's really no wrong

475
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,179
way to do it but it's just personal

476
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:07,710
preference and I find today I like the

477
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,710
mix of both personally I think that

478
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,480
there's a lot to learn from fresh frozen

479
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,350
and then there's a tremendous to take

480
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,269
away from your dried material but I

481
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:21,928
think right now what I'm doing now is

482
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:24,240
all fresh frozen and I I starting to do

483
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:27,659
drying times and trying to back myself

484
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,909
back into dry material itself and that's

485
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:32,610
that's a long process but it's been

486
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:33,799
really interesting seeing the yields and

487
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:37,229
the results

488
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:39,628
I'm definitely pro both of them I just

489
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,960
definitely say if you really want to see

490
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:45,329
what your resin is made of dry that [ __ ]

491
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,490
out run it through some dry set screens

492
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:49,199
or somewhat some water hash bags and

493
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,599
just you know of course you can do it

494
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,669
fresh through through through bags and

495
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,339
whatnot but it's nice to have it's nice

496
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:57,830
to have that idea of what it can do and

497
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:01,230
there's also something to be said that

498
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:03,329
the way the resin breaks off when it's

499
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,069
been properly cured and when the head

500
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:06,750
has been allowed like stuntman talked

501
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:08,589
about on hash Church lesson they sort of

502
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,869
to raisin out a little bit

503
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:14,168
and to not be that big fresh water

504
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:15,639
balloon but to start you know raising

505
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:18,130
out a little bit and kind of getting

506
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,020
pruned up a little bit in that that just

507
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:23,650
makes it so the head becomes so much

508
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:25,329
easier to snap off and there's you know

509
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,330
something to be said for that as well I

510
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:31,149
think it's a really strange specific to

511
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:33,278
you know more so than I mean there's

512
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,159
certain things that wash ball fresh

513
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:38,558
frozen there's stuff that does well dry

514
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,539
there and in my personal opinion at

515
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:43,418
least is that a lot of it has to do with

516
00:22:40,538 --> 00:22:46,390
the concentration of terpenes versus THC

517
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:47,830
inside the head so just like alcohol can

518
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,380
prevent water from freezing

519
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:53,288
if the terpene content inside the head

520
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,360
is too high it's not gonna freeze and

521
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:58,359
you'll see this when you like make a lot

522
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,579
of BHO and stuff like that certain

523
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:03,579
varieties the slabs literally will not

524
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:06,069
freeze just because the terpene content

525
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:08,710
so high and considering we can only get

526
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:12,398
water to 32 degrees really or you know

527
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:15,640
maybe 31 or whatever you're gonna have a

528
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:21,398
hard time getting varieties that have

529
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:24,520
thin cuticles and high terpene content

530
00:23:21,398 --> 00:23:27,609
to not just break break apart and

531
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:29,710
basically become part of the water or in

532
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:33,519
certain cases I've even seen the heads

533
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:35,679
are still really sticky at freezing temp

534
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,889
or 32 degrees or whatever your frozen

535
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,929
your cold waters at and they'll stick

536
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,299
together and it'll be stuck in your to

537
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:47,048
20 bag like the whole bottom of the 220

538
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:48,879
bag will be gold I mean just full of

539
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:50,500
gold but there's no real way to extract

540
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,730
it because you can't get the heads to

541
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:57,759
break apart again in certain strains

542
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:59,319
when you dry them they like shrink

543
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,648
together and then the heads become these

544
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:05,109
little balls and when those even when

545
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:06,969
you when you're washing try those balls

546
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:08,678
will break off but they're well over 200

547
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:12,819
20 microns so you're just never able to

548
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:15,909
catch up these are your problems of our

549
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:17,798
trade totally agree it's like you know

550
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:21,490
I've been washing for the past month

551
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:22,900
you know maybe 30 pounds a day something

552
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:26,319
like that

553
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:29,500
and we're seeing all kinds of different

554
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,000
varieties you know washing and it you

555
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,369
know a lot of the CBD varieties we're

556
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,630
seeing a major yield in the the 25 and

557
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:40,869
45 really nothing in the 1973 so to your

558
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:42,820
point it's it's so that's so true yeah

559
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:44,319
it's every strain is different whether

560
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:45,669
it's better you know there's certain

561
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:47,859
varieties like they used to have a white

562
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:52,750
rhino cross with skunk number one it

563
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:55,629
made the best try sift and full melt

564
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,789
from dry trim I mean bubbleman that was

565
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,650
that photo that shroom he sent to you

566
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:02,349
back in the day that was the screen like

567
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:05,080
this with the two bubbles on both sides

568
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:07,539
of the screen probably like two thousand

569
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:10,480
four or five on the fresh headies

570
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:15,009
website I remember it I remember that

571
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:19,809
was yeah that was those dry stuff just

572
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:23,680
from sifting in a key box basically and

573
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:25,569
it was just really the heads broke off

574
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,160
really easily and they didn't have a

575
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:28,359
really high terpene content so they're

576
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,100
really easy to work with

577
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:33,219
and at the time I was using all the

578
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:35,740
power in my apartment or condo for

579
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,079
growing so I didn't run any heat so you

580
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,650
know 45 degrees 50 degrees inside your

581
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,629
house

582
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,000
pretty decent [ __ ] working

583
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,950
environment I mean you don't have to

584
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,569
talk to me I live in Canada bro so we

585
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,930
got like eight months of that [ __ ] like

586
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:52,659
all day long I'm not far from you that's

587
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:54,549
for sure that's that is well I've moved

588
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:58,630
to a reasonable part of Canada I was

589
00:25:54,549 --> 00:26:02,589
just visiting Manitoba and it's minus 37

590
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:05,110
when I was there yeah well maybe uh

591
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:06,849
maybe there's a way to make cash in

592
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:10,089
negative 37 I mean one thing that I've

593
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:12,129
thought would be interesting although I

594
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:13,959
don't know if there's a reasonable way

595
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:18,100
to do it but so let's say you have these

596
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,750
lower temperature varieties that like

597
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:24,039
let's say they would wash if you could

598
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:27,150
get your washing liquid to zero degrees

599
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:30,549
or negative 15 right so if you have like

600
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:32,170
salt to your water or a glycol bath

601
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,309
instead of water there's like a million

602
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:35,800
different things you could do to prevent

603
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:36,970
the water from freezing but

604
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:39,279
would you be able to wash that out

605
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,960
afterwards and that's kind of an

606
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,129
interesting concept I don't know if it's

607
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,110
actually applicable but what other what

608
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,390
other liquid could you use that's not

609
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:51,129
water that freezes that that that

610
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:54,130
freezes at a lower temperature has a

611
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:56,650
lower freezing point um so that you

612
00:26:54,130 --> 00:27:01,350
could have varieties that don't wash at

613
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:03,550
32 degrees maybe wash in that right I

614
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:07,029
got to admit there haven't been too many

615
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:09,430
plants I couldn't wash not so many that

616
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:11,619
I'd start designing methodologies to I

617
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:14,140
mean maybe when nay pro releases like a

618
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:16,269
10% terpene strain or something I guess

619
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,980
that'll become more more of a issue but

620
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:19,839
I got to admit like at this point in

621
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,910
time even after last Sunday when we all

622
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:24,730
just named a few cultivars that washed

623
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:27,250
really well I began to realize there is

624
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,259
a lot of cannabis that you can grow that

625
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,180
will produce beautiful resin and give

626
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:34,119
you nice yields beautiful terpene

627
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:36,430
profiles and it's it's being done on a

628
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:39,639
daily basis by just even the people in

629
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:41,500
this panel right now yeah names I didn't

630
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,690
even recognize dude like you you

631
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,359
probably would as your you have your

632
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,250
finger more on that pulse but I just

633
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:51,369
know a lot of varieties that are really

634
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:54,549
excellent flowers to smoke don't really

635
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:56,909
make very good hash dry trim or fresh

636
00:27:54,549 --> 00:28:00,460
frozen but are really wonderful flowers

637
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:02,230
and and you can breathe those varieties

638
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:06,340
and eventually find one that has the

639
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:10,480
flavor and washes but just I was just

640
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:11,769
from a they'd be a good science

641
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,420
experiment is all I'm saying

642
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:15,519
right if so if you had something that

643
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:18,100
didn't wash at 32 degrees you're able to

644
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,319
get your liquid now let's say it's salt

645
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:22,629
water to 15 degrees and now it does wash

646
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:25,359
because you've reached that point of

647
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:27,220
where the head is actually freezing be

648
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:32,919
interesting just to see if that that is

649
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:36,339
what what is causing the the disparity

650
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,500
between varieties we should wash Hayes

651
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:40,990
somebody needs to grow some Hayes and

652
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,480
then wash the pace I need some Hayes

653
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:46,170
hash in my life I love Hayes Hayes is my

654
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,170
son's middle name

655
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:55,259
dosey doe right here that's it's pure

656
00:28:49,109 --> 00:29:00,209
lemon haze funk it's funny because yeah

657
00:28:55,259 --> 00:29:01,920
Chris Strom dump the Schrom dumps that

658
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:05,370
historically it's been a great hash

659
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,080
producer oh yeah so that's a I'm sure

660
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:09,949
that that outcrops you made especially

661
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:18,240
the Dancy dough is probably insane I

662
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:20,490
paid all the terpenes but you know I

663
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:27,230
just actually exhaled some seeds in the

664
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:29,579
haze and that [ __ ] was lemony real good

665
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:32,130
yeah the stuff that flood shared with me

666
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:35,039
recently was really Lemon Haze heavy

667
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,630
yeah you know you know it's good when

668
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:42,710
you ask someone happy what did that

669
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:57,980
taste like and they say another one yeah

670
00:29:42,710 --> 00:30:01,200
yeah brother the resin texture

671
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,819
conversation part was what we do here

672
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,759
with some of the ones that don't wash as

673
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:08,279
well I don't really cultivate too many

674
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:11,430
like that um cuz you know what my name

675
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:13,680
is but when we find ones like CBD ones

676
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:15,450
or some lemony profiles like some tiny

677
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,670
lemony ones that gonna watch - well we

678
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,259
notice that they are really oily right

679
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:23,460
off the touch we'd like to make

680
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:26,339
tinctures or SABS or just like oils you

681
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,230
know with those um they seem to be like

682
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:29,639
water soluble if I wash them you know a

683
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:36,059
lot of the Terps are just floating on

684
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:37,950
top where if I if what we make it into

685
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:40,169
you know some other type of product it's

686
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:43,440
acting a lot better and none of a waste

687
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:44,789
and I like to see that kind of happened

688
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,410
- it's like we come up with a strain

689
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:49,500
list for hashes like let's come up with

690
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:52,590
a cultivar so I list for you know

691
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:55,549
tinctures and topicals and such you know

692
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:55,549
that'd be really cool too

693
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:06,539
how did I go me no no you're good I was

694
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:08,819
answering you okay you look cool yeah

695
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:11,548
that's like something that I always look

696
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:13,200
at here it's like as the grower when it

697
00:31:11,548 --> 00:31:15,900
comes down to harvest time and we're

698
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,390
growing so many Yuki knows you know we

699
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,919
have a tendency we run a clones we got

700
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,470
our fee knows that we like to you know

701
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,720
we know what they're all about and how

702
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,250
they grow but then there's the new ones

703
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,130
and that's like more than half the

704
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:31,919
garden all the time and to just hunt

705
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:35,580
through the new stuff is so fun but it's

706
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:38,130
a real trial and error so getting better

707
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:40,589
with that is now figuring out the

708
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,260
parents and the of the cultivars to know

709
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:46,079
you know we're bringing hash plants and

710
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:48,629
we're breeding into more hash plants and

711
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:51,329
it makes it a lot easier for sure and to

712
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:54,690
know what ash plants are what I always

713
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:56,099
let homie snow and I'm sure you know

714
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,350
what the cultivar lists that you guys

715
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:00,119
were talking about the other day like

716
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,649
those type of strains like if anybody

717
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,879
looked up with those strains were and

718
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,740
then look at the parents of those

719
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,440
strains could really find out what I'm

720
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,109
talking about pretty easily but I think

721
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,490
it's really cool to dad to kind of know

722
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:14,099
the difference so it's like we're

723
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:17,039
already of leading to like waste time or

724
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:20,969
waste material and like I kind of search

725
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,428
at harvest time I like I I go out there

726
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:25,470
in the field and I work everything by

727
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:27,809
hand like kind of like charas rub it at

728
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:29,970
first and I wanted to talk about that

729
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:32,910
too is some hand rub hash because that

730
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:35,910
shit's really in next level if you want

731
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:38,910
to talk about that which I'll put on

732
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:40,410
next but like when you know you're

733
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,779
searching for the hash plants I really

734
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:45,240
like to find the ones that are you could

735
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:47,089
feel the heads like on your fingers you

736
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,640
know what I'm talking about yeah and

737
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:52,949
yeah that's yeah nice I thought that

738
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,740
thought I shared that same sentiment

739
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:58,890
where I look at the apparent stock that

740
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:01,829
was used before I even consider any any

741
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:08,100
seeds at all that's super-important to

742
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:08,399
me over a year work easily you know if

743
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:09,839
you're

744
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,850
even if you're just doing indoor if

745
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:14,039
you're doing outdoor like probably to

746
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:16,769
like year and a half maybe two years of

747
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:20,789
work just to potentially find something

748
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:22,889
yeah that's unspoken thing I feel like

749
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:24,359
it doesn't get talked about people that

750
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:27,690
find those Finas you know it's so much

751
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,909
work to find something that is actually

752
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,309
actually watches and checks all the

753
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:34,350
boxes and that you want to keep running

754
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:36,299
yeah I think I have more in my stable

755
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:37,949
that I've kept all this time out of all

756
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:41,629
all the time that I've been washing and

757
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:44,610
those four are with me still to this day

758
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:48,900
so it's it's hard it's hard out there

759
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:51,839
man well it's funny it's getting even

760
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,940
more difficult because you know everyone

761
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,039
kind of claims that sharing is caring

762
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:00,059
and is like oh yeah you know I like to

763
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:03,750
share to people right up until you ask

764
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:05,159
them for a cut and I gave a lot of cuts

765
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,140
away over the course of the last five

766
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,210
years so I feel like I can say this you

767
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,880
know I had cuts given to me by all sorts

768
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:14,250
of wonderful breeders and never once did

769
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,019
I feel like it was my duty to interview

770
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,480
the people I was giving them to to make

771
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:20,579
sure that they were going to be good

772
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,409
enough to receive this particular cut

773
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:24,599
and there was a ton of people in my city

774
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:26,820
who felt this way and actually got quite

775
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,059
upset with me for just giving them away

776
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,950
and I was always like I'd be like what

777
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:34,320
if you know you know this guy that

778
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:36,629
supposedly doesn't deserve the Cologne

779
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,100
what if he gets it but then one of the

780
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:41,640
first people who gets it too is like a

781
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:43,589
sick little girl with epic profile just

782
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,599
is so you know I'm trying to get him to

783
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,970
see like listen like the world is not

784
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,589
quite as limiting as you think it is

785
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:52,769
there are these connections that can

786
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:55,530
occur in in in in ways that you can't

787
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:57,630
possibly fathom and the only way to try

788
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:01,080
to kind of support that is to do good

789
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:03,329
and doing good as sharing genetics yeah

790
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,829
your mout because I can't handle

791
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:07,710
listening to people who lost their

792
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:09,750
genetics while hoarding them it's like

793
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:12,119
oh here let me pull the tiniest little

794
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,710
violin out and play you a song I'm so

795
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,779
sorry that you were an [ __ ] and

796
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,970
didn't give your cuts away to anyone and

797
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,780
now you've lost them and you have no one

798
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:27,089
to call and say hey I get my cuts back

799
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:30,720
so yeah that's in a 77s words you want

800
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:33,420
to save a strain give it away you know I

801
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,399
mean [ __ ] it's the crazy man himself man

802
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,460
but but don't give it away like this

803
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,500
okay you can have this cut but here's a

804
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,179
long list of like your Ozzy Osbourne and

805
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,769
you have a right or if you're gonna play

806
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:47,480
the venue or something I think I'm gonna

807
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:47,480
need the red M&amp;Ms I'm going to need

808
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:55,170
anything tied to that looks nice iPad

no one in this room that understands

814
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,880
that more than Colin because he's

834
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:19,139
you're holding up the micron micron it's

835
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:21,659
um it's the 120 and then the 70 combined

836
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:25,019
from yeah so it's underneath the 150 bag

837
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:28,079
to the 70 back the 70 to 90 n to 120

838
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:29,820
yeah yeah I mix most of them I really

839
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,569
don't I just kind of separate the one of

840
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:36,420
the 40 and I separate like the 150 is

841
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:38,670
the outdoor got particulates flying in

842
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,880
so lationship our suits are just more

843
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:44,309
abundant and like but it's this is

844
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,090
outdoor resin this has been rained on

845
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:50,369
for every month this was at negative leg

846
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:52,800
or not neg it was at 20 degrees for a

847
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:54,329
few nights before I harvested this this

848
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,230
was this plant went through some [ __ ]

849
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:57,509
here in the valley

850

shout-out to bio vortex

856
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:12,870
hands down as one of the deck is like

857
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:14,429
breeders for sure all all this [ __ ] that

858
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:16,739
I ran from him was amazing I did the

859
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:21,449
banana dog as well which is banana og

860
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:23,250
with SSP black dog just unreal just hard

861
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:28,460
to get out hard to get his stuff for

862
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:31,050
sure but if you can it's worth it nice

863
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:33,389
good to have those tips that's really

864
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:35,400
what hash makers want to know I mean

865
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:38,489
they want to know every possible secret

866
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,769
they can possibly know by the time it's

867
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:44,250
not too hard to find varieties that wash

868
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:46,199
well or yield well and vice versa you'll

869
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,119
find ones that smoke well let's reel as

870
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:50,189
flowers what's really hard to find ones

871
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,859
that are really good flowers and really

872
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:57,599
good washers that's been my experience

873
00:38:52,860 --> 00:39:00,720
it's pretty it's pretty tough just in

874
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,250
general and I just haven't smelled

875
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,799
flowers in 19 years

876
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:08,190
yeah I I agree with that a hundred

877
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,050
percent you know it's I you know og KB

878
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:13,679
is one that seems to wash really well as

879
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:19,380
well like at times most things is going

880
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:22,609
to do well in washing yeah exactly it's

881
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:27,329
a terrible yeah exactly

882
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:29,280
I've had five years now I still I rock

883
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:30,900
it every year just for head staff mostly

884
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,850
and then this select few homies that

885
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,889
come through and lots of [ __ ] it's

886
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:39,210
straight medical I quit

887
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:42,569
yeah it's hardcore medicine yeah better

888
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:45,119
outside than it does inside - yep Lee

889
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,070
and it does way better and if you like

890
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,460
yeah and they like a Hugo or something

891
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:51,330
like

892
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:54,059
like thick soil oh this doesn't need

893
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:55,440
much water like what we got kind of

894
00:39:54,059 --> 00:40:01,230
going on in the backyard here it's

895
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:03,480
pretty gnarly yeah it's so what are you

896
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,710
guys watching right now like what some

897
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,480
of your favorite cultivars that you guys

898
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,670
are running that that seemed to get good

899
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,139
yields and what what yields are you guys

900
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,369
getting out of those I think that would

901
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:18,119
be a good good topic to kind of go over

902
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:22,769
yeah a lot of multiple vino so Chris

903
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:25,079
would know better yeah we're running a

904
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:29,009
lot of moonbow a lot of lemon cane a lot

905
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:30,239
of lemon peel moonbow and lemon cane and

906
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,980
the lemon peel are absolutely my

907
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:35,099
favorite ones to wash right now at the

908
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:37,829
shop moonbow between the night one like

909
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,179
the 99 and the 112 those tufi nose give

910
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:42,179
like four and a half to five percent

911
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:44,879
back and three and a half of that sits

912
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:47,699
between the 149 and the 90 you and the

913
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,190
rest is just you know 70 40 and you're

914
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:51,809
like 180 and stuff like that and it's

915
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,389
all you're collecting a bunch of it is

916
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:57,829
full mil so everything presses back

917
00:40:54,389 --> 00:41:00,359
between like 85 and 92 percent so

918
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:02,819
they're fantastic to work with

919
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:06,140
we do washes all hand stirred between

920
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,820
ten to fifteen thousand grams at a time

921
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:11,489
and so we're pulling massive patties off

922
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,170
those they do really well especially the

923
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:15,599
limited field like if you're looking for

924
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,780
a strain that's like very heavy on the

925
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,759
limit herbs it washes extremely well

926
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,110
it's not the easiest to get but I was

927
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:27,120
gonna say no one can get their hands on

928
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:29,160
that one bro yeah come to the shop and

929
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,809
you can come get it you know but other

930
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:34,049
than that you got to really know

931
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:35,789
somebody you know like yeah but it dumps

932
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,260
it's really good and the lemon cane is

933
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:39,840
the one that we took down to like that

934
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:42,930
ego clash and you know took first place

935
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,240
in hash with that one produces really

936
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:49,049
crazy full mouth for a strain with that

937
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:51,809
chirping profile cool down if you took

938
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:54,269
first at the ego clash how that was

939
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:56,460
quite an event I heard a dude it was

940
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:58,380
crazy that was my first time in

941
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,960
California so I didn't really know what

942
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,400
to expect but it was like it was not mid

943
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,610
to seen

944
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,860
it was just like pissin rain tons of mud

945
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,269
everywhere you know but it was a

946
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,700
phenomenal event man it was tons of fun

947
00:42:08,269 --> 00:42:12,860
there's so much good Mel everywhere I

948
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:15,199
didn't get to see a lot of the housing

949
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,340
that was there but I definitely [ __ ]

950
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,519
with a lot of the full mill that was

951
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:21,170
brought to the table and it was quality

952
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:23,809
there's maybe wanted few jars that I was

953
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:26,300
not really stoked on but you know he's

954
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:27,799
all it was all really good stuff and it

955
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,860
was all it was funny there's a lot of

956
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,420
papaya heavy crosses mmm so it's

957
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,950
interesting to see that everyone you

958
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:37,430
know is kind of leaning towards those

959
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:39,619
fruity turkeys right now you know the

960
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:41,089
Dutch variety has always made the best

961
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:43,639
hash I don't know if that was like a

962
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:46,789
product of Sam's selective breeding with

963
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:48,559
Scott number one most likely right but

964
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:51,139
right man a lot of those varieties

965
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,059
really like I said one of the best

966
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:56,509
washing varieties I ever had from dry

967
00:42:53,059 --> 00:43:00,429
trim was white rhino cross skunk number

968
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:02,780
one and I mean it just it did phenomenal

969
00:43:00,429 --> 00:43:04,279
there's some scope get that going at the

970
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,350
farm right now that's probably gonna be

971
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,330
dedicated towards hash like some fresh

972
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:11,690
frozen here soon so I'll report back on

973
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:13,940
numbers for that one shortly but it was

974
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,990
like grande Eddy skunker granny skunk we

975
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,630
got going right now so it'll be

976
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:20,809
interesting to see what that does I've

977
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:23,269
been raving this year about this

978
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:27,579
wheezing song from nature farm that we

979
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:30,170
grew we grew we grow eight plants and

980
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:36,980
every single one of them made awesome

981
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:41,809
hash just greasy and unreal yields like

982
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:43,960
near 20% probably so I'm really

983
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:43,960
impressed

984
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:54,900
really gassy like race fuel Terps I just

985
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:58,830
did a London Bridge London Bridge is

986
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:00,960
anyone smuggling in bridge no I've seen

987
00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:02,670
those seeds around in the cut being

988
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,710
passed around but I haven't is that is

989
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,990
that London poundcake Ross what's the

990
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:09,630
range on the pound cake and sunset

991
00:44:06,989 --> 00:44:13,500
sherbert it was from apparently and I

992
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:15,150
got it on my friend it's just like I

993
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,260
haven't smoked it yet I'm pretty

994
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:20,940
interested it's kind of like on a

995
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:25,580
next-level cookie gas gassy cookie kind

996
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:30,750
of gave me a GMO notes in there nice

997
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:34,440
fan-favorite over here that was I got

998
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:37,170
like crazy long list in my head what

999
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,800
else I got gold in the strawberries this

1000
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:44,550
one is just like 20% I'm dry five and a

1001
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,920
half wet that one's amazing that one

1002
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:50,850
straight strawberry shortcake

1003
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:55,110
and what else would wobble punch that's

1004
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:56,880
my new one that I made from breeding the

1005
00:44:55,110 --> 00:45:01,079
strawberry guava from Oni

1006
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,809
with purple punch go Seto I don't know

1007
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:05,429
who the seat pack though came from I got

1008
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:07,829
I took that it was pretty much a pollen

1009
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:09,149
truck I took the mail from a buddy's bro

1010
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:11,969
it took the mail because he was gonna

1011
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,740
throw it out and I was like no way I saw

1012
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:15,599
potential in it and I brought it home

1013
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:17,969
stressed it out and ended up seeing

1014
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,610
resident on the mail so I knew it was a

1015
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:25,230
keeper then I just brought it into the

1016
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:27,510
hole 32 plant straw - and knocked up the

1017
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:29,039
whole room ended up washing the whole

1018
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:32,160
room and collect and seed at the same

1019
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:34,079
time and that shit's been a really good

1020
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,429
[ __ ] one has anyone else done that -

1021
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,429
that's been pretty frickin cool with it

1022
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:44,039
I grew a whole room of seed for lights

1023
00:45:38,429 --> 00:45:46,769
32 plants and I got like that I mean

1024
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:51,360
about ten thousand maybe more seeds and

1025
00:45:46,769 --> 00:45:51,630
a whole room of freshmen that's pretty

1026
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,269
crazy

1027
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:56,849
Jenny can like no neither environment

1028
00:45:54,269 --> 00:45:58,710
and tile and your guava punch though I

1029
00:45:56,849 --> 00:46:01,679
do movies

1030
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:03,240
I took all the [ __ ] wash material and

1031
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,159
I put it out in the hoop house and I put

1032
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:07,859
plastic over the hoop house and they all

1033
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:09,899
sprouted up out of the nugs and I let

1034
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,700
that thing grow into the sticky shake

1035
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,280
when it was this year if anyone saw this

1036
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:16,769
take assured that I did that [ __ ] was

1037
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,480
that was all just strong waffle mix fie

1038
00:46:16,769 --> 00:46:18,929
knows there was like 35 different Eno's

1039
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,420
in there

1040
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:23,250
we had like a party inside the bush I

1041
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,980
mean I would definitely hope that no one

1042
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:27,780
ever did do a seed batch and not make

1043
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,090
hash with the material because if they

1044
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,680
didn't that would just crush my my soul

1045
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:34,500
to know that people are just pulling

1046
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:41,879
these bad seed harvest what should we do

1047
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:43,170
with all this bud because you don't get

1048
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,730
the seeds wet or something and you want

1049
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:47,670
to sell the seed but like yeah it was

1050
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:49,740
like it's definitely my intention was to

1051
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:52,680
wash the whole room first and then I

1052
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:55,289
just saw the opportunity arise with the

1053
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:57,210
male and then it kind of got a little

1054
00:46:55,289 --> 00:47:00,239
out of control like I only brought it in

1055
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:01,920
there for it and day and I was like you

1056
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,399
know how much pollen can come off in the

1057
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,920
whole room was dusted so Google blunt so

1058
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:13,170
yes it was badass though I mean job

1059
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:16,349
provides so job does provide yes I that

1060
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:19,409
is the truth hope to I you ever make it

1061
00:47:16,349 --> 00:47:21,420
down to the island down to Jamaica not

1062
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:23,069
yet I got a bunch of homies though that

1063
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,539
are ready to pick me up off the airport

1064
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:28,430
and bring you to the Rasta village

1065
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:31,170
shoutout to that okay in Montego Bay uh

1066
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:32,489

1070
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:42,329
make hash in I'll tell you some of the

1071
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,800
best hash I ever made in my life was

1072
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:48,900
outdoor grown cannabis from in Jamaica

1073
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,340
yeah I'd be glad be awesome I'd love to

1074
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,769
go do that it's hard to get away from

1075
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:55,710

little bit because I can't come to the

1096
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:47,579
US but maybe one day they'll figure it

1097
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:49,380
out and they'll just allow cannabis to

1098
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:56,509
be federally legal and then I'll just be

1099
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:59,610
like people coming down second way

1100

to get over the border

1106
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:25,879
I was driving my Volkswagen van

1107
00:49:22,949 --> 00:49:29,039
potentiating my stereotype you know and

1108
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:33,510
I got to the border and the customs guy

1109
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:36,029
was like where are you going I'm like

1110
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:38,220
I'm just going down to California to see

1113
00:49:40,469 --> 00:49:46,349
middle of Canada looked at me and said

the I never got across the border look I

1117
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:56,730

1118
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:58,799
concert tickets to hippies that I met in

1119
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:00,300
the forest in British Columbia because I

1120
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,860
was so bummed I had these mail-order

1121
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:05,310

1122
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:06,960
sparkly ones for like you know like jeez

1123

what shows were they for they were for

1124
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:14,909
like what's the big calli one the big

1125
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:17,069
was the California venue they film are

1126
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:18,480
no it was an outdoor venue it was all

1127
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:21,000
summer so it was like they played a

1128
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,570
Portland show I had I had tickets to see

1129
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,960
Jerry with Merle in like Seattle it was

1130
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:29,210
like this you know nice four or five run

1131
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,159
thing and anyway that was the start of

1132
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:34,280
my not going to the US so I haven't been

1133
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:38,269
down there since since fish 98 at the

1134
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:40,880
gorge was my last trip to so sorry to

1135
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:42,858
get off topic we're back on hash here a

1136
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,480
lot of people do some oak ash at

1137
00:50:42,858 --> 00:50:50,809
Grateful Dead and Phish concerts we can

1138
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:52,730
talk about that room we can so dry so we

1139
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:56,389
you guys were touching on drying before

1140
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:59,150
and you know I think one thing I wanted

1141
00:50:56,389 --> 00:51:01,838
to talk about was drying times and and

1142
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,838
pumps

1143
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,860
you

1144
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:11,139
you

1145
00:51:13,929 --> 00:51:18,818
in value and there's a company out there

1146
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,318
called Lou Boyd and I just want everyone

1147
00:51:18,818 --> 00:51:21,519
to be aware of this and I just want to

1148
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:25,719
share this if you don't already know

1149
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:33,509
this and these fad at home I you're just

1150
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:33,509
gonna have just it's le y bo d Laboy

1151
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:39,969
they're very expensive pumps but they

1152
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:42,970
will allow you to get at a really a much

1153
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:46,558
more consistent vacuum so you're not

1154
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:49,538
actually pulling all the Desirables out

1155
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,220
so you know I could give I've been a

1156
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:52,930
beingness for a really long time and I

1157
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:54,219
just think it's it's valuable

1158
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:56,889
information for everybody to have

1159
00:51:54,219 --> 00:52:00,159
because I think it's important to share

1160
00:51:56,889 --> 00:52:01,808
it they're a great company you can just

1161
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,568
reach out to them but but it'll allow

1162
00:52:01,809 --> 00:52:07,240
everything to do meaning you can do what

1163
00:52:04,568 --> 00:52:09,849
I would do and let's say 40 or 72 hours

1164
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:13,389
in in much less time with much higher

1165
00:52:09,849 --> 00:52:17,349
quality and it's it's just a lovely

1166
00:52:13,389 --> 00:52:19,509
you know addition to a not-so-great you

1167
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:22,778
know setup it's like bringing a machine

1168
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:25,349
gun basically to a knife fight it's you

1169
00:52:22,778 --> 00:52:27,880
know it's it's that it's that much it's

1170
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:31,028
reducing the amount of time that you're

1171
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:35,410
in the vacuum yeah exactly because it

1172
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:36,789
gets to a much deeper vacuum so it's

1173
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:43,449
what temperatures are you running on

1174
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:45,520
that then so say that again and what's

1175
00:52:43,449 --> 00:52:48,429
Melissa what's the vacuum pressure that

1176
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:50,079
you actually do get down to so the

1177
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:53,949
vacuum pressures that we're getting down

1178
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:56,289
to you for the Laboy I don't have my

1179
00:52:53,949 --> 00:53:02,439
notes in front of me let me see if I can

1180
00:52:56,289 --> 00:53:06,430
pull it up see if I can pull this up for

1181
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:09,789
you guys I want to talk about ice what

1182
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:11,500
you guys like for ice I love craft cold

1183
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:14,230
not sure if you guys have heard of those

1184
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:16,119
machine make really wicked ice just

1185
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:17,679
really nice solid our own machines hook

1186
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:20,528
up to them and they make really nice

1187
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:23,048
cubed ice I've always found that there's

1188
00:53:20,528 --> 00:53:25,329
certain ice that just wasn't what I

1189
00:53:23,048 --> 00:53:27,309
wanted to use if I could avoid it like

1190
00:53:25,329 --> 00:53:29,680
the chip ice

1191
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:31,630
you know that you get in hotels and

1192
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:34,269
cheap store-bought ice any ice with

1193
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:37,030
fluoride I always tried to avoid that

1194
00:53:34,269 --> 00:53:38,949
sort of stuff and even had quite good

1195
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:40,750
luck surprisingly back in the day in

1196
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:43,059
Switzerland when we made a lot of our

1197
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:44,679
ice by freezing just like all sorts of

1198
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:47,019
different things that we then hammer and

1199
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,879
smash the ice was quite sharp and big

1200
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:50,980
chunks and smaller chunks but it really

1201
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,099
seemed to do the job on breaking the

1202
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:55,780
resin off I think that it's something

1203
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:57,429
that people don't always look at they

1204
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:59,440
get used to their process they always

1205
00:53:57,429 --> 00:54:01,179
use the same ice and I'll I'll suggest

1206
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,700
to them have you ever just switched your

1207
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:05,859
ice up a little bit like maybe like like

1208
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:08,019
how cold the ice is how clear the ice is

1209
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,670
is it foggy like what's the pH of the

1210
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:13,179
water like there's there's quite a bit

1211
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:17,619
that goes into a simply making ice and I

1212
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:18,909
just wondered some yeah you can come

1213
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:20,319
back when you find it dude I just

1214
00:54:18,909 --> 00:54:22,299
figured while you've been looking I'd

1215
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:30,970
keep the conversation going on eiseley

1216
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:35,050
going but but it's it's like it's double

1217
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:40,959
to triple what a normal pump can do and

1218
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:44,640
it's it's going to it's yeah I'm going

1219
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,639
to share this with you guys right here

1220
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:59,019
so at the farm we make our own ice with

1221
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,330
the same water we washed with and that's

1222
00:54:59,019 --> 00:55:04,420
been really helpful you know like makes

1223
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:07,929
400 pounds I stress a day the guy have

1224
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:10,809
helping me stir buckets bags ice a ton

1225
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:11,980
of the time too you know and it helps

1226
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:13,269
you know being able to make your own ice

1227
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:17,050
with the same water that you're washing

1228
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:18,789
with you know using water chillers do

1229
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:20,740
what gives water chillers to preserve

1230
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:23,710
that ice so you don't have to use so

1231
00:55:20,739 --> 00:55:25,959
much um the room that we washed it is

1232
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:29,050
extremely cold so we don't really have

1233
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:31,659
to use too much ice this stays about 42

1234
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:34,480
to 45 degrees and you support your water

1235
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:36,489
in that room the water is stored in that

1236
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,469
room and the tab where the water comes

1237
00:55:36,489 --> 00:55:39,659
out of is also in that room everything

1238
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:41,549
that I use is

1239
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:43,139
based out of that route yet that's full

1240
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:44,940
well also here in Oregon I mean our

1241
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:48,659
water right now probably comes out like

1242
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:51,329
what 40 like upper 40s mid 40s right now

1243
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:54,629
it's pretty cold anyways it's very cold

1244
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:57,569
water for sure yeah yeah but it's great

1245
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:59,400
being able to wash with 32 in rinse with

1246
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:02,610
you know 32 degree water that helps

1247
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:05,039
tremendously yeah definitely it's

1248
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:07,769
amazing how much ice you go through if

1249
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:09,570
you're not taking the temperature of the

1250
00:56:07,769 --> 00:56:11,639
water and your water is a little yeah

1251
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:15,470
than it needs to be and you're doing big

1252
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:18,000
batches it will just melt your ice like

1253
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:19,589
you eat oh pattern on ice absolutely

1254
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,750
yeah when you're doing like 10 to 15 K

1255
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:23,760
batches at a time of fresh frozen yeah

1256
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:26,550
you eat up a ton of ice if you're not in

1257
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,590
a cold environment yeah as well as it

1258
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:30,870
makes a lot more particulate if you have

1259
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:33,510
to have more ice in there you need that

1260
00:56:30,869 --> 00:56:36,230
ruin does water to lubricate and kind of

1261
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:38,160
give that softening aspect to the wash

1262
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:39,869
mm-hmm that's the biggest thing I

1263
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:42,029
noticed is washing in that cold room is

1264
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:43,859
I use a lot less ice and it's you know

1265
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:46,260
it's a lot easier to stir those bigger

1266
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,940
buckets now because there's not you know

1267
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:50,520
60 pounds of ice in there

1268
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:53,010
hurling around you're only using like 10

1269
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:55,519
to 20 pounds at a time though yeah maybe

1270
00:56:53,010 --> 00:57:00,180
like 60 pounds for a whole wash like

1271
00:56:55,519 --> 00:57:02,789
that yeah yeah but per bucket you know

1272
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:06,239
you're may be used to 20 at a time it's

1273
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:08,909
a 44 gallon bucket with like I said 10

1274
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:11,369
to 15 K at a time depends on the

1275
00:57:08,909 --> 00:57:13,440
material well as you get into larger

1276
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:15,269
systems it becomes quite important to

1277
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,039
have things like water chillers because

1278
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:19,320
the otherwise the ice production just

1279
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,630
really reduces your economic viability

1280
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,789
of the whole project you know working

1281
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:25,380
out and not turning into this overpriced

1282
00:57:23,789 --> 00:57:28,409
product that someone's just gonna have

1283
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:29,789
to pay for so much ridiculousness along

1284
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:32,429
the way you want to be able to scale

1285
00:57:29,789 --> 00:57:34,800
these things while not affecting the

1286
00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:36,629
purity I won't say quality because what

1287
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:39,000
we work with is hash makers is really

1288
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:41,730
more purity quality is what the genetics

1289
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,090
and the growers have given to us we are

1290
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:47,250
the ones who unveil it so what we unveil

1291
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:48,840
is really dependent upon what you know

1292
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:51,210
the work that they did the months and

1293
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:53,509
months variables that they fought versus

1294
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:56,239
the could be a day

1295
00:57:53,509 --> 00:57:57,918
a week of variables that we that we face

1296
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,869
as hash makers unless it's a real big

1297
00:57:57,918 --> 00:58:02,748
action it maybe takes you longer than

1298
00:57:59,869 --> 00:58:05,419
that but can't compare compare it to the

1299
00:58:02,748 --> 00:58:07,848
growers and the variables that they have

1300
00:58:05,418 --> 00:58:10,129
to have to kind of deal with and

1301
00:58:07,849 --> 00:58:12,048
navigate over the course of you know the

1302
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:14,959
three plus months of some of these

1303
00:58:12,048 --> 00:58:16,338
cannabis cultivars flowering out and

1304
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:18,528
then being even some of the you know

1305
00:58:16,338 --> 00:58:20,239
like not running fresh frozen curing

1306
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:22,338
that out for another little while and

1307
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:24,559
getting that into you know ready to

1308
00:58:22,338 --> 00:58:26,028
process and then making hash and curing

1309
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,609
that out I mean man the first time I

1310
00:58:26,028 --> 00:58:30,798
smoked Sam - I'm quite certain that

1311
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:33,438
material was probably curing for three

1312
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:35,418
or four months and then the hash itself

1313
00:58:33,438 --> 00:58:37,219
was probably three or four months by the

1314
00:58:35,418 --> 00:58:43,458
time I smoked it and it was you know

1315
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:45,469
shocking to me in 1995 shocking yeah but

1316
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:48,228
being the grower - it also helps

1317
00:58:45,469 --> 00:58:50,989
eliminate any errors that might come up

1318
00:58:48,228 --> 00:58:53,688
because you can think about it like okay

1319
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:54,978
I did this this time you know changed up

1320
00:58:53,688 --> 00:58:56,658
this you know had a little lower

1321
00:58:54,978 --> 00:58:58,188
temperatures flushed for a little bit

1322
00:58:56,659 --> 00:59:00,318
longer or whatever you know this season

1323
00:58:58,188 --> 00:59:02,928
was a bit warmer bit colder at the end

1324
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:05,058
you have a little more intimate

1325
00:59:02,929 --> 00:59:07,159
relationship with that resin head and

1326
00:59:05,059 --> 00:59:10,909
can understand what it's potentially

1327
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:12,499
going to be doing for you yeah there's

1328
00:59:10,909 --> 00:59:13,939
nothing more there's nothing more

1329
00:59:12,498 --> 00:59:18,078
beautiful than walking through the

1330
00:59:13,938 --> 00:59:19,848
garden and seeing those head just just

1331
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,989
stick out from a mile away and you just

1332
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:27,439
know I'll tell you if you really want a

1333
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:30,349
bonus tip for me to all of you a really

1334
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:32,388
important factor of on hash making and

1335
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:34,999
cannabis growing is being able to see

1336
00:59:32,389 --> 00:59:36,949
what's going on microscopically and if

1337
00:59:34,998 --> 00:59:39,408
you can get yourself a really good I

1338
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:42,019
mean something that allows you to go in

1339
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:44,630
and spend time in that macro world of

1340
00:59:42,018 --> 00:59:47,478
trichomes and just really exactly you

1341
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:49,789
know getting right into I've been doing

1342
00:59:47,478 --> 00:59:51,948
this since 2008 and I can't tell you

1343
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:54,409
enough that it's really a worthwhile

1344
00:59:51,949 --> 00:59:58,188
it's what taught me about trichomes I

1345
00:59:54,409 --> 01:00:01,759
mean while we've been on this show Marc

1346
00:59:58,188 --> 01:00:04,958
scaled own set sent me an article called

1347
01:00:01,759 --> 01:00:07,940
he said did you see this and it's called

1348
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:10,099
chemical factories

1349
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:11,840
what's the subtitle here okay chemical

1350
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:14,119
factories cannabis trichomes under the

1351
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,950
microscope a recent study has revealed

1352
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:17,750
the internal structures of cannabis bio

1353
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:19,730
chemical factories trichomes and note

1354
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,920
that these hairs can be used as a

1355
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:24,440
measure of potency it's like you're

1356
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,210
kidding oh my god the guys at university

1357
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,639
figured it out and finally that these

1358
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:30,860
cannabis try comb hairs are what

1359
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:33,019
determined the potency on the cannabis

1360
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:34,640
plant and then they go on to I guess

1361
01:00:33,019 --> 01:00:36,469
claim that for the first time ever

1362
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:39,409
they're explaining what's going on

1363
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:41,359
inside these little I haven't read the

1364
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:42,379
whole thing and maybe they have figured

1365
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,000
out some new things but this

1366
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:47,780
informations been out there for quite a

1367
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,750
long time in a multitude of publications

1368
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:53,780
even myself and Jeremiah from cannabis

1369
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:55,190
culture wrote an article in 2000 and it

1370
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:57,680
might have been three it might have been

1371
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:59,900
five or six called inside the trichome

1372
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:02,329
and it very much explains what's going

1373
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:04,160
on inside the trichome and the different

1374
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:06,139
types of organelles and the factors and

1375
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:08,239
the plastids and the phenols and the

1376
01:01:06,139 --> 01:01:10,969
hydrocarbons and how they push up into

1377
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:14,419
the upper membrane and cook with UVB

1378
01:01:10,969 --> 01:01:16,459
light and produce c vga and then from

1379
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:18,800
there the entire cannabinoid and Turkey

1380
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,300
and profile so that information has

1381
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,610
probably been out there maybe since the

1382
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:24,170
sixties or seventies evens I'm not too

1383
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:26,570
sure but definitely something worth

1384
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:31,190
checking out if you guys want I will

1385
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:35,090
post it both in our private chat here

1386
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:36,679
with the panelists if I can figure out

1387
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:38,090
how to send you guys all oh here we go

1388
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:39,679
I'll send that to you guys and then I'll

1389
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:41,930
send it to everyone in the YouTube chat

1390
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:44,179
as well so haven't actually looked over

1391
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:46,159
here in a second but I guess we got four

1392
01:01:44,179 --> 01:01:48,079
hundred and forty people watching with

1393
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:50,750
us right now which is just over four

1394
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:54,199
hundred and twenty that's pretty cool we

1395
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:55,940
send this to them they're compound on

1396
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:59,419
your point a little bit too I've noticed

1397
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:02,990
with lighting indoor with lighting grows

1398
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:05,090
that have higher UVA and UVB lights they

1399
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:08,179
actually do have usually higher both

1400
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:11,800
higher THD percentages and more melty

1401
01:02:08,179 --> 01:02:13,819
strains and larger resin heads usually

1402
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:16,280
while this mystery is going to be

1403
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:18,320
unsolved or solved I should say in the

1404
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,910
next decade maybe less where you know

1405
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,230
you get a lot more people being able to

1406
01:02:19,909 --> 01:02:22,690
do

1407
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:26,019
this and engage and key and you know

1408
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:27,099
start kind of compiling this data and

1409
01:02:26,019 --> 01:02:29,139
there's gonna be all sorts of different

1410
01:02:27,099 --> 01:02:32,940
software's that are developed that allow

1411
01:02:29,139 --> 01:02:35,559
that data to be you know sort of

1412
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:37,840
amalgamated or or or made out and

1413
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:40,210
created into more of a digital landscape

1414
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:42,250
that makes it for easier navigation so

1415
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:44,289
I'm pretty excited for the data to come

1416
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:45,940
out on all these different the

1417
01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:48,309
difference is in the cultivars and why

1418
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:49,809
is this one waxy and this one's this

1419
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:52,389
certain way and why is it that this

1420
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:54,820
one's not washing well and these would

1421
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:56,349
be interesting mysteries to me to just

1422
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,809
have a full understanding and I'm quite

1423
01:02:56,349 --> 01:03:02,289
certain that science will answer the

1424
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:05,199
majority of them I mean to go off of a

1425
01:03:02,289 --> 01:03:08,590
plan like a cheap like hundred twenty

1426
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:10,089
dollar 20 to 80 AK stereo microscope is

1427
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:13,660
like one of the best tools you can have

1428
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:15,039
for sure yeah yes yeah look for house

1429
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:16,569
making but just for growing for

1430
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,309
identifying paths and all that kind of

1431
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:20,289
stuff and they're real cheap like a

1432
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:21,670
stereo microscope you don't need the

1433
01:03:20,289 --> 01:03:24,489
compound microscopes or anything like

1434
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:26,500
that well let's you start navigating

1435
01:03:24,489 --> 01:03:28,269
that different world where you're just

1436
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:30,400
you're silt look when I started shooting

1437
01:03:28,269 --> 01:03:32,559
macro cannabis I first of all couldn't

1438
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:36,130
believe how beautiful it was it really

1439
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:38,650
blew me away at how just beautiful it

1440
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:40,690
was inside the plant I was blown away at

1441
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:42,010
that but then I started like well what

1442
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:44,079
is that you know why is that different

1443
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:45,940
from that and what is that called and so

1444
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:48,969
then I started you know like chimera was

1445
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:51,670
really helpful and skunkman Sam and Rob

1446
01:03:48,969 --> 01:03:53,679
Clark guys that had some history with

1447
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:55,180
this you know that had worked in labs

1448
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:57,608
and that had been doing this since the

1449
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:59,139
80s and understood some of the important

1450
01:03:57,608 --> 01:04:02,019
terminologies that if you were gonna be

1451
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:03,849
able to even search the internet and you

1452
01:04:02,019 --> 01:04:06,699
didn't know the terminology of a

1453
01:04:03,849 --> 01:04:08,739
particular trichome like the cystal of

1454
01:04:06,699 --> 01:04:11,799
hair even fur for that matter it was

1455
01:04:08,739 --> 01:04:14,649
very hard to describe it into google and

1456
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:17,320
get any accuracy or find anything on it

1457
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:19,240
whatsoever so the macro photography for

1458
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,640
me let me get to a point where I was

1459
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:24,099
like okay I need to understand what all

1460
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:26,170
these things are and then you know

1461
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:28,389
starting to do that research was was

1462
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:30,280
really helpful I guess today nowadays we

1463
01:04:28,389 --> 01:04:32,170
have it so good you just go on Instagram

1464
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,319
and check out the hashtag and all the

1465
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:34,338
sudden it's like oh you've got

1466
01:04:33,318 --> 01:04:37,038
all the information you need about

1467
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:40,068
trichomes it's it's kind of a crazy

1468
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:43,489
thing in a good way to be able to you

1469
01:04:40,068 --> 01:04:47,929
know share information in such an easy

1470
01:04:43,489 --> 01:04:54,079
way and connect with so many people that

1471
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:56,808
it's I mean it's so Dutchess so it's

1472
01:04:54,079 --> 01:05:00,589
it's between 600 and we're maxing out at

1473
01:04:56,809 --> 01:05:02,660
900 mTOR that's that's where we're

1474
01:05:00,588 --> 01:05:06,219
that's the deepest vacuum that we've

1475
01:05:02,659 --> 01:05:11,498
attempted to do oh okay well the

1476
01:05:06,219 --> 01:05:13,759
scientific side you can go like

1477
01:05:11,498 --> 01:05:18,139
significantly lower than that I mean it

1478
01:05:13,759 --> 01:05:22,998
can mean way lower that you want to

1479
01:05:18,139 --> 01:05:24,440
bring if you have an updated system by

1480
01:05:22,998 --> 01:05:26,478
all means get lower than that because

1481
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:31,548
you can definitely I've had it sitting

1482
01:05:26,478 --> 01:05:35,389
at 170 m for ya it's 125 to 215 for us

1483
01:05:31,548 --> 01:05:38,028
we use the pharmaceutical units yeah and

1484
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:40,778
I can we ride 2 to 300 gram trays you

1485
01:05:38,028 --> 01:05:44,659
know in 12 to 24 hours just depends on

1486
01:05:40,778 --> 01:05:47,358
the stream so that's the top end right

1487
01:05:44,659 --> 01:05:50,389
that's the and then the what were the

1488
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:54,429
numbers that we have for when we go in

1489
01:05:50,389 --> 01:05:57,618
to vacuum our reading from 25 to 50

1490
01:05:54,429 --> 01:05:58,969
that's getting down to yeah that's what

1491
01:05:57,619 --> 01:06:00,709
we're getting down to yeah so I'm just

1492
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:05,690
giving you guys a range of like where it

1493
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:07,608
can go yeah so and then actually and my

1494
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:10,278
cousin he just texted me he's like dude

1495
01:06:07,608 --> 01:06:12,409
it can go down to 10 so that's crazy

1496
01:06:10,278 --> 01:06:13,998
there's also a chart and you can google

1497
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:16,548
and checked it'll give you a reference

1498
01:06:13,998 --> 01:06:18,259
point of yeah you know when you pull

1499
01:06:16,548 --> 01:06:19,608
down to that kind of you know military

1500
01:06:18,259 --> 01:06:22,278
in temperatures

1501
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:25,130
yeah the turkeys still boil off when

1502
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:26,539
you're when you're in those ranges so

1503
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:28,489
you can see you know it's kind of a very

1504
01:06:26,539 --> 01:06:30,969
fine line of how low do you really want

1505
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:33,528
to go and how long sit at that point

1506
01:06:30,969 --> 01:06:35,150
because you know turkeys will boil off

1507
01:06:33,528 --> 01:06:37,309
obviously check your freeze dry or water

1508
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:40,489
you know everyone knows that there will

1509
01:06:37,309 --> 01:06:41,959
be Kirby's leftover in that but I didn't

1510
01:06:40,489 --> 01:06:43,369
turn around with that myself you know

1511
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:44,659
like how low do you want to go and how

1512
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:46,940
long do you want to have to sit there

1513
01:06:44,659 --> 01:06:48,588
yeah those are you really start

1514
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:50,358
to degrade the purity of the product at

1515
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:54,858
that point or are you just pulling out

1516
01:06:50,358 --> 01:06:57,769
more terpenes at that point the

1517
01:06:54,858 --> 01:07:00,500
temperature because I mean like I see

1518
01:06:57,769 --> 01:07:03,650
I've been very surprised that people are

1519
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:16,579
in the fifties I'm never over 35 degrees

1520
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:23,119
yeah I know can you go it's all about as

1521
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:24,950
low as heart rate to release a unit

1522
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:28,849
where you can set each shelf to its own

1523
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:29,779
temperature because I don't think

1524
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:32,539
they'll ever do that

1525
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:34,010
talking Tula Boyd a little boy I don't

1526
01:07:32,539 --> 01:07:38,509
even know if I'm even pronouncing that

1527
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:40,280
and probably watching that name but but

1528
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:41,900
you should talk to them they're really

1529
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:46,310
great guys they've helped me out a lot

1530
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:49,068
and thanks for sharing that yeah yeah

1531
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:51,799
all we need is a software engineer right

1532
01:07:49,068 --> 01:07:53,480
yeah right yeah I mean dude it's it's uh

1533
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,490
we're getting there you know and we're

1534
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:57,230
gonna get there really quickly if we can

1535
01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:58,909
all just kind of share this information

1536
01:07:57,230 --> 01:08:01,068
you know I don't I don't think you could

1537
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:03,500
realistically have different shelf temps

1538
01:08:01,068 --> 01:08:06,079
in the same vacuum space though because

1539
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:08,358
it's all like they're you're the

1540
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,769
variations aren't gonna be you're not

1541
01:08:08,358 --> 01:08:11,480
going to be able to like make sure that

1542
01:08:09,769 --> 01:08:15,139
this shelf and this shelf when it's in

1543
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:16,640
the same vacuum is our actually 10

1544
01:08:15,139 --> 01:08:18,318
degrees different from each other I

1545
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,910
think it'd be really hard to do that

1546
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:22,759
well unless you're getting a three

1547
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:29,298
million dollar liable is a ssin oven

1548
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:35,960
like a true just what the setting of the

1549
01:08:29,298 --> 01:08:37,880
Shelf would be that at the sensor having

1550
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:41,119
sensors that could detect that and

1551
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:43,520
maintain that in in in it in one vacuum

1552
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:46,719
would be really difficult I mean the

1553
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,719
most effective thing I found

1554
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:52,310
raccoons I don't I have never seen that

1555
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:54,350
but but you know you might be able to

1556
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:57,130
find like Marcus said there's scientific

1557
01:08:54,350 --> 01:09:00,798
ones out there that can probably do more

1558
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:04,279
but I'm not I'm not privy to any of that

1559
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:06,078
stuff man I don't know when batches get

1560
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:08,029
that big for me I have to freeze dryers

1561
01:09:06,078 --> 01:09:10,460
luckily and I they're both seven shelves

1562
01:09:08,029 --> 01:09:12,020
so if I need to set one freeze dryer to

1563
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,849
a totally different temperature than the

1564
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:16,849
other one there's the option to do that

1565
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:19,069
I haven't really ran into that all that

1566
01:09:16,849 --> 01:09:23,539
much you know well check it check out

1567
01:09:19,069 --> 01:09:25,548
mil rock technology live from laboratory

1568
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:28,838
to production so that's an interesting

1569
01:09:25,548 --> 01:09:32,269
company that does a whole variety of

1570
01:09:28,838 --> 01:09:34,068
like a ton of different laboratory style

1571
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:36,230
freeze dryers research development

1572
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:38,329
freeze dryers pilot freeze dryers you

1573
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:40,158
know small production freeze dryers like

1574
01:09:38,328 --> 01:09:42,259
for sure I would love to check them out

1575
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:44,420
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's definitely

1576
01:09:42,259 --> 01:09:46,250
interesting it's it's it's big boy toys

1577
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:47,509
in the sense like wow like I don't know

1578
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:50,750
if they make like a four or five

1579
01:09:47,509 --> 01:09:53,868
thousand dollar unit but it's definitely

1580
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:56,000
neat to know about and and you know see

1581
01:09:53,868 --> 01:09:57,529
maybe one day that technology will get

1582
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,908
shrunk down I think the harvest rights

1583
01:09:57,529 --> 01:10:01,550
are cool but I think they're like

1584
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:05,589
they're they're more like of a toy

1585
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:08,000
compared to you know some units right

1586
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:10,789
yeah I totally agree they're kind of

1587
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,349
slow to it so it's you know and it's the

1588
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:14,149
other thing is you know getting down to

1589
01:10:12,349 --> 01:10:15,770
temperature sooner is really important

1590
01:10:14,149 --> 01:10:17,689
for me so because it cuts down on the

1591
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:19,550
time that you have to the whole thing

1592
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:22,158
has to switch over to do all the

1593
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:23,840
functions it needs to do and you know as

1594
01:10:22,158 --> 01:10:26,750
you said we need a software engineer to

1595
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,880
get that stuff fixed out you know yeah

1596
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:30,469
they do have really weird things with

1597
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,270
like the screen that aren't even like

1598
01:10:30,469 --> 01:10:34,219
buttons that are notable you just have

1599
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:38,300
to know to press in that area and you

1600
01:10:34,219 --> 01:10:39,679
can set you know from like it does crazy

1601
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,949
weird stuff for sure they need to be a

1602
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:46,130
lot more automated and made for what

1603
01:10:42,948 --> 01:10:48,348
we're doing you know totally so I want

1604
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:49,730
to hear I want to hear a little bit from

1605
01:10:48,349 --> 01:10:51,469
some people that haven't been able to

1606
01:10:49,729 --> 01:10:53,718
talk because some of us have you know

1607
01:10:51,469 --> 01:10:55,189
loud voices and strong personalities and

1608
01:10:53,719 --> 01:10:56,899
some of us sort of quiet guys in the

1609
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:59,779
background yeah I'm talking to you flab

1610
01:10:56,899 --> 01:11:02,509
and puah and best friend farms and even

1611
01:10:59,779 --> 01:11:04,759
Great Lakes a little bit heavy ice for

1612
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:06,409
sure you haven't been able to say much

1613
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,239
so just you know we've got about a half

1614
01:11:06,408 --> 01:11:09,679
an hour more so there I'm sure each of

1615
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:11,388
you had little things you might have

1616
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,520
wanted to talk about if you want that's

1617
01:11:11,389 --> 01:11:14,760
a great time to steer the conversation

1618
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:18,199
any one of you that

1619
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:19,860
like bringing something up and saying

1620
01:11:18,198 --> 01:11:24,089
bringing something to the conversation

1621
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:26,729
because I know you guys all do I brought

1622
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:28,739
my weekly list of washes for our

1623
01:11:26,729 --> 01:11:30,839
cultivars here for the last week that we

1624
01:11:28,738 --> 01:11:35,279
watched if you want to hear them oh yeah

1625
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:38,219
absolutely give it to us we watched a

1626
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:41,729
couple phenotypes of 91 Royale this last

1627
01:11:38,219 --> 01:11:43,559
week swamp boys gear they kindly we ran

1628
01:11:41,729 --> 01:11:46,669
a couple things of there is also the

1629
01:11:43,559 --> 01:11:49,440
guava jelly two different phenotypes and

1630
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:53,510
she act great results on both of those

1631
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:57,388
the guavas super-loud fruit forward and

1632
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:59,969
91 Royale one of the fee knows was him

1633
01:11:57,389 --> 01:12:01,920
to be more on the tip of the I guess

1634
01:11:59,969 --> 01:12:04,288
lemon is it Lennon Royale

1635
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:07,408
so whatever went into that I think a GMO

1636
01:12:04,288 --> 01:12:10,618
lemon tree or lemon something I'm not

1637
01:12:07,408 --> 01:12:14,819
sure exactly we ran a pineapple fields

1638
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:17,158
from dynasty genetics also and a couple

1639
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:19,679
of our own types the some of that kosher

1640
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:22,469
pushback to Mac and had been again a

1641
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:24,929
difference you know I got one that we're

1642
01:12:22,469 --> 01:12:27,538
calling gorilla food that I bred that's

1643
01:12:24,929 --> 01:12:31,170
the gorilla glued to Mac to a cake and

1644
01:12:27,538 --> 01:12:33,439
cookies and cream and yeah I don't know

1645
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:36,690
if I mentioned a couple of GMO Tina

1646
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:38,279
phenotypes and and my I guess it was a

1647
01:12:36,689 --> 01:12:40,578
ninety one Royale one of the peanuts

1648
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:43,679
just dumped it down the most really

1649
01:12:40,578 --> 01:12:47,340
garbagey to had that GMO rotten kind of

1650
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:49,440
thing on it garbage truck dumped nice

1651
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:51,599
that's what's up it's always nice to

1652
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:53,098
hear about washes and you know what what

1653
01:12:51,599 --> 01:12:56,010
came out and what's going on

1654
01:12:53,099 --> 01:13:00,239
how'd the pineapple feels good do the

1655
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:01,829
dynasty stuff this phenotype in

1656
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:05,069
particular this was actually the Cali

1657
01:13:01,828 --> 01:13:07,738
Snapple you know we had a Miss Universe

1658
01:13:05,069 --> 01:13:10,649
you know and a calyx that you know I

1659
01:13:07,738 --> 01:13:12,178
decided the Miss Universe is really nice

1660
01:13:10,649 --> 01:13:15,738
it was just kind of like that really

1661
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:18,210
sweet the kind of pineapple and and this

1662
01:13:15,738 --> 01:13:19,919
the number three we call it but the Cali

1663
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:21,569
Snapple for you know definitely I used

1664
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,578
to grow a lot of Cali miss back in the

1665
01:13:21,569 --> 01:13:26,488
didn't has the same look on it but it

1666
01:13:23,578 --> 01:13:28,158
has that kind of overwrite but also

1667
01:13:26,488 --> 01:13:30,589
little sour under

1668
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:32,750
west coast true pineapple turf there

1669
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:36,679
minding the Goldstar pineapple I've run

1670
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:38,510
southern Humboldt and yeah exactly I

1671
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:40,579
think it's our first wash on that one

1672
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:44,000
and this is from an indoor run organic

1673
01:13:40,579 --> 01:13:46,429
you know indoor living soil cycle so

1674
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,899
I'll have more results on it coming and

1675
01:13:46,429 --> 01:13:53,779
we actually I dry for two weeks so I at

1676
01:13:50,899 --> 01:13:56,479
you know at first that I go for a sixty

1677
01:13:53,779 --> 01:13:58,189
degree or a fifty degrees 50 percent and

1678
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:02,059
then I'll shift my second week into

1679
01:13:58,189 --> 01:14:04,339
sixty degrees 60 percent and I kind of

1680
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:07,190
do my patch drying air drying the same

1681
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:10,069
way it takes me two weeks like dial it

1682
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:12,349
does the two weeks breakdown really from

1683
01:14:10,069 --> 01:14:14,689
like when we've getting cured resin even

1684
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:17,150
material or from when we cut the plants

1685
01:14:14,689 --> 01:14:20,960
down with us a month before we even see

1686
01:14:17,149 --> 01:14:22,579
on our cured resin bubble - you know I

1687
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,840
guess a couple weeks we'll know what the

1688
01:14:22,579 --> 01:14:28,789
pineapple destino did more and honestly

1689
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,469
yeah I'm not exactly sure we run so many

1690
01:14:28,789 --> 01:14:32,090
flavors on it I'd have to just go back

1691
01:14:30,469 --> 01:14:34,429
to the room to see what the resins

1692
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:39,050
looking like right now but and what the

1693
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:41,719
date on it is for exactly the day we yes

1694
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:44,869
I feel I feel really bad for you having

1695
01:14:41,719 --> 01:14:46,899
to do all that haha it's horrible so

1696
01:14:44,869 --> 01:14:49,429
tough

1697
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:51,559
that's rough for sure what about you fly

1698
01:14:49,429 --> 01:14:53,929
got anything to share today man

1699
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,850
going on make it hash you know you're on

1700
01:14:53,929 --> 01:14:56,960
mute let me unmute you there you go

1701
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:59,150
there you go

1702
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:01,239
well I do run a lot of Hayes's and they

1703
01:14:59,149 --> 01:15:03,920
return like one to two percent but

1704
01:15:01,238 --> 01:15:06,859
they're very worth it even though

1705
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:10,940
they're flour for 14 weeks or so it is

1706
01:15:06,859 --> 01:15:12,679
my favorite hash to smoke I mean what he

1707
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:14,329
had I mean you guys are talking to all

1708
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:16,359
the right numbers for the freeze dryers

1709
01:15:14,329 --> 01:15:20,569
and everything I mean I do vary

1710
01:15:16,359 --> 01:15:22,698
depending on the resin so I find a lot

1711
01:15:20,569 --> 01:15:26,899
of the sativas have a lot drier resin

1712
01:15:22,698 --> 01:15:29,138
even when you wash them in water and so

1713
01:15:26,899 --> 01:15:33,469
I vary the temperatures I'll I'll have

1714
01:15:29,139 --> 01:15:36,380
15 for those and 20 for most everything

1715
01:15:33,469 --> 01:15:38,448
else other than that I run you know the

1716
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:39,850
machines relatively exactly the same I

1717
01:15:38,448 --> 01:15:41,658
mean when you have so much knowledge

1718
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:43,010
sitting it

1719
01:15:41,658 --> 01:15:46,189
right here what can you really add

1720
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:46,850
compared to the people that borrow than

1721
01:15:46,189 --> 01:15:48,738
the rest of us

1722
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:51,199
you could you could pop a big bowl of

1723
01:15:48,738 --> 01:15:53,629

01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:40,370
phenomenal I was always a really great

1762
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:41,049
variety from yes or I mean I guess

1763
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:44,510
seedbank

1764
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:46,480
ya know for sure you had the old ones I

1765
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:51,739
mean I have a lot of old on unpolluted

1766
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:53,718
genetics you know so it's nice it's nice

1767
01:17:51,738 --> 01:17:55,519
to have unpolluted genetics and I don't

1768
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:58,039
mean polluted by it

1769
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:03,350
sounded bad but just on like I thought

1770
01:17:58,039 --> 01:18:06,289
what you mean they are hybrids but you

1771
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:08,180
know haven't been modern updates oh it's

1772
01:18:06,289 --> 01:18:10,609
gone right exactly

1773
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:12,170
it reminds me of my sort of rarest seed

1774
01:18:10,609 --> 01:18:13,699
that I have in my collection that I've

1775
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:16,940
been collecting seeds for almost 30

1776
01:18:13,699 --> 01:18:19,159
years and probably my rarest that I have

1777
01:18:16,939 --> 01:18:21,079
and I got some good ones for sure like

1778
01:18:19,159 --> 01:18:23,329
friends they don't see banks just send

1779
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:24,710
me their full collections like just full

1780
01:18:23,329 --> 01:18:27,019
here's this is what my seed collection

1781
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:30,230
has and I get like every seed that they

1782
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:32,750
have so I have a big collection but like

1783
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:36,019
one of my favorites is from an old

1784
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:39,710
internet friend called the Mulla Mulla

1785
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:41,810
madman and it was his father who would

1786
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:43,670
grow back in the day and was involved

1787
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:47,030
with producing the Mullin didn't be

1788
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:48,890
madness which was just this crazy plant

1789
01:18:47,029 --> 01:18:51,229
he used to post pictures of it on

1790
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:54,560
overgrow it was like 18 feet wide and 12

1791
01:18:51,229 --> 01:18:57,079
feet high and get like 15 pounds of herb

1792
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,760
off of it but like 10 would still be on

1793
01:18:57,079 --> 01:19:02,210
the plant and smalls that he wouldn't

1794
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:04,640
bother coming out he just make I have

1795
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:07,039
seeds from his dad's collection I also

1796
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,840
have his seeds from like his own version

1797
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:11,510
of it kind of thing but he gave me like

1798
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:15,199
30 seeds from his dad's original

1799
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:21,920
collection I have kept those things geez

1800
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:26,809
for the last 22 years earlier for some

1801
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:29,869
reason has the most diverse like mutant

1802
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:31,370
type genetics that we've seen like the

1803
01:19:29,869 --> 01:19:33,619
mullet it'd be madness I think that

1804
01:19:31,369 --> 01:19:36,829
supposedly had some Papa New Guinea

1805
01:19:33,619 --> 01:19:39,380
something in it right yeah oh yeah dude

1806
01:19:36,829 --> 01:19:41,809
like everything you know it's which is

1807
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:44,739
one of the most unique islands in the

1808
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:47,090
world - in terms of genetic diversity

1809
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:51,340
then you have the duck's foot that came

1810
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:53,750
from out there while the ABC right the

1811
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:56,529
Australian bastard cannabis which is the

1812
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:58,819
one that doesn't even look like weed and

1813
01:19:56,529 --> 01:20:04,429
one of the most interesting ones that's

1814
01:19:58,819 --> 01:20:05,779
happened recently is the what is it it's

1815
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:07,890
the one that looks like a fern

1816
01:20:05,779 --> 01:20:09,960
yeah freesia

1817
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:11,250
yeah freak show yeah you know I don't

1818
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,810
think that one necessarily has anything

1819
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:17,279
to do with Australia but in terms of

1820
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:19,380
like morphologically unique cannabis you

1821
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:24,059
know three out of the four known really

1822
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:25,770
weird ones are are from Australia or two

1823
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:27,660
out of three it's just interesting well

1824
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:32,850
I don't see kangaroos anywhere else in

1825
01:20:27,659 --> 01:20:38,039
the world either no or talk about some

1826
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:46,829
tripped-out [ __ ] is the first the duck

1827
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:48,210
who is the first one I ever saw and it I

1828
01:20:46,829 --> 01:20:50,130
thought while he was in Central America

1829
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:52,590
because of just the photos he used to

1830
01:20:50,130 --> 01:21:03,960
post on over overgrow it just I just

1831
01:20:52,590 --> 01:21:07,890
assumed yeah I grew out some of those

1832
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:09,840
seeds that duck ducks flip pure the

1833
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:11,340
Ducks foot blueberry I can't remember

1834
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,890
what there was one other cross that he

1835
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:17,989
had to and I've also grown like Hawaii

1836
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:21,690
webbed indica which seems potentially

1837
01:21:17,989 --> 01:21:24,840
related or you know hybrid of something

1838
01:21:21,689 --> 01:21:27,179
of that nature I was just gonna quickly

1839
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:29,340
say that you know shout out to wali duck

1840
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:30,810
for almost setting his hair on fire at

1841
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:32,400
one of the first legends of hashed

1842
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:35,520
dinners that we ever clearer than

1843
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:37,949
Amsterdam and also shout out to Wally

1844
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,870
duck for literally carrying like 75

1845
01:21:37,949 --> 01:21:41,760
pounds of ice on his head like a boss

1846
01:21:39,869 --> 01:21:44,159
and plus like I don't know who's

1847
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:46,199
probably 105 degrees in the shade in

1848
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:49,529
Jamaica when me him a gypsy Ravana

1849
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:51,569
walked through the bush with a couple of

1850
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:53,340
hours the far-end dudes to the mountain

1851
01:21:51,569 --> 01:21:56,039
of weed that was awaiting us and it was

1852
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:58,680
like this hour-long hour plus long walk

1853
01:21:56,039 --> 01:22:01,050
through the jungle to get to this

1854
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:03,840
mountain of weed and we had to carry we

1855
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:05,310
all have to take turns and man I'll tell

1856
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,470
you both gypsy and I were looking pretty

1857
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:11,220
red when that that thing of ice was on

1858
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:12,900
our heads but Wally being from Australia

1859
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:14,369
and he's a little guy he's not a big

1860
01:22:12,899 --> 01:22:16,109
dude it was just like no it was just

1861
01:22:14,369 --> 01:22:19,590
nothing you could tell that the work

1862
01:22:16,109 --> 01:22:20,539
ethic ethic of an outdoor Australian

1863
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:25,739
gorilla

1864
01:22:20,539 --> 01:22:27,659
was no [ __ ] joke for real that was

1865
01:22:25,739 --> 01:22:29,729
legit well he's the kind of guy you want

1866
01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:31,319

1867
01:22:29,729 --> 01:22:33,059
won't be sitting and hanging out on a

1868
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:34,649
hammock he'll be like I know exactly how

1869
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:36,380
this works and I'm gonna put in the work

1870
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:39,479
to make sure it keeps working I

1871

1874
01:22:43,319 --> 01:22:49,529
you got - those are big sad tale I went

1875
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:50,970
down and learned how to make - and it

1876
01:22:49,529 --> 01:22:52,619
was like I spent the weekend with him

1877
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:54,740
and it was not just making hash you know

1878
01:22:52,619 --> 01:22:57,630
it was like tending to the fields

1879
01:22:54,739 --> 01:23:00,000
feeding the animals you know shoveling

1880
01:22:57,630 --> 01:23:01,289
[ __ ] into the the hubell like it was a

1881
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,390
bunch of work you know and it was a ton

1882
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:06,180
of fun I learned so much more than just

1883
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:08,160
how to make and isolate pure resin you

1884
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:13,260
know well because to him that is making

1885
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:16,529
how much exactly the inside out yeah

1886
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:19,500
it's lifestyle at this point thank you

1887
01:23:16,529 --> 01:23:21,119
for sharing with me thank you dude thank

1888
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:24,060
you for being like one of the true

1889
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:26,279
homies that like you know deserved it

1890
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:28,200
and like well you know respect it and

1891
01:23:26,279 --> 01:23:29,609
[ __ ] - there's a lot of people there's

1892
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:36,359
some [ __ ] boys out there I like to say

1893
01:23:29,609 --> 01:23:37,289
and yeah yeah I'm glad you respected it

1894
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:39,989
you did it right

1895
01:23:37,289 --> 01:23:41,789
he came correct and that's what matters

1896
01:23:39,989 --> 01:23:43,559
man I'd like to feel like teaching him

1897
01:23:41,789 --> 01:23:46,439
acted like knighting a knight and like

1898
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:49,380
or like kinda you have to like chill

1899
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:51,989
with like master Rafi and like sign wax

1900
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:53,789
off and and like when you learn this

1901
01:23:51,989 --> 01:23:56,969
[ __ ] like that then it's like this upper

1902
01:23:53,789 --> 01:23:57,479
level of respect and yeah that's what

1903
01:23:56,970 --> 01:24:00,360
it's all about

1904
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:03,179
yeah right plus big-time brother I

1905
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:04,529
appreciate you yeah it was that was my

1906
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:06,869
all-time favorite thing back in the day

1907
01:24:04,529 --> 01:24:09,719
to do back in the early days when really

1908
01:24:06,869 --> 01:24:12,449
it just it wasn't known like nine point

1909
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:13,890
nine out of ten people I'd show it to

1910
01:24:12,449 --> 01:24:16,739
would just be like whoa what is this

1911
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:19,530
like this is so crazy it was a very

1912
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:22,380
unique time and I definitely missed that

1913
01:24:19,529 --> 01:24:24,119
now being on a level where I don't I

1914
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:26,940
mean I I try to do as much as possible

1915
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:29,039
on that level but I'm definitely more

1916
01:24:26,939 --> 01:24:31,379
removed from it and not being able to

1917
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:32,939
just have my greenhouse out behind the

1918
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:33,380
house and have people come over and be

1919
01:24:32,939 --> 01:24:35,178
like

1920
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:37,369
it's it's hella hard when you don't have

1921
01:24:35,179 --> 01:24:38,690
land and even with some you know a lot

1922
01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:40,340
of people have land around here but then

1923
01:24:38,689 --> 01:24:44,509
you have to have the motivation so it's

1924
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:46,000
like this big look on a on an acre you

1925
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:49,369
could do a lot with it anchor you know I

1926
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,679
will tell you that so I mean you know

1927
01:24:49,369 --> 01:24:54,139
it's just whether you got the time or

1928
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:57,139
the means of doing and this and that you

1929
01:24:54,139 --> 01:24:58,940
know it all comes together but I look I

1930
01:24:57,139 --> 01:25:01,699
look up to the ones that you know that

1931
01:24:58,939 --> 01:25:03,559
food storage like a year's worth of food

1932
01:25:01,698 --> 01:25:05,178
and not have to go to the store at all

1933
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,789
to even buy food like we don't go to the

1934
01:25:05,179 --> 01:25:09,770
store to get you know grow material but

1935
01:25:07,789 --> 01:25:11,719
we do have to go sometimes to get you

1936
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:13,340
know sugar or like know or something

1937
01:25:11,719 --> 01:25:14,929
like that but we you know we raise our

1938
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:18,020
own poultry and stuff so we we knock

1939
01:25:14,929 --> 01:25:20,899
things out like every year to be like

1940
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:22,580
more sustainable and more off-grid but

1941
01:25:20,899 --> 01:25:23,198
still like you know how the lights

1942
01:25:22,579 --> 01:25:26,329

this is upcoming year so you did a lot

1951
01:25:43,369 --> 01:25:50,960
of pre-planning it goes deep and this

1952
01:25:46,789 --> 01:25:53,238

01:25:57,350 --> 01:26:01,190
want to like have a farm and have

1957
01:25:59,329 --> 01:26:04,000
everything like be regenerative and

1958
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:07,219
sustainable and way beyond what you know

1959
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,619
organic it it's more than just quality

1960
01:26:07,219 --> 01:26:11,899
of resin I mean like I eat you know

1961
01:26:09,619 --> 01:26:13,939
three meals a day and those have to be

1962
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:16,069
quality to well I say it all the time

1963
01:26:13,939 --> 01:26:18,379
man if you're gonna smoke full melt hash

1964
01:26:16,069 --> 01:26:20,479
why wouldn't you eat full mount resin

1965
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:22,819
and have full mount relationships and

1966
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:25,279
your entertainment is full mount and

1967
01:26:22,819 --> 01:26:27,198
everything is that it's just a bar that

1968
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:29,899
you said that's like this is this is

1969
01:26:27,198 --> 01:26:32,029
what full melt means to me and what it

1970
01:26:29,899 --> 01:26:34,939
means is that clean is then but the

1971
01:26:32,029 --> 01:26:39,649
purest that just like perfectly you know

1972
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:41,960
grown sustainably grown because you know

1973
01:26:39,649 --> 01:26:44,388
a lot of stuff that we do nowadays is

1974
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:45,960
nonce is not sustainable and now it's

1975
01:26:44,389 --> 01:26:47,940
catching up with with the young

1976
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,739
generations there they're seeing like

1977
01:26:47,939 --> 01:26:53,549
all the things that have been done are

1978
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:55,319
not so easily undone yeah totally I feel

1979
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:57,750
that a lot of people get inspired by

1980
01:26:55,319 --> 01:26:58,949
what we do here and I just found that

1981
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:00,600
you can go out and just gotta try to

1982
01:26:58,949 --> 01:27:02,909
work together in your community and

1983
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:05,060
build something out of nothing it's

1984
01:27:02,909 --> 01:27:07,289
really possible you it's the effort that

1985
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:09,630
beforehand no one really wants to do

1986
01:27:07,289 --> 01:27:12,569
because it's not you know you're not

1987
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:14,460
custom and or not used to doing it so

1988
01:27:12,569 --> 01:27:18,090
it's just a little bit harder to get

1989
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:20,039
that new new change but it's possible

1990
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:22,560
people just gotta do it and it takes a

1991
01:27:20,039 --> 01:27:24,600
long time to get to that level I mean I

1992
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,310
know Brandon you can work in your spot

1993
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:28,920
for like what nearly a decade or

1994
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:31,410
something so I mean it's it's not just

1995
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:33,989
overnight like oh look at me oh I don't

1996
01:27:31,409 --> 01:27:35,909
know like whatever thousands of

1997
01:27:33,988 --> 01:27:38,909
followers on Instagram it's a lot of

1998
01:27:35,909 --> 01:27:40,889
really hard work that you put in day and

1999
01:27:38,909 --> 01:27:42,359
night you know like yourselves like

2000
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:44,789
you're losing all the time and that's

2001
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:46,500
the best teacher right dude it totally

2002
01:27:44,789 --> 01:27:48,719
said I mean like I said it's a lifestyle

2003
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:52,770
at this point we eat sleep and breathe

2004
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:54,539
this five acres that were on and it work

2005
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:56,760
full-blown like I could tell you how

2006
01:27:54,539 --> 01:27:59,939
many days off I have a year and it's

2007
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,980
probably like around a week of my life

2008
01:27:59,939 --> 01:28:03,750
is its separate you know and it's

2009
01:28:01,979 --> 01:28:07,019
full-blown but I love what I do you know

2010
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:08,640
and and if I didn't do it I don't know I

2011
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:10,560
wouldn't be doing as good for the earth

2012
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:12,000
you know and that's why I woke up one

2013
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,620
day I just got woke and that's what it

2014
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,930
all came to it's like how can I help the

2015
01:28:13,619 --> 01:28:19,590
earth if I can just stay on my property

2016

place fertile and collect seed to ensure

2018
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:28,920
that that's my security and that's

2019
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:31,289
that's the quality of life you know I

2020
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:32,940
mean this it goes deep yeah it just goes

2021
01:28:31,289 --> 01:28:36,569
deep that's a whole nother like

2022

01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:14,819
food and is one of the thing is one of

2037
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:18,300
the reasons why I do grow my own suits

2038
01:29:14,819 --> 01:29:20,279
is because of what you said if you're if

2039
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:22,529
you're dabbing really really good

2040
01:29:20,279 --> 01:29:24,408
organic cash and you're sourcing it and

2041
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:29,219
you're growing it like you might as well

2045
01:29:33,599 --> 01:29:37,380

2046
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:40,198
six star filter and you're like oh damn

2047

eighth or plus or whatever just a good

2051
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:56,448

step right good resin good mind get

2056
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:06,329

better there's not bother huh

2058
01:30:06,329 --> 01:30:10,618
not the destruction not the poisons

2059
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:13,259
[ __ ] clouding up the mind you know

2060
01:30:10,618 --> 01:30:14,729
one of my first customer letters that

2061
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:16,440
one of the first women that bought

2062
01:30:14,729 --> 01:30:18,299
bubble bags for me and sent me a letter

2063
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:20,609
she wrote me a letter she said her

2064
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,889
father was it was elderly and he was

2065
01:30:20,609 --> 01:30:24,988
suffering from wasting syndrome and he

2066
01:30:22,889 --> 01:30:27,510
was very like maybe 90 pounds or less

2067
01:30:24,988 --> 01:30:30,000
and he was passing away from from not

2068
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:32,520
being able to eat any food from from the

2069
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,920
drugs they had him odd and so she had

2070
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:37,110
somehow seen like a video I did on pot

2071
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:38,969
TV about water hash and she was like I'm

2072
01:30:37,109 --> 01:30:40,649
gonna buy some bubble bags and you know

2073
01:30:38,969 --> 01:30:42,480
she was at first it was through emails

2074
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:45,479
and she finally said him to thank you

2075
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:48,468
letter that I'm about to get to the end

2076
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:50,789
of the story it was mostly just emails

2077
01:30:48,469 --> 01:30:55,079
you know explaining to me okay I'm gonna

2078
01:30:50,789 --> 01:30:56,609
I'm gonna go out on I'm gonna go out in

2079
01:30:55,079 --> 01:30:58,139
the streets you know she was from the

2080
01:30:56,609 --> 01:31:00,420
Midwest and I'm gonna try and buy some

2081
01:30:58,139 --> 01:31:02,069
marijuana and she ended up finding like

2082
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:03,630
an ounce of herb I think she got burnt

2083
01:31:02,069 --> 01:31:06,269
the first time it was like totally

2084
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:07,679
sketchy for this woman to do this and so

2085
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:09,989
she ended up doing it she got the herb

2086
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:11,609
she went home and made the hash out of

2087
01:31:09,988 --> 01:31:12,599
the bubble bags for following the simple

2088
01:31:11,609 --> 01:31:14,219
instructions

2089
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:16,340
and she so she had written me a letter

2090
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:19,230
saying you know I did all the stuff I

2091
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:23,730
basically put a little tiny bit of a

2092
01:31:19,229 --> 01:31:27,029
cash into my father's corncob pipe I was

2093
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:29,189
like old and he smoked this little bit

2094
01:31:27,029 --> 01:31:31,380
of hash of bubble hash and basically the

2095
01:31:29,189 --> 01:31:33,479
big you know she she said he ate an

2096
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:35,220
entire chocolate cake a McCain's

2097
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:37,769
chocolate cake he ate the whole thing

2098
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:41,610
that night and this [ __ ] had not

2099
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:43,830
been eating food period so I I get it at

2100
01:31:41,609 --> 01:31:45,960
first I laugh - I was like oh my god cuz

2101
01:31:43,829 --> 01:31:47,819
it's the classic stereotype let's make

2102
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:49,739
fun of the the stoners that have the

2103
01:31:47,819 --> 01:31:51,329
munchies it's just so much more profound

2104
01:31:49,739 --> 01:31:53,010
when it's gonna put the elderly man

2105
01:31:51,329 --> 01:31:55,079
who's passing away from wasting syndrome

2106
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:56,400
who is now not only improving the

2107
01:31:55,079 --> 01:31:58,769
quality of his life but actually

2108
01:31:56,399 --> 01:32:00,479
increasing the quality and the extension

2109
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:02,990
of his life and so it was a very

2110
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:05,789
profound story to be told you know like

2111
01:32:02,989 --> 01:32:08,159
1999 selling bubble bags kind of just

2112
01:32:05,789 --> 01:32:09,989
like more of a connoisseur guy myself I

2113
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:12,300
had come out of the BC compassion club

2114
01:32:09,989 --> 01:32:14,219
so I did have that full history of

2115
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:16,350
helping the club and acquire in cannabis

2116
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:17,789
for the club and getting busted for the

2117
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:19,500
club for those of you that don't know I

2118
01:32:17,789 --> 01:32:21,449
started the bubble bag company after

2119
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:24,270
getting busted with a bunch of herb that

2120
01:32:21,449 --> 01:32:26,039
I had for the for the BC compassion club

2121
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:27,930
for Hillary blacks compassion club which

2122
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:30,930
I ended up going through court and

2123
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:32,880
getting no fine in no time and the judge

2124
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:34,980
even ordered the money be given back so

2125
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:37,619
it was kind of a big deal at that time

2126
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:39,449
when I had that happen that I decided I

2127
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:41,279
wasn't gonna be doing that anymore and

2128
01:32:39,449 --> 01:32:43,470
working in the underground cannabis

2129
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:45,899
world I was gonna like transition and

2130
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:47,699
create an above ground I mean really it

2131
01:32:45,899 --> 01:32:49,799
was my lawyer who taught me because I

2132
01:32:47,699 --> 01:32:51,300
would they caught me with six grand cash

2133
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,100
and they called the proceeds of crime

2134
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:54,570
and then my lawyer would be like hey you

2135
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,250
owe me ten grand and I'd give him like

2136
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,840
ten grand and then he'd throw it into

2137
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:59,850
like a paper bag and put it on his front

2138
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,680
seat of his car and drive home and I'm

2139
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:03,150
like how the [ __ ] is that not proceeds

2140
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,950
of crime and he's just like well you

2141
01:33:03,149 --> 01:33:06,479
know cuz I went to school about degrees

2142
01:33:04,949 --> 01:33:08,130
and I'm a lawyer and when you give me

2143
01:33:06,479 --> 01:33:10,289
that money it's not proceeds of crime

2144
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:12,090
and so I figured is there a way for me

2145
01:33:10,289 --> 01:33:15,119
to access money from the cannabis

2146
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:18,449
industry and give them something back

2147
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:20,279
for it that's not breaking the law but

2148
01:33:18,449 --> 01:33:22,109
still acquiring because man let's be

2149
01:33:20,279 --> 01:33:26,509
honest every one that bought bubble bags

2150
01:33:22,109 --> 01:33:28,699
since forever has bought those Bo

2151
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:32,119
bags with money that they made growing

2152
01:33:28,699 --> 01:33:34,159
cannabis it's like literally like 99.9%

2153
01:33:32,119 --> 01:33:36,529
of people that bought ice and that's

2154
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:41,930
okay that's okay don't don't shush me

2155
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:44,179
man I liked it though so just a little

2156
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:46,579
story I think I got six more minutes if

2157
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:48,289
you guys if Pula wants to chime in pull

2158
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:49,729
you got the killer hash dude and you're

2159
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:54,949
on the island who aren't you in like

2160
01:33:49,729 --> 01:33:56,869
Hawaii no I'm in Oregon now well you are

2161
01:33:54,949 --> 01:33:59,329
in Oregon yeah weren't you

2162
01:33:56,869 --> 01:34:02,300
oh you just during that last meeting I

2163
01:33:59,329 --> 01:34:12,949
was in white for my family late

2164
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:15,529
Christmas it's straight fire I know you

2165
01:34:12,949 --> 01:34:17,300
you know a little bit of your story but

2166
01:34:15,529 --> 01:34:18,529
we I don't want to invite you on and

2167
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:20,510
then not have you say anything because

2168
01:34:18,529 --> 01:34:22,429
all of us were so anxious to talk I want

2169
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:25,190
to hear from you I value your opinion

2170
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:28,430
oh right on um so lately I just been

2171
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:30,859
messing with the like wicking timing and

2172
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:35,060
the temperature of like the fridge that

2173
01:34:30,859 --> 01:34:37,880
I use to keep the hash in because I only

2174
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:40,160
are dry and seep so with all these

2175
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:41,840
different cultivars like they they have

2176
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:44,689
different timings to where they can

2177
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:47,840
become easily break apart into rough

2178
01:34:44,689 --> 01:34:50,539
edges that touch the sieve and will just

2179
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:52,819
turn into dust by itself without having

2180
01:34:50,539 --> 01:34:55,819
to really put pressure on it or change

2181
01:34:52,819 --> 01:34:59,059
the hash and I like it because I get to

2182
01:34:55,819 --> 01:35:02,750
see the whole process of it becoming dry

2183
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:06,200
hash yeah but yeah definitely the way

2184
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:09,010
that cubicles and the waxes like hold on

2185
01:35:06,199 --> 01:35:11,869
to moisture and like all of them as well

2186
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:14,060
just have all different feels to them in

2187
01:35:11,869 --> 01:35:15,619
different textures and I've just been

2188
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:18,020
messing with the Wiccan time a lot

2189
01:35:15,619 --> 01:35:20,420
lately especially for really greasy

2190
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:24,890
trainset like don't really yield very

2191
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:28,369
well today I was doing a great pie and I

2192
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:30,170
don't really like great pie but it's

2193
01:35:28,369 --> 01:35:34,039
really greasy and really hard to work

2194
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:36,260
with but if if I got enough water out of

2195
01:35:34,039 --> 01:35:40,279
it fast enough on the screen in the

2196
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:43,550
fridge and it has to be down to like

2197
01:35:40,279 --> 01:35:46,038
around 25 I'm getting disliked fridge -

2198
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:47,179
and and it's crazy like what Fletcher

2199
01:35:46,038 --> 01:35:50,029
was saying earlier about you know

2200
01:35:47,179 --> 01:35:52,489
terpenes like sometimes don't freeze and

2201
01:35:50,029 --> 01:35:54,738
like you know it's crazy to play with

2202
01:35:52,488 --> 01:35:57,769
that of how cold do you need to go to

2203
01:35:54,738 --> 01:36:01,098
like work with it like another stream

2204
01:35:57,770 --> 01:36:03,980
that is easily workable in like a 50

2205
01:36:01,099 --> 01:36:06,650
degree room but um so I've been playing

2206
01:36:03,979 --> 01:36:08,718
with that a lot and in the past year

2207
01:36:06,649 --> 01:36:11,569
we've been like really into looking at

2208
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:13,489
like chem crosses because we really like

2209
01:36:11,569 --> 01:36:16,609
chem dog me and the farmer that I work

2210
01:36:13,488 --> 01:36:19,158
with and a lot of it just has a lot of

2211
01:36:16,609 --> 01:36:21,488
waxy stuff but when you go through a

2212
01:36:19,158 --> 01:36:26,328
bunch you can finally find something

2213
01:36:21,488 --> 01:36:29,328
release 5% and and most of its full nail

2214
01:36:26,328 --> 01:36:31,698
and it's there's even some in 180 and

2215
01:36:29,328 --> 01:36:34,969
the one we found lately in the Kimberley

2216
01:36:31,698 --> 01:36:38,269
chem has been our favorite and even 180s

2217
01:36:34,969 --> 01:36:40,698
clean and full mill and like honestly

2218
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:42,949
the rosin off of it's like the tastiest

2219
01:36:40,698 --> 01:36:45,229
one out of all the microns from that

2220
01:36:42,948 --> 01:36:47,598
strain it's a pretty cool strain in a

2221
01:36:45,229 --> 01:36:49,519
really cool plant from it so and you're

2222
01:36:47,599 --> 01:36:53,630
talking fresh frozen for a five percent

2223
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:57,770
yield fresh frozen yeah it's good damn

2224
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:59,239
you know twenty percent yeah so so it's

2225
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:01,610
pretty sweet because we really like the

2226
01:36:59,238 --> 01:37:03,408
chem dog profile and we want to be able

2227
01:37:01,609 --> 01:37:07,698
to have like nice clean hash of it to

2228
01:37:03,408 --> 01:37:11,149
you at a reasonable yield it's delicious

2229
01:37:07,698 --> 01:37:13,549
very good man I really enjoy it oh yeah

2230
01:37:11,149 --> 01:37:17,000
thank you relate to that too with the

2231
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:18,730
breeze Ryan you know the thing I found

2232
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,859
for retaining the most terpenes is

2233
01:37:18,729 --> 01:37:23,569
really just getting as is reducing the

2234
01:37:21,859 --> 01:37:27,729
amount of time it's under vacuum that's

2235
01:37:23,569 --> 01:37:30,529
obviously right place to start right

2236
01:37:27,729 --> 01:37:33,709
removing as much water as you can before

2237
01:37:30,529 --> 01:37:37,009
you're putting it in to the the vacuum

2238
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:39,139
while avoiding compaction right where

2239
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:43,610
it's like compressed on itself and now

2240
01:37:39,139 --> 01:37:45,949
it's hard harder to freeze dry uh so you

2241
01:37:43,609 --> 01:37:47,299
know like I made those screens for

2242
01:37:45,948 --> 01:37:49,098
awhile I just don't have time to make

2243
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:51,288
them but that's that's the thing that

2244
01:37:49,099 --> 01:37:53,779
you know we've had batches of hash that

2245
01:37:51,288 --> 01:37:56,018
dry in six to eight hours in the freeze

2246
01:37:53,779 --> 01:37:56,018
dryer

2247
01:37:56,369 --> 01:38:03,010
overall time or just final dry time just

2248
01:38:00,010 --> 01:38:07,360
just running final dry basically right

2249
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:09,340
so freeze it ship it so freeze it with

2250
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:10,689
you know hardly any water leave

2251
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:12,489
basically what you're trying to do is

2252
01:38:10,689 --> 01:38:15,189
get the water out of it really quickly

2253
01:38:12,489 --> 01:38:19,119
through wicking and then you pop it in

2254
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:20,889
to your pre frozen freeze dryer right so

2255
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:22,840
when you pop it in and immediately like

2256
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:25,660
within a couple minutes the whole patty

2257
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:28,270
is frozen and you can literally go in

2258
01:38:25,659 --> 01:38:31,000
break it up into chips and throw it back

2259
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:33,010
in on the screen and run your cycle and

2260
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,989
like we've pulled stuff out like six

2261
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:38,380
hours and except for like the very

2262
01:38:34,989 --> 01:38:40,300
thickest pieces there'd be a little ice

2263
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:41,920
in the center right on and it would be

2264
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:45,880
strain dependent and summarize there'll

2265
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:48,159
be already be dry and that's the you

2266
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:49,750
know that's not you can't do that with

2267
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:52,840
everything right and that was like

2268
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:57,729
smaller runs not big hole trays full

2269
01:38:52,840 --> 01:39:00,279
right but that's just what I've seen is

2270
01:38:57,729 --> 01:39:01,959
basically removing as much because all

2271
01:39:00,279 --> 01:39:04,149
you're doing is removing water right

2272
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:05,980
during the process so if you have less

2273
01:39:04,149 --> 01:39:08,889
water volume to start with of course

2274
01:39:05,979 --> 01:39:10,869
it's gonna take less time to finish then

2275
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:12,760
increasing the surface area by chipping

2276
01:39:10,869 --> 01:39:15,399
it up and breaking it up as well I feel

2277
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:17,890
like that really helps also being on a

2278
01:39:15,399 --> 01:39:20,529
screen inside of the instead of being on

2279
01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:24,820
a tray we're only one sides exposed both

2280
01:39:20,529 --> 01:39:26,649
sides are exposed so it's I know it's

2281
01:39:24,819 --> 01:39:29,049
all of these things together all

2282
01:39:26,649 --> 01:39:31,719
contribute to it but the main one being

2283
01:39:29,050 --> 01:39:34,810
if you have let's say 100 milliliters of

2284
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:37,270
water in a typical pour pour into your

2285
01:39:34,810 --> 01:39:42,450
regular tray and you reduce that to 15

2286
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:45,310
milliliters it's significantly less time

2287
01:39:42,449 --> 01:39:47,769
the first time I saw that tech being

2288
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:51,430
used was in Spain babi colada from La

2289
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:53,920
Caleta was showing it to me and then you

2290
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:56,110
know although we had talked to I had

2291
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:59,560
talked to space greens over the phone

2292
01:39:56,109 --> 01:40:01,899
one time with Frenchy and nicotine and

2293
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:03,400
we really didn't understand exactly what

2294
01:40:01,899 --> 01:40:05,949
he was saying when I saw it from Bobby

2295
01:40:03,399 --> 01:40:08,089
colada I have to tell you it was fast it

2296
01:40:05,949 --> 01:40:11,659
was way significantly faster

2297
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:13,789
and the drive that I finally drive I do

2298
01:40:11,659 --> 01:40:16,309
and it was really nice that chipped that

2299
01:40:13,789 --> 01:40:18,439
chipped ice now when I use the freezer I

2300
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:20,750
check mice no matter what even though

2301
01:40:18,439 --> 01:40:22,009
I'm not using the space mean stick but I

2302
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:25,689
want to say that everything I've seen

2303
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:28,489
from that has been pretty sad match

2304
01:40:25,689 --> 01:40:30,919
absolutely big shout out to Bobby colada

2305
01:40:28,489 --> 01:40:33,250
always has treated us amazing when we're

2306
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:36,020
in Barcelona he even made a private

2307
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:38,090
non-smoking room for stuntman Sam and

2308
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:40,940
myself one year when we went up to try

2309
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:43,130
his dry set that was a huge thing you

2310
01:40:40,939 --> 01:40:45,500
know Spain they smoked so much both

2311
01:40:43,130 --> 01:40:47,380
joints and cigarettes and for him to

2312
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:50,689
make this little room and hit within

2313
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:52,400
colada that we could go and smoke you

2314
01:40:50,689 --> 01:40:54,169
know it was basically just Sam and

2315
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:55,989
myself in there and then and then Bobby

2316
01:40:54,170 --> 01:40:58,789
and a few of the like a lot of guys but

2317
01:40:55,989 --> 01:41:00,710
it was very cool of him to do and it was

2318
01:40:58,789 --> 01:41:02,600
definitely above and beyond and those

2319
01:41:00,710 --> 01:41:05,449
guys know quality they make great hash

2320
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:07,579
dry sift as well as bubble hash and they

2321
01:41:05,449 --> 01:41:11,179
have they were the first ones to that I

2322
01:41:07,579 --> 01:41:13,010
saw laser etched logos and such into the

2323
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:14,690
rosin so I've seen a couple of people do

2324
01:41:13,010 --> 01:41:17,239
it since but and it's not like it's the

2325
01:41:14,689 --> 01:41:19,669
most complex technology but what a cool

2326
01:41:17,239 --> 01:41:20,899
thing to be the pioneer and I got I got

2327
01:41:19,670 --> 01:41:21,710
to give it to those guys that's where I

2328
01:41:20,899 --> 01:41:23,989
saw it first

2329
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:25,850
I hate to cut it down because I could

2330
01:41:23,989 --> 01:41:28,880
talk with you guys for another hour easy

2331
01:41:25,850 --> 01:41:30,770
but I do have to go to Whistler I have a

2332
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,659
place rented up there for the weekend

2333
01:41:30,770 --> 01:41:34,700
and it's my whole family is on the other

2334
01:41:32,659 --> 01:41:36,710
side of the store literally my little

2335
01:41:34,699 --> 01:41:38,779
guys wearing his pajamas right now like

2336
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:40,489
bouncing off the walls ready to go up to

2337
01:41:38,779 --> 01:41:42,829
Whistler because he's got ski school at

2338
01:41:40,489 --> 01:41:44,809
at 8 o'clock in the morning tomorrow and

2339
01:41:42,829 --> 01:41:47,269
it gets to go I don't know they're doing

2340
01:41:44,810 --> 01:41:48,830
some Avalanche training or something so

2341
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:50,390
imagine you're 5 years old you're going

2342
01:41:48,829 --> 01:41:52,010
to the top of Whistler mountain to do

2343
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:54,470
Avalanche training tomorrow that's your

2344
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:56,630
day so shout out to Tanner cuz that's

2345

soon as later Dan touches and taste of

2349
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:07,789
Cascadia cool extractions heavy ice

2350
01:42:06,229 --> 01:42:09,409
we're gonna hear more from you next time

2351

so much for making the first episode of

2360
01:42:26,210 --> 01:42:31,279
hash talk a good one we had 400 420

2361
01:42:29,630 --> 01:42:33,618
people watching the whole time so that's
