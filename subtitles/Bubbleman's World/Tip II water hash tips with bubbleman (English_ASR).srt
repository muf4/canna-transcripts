to give you guys another little bit of a

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,960
tip on Bubble making this is going to be

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,599
tip two in the water hash tips with

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,080
bubble man installment um today I wanted

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,160
to talk to you a little bit about ice

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,600
and the use of ice and how important it

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,920
is in the extracting of our resins the

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,039
wax membrane of the glandular Tricom as

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,480
you know is uh is becomes brittle in the

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,480
cold there's a photo of a of a triome

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,159
right there it's a DJ Short Blueberry

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:38,359
grown by doc Atomic so the little wax

14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,759
membrane uh that's that holds all those

15
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:44,238
profiles the cannabinoids the THC and

16
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:47,519
the Tarpin inside it becomes brittle

17
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:50,280
when we uh use ice so we want a lot of

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,039
ice being present from start to finish

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,600
you always want the ice to be able to

20
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,160
have access to uh knocking back and

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,160
forth and and and hitting directly the

22
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,319
heads a lot of people were confused when

23
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,118
they saw my video and saw that I put all

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,239
my ice inside my bubble now bag but I

25
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,799
put very little to no ice in the actual

26
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,719
bubble now machine this was due because

27
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,439
the water was extremely cold if you're

28
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:15,640
using a chiller or you're using

29
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,798
extremely cold Creek Water you won't

30
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,159
have to use as much ice for the purpose

31
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,520
of you know keeping the water cold

32
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,960
you'll only really need to use ice to do

33
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,399
its job of knocking those resin glands

34
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,839
off of their bodies so the tip today is

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,439
really use as much ice as you possibly

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,200
can you can't really use too much as

37
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,078
long as you can get it turning with a

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,200
with a spoon or you can turn it in your

39
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:43,199
bubble now machine I pack as much as I

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,478
can and I pack good ice in do not use

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,439
store-bought fluoridated ice if possible

42
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,959
you can use this ice it's not the end of

43
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:52,639
the world it's not going to destroy your

44
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:56,839
hash but if you can I like to use a

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,519
solid Half Moon ice that is r or

46
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,118
distilled so that's our tip for today

47
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,359
I'll finish it off with a bong rip with

48
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,359
you and thanks for

49
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,199
watching
