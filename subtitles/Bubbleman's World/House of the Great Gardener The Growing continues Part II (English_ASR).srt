11
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,078
Med all right so we got a nice little

12
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,920
pile of sift sitting on our top screen

13
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:32,599
here screen this is the

14
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,200
250 the 60 LPI so the resin will be

15
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,438
mildly contaminated um we could give it

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,040
another

17
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:40,679
flick and collect resin underneath

18
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,360
that's one way of producing a nice

19
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,560
variety of head and of course we already

20
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:51,799
have collected over on this end the

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,000
extremely nice gentle light sift of pure

22
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,479
heads so I got some nice photos on the

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
macro lens I'm going to show you those

24
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,239
very enjoyable you know what you want to

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,320
do with it you want to cart it well

26
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,798
unless you want to flick it a couple

27
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,359
more times it's up it's totally up to

28
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,759
you you have so much I would just card

29
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,038
it up it's a killer grade and if not it

30
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,038
can be

31
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,159
cleaned yeah there's like literally one

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:20,519
or two stigma hairs in there and that's

33
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:20,519
it it's nice to see the uh Purity as

34
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,518
always oh man look at it on the card

35
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,878
yeah it's coming up want to be careful

36
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,239
you don't almost need a brush for that

37
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:36,959
ooh I would have kept that separate yeah

38
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,319
keep that separate just cuz it'll always

39
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,719
cause problems for

40
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:45,799
cleaning still perfect for puffing just

41
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,800
cause more problems for

42
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,439
cleaning let me see if I got a card

[Music]

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,120
on

45
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:05,120
let good the

46
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:17,878
push it's the high grade sift

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,200
man and a little brush obviously if you

48
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,560
had one you could you could clean this

49
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:26,598
all up much nicer you definitely don't

50
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,598
want to let it um sit well plug your

51
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:31,000
screen eventually it can sit as long as

52
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:32,518
you just get a card and and clean that

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,840
cuz you can see how that resin is

54
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,840
already creating a bit of a

55
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:41,000
thing that's what we call

56
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,078

furry furry

88
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,319
nugget all right so we just lifted that

89
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:21,280
screen that we just sifted over and

90
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:23,719
basically have uh another level of sift

91
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,599
so this came

92
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,639
through the

93
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,199
180 so we've got our 250 Micron and our

94
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,319
180 this one came through so we'll card

95
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,680
it up

96
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:38,080
gently there's ridges this is so what

97
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,000
would you call this

98
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,839
one I mean it's seconds

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,199
from I guess this would be the it would

100
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,159
be the third the seconds from the 90

101
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,960
done the third time second the second

102
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,759
flick it looks flick it was more of a

103
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,879
yeah it was we carded up the res it was

104
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,639
more I would think it'd be more

105
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:01,639
contaminated than that other second

106
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
version

107
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,840
if I were a bon man but it does look

108
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,279
pretty

109
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,279
damn pretty damn good color

110
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:25,519
wise a little pile of the

111
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,520
Barb guaranteed it'll melt yeah lighter

112
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,519
than the stuff that's on

113
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
top

114
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:46,879
awesome have that sparkly effect

115
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,879

work we're just caring up the resin that

124
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,720
didn't go

125
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:36,559
through the the

126
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:39,560
990 LPI 180 Micron

127

screen little pile

128
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,959

[Music]

130
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,319

00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,420
later

132
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,420
[Music]

133
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,279
the other

134
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:13,279
one one thing I would definitely suggest

135
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,478
you getting in the future is a nice big

136
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,439
brush yeah it'll blow the card idea way

137
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,878
and it'll it with these ridges and stuff

138
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:22,800
it won't be an issue you'll be able to

139
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,840
brush all the resin up so much faster

140
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,240
than carding and you'll also be able to

141
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:30,918
clean this screen with a with a nice big

142
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,879
brush yeah good big static free brush

143
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,639
and'll be resin falling underneath the

144
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:36,918
big

145
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,718
screen just another way every time

146
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:42,399
you're uh using these

147
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,720
screens you're basically um making hash

148
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,639
so uh whether you're using the 250

149
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,360
Micron the 180 Micron or my regular size

150
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:53,120
screens which is the 150 and the 70

151
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,759
which you know always come in handy when

152
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,278
you want to clean the resin this is more

153
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:01,919
of a if you're going to do an initial

154
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:06,720
screening use a a few nice screens

155
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:11,319
and do it right my car gets smaller and

156
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,320
smaller the screens get bigger and

157
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,959
bigger yeah that's it hey see me with a

158
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,440
big huge scooper soon a giant like 8 1

159
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,039
12 by 12

170
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,120
know those drywall finisher guys' be an

171
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,240
interesting technique definitely all

172
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,839
right you need me over there look you

173
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:56,320
can see how much resin is on top of this

174
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,959
of the uh 60 oh yeah there's definit I

175
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,160
just want to lift it up to see what's

176
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,039
going on underneath that's what I

177
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,078
thought

178
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:07,120
another pile of resin it's like a big

179
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:07,120
heart so yeah you want

180
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:14,640
to

181
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:19,399
it can also see it falling like rain

182
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:21,519
yeah yeah totally being in a pollen room

183
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:24,320
yeah I know a certain person that

184
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,919
wouldn't like this that's crazy uh yeah

185
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,240
I guess we're going to go on top here so

186
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,479
what we want to do here now is be

187
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,360
extremely gentle don't touch the screen

188
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,000
don't rub this St you can touch the

189
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,560
frame no problem but don't rub the the

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,839
bud on the screen all we're going to do

191
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:39,958
is a

192
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:44,200
bounce or we're going to break up a

193
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,199
yeah this is nice

194
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:53,278
CL once again the quality of this

195
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,279
herb is definitely on

196
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:59,679
par on

197
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,920
par cuz they don't [ __ ] around that the

198
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,919
uh House of the great

199
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,440

to come to

203
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,039
Toronto yeah that's I think that's a

204
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:20,039
little bit

205
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,440
better just keep the stocks in a

206
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:40,278
pile oh

207
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:43,720
nice big nuggets flying here at the

208
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:46,039
house of the great gu look at that that

209
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,639
is definitely Afghan

210
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,639
dominant look at that thing this is

211
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,199
beautiful so this has been a strain

212
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:58,879
you've had for quite a while uh well we

213
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,440
have the Shish Berry for oh man since

214
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,559
they're early mid 990s I would say

215
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,560
awesome uh it was just it's my favorite

216
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:09,359
smoke it's not a heavy smoke it's a

217
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,958
social uh you know you smoke it with

218
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:16,079
your friends when you're having good

219
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:20,679
times it's just um great yeah it is

220
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:24,359
social weed marijuana uh so we had it

221
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:27,599
for a long time and then I came across

222
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,879
the Afghan strain and the Afghan strain

223
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,639
was by far are the best

224
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,159
painkiller that we had come across in

225
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,720
for a long

226
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,399
time some of break I'm breaking the rule

227
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,199
here some of the kushes and stuff now

228
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:47,639
that are better but is the best so look

229
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:51,278
at that bud big fat

230
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,919
nugget so yeah so we crossed had a a

231
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:56,759
really good Afghani mail fantastic just

232
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:59,319
for structure purposes just it was

233
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:02,759
unbelievable so we used it in the base

234
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:07,440
some cross and a bunch of things and the

235
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:11,198
uh shis Berry was on that list I'm glad

236
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,600
and then in the is it the 2004 raid of

237
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:18,519
the RCMP on the vitc facility that we

238
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,480
built no uh was lost it was one of the

239
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,959
strains one of the other strains was the

240
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,920
princess and the princess was like the

241
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:29,958
number one strain was that a c99 or no

242
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:33,519
the princess was uh

243
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:35,638
uh bubblegum

244
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,720
Romulan what else was in it there was

245
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,959
something else in it there's three

246
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,000
genetics in

247
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:44,359
it uh the seeds were given to us by one

248
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
of the old shop

249
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,240
owners what was it

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,519
bubblegum

251
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,600
Romulan I can't think of the third one

252
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,799
right now but it was it was the other

253
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,759
one

254
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:02,159
lost damn always hate hearing that so my

255
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:07,079
favorite Shish Berry she she lived on in

256
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:11,319
in the in the uh Shish Berry aghan cross

257
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:13,278
so we started those seeds and you know

258
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,240
just looking looking for the hash it

259
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,838
sure brought it back to me I mean I also

260
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:22,000
know the Shish Berry from the

261
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:25,759
mid90s and um I hadn't seen it in so

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,559
long and then coming here and seeing the

263
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:31,159
Barb I was just like that's there's

264
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:34,879
there sh Berry in there

265
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:36,759
yeah yeah it's a save and not just like

266
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,399
a smell or something but it's like the

267
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,639
structure of the bud the way the bud

268
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:44,000
kind of looked even the growing of it

269
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,198
it's super easy to grow and nothing

270
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,879
there's nothing crazy about it there's

271
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:53,639
no extremes on it it's you know anybody

272
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,039
can grow it yeah just like some of those

273
00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:01,039
buds out there that you know you going

274
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,039
to do the whole thing let's do it sure

275
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,919
okay of course we're going to do the

276
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:11,399
whole thing we should like almost shift

277
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,399
this just fun

278
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,720
work the smell is so good to

279
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:19,399
continue Yeah well yeah we haven't even

280
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,160
we haven't talked much about that have

281
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:24,120
we no no about I guess the last time we

282
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,278
were here as many of the watch people

283
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,519
watching right now will will will be

284
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,759
thinking yeah wasn't weren't they

285
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,120
supposed to Clos down well obviously our

286
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,560
injunction uh was accepted and went

287
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,799
through the crown is of course appealing

288
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,958
it I'm a

289
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:43,559
grandfather yeah exactly grandfathered

290
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:46,359
in I guess um I was somewhat confused by

291
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:49,278
it it was something between as long as

292
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:53,079
your license went to at least March

293
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:54,318
21st yeah you were yeah well there's a

294
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,799
whole there's a whole bunch of things

295
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:59,919
that are wrong with the decision in

296
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:03,719
itself and that it limits

297
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:07,439
people so I think it's you had to have a

298
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,759
production license as of or a production

299
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,680
license as of September is it September

300
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,360
31st

301
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:18,359
2013 okay and a personal

302
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,440
license that was

303
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,440
active sometime in March March 21st or

304
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,519
something so there's a bunch of people

305
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,720
that because they're because they

306
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,240
production license especi I think more

307
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,759
dgs right that were affected by that

308
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,639
ruling because what happened was there

309
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,199
wasn't enough time they knew the program

310
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,560
was ending and then there wasn't enough

311
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:42,879
time or they had trouble and didn't you

312
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:46,000
know got delayed that they said I forget

313
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:48,720
it and then and then I think the people

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,720
didn't uh renew their license so they

315
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,440
got stuck in that little void but as

316
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,720
long as you had a valid

317
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,600
license uh as of

318
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,959
uh I believe it's September 31st I may

319
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,038
be

320
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:06,759
okay uh 2013 your grandfathered in and

321
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:10,640
that means as long as you got it before

322
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:14,000
then or yeah as long as it was valid as

323
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,559
of as of okay so if your your license

324
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,558
expired on September 30th it would

325
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:24,199
extremely suck to be that person yeah

326
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:27,839
mine just expired on March 31st so Mine

327
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:31,558
mine's actually written to expire

328
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,359
May 23rd or something because I got it I

329
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:38,399
got it the week

330
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:40,918
before Canada sent out uh the letter the

331
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,440
news about the ending of the program so

332
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,679
that's not the letter that exposed us

333
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,279
all to the mail people that was a

334
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:47,759
separate letter different letter they do

335
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:49,440
all sorts of offensive letters when

336
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,359
they're dealing with us which I'm not

337
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,080
sure I mean we are really the easiest

338
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:56,240
kind of people to deal with just let us

339
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,119
do what we want to do and we're we're

340
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,519
good to go we're not causing problems

341
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,959
we're not uh

342
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,158
totally

343
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,679
totally so it's a strange situation but

344
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,320
I'm very glad to say that that

345
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,038
injunction is happening for now and

346
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,678
injunction is happening for now the

347
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:14,200
crappy part is is that the government

348
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,960
came back and they're appealing the

349
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,080
injunction so everyone sort of sat back

350
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,319
and they're like oh awesome you know

351
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:27,759
trial Trials take forever no it take

352
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:30,678
years mine took six years right so

353
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,440
injunctions are awesome appeals not so

354
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:36,679
awesome so the government appealed it

355
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:41,600
and they could hear that

356
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:44,280
case within a month couple weeks y right

357
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,719
so here we go again so here we go again

358
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:49,240
the government's coming forward and

359
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,120
saying oh the oh the judge went too far

360
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,640
and it's like well I sit that I sit back

361
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,199
and I'm like what are you talking about

362
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,799
the judge went too far the judge didn't

363
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,840
do go far enough exactly right they put

364
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:04,359
150 g limit out there there's

365
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:07,319
individuals that have licenses that are

366
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:09,399
more than 150 g so what is that guy that

367
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,798
guy can't leave his house for the

368
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,360
weekend hey let's go skiing and Whistler

369
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:18,000
for the weekend I can't because that guy

370
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:21,079
would have to carry more he would have

371
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,240
to carry say two days 300 g yep he gets

372
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:26,639
caught by the police trou he's he's a

373
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,919
criminal yep that guy would be arrested

374
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,759
and charged under the criminal code of

375
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,919
Canada for and our criminal code now is

376
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,960
pretty bad for having two days supply of

377
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,960
cannabis there are I know they've

378
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,400
already got a list of over 200 people

379
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,440
that have moved because you can't move

380
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,240
your license anymore you're

381
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:53,080
grandfathered in but your license stays

382
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,200
to whatever whatever location it was

383
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:57,639
attached to oh did you move you know I

384
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,720
guess go make a deal with the people

385
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,919
that moved into your house

386
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,839
get home CU you can't move it all right

387
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,320
let's gently lift this before we get too

388
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,319
violent all right both of us it's our

389
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,519
nature to grab this butt and move it

390
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,240
around which there's you know what

391
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,279
there's nothing saying that you can't do

392
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,798
it afterwards when it's been moved over

393
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:20,038
there so I guess uh we'll put this over

394
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,038
the pile in the far

395
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
end

396
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,320
these are

397
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,599
good

398
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:48,279
MH um so yeah once again a good amount

399
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:49,759
of sift way better um distributed Now

400
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,639
you kind of see here where you see these

401
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,640
little black bits and stuff how they get

402
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,679
caught totally see them just come down

403
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,440
on a 45 see them all they're all there

404
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,759
right it's more than you can imagine do

405
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,840
you see them sticking straight up go

406
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:07,679
right down to the r isn't that nuts

407
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:09,839
that's the trick dude that's why now

408
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,278
here is what we don't want to bang this

409
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:15,158
screen this screen we want to lift very

410
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:16,640
gently and put over there and then we

411
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:18,799
know what we have underneath is going to

412
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,799
be of the utmost

413
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,798
quality

414
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,799
so this

415
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,519
here

416
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:34,759
[Music]

417
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,480
this is the top of the screen I'm not

418
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,599
sure if you guys can see if I get down

419
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,038
at the angle the way we were

420
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,759
looking but you can kind

421
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:46,519
of let's see if we can get some fancy

422
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,440
camera work happening

423
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,440
here cuz if we

424
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,519
can be good to show

425
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,599
you what's going on

426
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,918
here

427
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:05,599
yeah there we go you see that all those

428
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:10,240
little bits and pieces all those little

429
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:13,719
contaminants are lodged into the

430
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,079
screen and then underneath the big

431
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,640
screen we've got what I would say is

432
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:23,119
going to be probably 99 plus%

433
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,720
heads so it hurts me to card these up

434
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,439
but next time I come you're going to

435
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,919
have your brush and you're going to be

436
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,360
all about brushing at least for for this

437
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:35,080
grade carding everything else is not a

438
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:37,879
big problem my card is so gummed here I

439
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,879
have a clean one right

440
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,400
here

441
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,158
wow that's

442
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,439
nice that's the right quality right

443
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,439
there

444
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:08,319
there I'd say we're looking on boat peer

445
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,558
heads and not just a hit of it either

446
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,720
you know that's the cool thing about

447
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,200
coming to the great Gardener's place and

448
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,240

and what I'm doing right now is I'm I

499
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:46,599
fed the CBD Warlock and I'm crossing it

500
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,600
in with the Jean G nice joh G is a huge

501
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:52,639
heavy hitter yeah that's a potent strain

502
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,199
hey yeah oh yeah I don't smoke it it's

503
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,120
like it's like literally one of those

504
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:00,480
strains where I personally do not smoke

505
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:02,839
it it will it re my

506
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,440
day you just can't get anything done

507
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:07,798
well John Bell would probably love that

508
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:10,519
as a pain management oh yeah oh I I I

509
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:13,440
have no doubt that it works it works

510
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:16,440
right we got it from uh the Montreal

511
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,120
Club oh yeah as their number one

512
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,679
painkiller right so when we were

513
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:23,879
switching we not switching but uh

514
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:27,080
sharing strin in amongst the clubs that

515
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,799
was the one that uh when they sent they

516
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:30,278
sent us a whole bunch at the time

517
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,119
yep but that was the one when we put it

518
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:34,359
to the members here you know it's right

519
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,639
away you know you know when people are

520
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:38,599
coming back sort of the same day saying

521
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,840
yes I'll take some more of that you know

522
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:43,678
you're on something so awesome well

523
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:47,079
we're going to lift up this sift this is

524
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,880
our first grade um we'll probably give

525
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:51,439
this a quick flick which will give us

526
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,919
another second grade and I'll show you

527
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,480
that and uh otherwise we're going to

528
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:00,080
keep working here and get through these

529
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:02,519
tubs get this ready for the big machine

530
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:05,519
so see you guys back in a

531
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,519
bit

532
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,159
first do your thing

533
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,200
man it's funny to watch Matt do this

534
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:17,799
because uh I know in 20 years from now

535
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,919
he'll still be doing

536
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:26,079
this and this is the day he learned

537
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:28,800
it done all right really do see

538
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,678
it how's that b-grade looking

539
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,158
[Music]

540
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,159
blond as ever pretty good for

541
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,599
b-grade wispy it is right like you got

542
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:55,439
to be do it too fast and you like almost

543
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:59,599
create like a wave yeah you exactly

544
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:03,080
that's kind of the good way to do it too

545
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,079
you do it too slow and you melt the

546
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:10,798
resin put a brush future references a

547
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,799
brush a brush a

548
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,240
brush yeah I want to photograph this

549
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,558
PW

550
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,720
happening oh and she

551
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,038
goes so that's right on the top of the

552
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,200
screen so that's still fairly

553
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,278
contaminated but probably cleaner than

554
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:35,120
than 90% of most people

555
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:38,558
sift Barb doing it right since since

556
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:40,599
when what early '90s early '90s

557
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,558
just checking out we'll leave that we'll

558
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:43,678
leave that one on there yeah exactly cuz

559
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,278
now you got your

560
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,038
two terrible yeah but no not terrible

561
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:50,798
cuz once again each time you've done it

562
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:52,960
today it's been completely

563
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:56,158
saved so that's the other one though

564
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,880
right it's on the other side yeah to

565
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,600
push it over a bit there you go he's on

566
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,080
it

567
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,599
he knows what he's doing oh yeah how's

568
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,558
it looking yeah a little bit higher a

569
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:10,158
little

570
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:12,639
few uh a few more hairs yeah tiny little

571
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,240
bit more contaminant yeah that's all you

572
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,240
don't want to just

573
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,038
keep

574
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,319
one right here is

575
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:50,880
next too many gardening it

576
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,880
up so this was an empty room when I got

577
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,240
here today and the house has basically

578
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,760
half filled it the clones have a little

579
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,480
bit of droop right now but they looked

580
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:02,879
amaz amazing when they first went in

581
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,599
much like this guy right here and so uh

582
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,640
I have no doubt that these will become

583
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:10,158
beautiful big ass plants in the near

584
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,960
future oh yeah a little dppy though yeah

585
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,240
I just mentioned that but I mentioned

586
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,038
how good they looked when they first

587
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,200
went in look at this one

588
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:19,200
already some of these are standing up

589
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,750
[Applause]

590
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
now

591
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:46,639
that we didn't get as much seed as we

592
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,600
wanted to so we have to do it again

593
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,399
oh

594
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,319
perfect that'll

595
00:30:50,398 --> 00:31:00,638
be time that for

596
00:30:53,319 --> 00:31:03,038
November M Amsterdam Amsterdam the great

597
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:05,158
Gardener so we just keep collecting our

598
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,319
first and second grades and then we end

599
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:11,120
up being left with I

600
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:13,638
guess a secondary secondary grade which

601
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:16,119
is on top of the 250 screen

602
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:18,839
here you see the way we're carting right

603
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:21,599
now it it we're doing it purposely like

604
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:24,000
this because the resin moves nicer when

605
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:26,599
you almost blow it across the screen if

606
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,599
we start carting like this you'll see

607
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:32,319
instantly that the it's sticks to the

608
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:32,319
screen and it it becomes a little more

609
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:46,759
problematic Barb thirds so this is our

610
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,249
[Music]

611
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:02,119
thirds clicked it right on

612
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,119
them

613
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:06,960
boom so it's good when you're doing this

614
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,798
process that you clean your screens each

615
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,558
time I mentioned it before I'll mention

616
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,240
it again a brush is even better it'll

617
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,480
clean out all the holes and then of

618
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,240
course we have there'll be another level

619
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,440
underneath guaranteed what we just did

620
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:23,638
was we created another level of Si

621
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,600
underneath that one's that one that was

622
00:32:23,638 --> 00:32:28,158
seconds well we called this seconds

623
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,798
before exactly because when we collect

624
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,519
it wasn't

625
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:33,558
first still have a little bit of

626
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,759
contamin yeah usually the only thing

627
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:38,079
that usually will hit down here is going

628
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,558
to be the first grade but that's only

629
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:42,519
off the first initial bounce on the two

630
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,079
screens when you move them both and

631
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:48,240
collect we've already collected that

632
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,960
moved the bud a secondary time on that

633
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,079
screen to get it to collect and then

634
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,480
collected the screen off this screen and

635
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,199
that's what we're collecting now so this

636
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,480
is a seconds for sure these sifts are

637
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,798
still much cleaner than what what most

638
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,278
people's siths would be considered I

639
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:03,879
mean we're calling it first and second

640
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:07,440
but really what they are is like this is

641
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,320
90 plus% heads and that other stuff that

642
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,200
we that we made was literally like

643
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:13,079
almost 100% I never like to say 100% I'd

644
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,120
call it

645
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:19,918
99.9 which is what I used to call uh

646
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:23,079
Sam's uh cleanest dry sift which carding

647
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,159
techniques will do uh this trick will do

648
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:27,398
Sam can do it with his technique there

649
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:29,600
there are ways to get resin to this

650
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:32,199
level of cleanliness if you really want

651
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:35,759
to just do it and not be worried about

652
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,720
um the cost go get yourself a rowap

653
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,158
machine Couple Grand for those you might

654
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,759
be able to get one for under a grand at

655
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:43,480
an auction what what's a rotap machine a

656
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,679
rotap machine it's one of those round

657
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,399
pharmaceutical grade separation vibrator

658
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,038
machines the stacks of screens that I

659
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,439
have I have one of those yeah they fit

660
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:55,558
into the rowap they they usually if it's

661
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,798
a good unit and you can dial it in

662
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:01,599
pretty yeah you can get small on at the

663
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:03,278
other place yeah you can usually get a

664
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,119
pretty good grade as well so there's all

665
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:10,039
these different ways um you know for

666
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:12,279
what what Matt's doing here big screens

667
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:14,358
like this make sense because he's

668
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,839
already using screens over this he's

669
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:18,119
already collecting the resin he's

670
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,320
already seeding out bud and growing bud

671
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,720
that needs to be destocked or trimmed

672
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,159
and so this is uh this is something he's

673
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:28,959
already doing now he just has a trick to

674
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,559
remove some of the nicest heads first

675
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,960
before he collects the rest of it uh

676
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:34,960
that hopefully I'll get to clean up

677
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:39,969
[Music]

678
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:46,679
later all right so we're back our last

679
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:48,639

shishka pretty

681
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:56,800

684
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,750
and really just everything about it I

685
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,719
kind of can't say enough about it I like

686
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:11,239
[Music]

687
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:13,439
it like this is reminiscent of I guess I

688
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:16,000
guess because this is what I had in the

689
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,159
9s yeah me too this was like when do you

690
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,679
get to see stuff you had in the '90s

691
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,879
I sort of went into a bubble right I

692
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:26,078
didn't for me it was just I was

693
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,400
developing my own flavors once in a

694
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,720
while you find something that's like wow

695
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,760
man I got add that to the

696
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:37,399
camp like I missed the whole sort of

697
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:41,480
cush era I don't know sweet stoked

698
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,720

699
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,119
understand how potent it is but

700
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,639
everything but I don't know I'm not a

701
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:48,440
Kush fan well I've always been a bit

702
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:52,400
harsh on the Kush Vibes in the sense

703
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,838
that kush is a great productive um

704
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,838
commercial strain in the sense that

705
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:59,440
people that might not be able to grow

706
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:03,440
other things could come out successful

707
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,440
with growing the Kush I was always into

708
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,559
sativas that's why I damn near broke

709
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,440
into tears when you handed me the sweet

710
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,719

that would be pretty Dar fantastic it's

733
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:19,000
a big world out there and it seems like

734
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,318
with cannabis that

735
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,960
uh seems to be opening up I even had

736
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:28,400
friends of mine that are seed sellers

737
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,119
out of uh Amsterdam

738
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,800
tell me in just this last year that

739
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:34,519
they've been getting lots of people from

740
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,480
the Middle East coming and buying

741
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:38,639
seeds and they're you know they're kind

742
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,920
of like don't don't they like put you to

743
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,759
death there for that stuff and you know

744
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:47,400
I guess to a point they do but I guess

745
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,200
even there it's getting cooler yeah

746
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,039
because for people to even consider such

747
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,159
a

748
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,119
thing well why don't you start why don't

749
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:56,719
you start healing people not necessarily

750
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,240
even healing people why don't you bring

751
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,239
comfort of life

752
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,959
yeah for sure back to people right it's

753
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:06,118
hard to deny it's hard to deny the

754
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,240
grandma that you know is in pain and

755
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,800
someone gave her a tinure and she's not

756
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:13,159
obain anymore yeah it's a huge eye

757
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,680
opener I mean the big story for me was

758
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:19,719
always Lester grinspoon talking about

759
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:21,879
his son and how uh you know after he uh

760
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:23,959
he basically this was years ago decades

761
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,680
ago when he was using it medically and

762
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,599
I'm pretty sure he was quite young like

763
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:32,519
11 or 12 years old his son Lester's son

764
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,400
yeah don't quote me I think his son his

765
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:37,639
son's name would have been

766
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,639
Danny um he was sick getting

767
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:41,719
chemotherapy and every day after

768
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:44,598
chemotherapy every time they would go

769
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:47,598
back home and uh you know he would wret

770
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:50,680
for hours because it was harsh poisons

771
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:53,440
poisoning his body and

772
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:55,159
so when he finally broke down and

773
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,639
allowed you know to consider to use

774
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:58,358
cannabis as a medicine there weren't all

775
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,318
these fancy vapor izers or all these

776
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:02,159
things so he had smoked a joint I

777
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:04,800
believe just out in front of the

778
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,559
hospital and after chemotherapy that day

779
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,280
instead of going home and wretching for8

780
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,920
hours he was he asked his parents

781
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,960
excitingly in the car ride home you know

782
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,639
could could we stop for a submarine

783
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,960
sandwich which is like that's a pretty

784
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:20,838
huge quality of life change particularly

785
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,039
for a child cuz we never want I mean we

786
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:24,039
never want to see people suffer

787
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:27,559
generally but something about a child

788
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:29,000
suffering that is even more devastating

789
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:30,480
you know you just don't want children to

790
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,159
suffer

791
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,000
sure so I I was always found that to be

792
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:37,639
a very powerful story that Lester told

793
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,239
in a it must have been an interview

794
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:41,759
because I've heard it in his words him

795
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:41,759
telling the

796
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,800
story there's some pretty powerful

797
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,880
stories out there I remember a guy named

798
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,920
Ronald Ranger from at the Vicks and

799
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,960
Ronald Ranger he was just a regular guy

800
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,920
but he had glaucoma and he had glaucoma

801
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,119
he had a bunch of other things

802
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,000
uh wasn't you know wasn't the healthiest

803
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:06,358
guy but his glaucoma

804
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,599
would take a sight away and back in the

805
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:13,159
day he knew cannabis when he smoked it

806
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,800
he could see like he like he could

807
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:17,078
wouldn't be able to see you or I but he

808
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,560
could do shapes and he could maneuver

809
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,400
around and if he didn't have cannabis

810
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:23,559
and the pressure on his eye would build

811
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,039
up to the point where he couldn't see

812
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:30,199
and and in the scope of this guy's

813
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:32,480
life he in the in to find Cannabis you

814
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:35,838
had to go out on the street sometimes

815
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,039
blind looking for cannabis jeez and he

816
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:41,078
was dragged into an alley on numerous

817
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:43,920
times raped and

818
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:47,318
sodomized Jes because this guy wanted to

819
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:51,519
find weed so he could

820
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:53,719
see we came across that story like to

821
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,920
this day I can't tell the story without

822
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:58,159
you know feeling the emotion this dude

823
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,920
just wants to see do doesn't want to

824
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:06,960

00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,240
move the bud too

878
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:41,480
much coming out of the

879
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:47,639
bin back all right so we've lifted up

880
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:50,358
our our 180 Micron screen we put the

881
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:52,239
butt over there um you can see there's

882
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:55,639
resin on top of this screen we put it

883
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:57,558
over here this is our number one grade

884
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:00,838
this is our first grade this is the

885
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:03,119
light light light sifting that we got

886
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:05,480
from doing breaking up all that bud over

887
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,480
those two screams of course there's more

888
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,440
to get but this quality will

889
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,559
be near pure heads those ripples are

890
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,000
thrilling me

891
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:19,720
out keep hitting them and it's like a

892
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,239
car accident it's a dry sift accident oh

893
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:23,239
this is nice

894
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:30,519
quality so it's a great way for any one

895
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:33,440
who's already sifting or

896
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:35,920
growing to collect a really incredible

897
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,358
quality of sift I mean that is really a

898
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,880
nice

899
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:43,199
quality without too much uh really

900
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,920
without doing much different at all just

901
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:47,679
specific screen

902
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,838
sizes press that in your hand that fast

903
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:52,719
yeah

904
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:54,440
beautiful see drop it on there love to

905
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:59,480
see the

906
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:02,039
contrast oh yeah snaked right

907
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:04,719
up looks

908
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:07,000
good so that's basically the first thing

909
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:09,078
you want to do if you're dry sifting and

910
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,559
you want to collect the best heads

911
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:13,440
possible from there you can bash the

912
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:15,480
herb more and collect it under the

913
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,318
screens and then basically do what we're

914
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,000
about to do which is take that bin or

915
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,558
that tub full of the Barb that we've

916
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,119
destocked and done this light dry

917
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,160
sifting with and then I guess we'll be

918
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:30,680
taking it down to Matt's industrial size

919
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:33,039
machine and giving it a 10 minute a 1

920
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:34,558
hour and a 24hour I'm not going to be

921
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:35,920
here for all of those but I'll

922
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,519
definitely be here when it goes in for

923
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:43,240
the 10 minute and show you what we get

924
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:43,239
out of that as well so cool

926

00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:23,400
content but it's like it's it's a beast

994
00:50:20,358 --> 00:50:25,400
it's such a beast that you know it we

995
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,358
were like we're keeping it excellent you

996
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,280
we have we have we you know cuz you can

997
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,400
only keep so many plants and stuff but

998
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,480
you don't get rid of one that's that

999
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,798
special that's one of those times you

1000
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,358
want want run into a strain like that

1001
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:40,199
you keep it and then there's another

1002
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:42,480
that's the afgh that's Afghan but what

1003
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:44,598
that one has the that was if everybody

1004
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,760
remember is that was the one that had

1005
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:50,480
the Afghani Ved structure remember we

1006
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,400
like this is the one this is Afghan well

1007
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,960
when it flowered It produced the catonic

1008
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,079
bud it sure has the canonic and then the

1009
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,920
other plant that had the the canonic

1010
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:04,599
venge growth actually created like the

1011
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,880
agh aghy bud so was like genetics the

1012
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:07,680
Bea this is the beautiful thing about

1013
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,000
genetics so all right so that's these

1014
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:13,199
are our three tubs of Barb maybe should

1015
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,280
yeah look at that this way I like how

1016
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:16,960
that uh so just be sort of careful on

1017
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,319
the side I don't pretty much stand up

1018
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:23,240
against it sure I'll just mostly use my

1019
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:25,199
hands and arm to block jeez I'm not a

1020
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:29,358
big enough person to block

1021
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:29,358
this this is a great

1022
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:40,960
smell so this for us has two purposes

1023
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:43,039
one obviously we get hash from it uh but

1024
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,798
the other one is the tumbling action uh

1025
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,880
breaks the buds apart and releases all

1026
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:51,400
the seeds not all of them but a good

1027
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,119
chunk a good chunk as anybody knows

1028
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:58,480
that's clean SE seeds before

1029
00:51:54,119 --> 00:52:00,200
it's long and slow process sometimes ESP

1030
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,358
you got one of those fancy

1031
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:05,879
machines yeah there's some pretty fancy

1032
00:52:02,358 --> 00:52:05,880
ones for sure

1033
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,159
so raining

1034
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,798
glands oops

1035
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,920
s getting dirty at the house of the

1036
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:26,119
great Garden all right so that's a good

1037
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,159
solid uh I don't know what but many

1038
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:32,318
pounds of of weed just went in

1039
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:35,318
there I'd I'd say two two lbs I don't

1040
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,318
know probably only

1041
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:42,719
two we'll call it two plus two plus yeah

1042
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:45,679
you're right

1043
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:49,480
there in

1044
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:51,039
there you know what time it

1045
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,079
is

1046
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:57,239
442 442 jeez it's only been 22 minutes

1047
00:52:54,079 --> 00:53:00,798
since we hit our 420 rep

1048
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:02,869
we'll plug this in so at uh

1049
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:05,980
452 see what we

1050
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:05,980
[Music]

1051
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:12,240
get beautiful all right well 10 minutes

1052
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,199
we'll be back in 10

1053
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:15,679
minutes all right you know what I always

1054
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:18,838
used to do is I always used to sort of

1055
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:20,919
knock that off but now that we've sort

1056
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:22,480
of done that double screen technique I'm

1057
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,480
sort of thinking cuz if you look at this

1058
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,920
it's the same right

1059
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,280
like it's like hair and you can see them

1060
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,760
poking

1061
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,559
out now I used to rub it now I don't

1062
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,720
want now I don't want to rub it I want

1063
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:37,599
to like well maybe separ you know

1064
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:39,078
collect it separately get it yeah get

1065
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,480
everything out that's underneath it

1066
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:44,359
first yeah pull the tub out all right

1067
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,280
never a bad idea to be learning new

1068
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:50,039
things and just if you don't really have

1069
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,040
to change much and just be a little more

1070
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,200
careful

1071
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:58,440
perfect and that is a healthy pile of

1072
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:58,439
red

1073
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:07,318
present I brought a whole stack in but I

1074
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:07,318
think I gave half

1075
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:14,838
you not quite thick enough

1076
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,798

1077
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:29,199

get 10 minutes not bad no not bad at

1082
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:51,720
all the container that

1083
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,720
big think I

1084
00:54:55,318 --> 00:55:02,400
dos it take like four

1085
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,400
medium

1086
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:11,720
yeah this is one of those hyoma

1087
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:14,798
Afghani oh Afghan katonic oh Afghani

1088
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:16,919
katonic right right right right so it

1089
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:22,239
had the Afghan structure but it grew out

1090
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:25,318
to a h or a canonic style shape

1091
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:28,318
but all of them look

1092
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:28,318
