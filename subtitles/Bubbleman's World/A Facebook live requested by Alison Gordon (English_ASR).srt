48
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,599
turning on this torch I know it's going

49
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,240
to be loud and obnoxious but uh it needs

50
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:05,399
to be done so let's see if we oh

51
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:07,958
actually before we do that let's do this

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,598
real quick and get this

53
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,598
timer that I wanted to get on my

54
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,199

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,680
solo rigs all right here we go we got

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,360
this timer

59
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,959
launching activity timer boom it's nice

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,519
to have the timer on my phone I use it

61
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,159
all the time but I got to say when I'm

62
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,640
as for those of you that don't know when

63
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:34,759
you're heating up this quartz it's very

64
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,359
nice to know how long you heated it up

65
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,318
for which tells you how long you should

66
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,800
cool it down for and then makes for the

67
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,598
cleaning to be very uh much easier

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,439
recently I looked at the price of this

69
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,799
particular dial just with this quartz

70
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,158
Banger which is the MEAP pot which you

71
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,560
can see there with the seat of Life

72
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:53,199
carved into the bottom of it um very

73
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,959
expensive for this little unit

74
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,878
$850 without the bucket or the ofc so

75
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,800
you want to take care of these things uh

76

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,080
really all there is to do now is see if

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,878
that timer actually opened up because if

80
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,640
it didn't I'm going to have to figure it

81
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,639
out where did you go

82
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:22,239
timer I can't even see the timer I know

83
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:25,639
I just added it oh there it is activity

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,239
timer oh there we go so I guess I bet I

85
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,000
got to set this thing I've never done

86
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,120
this before so uh bear with me while I

87

142
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,478

I love the vapexhale don't get me wrong

144
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,959
I usually have it plugged in and ripping

145
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,960
it out but after getting this piece

146
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,720
recently I just can't say enough about

147
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:25,959
it yeah it's an exciting uh idea you

148
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,160
know so here's the cleanup see how dirty

149
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:32,359
we got here we're going to give it a

150
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,560
little cleanup with uh with a

151
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,479
Q-tip but you'll

152
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,000
see there's

153
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:41,279
still some dirt in there okay so what we

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,079
do is we

155
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:47,719
dip in this cleaning solution right in

156
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:49,719

right in here and this shit's going to

159
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,080
Bubble Up and froth

160
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:59,959
up and it basically cleans the quartz

161
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,598
like nothing I have ever seen

162
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,038
any cleaning agent do and it's

163
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,159
completely natural you can drink the

164
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:09,199
[ __ ] it's based on like coconut oil and

165
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,759
kunga oil and it is [ __ ] killer I

166
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,680
will show the cleaner again absolutely

167
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,160
just uh make sure hey Mark sorry I'm

168
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,959
late don't worry Spencer we're happy

169
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,560
that you finally made it buddy we've

170
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,519
been waiting for

171
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,519
you so a couple

172
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,638
more and then you can see just how clean

173
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,120
I got

174
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:33,360
that you see that guys

175
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,639
so amazing amazing cleaner and I will

176
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,160
show that again right away no alcohol it

177
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:43,160
is exceptional resin lifting

178
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:46,520
power Dark Crystal glass so what it is

179
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,919
is it's non-chlorinated water it's uh

180
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,719
Kanga oil processed coconut extract

181
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,560
processed kelp extract and processed

182
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,080
extract of sugar cane so they got some

183
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,800
method that they're they're doing with

184
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,519
it but I'll tell you what there's no

185
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,639
smell there's no taste even once you

186
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,359
clean it off most most of it's water and

187
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,240
so the water steams and I guess it's the

188
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,639
oil inside the water while it's steaming

189
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,478
that lifts and picks up the resin so

190
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,199
wipe the outside of your bucket yeah I

191
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,439
wipe the outside of it sometimes not

192
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,080
always when it gets you know when resin

193
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:19,120
uh surrounds it a lot I take this little

194
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,639
guy and I'll just give it a nice outside

195
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,280
clean probably every like second or

196
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,840
third rip so will that help with my

197
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,478
shower head for reals I missed what you

198
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:31,439
were asking about your shower head but

199
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,240
man I'll tell you I am loving this tiny

200
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,158
little mother ship you see how big this

201
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,320
thing is I think my torch is almost

202
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:42,399
bigger than it very small little

203
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,760
dude we know how to talk and clean them

204
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,159
well whatever I'm just saying this stuff

205
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,480
is great [ __ ] and I'm sharing it with

206
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:49,719
you whether you like it or not I love to

207
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,600
clean glass I'll tell you it's it's to

208
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,278
pay a lot of money for quartz and to I

209
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,159
want it to be new every time I hit it

210
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:58,439
and it's a bummer when you ruin it when

211
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,838
you burn too much material on it people

212
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,279
hit it hot they they don't clean it

213
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,839
properly so um I wonder if I soak you

214
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,679
know what it could Spencer there I have

215
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,320
seen some thermal shock do some pretty

216
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:11,319
incredible things you can heat the stuff

217
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,200
up and boil it and then put um bangers

218
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,959
into it and it'll he's got videos on his

219
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,759
Instagram it just picks the resin right

220
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,518
off the glass what's the size on it Mark

221
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,399
uh this is

222
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,679
7.9 7.9 for this one so it's what they

223
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,480
call a sub 8 and definitely for people

224
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,599
that are looking for you know he

225
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,278
Mothership glass it seems that a lot of

226
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,320
people are looking for smaller than

227
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,799
taller pieces 9 in and up you're

228
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,879
certainly not going to get the same

229
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:43,879
amount of people bugging you for um a

230
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:46,240
piece as 8 in and Below straight up

231
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,958

232
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,480

235
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,759
house today we're going to start off

236
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,839

237
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:01,559

238
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,440
cushion incredible flavor on that Sunset

239
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,559
sherber I can't even describe this it's

240
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,600
so nice it's so unique I just

241
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:12,119
uh yeah it's got this cushy also very

242
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,800
deeply cushy but something different

243
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,480
like very flavorful then the Tangi what

244
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,719
needs to be said about the Tangi it's

245
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,320
Citrus explosion it's so citrusy it's

246
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,079
just amazing everyone that smells it

247
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,839
whether they like cannabis or not will

248
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:27,879
have something nice to say about it oh

249
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,680
wow that's so nice so yeah we have a big

250
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:31,200
appreciation for that

251
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,479
then we got the

252
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,560
Clementine the Clementine is very

253
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,320
different in the sense of it's a citrus

254
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:39,679
it's similar to Tangi but it just has

255
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,560
these completely different undertones

256
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,519
following that Citrus blast that you get

257
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,039
when you initially um smell it and then

258
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,759
of course the Jack Frost I mean who

259
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,838
doesn't love some Jack Frost if you've

260
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:53,559
never have it you got to get blue

261
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,360
river.com Blue River extract.com ships

262
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,599
to

263
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Alaska M so there's the Jack Frost very

264
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,959
happy with that very happy with um the

265
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,879
New Order of tpin that we'll hit the

266
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:07,958
website here in the next week or so and

267
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:10,278
just uh been loving it up TP dipping

268
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,719
bong ripping [ __ ] Yan as d420 K would

269
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:15,000
say on hash Church my mom was tripping

270
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,440
the other day on why my house stunk like

271
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,720
citrus I bet she was I bet she was yeah

272
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,839
dude trust me I've tried so many

273
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,600
different cleaners this thing is really

274
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,639
good I was impressed with it i' I

275
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,120
haven't you probably noticed if you've

276
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,240
watched my channel for any amount of

277
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,600
time that I've never out of all the

278
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,919
years I've been smoking these have I hit

279
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,560
from these Mothership um quartz bangers

280
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,639
because I always felt like it was too

281
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:40,439
fast to destroy them and for the value

282
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,879
like like I said 850 just for this

283
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,800
quartz and dial that becomes so

284
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,120
expensive that you want to be able to be

285
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,958
able to take care of it so I just got

286
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,639
this cleaning solution I carry it around

287
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:55,278
in these 4.5 MLS a bottle is is huge 650

288
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,120
MLS but what I think I'm going to do is

289
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,879
I'm going to probably put you know 5 mls

290
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,440
in each one of these put a nice little

291
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,000
sticker on there and sell it with a

292
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,120
little pack of Q-tips and just sell it

293
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,759
for like a buck or something not to try

294
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,480
and make money but just to try and like

295
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,240
get people access or maybe I'll make a

296
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,039
bunch of free samples of these with the

297
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,639
first couple of bottles and I'll just

298
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,198
send them out to people and say hey look

299
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:20,039
if you like it you know where we're at

300
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:21,879
and if not uh thanks for trying any

301
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,679
thoughts on Colorado's Social Clubs

302
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,360
coming soon I don't know I don't spend

303
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,838
any time in Colorado I do have a lot of

304
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,560
friends there but I really don't have my

305
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,639
finger on the pulse at all I barely have

306
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,679
my finger on the pulse in Vancouver and

307
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,680
I only live 25 minutes outside of that

308
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:38,879
City so um I feel that Vancouver is

309
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,719
blowing up though you know for our scene

310
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,600
it's like so many dispensaries there's

311
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,920
vapor lounges I think it's time for a a

312
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,879
real high-end place to come in and offer

313
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,958
something that nobody else is offering

314
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:56,078
so yeah red congales is good Karma's

315
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:57,958
[ __ ] is good um Sunset sherber is good

316
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,879
lavender skunk is good there's so many

317
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,679
good ones what's go what's up there Mike

318
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:05,000
Micron Mike Micron in the house I think

319
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:07,039
it's time for us to probably Blaze one

320
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,120
more Bowl this is the Allison Gordon

321
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,799
session she requested this so I think

322
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,278
everyone should at least say hello to

323
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:18,120
Allison or perhaps something else of

324
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:20,799
sorts but she's in the room this is her

403
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,000
Mothership groups they just might be a

404
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:54,000
little more

405
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,239

411
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,798
wherever they sell West Coast

412
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,480
concentrate would be one good start you

413
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,318
could go check out Sunrise Wellness

fiery stuff from concentrated X and

416
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,120
Heavenly days uh mostly raos and I think

417
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,799
maybe a little bit of dry

418
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:29,159

00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,519

anyone who clicks on it come

473
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:30,960

00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:42,280
eight or 900 people are watching but I I

479
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,960
do these shows even if like three people

480
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:45,960

481
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,960

658
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:44,720
hit some Clementine before that I think

659
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,119
it was Jack Frost before that or Tangi I

660
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,120

662
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:53,639
like little the this thing is so heavy

663
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,080
it just

664
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,880
closes or falls

665
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:02,359
down all right God this smells good like

666
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,960
coffee and I don't even like

667
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:06,439
coffee nail is escaping yeah I know

668
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,519
Nail's trying to get away on me it's

669
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,558
like don't you do that don't you try to

670
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:14,278
get away oh I'm getting her done lemon

671
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:16,960
drop the OG original UV reactive color

672
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:19,398
good eye Spencer good

673
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,200
eye I don't know if they will you know

674
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:23,038
it's possible I definitely want to open

675
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,038
one in Vancouver if I did this Bubble

676
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,079
Man space and it was a high-end gallery

677
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,119
and had the restaurant and had you know

678
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,798
Bubble Man World maybe like a studio

679
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,519
where I could film out of uh a nice

680
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:36,079
little restaurant it would definitely

681
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,200
have a Blue River store and it would be

682
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,798
the first I would suspect in North

683
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,679
America that you could uh that you could

684
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,558
purchase Blue River tpin in a little

685
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,798
special area of the store where you know

686
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:49,839
we'd have well-trained people that could

687
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:52,440
explain the different tpin show you the

688
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,480
chemical makeups offer you vape exhale

689
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,200
pure tarine rips without

690
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,599
canabo and uh yeah I think it would be

691
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,880
really pimped out so something I've been

692
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:04,839
talking about with a potential

693
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,320
investor all right I don't usually torch

694
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:08,278
that long for those of you wondering I

695
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,200
was just really cleaning I'm obsessive

696
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:13,558
compulsive with cleaning this nail so

697
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,480
it's uh it's the way it

698
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:18,079
is love the idea yeah right you know

699
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,038
like have a real nice high-end little

700
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,158
like clean tarping Corner have the Vape

701

Lounge have you know the shop that sells

702
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,278
all the hash making tools maybe build a

703
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,079
hash lab that's almost like a room

704
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:29,679
that's you know like a walk freezer with

705
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:31,319
a big glass window where people could

706
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,919
come in and be like oh bubble man's in

707
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:34,278
he's making hash right now you can walk

708
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,640
in and you can watch him or we'll have

709
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:38,640
it playing on TVs in the in the place

710
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,720
where I'll be dry sifting or wet washing

711
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,399

714
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,319
and then of course people if they're

715
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,559
inspired by it they can either buy those

716
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:51,158
tools or they can go home and make their

717
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:52,960
own tools for that that matter you know

718
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:54,080

726
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:10,839

743
00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:00,759
TVs beautiful Vapor Lounge

744
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,600
high-end glass Art Gallery super

745
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:06,038
high-end Art Gallery with special

Philly show with all the Philly artist

750
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,599
like something that would be super

751
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,959
inspirational for the entire Community

752
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,798
but instead of being one single

753
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,600
component that might not be enough to

754
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:26,278
keep it really flourishing and Alive add

755
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,839
all of those components maybe do a

756
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:30,558
Facebook or a a live YouTube you know

757
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:32,959
Robert when I'm in there making hash

758
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,119
once a week or something have it as a

759
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,519
subscription base the that serious

760
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,759
people that really want to get the

761
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,399
information because uh I'm ready to

762
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:41,960
start giving it out again and I'm ready

763
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:44,678
to start doing things that are a little

764
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,840
bit different than most the things that

765
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,320
I see that are being done I'm back in

766
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:51,480
the game I want to do this I think

767
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:54,398
Vancouver is a great spot to start I

768
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,639
could see it happening in La soon after

769
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,158
and of course I mean I would love to

770
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:00,038
push the bount boundaries and have some

771
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,200
small little private type thing in

772
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:03,599
Whistler that would be just amazing but

773
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,480
we'll start with Vancouver and we'll see

774
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:09,398
how it goes I'll tell you I put three

775
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:11,798
years into the melting point and um I

776
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:13,199
think yeah bubble man's world exactly

777
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,599
I'd like it to be called Bubble man's

778
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,399
world but the gallery will be the

779
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:19,359
melting

780
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,479
point or uh the you know all of these

781
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,119
different aspects that I've been

782
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,919
thinking about since the melting point

783
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:27,319
cuz I first had the melting point back

784
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,960
in 2003 when I had my raw food Cafe my

785
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:31,839
Vapor Bar my high-end Glass Gallery A

786
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,798
lot of these things I've already done

787
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:37,199
like over 10 years ago so Vancouver

788
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,519
British Columbia so yeah A Bit of

789
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,399
Everything Under One Roof a really

790
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,798
amazing Immaculate space that was built

791
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,918
to fit all of these things high-end I

792
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,638
don't want Coca-Cola and chips I don't

793
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:48,399
want it to be like your average Vapor

794
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,079
Lounge I want it to be something that

795
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:53,038
people can really feel comfortable going

796
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:56,038
to the way they would uh a nice

797
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:58,319
restaurant so that is a little bit into

798
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:00,398
my mind of some ideas that I've been

799
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,638
having figured I might as well share it

800
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,359
with you guys and get a little bit of

801
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:05,359
feedback it's something you could see

802
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:07,798
coming in the upcoming year

803
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,599
2017 and uh yeah you know Spencer I

804
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:11,480
would definitely talk to all my glass

805
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,319
friends that had beautiful glass and try

806
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,960
to bring them in to be a part of it in

807
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:16,759
some way shape or form at least for the

808
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,919
gallery aspect to make sure all the best

809
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:20,638
glass in the world was in there I also

810
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:22,559
like the idea of the gallery buying and

811
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:25,079
selling glass you know having a good

812
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:27,079
chunk of money put aside so we can buy

813
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,398
heady pieces to put in the gallery with

814
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,199
without having anyone's [ __ ] on

815
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,719
consignment and being able to sell that

816
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:37,038
[ __ ] at any rate that we want to without
