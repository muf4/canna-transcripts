Solomon all right I made it into the

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,319
truck here and man there's a lot of

37
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:21,479
things to remember to go

38
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,919
sledding um I had forgotten my sled ramp

39
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,560
which wouldn't have made it impossible

40
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,958
you can always get the sled off the

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,759
truck easy enough usually you can get it

42
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,120
on pretty good too with a snow bank but

43
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:34,479
definitely not my idea of fun so I've

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,640
grabbed my ramp I've grabbed all my

45
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,919

128
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,000
the Big Chief a big round sort of

129
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:55,079
smaller mountain is uh actually one of

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,360
the second largest single pieces of

131
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,318
granite in North America possibly the

132
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,680
world you'll have to Google that that's

133
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:04,520
that's called the chief and it's in

134
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,038
Squamish very popular amongst our rock

135
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:09,560
climbing

136
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:11,878
culture they really dig it

137
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,560
so if you want to check out a good video

138
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:17,158
on H the chief check out zombies woof

139
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,079
it's actually zombies roof named after a

140
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:23,360
Frank zapas song and it's a very

141
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:26,719
technical very difficult uh short climb

142
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,720
that can be done right here at the

143
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,120
chief right and around this corner just

144
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,639
before Squamish and just at the base of

145
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,679
the chief you can see the chief how

146
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,718
substantial it is now as we pull up to

147
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,918
it you can see rock climbers would love

148
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,479
it we have Shannon Falls if you're

149
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,158
coming up this way it's always worth

150
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,080
stopping here for a puff Shannon Falls

151
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,600
Provincial Park and uh it's actually got

152
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,240
a pretty substantial waterfall it's

153
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,040
winter so the waterfall is not going to

154
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,879
be kicking very strong right now but uh

155
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,879
it'll definitely be

156
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,000
kicking and I'm not sure what kind of

157
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,759
kind of height we have on Shannon Falls

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,399
but that's another thing you can check

159
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,679
out on your

160
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,200
Google and then brand new right past

161
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,679
Shannon Falls right at the base of the

162
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,240
chief we have a new Gondola going in I'm

163
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,919
not sure if this is called the Squamish

164
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,639
Gondola but this is all literally brand

165
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:20,159
new not even finished and that Gondola

166
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:23,439
goes right up there to a zone that has

167
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,439
otherwise been

168
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,399
unaccessible coming up to the chief the

169
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,799
