[Music]

2
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:24,960
all right welcome to poem man's world

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:29,010
I'm here with Mark and Remo the cush

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,969
brothers yeah we're over at Remos place

5
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,469
here and we just basically ran an

6
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,530
incredible batch a couple of weeks ago

7
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,359
you can see people cuz we do yeah you

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,960
probably saw the video footage and

9
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,759
pictures that I had on my social media

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,620
worked out really lovely so we've got

11
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,089
that all the samples here put out and

12
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:50,609
I've already had a few hits we actually

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,829
did a gauntlet a few minutes ago we

14
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:54,179
smoked them all we smoked every single

15
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,469
one of them and sort of talked a little

16
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,109
bit about them and you'll be able to

17
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,609
check that out on Remos channels or do a

18
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,309
shout-out to your tooth my youtube

19
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,170
channels their burger and were able to

20
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,640
speed our urban rail absolutely I'm not

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,140
sure if you can put anything up anytime

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:14,790
soon you might as well come a shout out

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:17,210
to your channel as well the couch

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,210
brothers

25
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:21,368
channels coming up the engine anyway I

26
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:26,140
thought we'd just do a couple of riffs

27
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:27,728
for the for the camera and yes you know

28
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,849
what I've got to see this this is the

29
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:32,170
smoothest bubble passion I've ever seen

30
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:34,419
in my life like it stinks it's

31
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,990
definitely very nice and that's a good

32
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:41,200
sign that your hash contains alcohol

33
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:42,968
soluble terpenes and terpenoids flavors

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,609
and tastes that would otherwise

35
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:47,890
potentially be water soluble which one

36
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:49,419
we made the bubble you saw the water and

37
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,060
the bottom cylinders

38
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,280
nice color and it had a nice smell to it

39
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,978
we didn't even drink any animal but it

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,030
tastes just like cannabis teeth

41
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:00,099
unfortunately those you know that's the

42
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,539
one downside for water extraction is

43
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:03,329
that and it's why we don't want to leave

44
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:06,579
the hash in the water for so long

45
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:09,868
because it robs those flavors alcohol

46
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:09,868
soluble beans

47
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,770
end up with that full plate which is

48
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:19,639
lying which is why your hash smells like

49
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:21,740
a concentrated paste be that do that

50
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:25,039
class breathing things of that mom also

51
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,870
simpler completely absolutely you know

52
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,030
to a degree I mean some people like they

53
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,490
want to leave it out overnight we're

54
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,789
definitely still leaving it out I like

55
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,990
the idea of playing around in the future

56
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:38,030
knowing that I can imagine saving to

57
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:41,360
move much more this seems you know

58
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,939
terpene full but the idea of getting low

59
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,870
humidity cold environments almost like a

60
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:49,250
walk-in freezer

61
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,750
we're walking fridge that allows the

62
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:57,349
toilet of the better obviously these

63
00:02:50,750 --> 00:03:00,620
things evaporator right so any attitude

64
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:04,879
to whatsoever is going to even evaporate

65
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,759
the water so the coal generally put

66
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,750
something if you're curing your hash

67
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,280
sometimes you blow it back here my hash

68
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,128
in the freezer and then you're

69
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,240
suspending your house

70
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:23,239
as it was first day

71
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:25,800
[Music]

72
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,770
I'm happy with how this turned out it's

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,620
definitely super flavorful super melty

74
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:35,370
and looking for natural ingredients and

75
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,969
pictures of the mouth factors potatoes

76
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:43,020
just got me all excited to take a hit so

77
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:47,068
that word person 90 absolute first nice

78
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,900
rock tonight yeah from from what I

79
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:51,599
remember from her last con this was the

80
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,300
most potent and killer of all it was

81
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,090
absolutely in fact the 160 was just nice

82
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,400
the 120 okay Alan I'm feeling that I

83
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,289
felt it like if I was using it more

84
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,730
medicinally like my friend John for

85
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:04,590
instance we've got quite a few breaks

86
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:06,299
and whatnot he to me he just feels it

87
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,189
right away when he takes a good grip you

88
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,260
kind of fee as his knees when we eat his

89
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:19,410
ankles or are pretty quite as much I

90
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:22,409
felt that from the one after this one oh

91
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:25,729
here we go turbo death kill surprised me

92
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,729

00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:18,050
light it's really held on your blonde

104
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:21,399
color and like almost as though it was

105
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,400
in a French Lick I'm impressed

106
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:31,269

109
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,069
that'll be up on that rebirth channel

110
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,460
there we'll definitely check that out

111
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:50,740
that's the whole actually turning that

112
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:53,319
you be able to you know isolating

113
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,639
glandular trichomes cats and I would

114
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,349
like to say that the magic really

115
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,300
happens sure it's nice to know someone

116
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,850
that knows the process and isn't gonna

117
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,400
make any mistakes that's always a big

118
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,020
thing you might pay majority of the

119
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:08,289
difficulty of coming up with a product

120
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:10,359
like this happens in the grow room

121
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,920
you're a moral authority to makers you

122
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,330
know can't be control of everything and

123
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,910
making sure things are going right

124
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:18,699
instead of wrong that's where you get

125
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,680
your phone out patch crazy the banks

126
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:22,979
themselves they're really really just a

127
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:37,470
tool go to the ice

128
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:39,180
I guess this hatch took us polygamy yeah

129
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:43,740
in the in the long run it's a four and a

130
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,150
half months well worth it for it to go

131
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,920
and you've been there in the hole all

132
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:48,839
