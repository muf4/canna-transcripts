[Music]

2
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:24,089
hey what's going on everybody welcome to

3
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,000
ball man's world I'm here with Neil

4
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:30,379
gallant in Montreal Quebec from the

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,869
maple butter crew and we are at his

6
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:35,579
Regardie facility here where he's doing

7
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,169
a bunch of different sort of experiments

8
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,119
using different nutrients and different

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,590
lights and I guess today he's gonna walk

10
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,369
us through a little bit of what he's

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,170
been doing what he is doing and we're

12
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,238
gonna do macro photographs we're gonna

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,579
do full video and you've got one room in

14
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,859
bloom as well correct we have yeah well

15
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,170
two rooms and ones in the first week of

16
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,058
bloom we're gonna go check out under HPS

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,600
and then we have a vetting room under a

18
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:02,238
ceramic metal hot lights and we have a

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,739
led room under flowering right now at

20
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,379
the end of flower excellent well I'm

21
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:09,259
glad I brought multiple pairs of method

22
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:12,379
sevens so I got my HPS around my neck I

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,390
got my LEDs on my face and I didn't

24
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:17,030
actually bring metal-halide ones but I'm

25
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,379
sure will be a little figurative you

26
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,118
guys have a good amount of these lights

27
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,589
so yeah for those of you that aren't

28
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:24,109
aware and I'm sure most of you are aware

29
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,359
maple butter has been producing artisan

30
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:29,359
rosin they produce incredible quality

31
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,290
flowers I did meet Neil through a mutual

32
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,539
friend of ours

33
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,000
however right away we really clicked it

34
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:36,890
off because Neil and John his partner

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,959
are really all about quality they

36
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,259
produce incredible quality resin really

37
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,699
well grown cannabis and it's just they

38
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,649
don't have to brag about it they don't

39
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,329
have to puff up their chests when I saw

40
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:49,579
their mug for the first time and I saw

41
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:51,200
their hash and Roz's and I knew right

42
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:53,209
away that these guys were on points

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,609
which is kind of why I'm here today

44
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:57,919
thanks a lot mark well yeah well thanks

45
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:59,929
for the intro we had you come out here

46
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,710
today because we've been doing tests for

47
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:06,290
an LED company based out of Montreal and

48
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:09,159
we've really surpassed I think all

49
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,689
expectations with these lights we

50
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,299
room that we usually would have had 12

51
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:15,939
couple ended using about 12,000 watts in

52
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,280
a room with five times eight of AC and

53
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:20,770
we basically changed that to a 6,000

54
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,069
watts of LEDs so about half the wattage

55
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:28,150
and we're using about a third of the AC

56
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:29,919
capacity that we were using before those

57
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,770
are huge numbers for those of you that

58
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,750
run operate larger facilities it might

59
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,710
not mean as much to a small facility but

60
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,870
when you're getting into a much larger

61
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,640
facility those are very substantial

62
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,159
numbers to be able to cut your wattage

63
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,329
in half and even the lights must be a

64
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,829
little bit more comfortable to be

65
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,520
underneath yeah they're definitely not

66
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,200
as strong you don't get that burn in

67
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,760
your neck from the HPS and things like

68
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:54,280
that when you're in your rooms for long

69
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:57,519
also you like the buds don't get any

70
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,530
burned from them you can pretty much

71
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,600
stick the bun directly under the light

72
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,699
you'll see stress light stress because

73
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,289
there is intensity but you won't see any

74
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:07,179
birds the pistol will still be very

75
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:09,340
white they won't burn at all right so

76
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,340
it's kind of cool at first I was you

77
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,959
know like everybody else you know I know

78
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,120
LED is definitely going to be something

79
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,569
for the future and that we need to look

80
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,090
into I was just not sure in what

81
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,939
companies to look at some of them are

82
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,709
basically replacing let's say does that

83
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:29,650
run with or by a table so let's say

84
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:32,289
2,000 watts under a 4x8 of double-ended

85
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,219
they'll replace it with 3000 watts of

86
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:37,750
LEDs to basically go and get the same

87
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,430
same key ratios in the room so you don't

88
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,799
have to change

89
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,510
you don't have to change but you're not

90
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,519
efficient you're using way more amperage

91
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:45,989
more you know you're you were using ten

92
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,959
amps before under two lights now you're

93
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:51,810
using 1314 mm so you're not it kind of

94
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,449
you know it divides the purpose of being

95
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,650
what we're trying to create here so

96
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:57,780
we're doing this because we want to go

97
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,280
micro that's been our plan all along we

98
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,158
knew that the regulations we're going to

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,840
come out eventually they finally did you

100
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,608
guys have a really clean facility I'm

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,009
impressed with the SOP that you guys

102
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:10,349
have sort of incorporated here I've been

103
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:11,818
through the entire facility so far and

104
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:14,459
it's just very clean it's very

105
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,649
professionally done you guys have the

106
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,780
smocks and the the booties and the hair

107
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,339
nets and the gloves and pretty much

108
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,459
everything that just needs to be on

109
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,750
point for for a proper facility when

110
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,089
you're growing cannabis you don't want

111
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,918
to be you know growing microbials and

112
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:33,119
fungi and pathogens you want to make

113
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,978
sure that those problems and it's things

114
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,340
that we know moving on to the future

115
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:41,699
we're going to have to continue to

116
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,899
really be on point because the this is

117
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,879
gonna be stricter when we're gonna go

118
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,429
micro so we need to adapt ourselves now

119
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,439
before we get to that stage you know

120
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,848
when we get to that micro stage it's not

121
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,829
going to be something new for us that

122
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:54,538
those things will already be our

123
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:56,430
standards and so you've been looking at

124
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:59,908
the LED lights I suspect for a while now

125
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:02,158
they've been around for what I've had a

126
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:03,569
few little ones here and there try a few

127
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:06,810
little tests without you know much

128
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:08,610
result you know Mitch he's had some the

129
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,550
same LEDs for about seven years and he's

130
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:14,639
been doing quite well of his and so it's

131
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,319
what really gave me the you know I

132
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,090
really wanted to try it I know that it's

133
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,408
gonna be you know the most efficient way

134
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:22,619
of growing eventually but it was

135
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:25,408
financed if we can increase the resin

136
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,149
production which is for me more

137
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:29,159
importantly than increasing the veg

138
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:31,199
yield although one could argue that the

139
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,910
to coincide with one another yeah that

140
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,229
when you do increase vegetative yield

141
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,000
generally you should get the greater

142
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,890
surface area and get more resin but I

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,680
find that no I find that sometimes

144
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:43,259
pumping liquid co2 sure it'll get less

145
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,060
THC at the end like often we've seen

146
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,159
rooms where we had no co2 we get less of

147
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,829
a yield much more resin content on the

148
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,710
plants then sometimes with co2 so that's

149
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:54,810
why we do very mild views of co2 here we

150
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,769
don't you know they get thousands of

151
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,810
1,200 feet hams

152
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:59,139
we're not pushed public pumping the

153
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,209
rooms too

154
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,610
that's cuz you guys are tracfone farmers

155
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:05,379
yeah and trichome farmers are focused a

156
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,300
little bit differently than vegetative

157
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:10,870
you know that sort of prohibition based

158
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,030
model of and when I say that I'm not I'm

159
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,980
not really calling that down I'm just

160
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:16,899
saying it's where we were stuck we were

161
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,520
kind of segregated into this mentality

162
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:20,829
of how much can I get and how fast can I

163
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:23,439
get it and now as things become a lot

164
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:25,089
looser a lot more legal a lot more

165
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,269
mainstream and men as it become

166
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:30,639
mainstream it's very it's an incredible

167
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:32,709
thing how mainstream cannabis is slowly

168
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,110
becoming amongst all the rest of the

169
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:37,779
population that you know last two years

170
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,970
it's unbelievable hugs become a lot more

171
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:42,189
you know I thought that's yeah saying

172
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,870
that in Kobach yeah and it's still very

173
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,430
conservative here that's what I'm saying

174
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,019
but we're still you know we're breaking

175
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,110
the boundaries of the year and it's

176
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:51,599
getting a little bit easier and I mean

177
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,949
for sure there's still people that are

178
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,020
deniers especially here to come back

179
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:58,060
sure like even the College of Medicine's

180
00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:00,099
that only see Canada is good for about

181
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,589
four or five different they'll eat all

182
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,240
those words they will eat all those

183
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,519
words I love that the bubble bags are

184
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,500
the bridge between us right now yeah in

185
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:10,029
the background on the camera you all I

186
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,680
we did take those up because you were

187
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,239
coming in we're gonna make me run it

188
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,620
back for sure so I'm looking forward to

189
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,240
doing some macro photographs I'm

190
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,980
definitely looking forward I guess this

191
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,569
kind of will be in a sense a part one

192
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,970
video because we really want to be able

193
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:25,839
to show you not just what it looks like

194
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:28,420
in photographs and in video but also the

195
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,099
actual numbers versus what they would

196
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,850
normally get so we'll be able to give

197
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:36,220
you the vegetative weight of the room

198
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,900
that we're gonna go photograph and video

199
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,990
and then we'll also be able to give you

200
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:42,549
the resin content ie red cannabinoid

201
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,139
entering content exactly we're gonna

202
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,300
have

203
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,680
tested so we have all the different

204
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,840
rooms are basically going to have

205
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,158
different mother deterrents with the

206
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,748
different tables all have different

207
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:52,918
spectrums of lighting underneath them so

208
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:56,099
we're gonna really see if they have

209
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,658
different turkeying developments under

210
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:59,158
different lights sheriff so that's what

211
00:07:57,658 --> 00:08:01,139
we're gonna have analyzed to really see

212
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:02,728
which light is that the keys were still

213
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,418
in testing we're still trying to follow

214
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:07,978
up the right model to be using I'm going

215
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,019
more towards the hybrid models a little

216
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:12,748
bit of white sandy Fred's mixed together

217
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,430
I find that it's it's the best mix

218
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:16,319
because you get stronger plants under

219
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,449
those White's they don't fall over as

220
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,680
much and we get those hollow stems or

221
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,098
I'll give you under those deep browser

222
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,598
HBS's interests oh you know like we're

223
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:27,329
we're trying to build the right recipe

224
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,399
and I think we've done pretty and you

225
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:31,318
guys are growing exclusively with Canada

226
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:34,588
nutrients currently at the moment we are

227
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,519
doing kinda nutrients and uh absolute

228
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:37,289
about this growth

229
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,969
so that was pro right of course of many

230
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:42,149
of you might remember soil balance pro

231
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,919
pro from past church when he started

232
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,889
when he came on instead of talking about

233
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,740
the different beneficial bacteria for

234
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:53,220
the plants very cool interesting concept

235
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,528
of collecting these microbes from all

236
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,300
nights together assembling this real big

237
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:59,879
recipe bearing in your health your

238
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:02,159
plants healthy and no it works really

239
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,019
well we like kind of nutrients we the

240
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,689
last two years we've pretty much tried

241
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,519
every single nutrients out there we've

242
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,320
stuck the cannon out just because we're

243
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,759
doing more testing on lighting at the

244
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,700
moment so we kind of want to have the

245
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,740
same base thank you so

246
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,690
changing too many very exactly then it

247
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,340
just becomes too many different

248
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,020
variables like you said you can't really

249
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,000
claim anything at that point so we're

250
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,909
pretty much running on counter right now

251
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,240
very base nowhere we don't beat very

252
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:31,639
high so you know eight nine hundred ppm

253
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,409
that's pretty much it awesome dude well

254
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,179
I'm looking forward to walking through I

255
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:37,579
know you have some workers in the

256
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:39,349
background working I guess trimming down

257
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,560
the canopy ah yeah they're pruning in

258
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:44,240
the HPS room right now I'm pretty thick

259
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,699
so they're doing a little print today

260
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,019
and we'll just walk in the facility and

261
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,270
I'll show you guys around cool well I

262
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:56,720
didn't bring the camera lens for the HPS

263
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:58,399
room but I do have my method sevens so

264
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,379
I'll end up taking off my wide-angle

265
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,939
lens and just putting my method sevens

266
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:04,549
in front of my camera so they can get

267
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,170
that nice clean light rather than that

268
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:07,969
orange yeah you that would inevitably

269
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:10,759
come through on the camera which is

270
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,980
really sort of a very powerful way of

271
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,569
showing just how effective the method

272
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,610
seven glasses are when you're in the

273
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,860
room that orange light can really cause

274
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,080
like headaches and discomfort over long

275
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,759
periods of time and you'll just see when

276
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,320
I come in with the camera I'll keep it

277
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,909
orange and then I'll put the glasses

278
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,470
over top of the grow I'm sure many of

279
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:29,569
you have seen the Instagram shots on

280
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,580
Memphis Evans account but it's

281
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:34,010
definitely why you'll see everyone in

282
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,050
the room wearing them they are a game

283
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:38,928
changer when it comes to the growing

284
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:41,479
for sure and we really love to work with

285
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:43,039
a method sentence I mean yeah they're

286
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,999
great guy great they're great guys and

287
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,738
the glasses are great so it's alright

288
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:52,459
cool man well let's go for a little tour

289
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:56,030
all right I'll do it all right take us

290
00:10:52,458 --> 00:11:00,449
in all right

291
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:02,149
[Music]

292
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,199
Oh

293
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:11,208
Kotex y'all UV obly get wha love it that

294
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:13,990
says UV protection is essential yeah

295
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:17,459
Reliance anyways

296
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:19,539
you have some you extra UV lights that

297
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,129
the flowering session that we're gonna

298
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:27,009
find let's get Matt there's seven here

299
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:31,090
we have three rooms of the same size

300
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:33,490
they're about 300 square feet rooms we

301
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,850
have three four and six four by eight

302
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,139
tables on each they're on rollers

303
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:42,360
[Music]

304
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:44,870
beautiful nice and smooth yeah well walk

305
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,870
in here

306
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,430
so this is under these double-ended

307
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:53,480
lights which everybody seems to be

308
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:55,189
growing under at the moment

309
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,840
it's my first experience with them I

310
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,870
think they're a little intense for the

311
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,160
type of farming that I usually do you

312
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,929
know you definitely feel the heat on

313
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:06,139
your neck in here and things like that

314
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:09,259
but the AC works well I mean there's

315
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:12,049
plants are doing well it's a pretty

316
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:13,970
comfortable temperature yeah exactly

317
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:17,240
and what cultivar do we have here this

318
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:20,960
is all where's my bike so we're doing a

319
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,778
full run of Pike in here

320
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,450
lovely and this is just a weekend yeah

321
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:30,019
this is about five days in they're just

322
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:32,660
starting bike sir papa usually 7 to 8

323
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,399
days but I've noticed under the LED

324
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:36,439
lights which I was very surprised they

325
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,000
actually started popping at about you

326
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:43,070
know five to six days so I actually got

327
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,839
heads out a little bit faster and also

328
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,760
the plants were not stressed from

329
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,910
transition I went from the ceramic metal

330
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:52,429
highlights to LEDs and they didn't get

331
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:54,409
that that transition shock where you

332
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:55,909
know these got it a little bit of

333
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:59,059
meaning of the week they're coming back

334
00:12:55,909 --> 00:13:01,250
at the moment but that's what I really I

335
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:03,109
can notice the differences between the

336
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,208
double n days or the LEDs and things

337
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:10,399
like that sir in all our rooms we also

338
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:13,189
have these little antenna things these

339
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,919
are basically monitoring our light

340
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:18,529
intensity or co2 levels or humidity

341
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:21,049
levels temperature levels at different

342
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:23,208
heights so we have light canopy we have

343
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:25,549
plant canopy and we also do like bottom

344
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:27,469
canopy at the table so that we really

345
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:29,059
get the humidity readings and the

346
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,730
temperature readings inside of the plant

347
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,139
canopy not just on the ambien exterior

348
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,180
temperature and what program are you

349
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:39,620
using for that we're using a service

350
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:41,719
called a data can and it's somebody that

351
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,419
Robin friend of ours that that's

352
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,980
programming it and does really well

353
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:50,088
with a few LPS right now to introduce

354
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,800
this system and I mean I really like it

355
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:54,560
we've got it all apps off we've got our

356
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,899
co2 emitters hooked onto the laptop so

357
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,750
basically we've got all that program

358
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:02,539
what lights turn on co2 turns on enough

359
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,470
for our readings in our plant canopies

360
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:05,448
and then we can have the different

361
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,670
readings from the different tables as

362
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:09,289
well so we're collecting all your data

363
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:11,049
but more importantly you're able to look

364
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:14,240
at it in real time anywhere you are

365
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:18,919
outside of the girl room exactly I get

366
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,959
an email if ever my co2 tank is that

367
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:23,229
there's something like that temperature

368
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:27,379
levels I can put you know different

369
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:29,360
different alerts for different Peaks so

370
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:30,860
we're saying no a deviation and things

371
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,339
like that exactly so I get them on my

372
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,110
cell phone

373
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:37,970
great that's amazing look it's not you

374
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,579
know we still hand water we're not doing

375
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,199
any feeding systems at the moment which

376
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:44,689
that's something we're gonna look into

377
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:47,240
eventually but we definitely like

378
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:50,410
working with with cocoa and all our in

379
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,090
all our rooms so

380
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:54,980
you know we go in there much every two

381
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:57,530
days the waters plants are very clean

382
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,690
underneath and we're starting to prune

383
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,459
them very important to keep these plants

384
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,140
clean underneath any type a little break

385
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,170
it just really becomes a vector for

386
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:08,750
contamination for sure for sure and some

387
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:10,729
things like we do super cropping here so

388
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,460
you can see like we'll have some elbows

389
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:19,450
on our plants literally like the stoma

390
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:21,860
technique so instead of no cutting or

391
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,740
plucking our heads we basically just do

392
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,310
a super drop an elbow on our plants get

393
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,310
a few more heads

394
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:34,069
[Music]

395
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:39,549
beautiful so yeah it's a nice

396
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:41,198
comfortable room to be in I love the

397
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:43,808
even canopy I love that you guys are

398
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,219
collecting your data points you know not

399
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:47,379
only for the fact that it becomes

400
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,939
important to be able to you know when

401
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,558
you're not feeling comfortable or you've

402
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:51,698
got that intuitive feeling that you want

403
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:53,799
to know what's going on in your grow

404
00:15:51,698 --> 00:15:55,568
room what a great way to be able to go

405
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,758
on the boat you showed it to us

406
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:59,528
yesterday we'll make a little video of

407
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,709
it later where we can show them exactly

408
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:04,389
all the different graphs and how well it

409
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,219
works and I mean and now we're seeing

410
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:09,669
like it's all this the peaks and things

411
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,889
like that so like in a room like this we

412
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:13,778
have five times a day C twelve thousand

413
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,039
watts of double-ended it works good

414
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:15,938
together but we're definitely not

415
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,938
efficient

416
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:20,289
you know we're using five tons to blow

417
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:22,088
this room whereas in the other room

418
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:24,219
we're having more spikes at the moment

419
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:26,589
on our data because we have to have a 5

420
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,420
ton AC there and I've been dropping it

421
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:31,300
down we've been trying to use it as low

422
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:33,519
as less possible we can but we're using

423
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:35,378
maybe two tons out of the five and we're

424
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,919
still getting a lot of spikes in the

425
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:38,050
room

426
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,669
just too big for the for the room that

427
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:44,039
we're running at the moment the LED is

428
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:44,039
burnout about 45 degrees Celsius

429
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,860
we want to filter out as many of those

430
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:50,019
spikes as possible and really not a nice

431
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,269
even exactly so that's what we're

432
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:54,009
working on and but the other thing is

433
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:55,509
also to be careful because that first I

434
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:57,009
kind of got lost in these data graphs

435
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:58,149
you know you serve you just start

436
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:59,439
looking at it and you start tweaking

437
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:01,209
everything in your room and then

438
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,040
everything starts moving sometimes you

439
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,750
have to get lost to be found yeah

440
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,299
exactly and then we started working a

441
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,190
lot with the BPD as well with this I

442
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:10,509
mean just say the most valuable lessons

443
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,440
you've ever learned from growing was

444
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:13,180
making mistakes

445
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,588
oh yeah and we've had our fair share of

446
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,110
mistakes well that's why you're a great

447
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:18,458
grower because the best growers in my

448
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,409
opinion are the ones that have made the

449
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:21,789
most mistakes well and that's hard for

450
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,430
some people to wrap their heads around

451
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:26,409
you know but it works for photography

452
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,630
for instruments for everything like the

453
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:32,650
more errors you make the more

454
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:35,650
understanding you have richer I mean we

455
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,750
did you know this is our third crop in

456
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,790
this facility you know our first one was

457
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,950
a bus we didn't do very well we tried

458
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:44,170
about 12 different genetics we had

459
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,120
tested some there was a few that weren't

460
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,940
tested and then one ended up her meeting

461
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:51,459
at week three right underneath the the

462
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,420
top colas we didn't see it pollinated

463
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:57,289
and you know [ __ ] us

464
00:17:54,420 --> 00:18:00,539
but you know we turned around and we

465
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:03,659
made sure not to make that mistake again

466
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,659
[Music]

467
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,029
like the sides look a little bit better

468
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,890
I find at the moment I still have a

469
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:16,500
little bit of tweaking to do but

470
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:21,440
definitely looks good how's it going

471
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,440
down there Mitch everything good

the water filtration system water

we're all good team about the experience

00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:44,379
so just why forget

00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,379
better quality tie counts

class you learn from them

00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:27,730
I think that's what

494
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:34,549
it's you know learning about all the

495
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,779
different types of lighting and taking

496
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,970
the right decisions well we're gonna go

497
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:40,129
micro I mean you know we've held out

498
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,079
we haven't wanted to go out to you

499
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,410
because be quite honest we like being

500
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,659
able to

501
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,880
smokin Joe at our facility maybe not in

502
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,820
the room sure you know we do like a

503
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,860
little bit of a say in my opinion is an

504
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:55,558
extremely important factor that seems to

505
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:57,149
be getting lost in the lp system Health

506
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,579
Canada's not really allowing for the

507
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,230
importance of I mean of course gas

508
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:02,548
chromatograph and all these sort of

509
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,950
tests are important but what's more

510
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:11,129
important when you're building beer when

511
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:13,319
you're luckier you're gonna you have to

512
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:16,110
be able to know it's hugely important to

513
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:17,579
be able to establish profiles is at the

514
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:19,469
end of the day the computer can tell you

515
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:21,329
a bunch of things but why don't all the

516
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,159
vineyards have these some machines

517
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:25,109
testing for terpenes because it's the

518
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:26,909
palate it's definitely something to

519
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:28,589
lobby Health Canada for in the sense

520
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:30,570
that you know maybe not everyone at the

521
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:32,369
facility is sitting back and puff and

522
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:35,428
tough all the time but having a cannabis

523
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:38,939
sommelier having a professional you know

524
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:40,860
trains olfactory specialists come in and

525
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,150
I think they're gonna have to because

526
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:43,918
especially with the fact that they're

527
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:47,009
gonna be allowed to buy from micros now

528
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:50,179
you know testing one thing but you know

529
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:50,179
like you can still have

530
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,659
so the thing is going to be is how are

531
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,788
you gonna determine the price of the

532
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:59,640
cannabis that you're gonna pay her you

533
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:01,548
know is it ready to grow products like

534
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,429
want to have a micro God

535
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:08,339
one to see what it brings you what is

536
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:10,519
the by what's your bio essay what is it

537
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:12,949
just like does it make your eyes water

538
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:16,109
collect that Peter toss and baubles

539
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:18,509
Rastas 170 they said we will meditate a

540
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:21,539
meditation master

541
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:24,690
that's existing in today's can dissolve

542
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:26,909
how big the but how fast while right

543
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:30,600
yeah how much you get their life no it's

544
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,930
Jerry properly no storing fury and

545
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:35,709
timing

546
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:38,590
all the subtle nuances yeah I'll go

547
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:41,259
through machines call like kind of an

548
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:43,339
expert because you're looking at

549
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:45,140
and those little steps make a big

550
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:45,740
difference when you ignore them along

551
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,390
the way

552
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,339
compared to when you focus on them along

553
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,620
the way to me it's really the difference

554
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:53,089
between the people who are growing I

555
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:55,729
guess with the black market we call

556
00:21:53,089 --> 00:22:01,269
quads versus the people that are growing

557
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:04,099
you know the doubles the dubs

558
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:06,589
it's like a bad word yeah and the thing

559
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:08,569
is there's so much of that going around

560
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:10,099
that the prices are dropping but people

561
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:13,159
that are still growing quality are still

562
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:14,719
getting their prices and and that's what

563
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,550
people need to realize it's

564
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,789
put the effort in and you'll get what

565
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:20,589
you deserve for your product and

566
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:22,569
you know when people know what you're

567
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:25,298
growing know the way you're growing you

568
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:27,129
know people ask for it by name and I

569
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:29,129
think that's why the micro industry is

570
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,690
gonna have such an impact

571
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,400
we can bring a lot of those three

572
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,400
friends to the legal market

573
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:38,439
well it's kind of why I've used my brand

574
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:40,539
in my name which has kind of been

575
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,570
synonymous with quality over the last 20

576
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:45,009
years teaching people about quality

577
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:48,009
where I've always gravitated towards

578
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:50,559
guys like you that are also on the par

579
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:53,019
so I kind of can give this sort of you

580
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,519
know full melts certification to certain

581
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:57,160
groups of people that I know are growing

582
00:22:54,519 --> 00:23:01,240

583
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:03,100
melty hashes yeah we're doing pens well

we want you know to do something of a

613
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,999
in pension that's the real wimp answer

614
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:21,378
that yeah there's definitely something

615
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:22,848
to be said for that the LPS aren't

616
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:24,199
really focused on that right now but I

617
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:26,960
think it's the importance and having

618
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,389
groups like you guys in a sense become

619
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,058
LPS or become micro growers and

620
00:24:29,388 --> 00:24:33,678
processors to sort of I think that'll be

621
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:35,928
the missing link that will really be

622
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,239
able to show these LPS you know you're

623
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:41,359
not doing everything wrong growing an

624
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:43,190
incredibly clean crop is important but

625
00:24:41,358 --> 00:24:45,470
there's there's other little aspects

626
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,920
that if you remove probably the process

627
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,969
you won't end up with the same results

00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:15,700
try giving them both but use a lot less

659
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:18,820
lighting they're really intense those

660
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,649
legs very hot as well we're gonna try to

661
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:21,220
do flowering with them probably soon

662
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:24,029
enough

663
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,650
none of our next ones

664
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:27,180
just done more that are coming in soon

665
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,590
so we're gonna change it up here and a

666
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,509
little bit in here in the bet you would

667
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,980
change supply these probably bring it to

668
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:32,430
Le

669
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,039
because we really like

670
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:37,860
the way that the LEDs have done the

671
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,740
vegging at the moment most likely going

672
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:42,959
to change to that this is basically our

673
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,529
badgering order to keep our mothers take

674
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,509
our cuttings here so right now we have a

675
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:50,250
bunch of players my bikes and apply a

676
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:52,319
participant baton here

677
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,789
things like that a few genetics that

678
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,299
works running out in the corner so we

679
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:55,789
have coffee

680
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:58,009
[Music]

681
00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:01,269
we did warriors rather than just the

682
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:04,519
trials still testing

683
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:07,019
next round of mother's milk that we have

684
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:09,059
is it Oh milk or there's some bikes to

685
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:12,210
here they're all they're all a little

686
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:13,799
differently but there are all Mills it's

687
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,740
bad choice and labels you can't take

688
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:20,250
them up cause I see I see because I saw

689
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:23,160
a couple UWM bees there yeah so it's a

690
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,079
hundred milks hundred mils where we'll

691
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:29,970
take 90 of the best ones

692
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:33,720
if you transplant two greens for flowers

693
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:36,179
perfect before they start also on tables

694
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:40,409
nice and easy to move yeah much larger

695
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:44,100
tables these are 15 we've got two of

696
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:46,110
these in here pretty easy to work around

697
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:48,288
I like the handle little steering wheel

698
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:48,288
there

699
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:53,249
I've always just used that my hip

700
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:06,150
all right great well let's go check out

701
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:08,620
the final room the LED room do it

702
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:11,740
alright guys so here we are in the LED

703
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:13,089
room John Neil's partners here with us

704
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,120
as well and we're just gonna talk a

705
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:18,399
little bit about the difference between

706
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:22,539
the HPS and the LED that they've seen so

707
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:26,410
far oh hey guys so yeah welcome to our

708
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:30,759
LED room as you can see it's doing quite

709
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:34,560
well at the moment these are the panels

710
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:37,509
we have they're 200 watt panels we have

711
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,309
mix spectrum on this line here so we

712
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:41,799
have a row of whites and then the deep

713
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:43,629
red and then the white this is

714
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,789
definitely the row that we're preferring

715
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:48,550
at the moment and then we have a row of

716
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:50,920
all whites the one that you're seeing at

717
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:54,039
the moment so those are usually more use

718
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:56,470
under for vegging but we did a test to

719
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,240
do the flowering under them and we saw

720
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,309
the same type of results as you see

721
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,900
under metal highlights so they don't

722
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:05,049
stretch as much they're a little bit

723
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:07,540
sure than the other plants but the bud

724
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:08,710
structure is a little bit tighter the

725
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:11,220
test is really going to be on the

726
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:14,380
different turkeying productions and the

727
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,970
resin so we're gonna be able to do all

728
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,460
the different tests we have basically

729
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:21,460
six tables here we have three tables of

730
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,380
where's my bike three tables of mother's

731
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,329
milk and they're all growing under

732
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,370
different spectrums of LEDs so we're

733
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:29,859
gonna have a slightly different result

734
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:31,419
under each table okay can you tell us a

735
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:33,939
little bit about the company that you're

736
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,910
working with how you came to put these

737
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,529
LED lights in your room over other ones

738
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,930
and what was really the turning point

739
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:43,019
because it's a lot of it's a big

740
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:46,830
investment to do R&amp;D for other companies

741
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:49,490
yeah it is and we've seen quite a few

742
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:52,460
companies go around

743
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:54,980
I basically spoke to the two engineers

744
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:57,319
that design the lights and put them

745
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,789
together and they were talking and what

746
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:00,919
what they were telling was made a lot of

747
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:04,359
sense we were basically gonna try to

748
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:08,480
replicate what you know a thousand watt

749
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:11,779
bulb did with half the the the wattage

750
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,759
and they said that they had found they

751
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:15,920
said that the formula the right formula

752
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:19,069
to do this and they sound pretty

753
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:21,529
convincing I gave them a try and right

754
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:23,539
away you know we saw great results from

755
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:25,460
the beginning of flowering we saw like I

756
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:27,230
was saying for the the buds I actually

757
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,079
started developing a little bit quicker

758
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:32,299
a day or two quicker than I was used to

759
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:36,259
the light transition from ceramic metal

760
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:38,589
highlights to the led room was it was

761
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:41,390
perfect there was no stress whatsoever

762
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:43,549
the plants were always happy and healthy

763
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:46,009
under the lights seems like they can

764
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:48,379
even almost grow into the lights you'll

765
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:52,279
see light stress but you won't see any

766
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:54,980
temperature like affecting the trichomes

767
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:58,039
or the pistils they'll still stay white

768
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,630
so it's really interesting and the other

769
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:03,769
thing is also that these burn at about

770
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:06,140
45 degrees Celsius as opposed to 750

771
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:08,269
from a double-ended wolf exactly which

772
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:12,440
difference in temperature we're using a

773
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:15,019
third DAC we would have used you know

774
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,269
usually we use a 510 AC in a room this

775
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:21,559
size with 12,000 watts of double-ended

776
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:23,720
and now we're using about a 2 tons max a

777
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:25,279
ton and a half and the mother's milk you

778
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,039
guys have been growing for not as long

779
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,480
as the bike correct we've had it for

780
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:31,940
about the same amount of time we just

781
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,500
haven't really developed it that much

782
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,019
we've grown it a little bit

783
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,880
it wasn't as popular as the bike so we

784
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,929
didn't give it as much attention

785
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,780
attention

786
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:43,880
definitely beautified it's it's really

787
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:45,500
got a nice profile yeah super unique

788
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,760
compared to a lot of things that are out

789
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,009
on the market right now

790
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:51,730
it's got subtle nuances whereas most

791
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:54,230
things are either based off of a cushion

792
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:56,419
it's got the density it's got really

793
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,370
nice structure and I just wonder I guess

794
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:00,320
when you're doing RMD for a different

795
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:03,589
light when you're used to HPS what

796
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:06,230
you're really looking for is an increase

797
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:08,990
in either your ideally both your resin

798
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:11,150
and your vegetative yield production for

799
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:14,720
sure the bikes look huge yeah man they

800
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,490
do and they you know and but normal huge

801
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,470
I mean this is usually like under the

802
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:20,630
deep breaths is more what you'd see

803
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,370
under an HPS it has a lot of the same

804
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,799
characteristics where you'll have those

805
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:26,000
those hollow stems you can see now at

806
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:27,259
the end of flowering the plants are

807
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,429
having a harder time holding themselves

808
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:32,960
up they're not as as girthy as the the

809
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:35,809
whites would be or the metal highlights

810
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,940
would be but the the bud structure is

811
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:39,490
very big I mean we have some coolers in

812
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,820
the back there that are

813
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:44,140
and so we're definitely seeing the

814
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:45,609
different traits from the different

815
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,470
types of Lighting's that are very

816
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:49,509
similar with what we would find some

817
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:51,549
lark or greater and what was what was

818
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:54,960
the name of this led company again this

819
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:58,089
is Eric group a moment or er a group

820
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,769
they're not out on the market at the

821
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:01,809
moment they'll be shortly I believe on

822
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:05,470
the market there's a few LPS that are

823
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:07,629
also looking at these lights so we're

824
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:09,700
just basically waiting on the numbers

825
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:11,620
that are gonna come out of this room to

826
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,779
see the grump the grand-père wattage

827
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:16,209
that we're gonna we're gonna get grandpa

828
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:19,299
wattage and I guess the first quarter

829
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:21,610
ticket or the resin meal after or it's

830
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:23,710
exactly so a percentage you know the

831
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:26,379
bike we're used to getting a high 20s

832
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,549
high 20% yields and rosin and things

833
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,070
like that so we're definitely going to

834
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:34,240
like to see if we can still maintain the

835
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:37,689
same same numbers yeah a hugely valuable

836
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,490
data not only for the LED companies but

837
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:42,670
for growers as well I mean if you can

838
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:44,880
use half the average if you can create

839
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:46,060
less heat if you can use less

840
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,030
air-conditioning

841
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:52,000
these are all just sustainable concerts

842
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:54,009
and it seems like the yeah and also like

843
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,990
all the stress that puts on machinery

844
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:57,879
like you're you're constantly fighting

845
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:59,829
you know you're fighting heat all the

846
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,150
time in your double-ended rooms look

847
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,710
we've turned everything off in this room

848
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,870
and we're in here talking I mean it's

849
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:07,539
not getting lauder we're not getting a

850
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:10,809
burn on our necks the micro molds are

851
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:11,989
very low compared to what you'd see on W

852
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:15,710
on

853
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:17,689
you know over at 384 hundreds we're very

854
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,760
low but yet you know we're getting great

855
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:21,740
results the resin production looks on

856
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,899
point - to my naked eye I haven't gotten

857
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:26,089
my macro lens under there yet but it

858
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:28,279
definitely looks on point in the sense

859
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:30,530
that the resin is growing up to the

860
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,330
teeth to the tips of the sugar leaves

861
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,490
some of the fat needs themselves are

862
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:37,699
covered almost to the edges definitely

863
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:39,678
the milk is is waved like the stems the

864
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:41,689
fan leaves are growing like full visible

865
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,329
trichomes you can see the heads with the

866
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:47,628
naked eye trichome goodness and a

867
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:51,230
wonderful aromatic got a smell in this

868
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:53,599
room between these two cultivars really

869
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:57,139
nice great job guys so once again you've

870
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,779
got how many lights total four how many

871
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:03,769
watts in this particular one so if we

872
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,630
take one table we run five lights of 200

873
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:08,059
watts under one one table so we're

874
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,309
running a thousand watts under a 4x8

875
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:12,559
table and you have six of those we have

876
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:16,608
six of those so running 6,000 watts in

877
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:17,929
this room at the moment compared to the

878
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:20,179
other room that runs it

879
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:22,129
both those not the water and this is

880
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:24,019
your first grow with these lights is

881
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:26,510
okay so yeah you've got I like how

882
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:29,420
you've got a whole row the Reds yo of

883
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:31,610
the mix and then weights that's a great

884
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,519
way to do it and so we're also gonna

885
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:36,140
look so when we go for get they're doing

886
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:38,179
3rds well we're doing one and two like

887
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:40,250
six at the same time we're gonna have

888
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:41,449
six different like tables to test so

889
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,659
we're gonna and everything have to get

890
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:46,219
tested look at the the trichrome not the

891
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:48,829
track number the terpene productions on

892
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:51,230
on each light and we're also testing

893
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:53,360
another light now it's a little UV that

894
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:55,340
we're adding only at the last four hours

895
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,200
of the day for the last four weeks

896
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,570
growing we're only trying it in one

897
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,429
little section for now but we're

898
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:03,440
developing a hybrid model of light that

899
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:07,039
will have like the UV included inside of

900
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,630
it so I just want to stick my face in

901
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,159
these buttons consist this little

902
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,990
melting water and standing at this level

903
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,289
seeing the size of these coal is really

904
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:16,519
oh really beautiful I want to get in and

905
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:17,929
photograph some of those they're not

906
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:19,820
sure account don't you do it but

907
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:21,769
definitely figure it out these lower

908
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,360
buds will be no problem yeah this one's

909
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:25,009
we're not the mix spectrum the good

910
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,450
definition of it the ones hanging on the

911
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,580
end is the red that was there they're

912
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:30,009
just developed

913
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:33,849
yeah they've got nice shot nice it's

914
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:36,700
just yeah so I mean all in all before

915
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:39,279
you harvest before you make pass just

916
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:40,750
your sort of intuitive feelings you guys

917
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,350
are both pretty happy with what's going

918
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:47,199
on here yeah I'm very happy very

919
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:49,480
impressed yeah with the the switch from

920
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:51,159
being HBS growers and then going into

921
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,630
this LED market where we're gonna be a

922
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:54,940
little bit more conscious of the energy

923
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:56,500
we're using here and you know we want to

924
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,659
go the microwave like we've been saying

925
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,460
and so this is really we really do

926
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:02,019
believe that in the micro it's all gonna

927
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,500
be about efficiency you know we're gonna

928
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:09,250
be have a very small footprint so it's

929
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:11,019
all gonna be about being efficient that

930
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,210
you've saved here it's like you could

931
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:16,929
literally have panels on the side walls

932
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:18,730
we'll be using we're looking at adding

933
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:20,199
things like through the canopy and

934
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,179
things like that so I'm having little

935
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:25,000
lights that are mounted on tripods that

936
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:26,559
go in the middle of the canopies and you

937
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,869
know without UVs and things like that

938
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:33,670
but we're looking at a bunch of

939
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:36,159
different things definitely have plenty

940
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,880
of ideas yeah well I really can't wait

941
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,309
to get the macro lens

942
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:44,420
here I thank you guys for walking us

943
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:46,070
through it and yeah this may be next up

944
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,289
will be a little macro photography and

945
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:50,180
I'll do some nice close-up footage with

946
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:53,469
the video camera so people can really

947
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:57,639
get an idea of what's going on in here

948
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:57,639
great guys thanks thank you

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,690
and we're joking when they said the room

978
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:19,969
is really comfortable the lights are

979
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:24,869
giving off very little heat whatsoever

980
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:26,969
the room has really well conditioned air

981
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:28,889
it's you know for only using two tons of

982
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:34,619
a five-ton I don't know they've got

983
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:36,480
about six to eight fans in 806 it's not

984
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:39,449
the hugest room but they're definitely

985
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,190
doing a good job in cleanliness they're

986
00:42:39,449 --> 00:42:43,109
growing great looking cannabis so far

987
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,579
obviously once I've helped make some

988
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,200
hash out of it and we've squished a

989
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:49,889
little bit of it that'll be the true

990
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:53,429
test but overall I'm quite impressed

991
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:57,269
with this LED room it's you know the LED

992
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:59,369
lights looks somewhat dated but to me

993
00:42:57,269 --> 00:43:02,039
looks mean nothing when it comes to the

994
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:03,509
actual production of the lights and what

995
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:04,949
they're actually pulling off with

996
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:07,170
they're focused on the engineering of

997
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:08,609
the lights and the spectrum that to me

998
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,349
is a lot more important than trying to

999
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:12,450
make something look fancy for a grow

1000
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:13,799
room and it's a great-looking canopy you

1001
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:16,619
know they've got the lights really

1002
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,590
packed in nicely and obviously using a

1003
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:21,779
lot less damage is going to be something

1004
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:24,059
that growers are looking more forward to

1005
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,620
being able to lower that heat make the

1006
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,298
room more

1007
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:30,288
to work in

1008
00:43:26,298 --> 00:43:33,429
and be using you know less wattage seems

1009
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:33,429
like a win-win to me

1010
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:48,269
all right so I'm going to get my macro

1011
00:43:46,409 --> 00:43:51,449
lens out and do some photography now and

1012
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:53,789
see if we can't get some great resin

1013
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:57,750
photos of the mother's milk as well as

1014
00:43:53,789 --> 00:44:00,500
the where is my bike souring so that's

1015
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,500
what we're doing next

1016
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:39,019

1017
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:46,880

1018
00:44:55,309 --> 00:45:17,179

[Music]

1021
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:12,199
here off camera I've got Stefan to

1022
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:14,030
panfish top Gardens group who has these

1023
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:15,649
guys have been the engineers behind the

1024
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:18,170
LED lights that the maple butter boys

1025
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:20,858
are growing in this R&amp;D room and we've

1026
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:23,510
also got Neil from maple butter and

1027
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:24,400
thank you for being here today Stefan

1028
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:27,349
thank you

1029
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,108
yeah absolutely you know only had the

1030
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:31,580
last 24 hours or so to sort of be in and

1031
00:46:30,108 --> 00:46:34,069
around these lights but I have to say

1032
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:36,710
even just from turning off all the fans

1033
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:38,088
and all the a/c about 10 or 15 minutes

1034
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,670
ago and kind of getting caught up

1035
00:46:38,088 --> 00:46:43,900
talking outside of the room when we came

1036
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:48,230
in it was a real joy to not just be

1037
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:49,760
smacked with that HPS heat and lighting

1038
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:51,500
spectrum that tends to give me migraine

1039
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,180
headaches so I guess I'll start with a

1040
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,199
quick question

1041
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:55,879
give us a little bit about your

1042
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:57,919
background a little bit about how you go

1043
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,450
on into LED lighting and and maybe how

1044
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,230
it translated into cannabis growing

1045
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:06,379
absolutely so again thanks for having me

1046
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:10,309
and I want to thank Neil and John for

1047
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:13,760
the opportunity we my team that is have

1048
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:17,329
been in the LED business for better part

1049
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:21,490
about 15 20 years so we started off way

1050
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:23,769
back what we call the white space and

1051
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:25,329
that space has evolved dramatically and

1052
00:47:23,769 --> 00:47:27,460
when we see white spaces general

1053
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:29,170
lighting that space has evolved

1054
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:32,409
dramatically over that period of time

1055
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:35,289
and now we fall antenna purposes have

1056
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:37,929
been focusing our time and energy will

1057
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:41,079
last eight years in the order culture

1058
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:43,329
business what we brought to bear was

1059
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:47,349
essentially what I call the

1060
00:47:43,329 --> 00:47:51,059
collaboration between experts in the LED

1061
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:54,339
business ourselves universities and also

1062
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:56,860
commercial growers what we wanted to do

1063
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,860
is make sure that we did not develop

1064
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:02,860
products sort of in a vacuum and

1065
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:05,230
ultimately take feedback from people in

1066
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:09,610
multiple different industries in order

1067
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:13,449
to develop a product line of agriculture

1068
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:15,430
fixtures that we think will deliver on

1069
00:48:13,449 --> 00:48:18,669
the promise and that's what we see here

1070
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:21,639
essentially with the help of Neil and

1071
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:24,610
John who have been growing under our LED

1072
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:26,170
lights we definitely see first and the

1073
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,890
results are very happy with that and

1074
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:32,430
I'll certain that Neil talk about this

1075
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:35,259
is feedback or is experience so far

1076
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:38,349
we've been in this for how many weeks

1077
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:40,770
now we're in the ninth week right now

1078
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:43,259
flowering and

1079
00:48:40,769 --> 00:48:45,179
yeah I mean from day one you know it was

1080
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,359
definitely a little bit of a leap of

1081
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:50,489
faith but if I had the right points you

1082
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:53,489
know we we dropped the wattage in the

1083
00:48:50,489 --> 00:48:57,058
room drastically like half what we would

1084
00:48:53,489 --> 00:48:59,159
have usually had and we changed a little

1085
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,839
bit our ways of growing so like upped

1086
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:02,368
our temperatures a little bit and

1087
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:04,889
started playing a little bit more with

1088
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:07,289
the BPD and then we really started

1089
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:10,108
getting a you know really nice results

1090
00:49:07,289 --> 00:49:12,710
from the beginning we have no stress

1091
00:49:10,108 --> 00:49:18,119
from transition lighting from vegging to

1092
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:20,190
flowering no overall a really nice great

1093
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:22,349
product

1094
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,849
well the bikes look absolutely

1095
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:26,309
phenomenal not to say that the mother

1096
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:29,640
milks don't but just from the

1097
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:34,440
perspective of these giants you know arm

1098
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:36,509
sized buds i years ago would have never

1099
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,460
thought that that was possible under LED

1100
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:40,109
lighting and i'm quite certain that you

1101
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,480
know not too many years ago you could

1102
00:49:40,108 --> 00:49:45,539
have grown these plants taking the LED

1103
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,250
lights out put the HP SS underneath and

1104
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:48,900
just told people yeah this is an HP s

1105
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,699
garden you know you can't do this with

1106
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,309
LED you could literally trick people the

1107
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:55,500
buds are huge and more importantly

1108
00:49:53,309 --> 00:49:59,010
obviously vegetative yield is huge to

1109
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:01,349
all sorts of growers but for me it's the

1110
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:03,540
resin content and these things seem to

1111
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:06,269
be on point for how sticky they are how

1112
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:08,670
much the room smells terpene profile

1113
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:10,829
being profile is definitely really nice

1114
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:14,809
because we have they don't see any heat

1115
00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:17,818
stress on the plants whatsoever these

1116
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:19,880
burn at 45 degrees Celsius I believe

1117
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:22,750
with no 8 c7

1118
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:26,180
literally there's no real risk of

1119
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:30,050
damaging a crop with these we're using

1120
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:32,359
1/3 the AC capacity and half the wattage

1121
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:34,789
in the room so I mean it's it's it's

1122
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:37,250
really a good great gain of efficiency

1123
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:38,989
in growing under these lights and so

1124
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:41,510
what were some of the key things Stephan

1125
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:43,309
for the development of these particular

1126
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,920
lights the shape and the sizes the

1127
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:47,869
strips the lights used like what were

1128
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,789
some key things that led you to create

1129
00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:52,969
this particular design with the white

1130
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:54,529
and the red so again we've been at this

1131
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:56,059
for about eight years

1132
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:58,400
and one of the thing that we we've been

1133
00:50:56,059 --> 00:51:00,829
constantly looking at as you pointed out

1134
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,960
is you would have never thought this

1135
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:04,549
possible a few years back and indeed it

1136
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,829
was not really possible because the

1137
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:08,510
technology was not there yet it was not

1138
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:11,329
ready for primetime so to speak

1139
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:13,100
there's been a big evolution in the LED

1140
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:16,340
industry especially for the culture in

1141
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:18,529
terms of combining different types of

1142
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,420
technologies and different colors from

1143
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:22,580
Ligeti but also for light output and

1144
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:24,980
especially in the work culture business

1145
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:27,590
in terms of micromo production for the

1146
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:29,240
plants that is so what we looked at that

1147
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:32,440
we wanted to take a different approach

1148
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:35,659
because again through our experience in

1149
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,210
feedback that we've received typically

1150
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:40,219
under HBS you have that one point source

1151
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,990
or one light source that emits a lot of

1152
00:51:40,219 --> 00:51:45,019
infrared energy a lot of light

1153
00:51:41,989 --> 00:51:46,250
essentially but LEDs it's very different

1154
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,230
and we wanted to have a more of a

1155
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:50,360
distributed approach more of a canopy

1156
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,679
approach essentially giving the ability

1157
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,090
as Neil pointed out that you could

1158
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,769
actually take your lights and bring them

1159
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:57,350
down as close to as possible to the

1160
00:51:54,769 --> 00:51:59,840
canopy in fact our lights will go as low

1161
00:51:57,349 --> 00:52:02,869
as you know no no space whatsoever so

1162
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,760
you let the plants go into into the

1163
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:06,559
lights some of the feedback that we've

1164
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,450
received and through our own experience

1165
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,840
also over time as we understand one

1166
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:14,809
thing if you go back in time with in the

1167
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,320
white space moving parts or mechanical

1168
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:19,829
parts was

1169
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:22,710
she looked at a look at or pawn as a

1170
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:24,239
failure mechanism over time so that's

1171
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:26,690
why what you see with these lights the

1172
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:29,669
rug it that was the intent for growers

1173
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:32,309
their waterproof there's no moving parts

1174
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:34,740
there's no fans so as Nell pointed out

1175
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:36,599
is over temperature these lights will

1176
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:37,859
not go very high in temperature and

1177
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:40,170
they've been designed that way to

1178
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,059
maintain a certain level of temperature

1179
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:44,190
so in this space you feel very

1180
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:47,009
comfortable very well and working under

1181
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:49,650
the LED lights the other thing too is we

1182
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:52,170
took percussion in terms of our IP in

1183
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:55,079
the distributed fashion so you asked

1184
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:56,550
about the two different products that we

1185
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:58,340
have we have one that's called super

1186
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,720
grill which is more of this white

1187
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:02,670
whitish with a very special spectrum

1188
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,929
distribution and the other one is more

1189
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:05,730
of a distributed with a little bit more

1190
00:53:03,929 --> 00:53:08,489
red or what we call deep red which

1191
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:11,369
facilitates growth from from experiences

1192
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:13,319
and also tests that we ran we're also in

1193
00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:15,960
the process of introducing these are 200

1194
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:18,420
watts fixtures and people sometimes a

1195
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,699
surprise saying 200 watts yeah well with

1196
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,139
combination so to replace a thousand

1197
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:23,909
watt you'll go with 600 watts

1198
00:53:22,139 --> 00:53:25,980
essentially so again there's economies

1199
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:28,349
of scale when you do that here we went

1200
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,750
500 cut but we're gonna go a little bit

1201
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:32,400
more under the hybrid model that's

1202
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:34,380
correct so let's Neil pointed out we

1203
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,150
have a hybrid model that's going to be

1204
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,680
released here very shortly it's a

1205
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:40,680
combination of both from a special

1206
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:43,139
distribution but also ant in the the

1207
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:45,210
wattage so we're moving from 200 to 300

1208
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:47,819
watts so the idea is that you combine

1209
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:49,440
two which essentially becomes a four by

1210
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,610
four grid essentially to replace a

1211
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,619
thousand watts

1212
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:53,910
give or take and then can you tell us a

1213
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:56,559
little bit about the differences between

1214
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:59,059
the plastics that are

1215
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,799
shielding these both the white and the

1216
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:02,869
red I know this one is opaque yes and

1217
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,180
one is clear so it's very good question

1218
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:07,369
so the one that's clear it's because of

1219
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:10,579
the spectral distribution so because

1220
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:13,279
it's all white of the same color recipe

1221
00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:14,360
so to speak you don't have to diffuse

1222
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,940
the light because the light that's

1223
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,680
emitted is uniform across the board on

1224
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:21,110
the other one if we open it up and see

1225
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:23,629
that we have different LEDs some are

1226
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:25,579
white some are red so in order not to

1227
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:28,099
have what we call shadow on the plan

1228
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:29,869
because of the two LEDs we've designed a

1229
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:32,420
diffuser that diffuses the light

1230
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:35,299
spectrum completely so give you a very

1231
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:37,909
uniform across the entire fixture a

1232
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:40,100
uniform light spectrum distribution it's

1233
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:41,629
holding it pretty solid like I'm not I'm

1234
00:54:40,099 --> 00:54:44,119
not completely understanding all the

1235
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:45,289
science behind lighting I've looked into

1236
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:48,109
it a little bit over the years from

1237
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:50,239
metal halide to HPS to LED but obviously

1238
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:53,090
there's a substantial difference between

1239
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:55,729
the red and and the light that's correct

1240
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:57,620
and what you would see again if you go

1241
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:59,599
back to HPS there's different spikes if

1242
00:54:57,619 --> 00:55:01,369
you look at the latest distribution our

1243
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,429
spectral distribution there are certain

1244
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:06,980
spikes of what we call light-emitting so

1245
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:08,690
essentially the the the frequency at

1246
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:11,000
which you know different colors are

1247
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:14,269
being emitted in this case what we

1248
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,670
wanted to do is ensure again that we

1249
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:19,519
have a uniform distribution and a

1250
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:22,369
spectral distribution that provides

1251
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:25,789
either more deep breath in the case of

1252
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:28,159
the fixture what we call the new mega

1253
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:30,529
bloom and a little bit less in this case

1254
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:33,109
at a super go and it all depends on the

1255
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:34,250
grower and we keep on saying that we

1256
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:36,200
would never do this with other growers

1257
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:38,449
obviously the rows know how to grow

1258
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:40,759
their crop pharrell we're here to

1259
00:55:38,449 --> 00:55:43,309
facilitate we're here to help in a

1260
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,580
process well the these growers know how

1261
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:45,980
to

1262
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:47,599
their crops really absolutely I get to

1263
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,980
photograph a lot of different groves and

1264
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,199
do videos and a lot of different growers

1265
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:53,480
this one's really really well done I

1266
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:56,899
love the way they've taken you know

1267
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:59,119
almost I mean obviously it's a cm PR

1268
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,860
it's legal but it's also I still use the

1269
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,359
term where you've kind of you're going

1270
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:04,430
from that black market to that legal

1271
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:06,680
market and these guys have done an

1272
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:09,769
incredible jump in producing like a

1273
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:12,139
really professional room for you to be

1274
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:14,059
able to hang these these LED lights in

1275
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:16,129
and it's amazing I have to say to watch

1276
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:18,590
both of you stand under the lights like

1277
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:23,570
less than six inches and not be sweating

1278
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:25,309
and hot and uncomfortable that's the

1279
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:27,019
point I want to make is definitely again

1280
00:56:25,309 --> 00:56:29,000
we definitely want to thank Neil and

1281
00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:32,509
John because we've done a number of

1282
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,550
these installations so far and we always

1283
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:36,140
typically put them at the top of the

1284
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:38,600
list of what we call attention to

1285
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:40,129
details mm-hmm and and what Neil

1286
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:42,559
mentioned before is there's a little

1287
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:44,690
paradigm shift when you go from HPS to

1288
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,789
LEDs and that's critical for people to

1289
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:48,260
understand is that you you need to

1290
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:49,699
monitor obviously the environment and

1291
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,530
growers know that what you need to do

1292
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:53,509
differently under LEDs to some extent

1293
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:54,950
increase the temperature manage humidity

1294
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:57,110
a little bit differently and results

1295
00:56:54,949 --> 00:56:58,849
there too well especially because when

1296
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:00,740
you have someone like Neil and John able

1297
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:04,309
to show the proof of concept of the

1298
00:57:00,739 --> 00:57:06,500
lights then when people fail themselves

1299
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:09,679
and blame the lights you're able to say

1300
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,570
well we know that this is is possible so

1301
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:13,429
and most people it's very much a human

1302
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:15,470
trait they do it with my product oh I

1303
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:17,239
you know I made some bubble and I put it

1304
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:18,649
in the bags and it just didn't come out

1305
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:21,439
it's like well that's not the bags

1306
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:23,300
falling it's actually Broward who did

1307
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,970
that wrong so having the proof of

1308
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,920
concept to be able to show you know the

1309
00:57:25,969 --> 00:57:31,039
quality and it's really I mean these are

1310
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:34,430
some serious nuggets you know the bikes

1311
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:36,980
look to me like an old-school late 80s

1312
00:57:34,429 --> 00:57:39,319
Early 90s cannabis cultivar just the

1313
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,539
formation of the buds this big and then

1314
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:45,380
you've got over here the sort of newer

1315
00:57:41,539 --> 00:57:48,440
sort of calyx stacked fox tail Mother's

1316
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:51,140
Milk which is just I mean they both look

1317
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,480
except the resin is super resin is ya

1318
00:57:51,139 --> 00:57:55,368
know and they're gonna have weight you

1319
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,710
know they're dense that's the other

1320
00:57:55,369 --> 00:57:59,660
thing with with LEDs you know is you'll

1321
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:01,099
get you know this it looks like it's big

1322
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:02,629
with them when you dry them you don't

1323
00:58:01,099 --> 00:58:05,179
get that dense weight where these

1324
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:09,920
definitely look dense at the stake

1325
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:12,589
everything falling it's a nice it's a

1326
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:15,340
nice growth and so what's the future for

1327
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:18,200
er a lighting are you guys looking to

1328
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:20,690
fill up some LPS are you looking to do

1329
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:23,829
like additional lighting and greenhouses

1330
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:26,000
like what all of the above I would say

1331
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:29,119
at this point in time we have a number

1332
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,280
of installations underway the idea was

1333
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,950
all along to prove a point which is as

1334
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,510
you pointed out this works there's been

1335
00:58:33,949 --> 00:58:37,608
a lot of bad press in the industry about

1336
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:39,230
LEDs and that the market is very open

1337
00:58:37,608 --> 00:58:40,639
right now so there's multiple different

1338
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:42,820
entrance which is fine I think that's

1339
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:45,440
going to allow the industry to evolve

1340
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:47,150
what we wanted to do is very we're very

1341
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,309
close and we want to continue that we're

1342
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:51,079
very closely with growers because they

1343
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:52,369
know how to grow their plants best but

1344
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:54,650
then again like I said we're here to

1345
00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:56,570
facilitate so the next steps really are

1346
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:59,329
working with LPS there's a big push for

1347
00:58:56,570 --> 00:59:02,320
micro RPS in Canada so we have a

1348
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:05,469
presence both in Canada in the US and

1349
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:07,809
we have big plans awesome very cool it's

1350
00:59:05,469 --> 00:59:09,069
a yeah it's absolutely impressive what

1351
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:11,679
you guys have done here all together

1352
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:14,230
thank you the lights look great I love

1353
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:17,019
the way they really create a full canopy

1354
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:18,789
there's no real breaks or spaces and

1355
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:20,889
lights just likes where the efficiency

1356
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:23,440
also comes in right like every square

1357
00:59:20,889 --> 00:59:25,929
and just full is really filled out so

1358
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,450
that's where you get your efficiency you

1359
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:32,769
know having a small high-powered unit

1360
00:59:28,449 --> 00:59:35,289
you know has to dissipate as good a job

1361
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:37,030
as well you know what it's just as

1362
00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:38,440
important for the small-time grower as

1363
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:39,940
it is for the large time grower

1364
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,320
obviously for the fallen small-time

1365
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,849
grower who doesn't have a lot of room

1366
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,740
and a lot of space and air air

1367
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:47,110
circulation is always a problem being

1368
00:59:44,739 --> 00:59:49,719
able to bring the temperature down this

1369
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:52,030
much is very substantial but also on a

1370
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:54,909
large scale I mean using half the

1371
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:57,580
wattage using half the AC reducing your

1372
00:59:54,909 --> 01:00:00,369
footprint by such a large amount is is

1373
00:59:57,579 --> 01:00:02,619
it's a game changer really yeah and I'm

1374
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:05,859
really looking like I'm gonna have a you

1375
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:08,199
know equal equal crop as I would have

1376
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:09,519
under HBS's well I'm glad you said that

1377
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:12,339
because this will definitely be a

1378
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:13,869
two-part video I'm not sure how we'll do

1379
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:16,240
the second part but I definitely want to

1380
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:18,339
get the numbers from you in respect to

1381
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:20,679
the vegetative yields versus the normal

1382
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:22,360
vegetative yields grown under HBS and

1383
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:24,879
then of course from the bubble man's

1384
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:26,680
perspective most importantly the resin

1385
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,110
content the cannabinoid and terpene

1386
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:30,909
profile it's great that it's two

1387
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:33,450
cultivars that you've been growing for

1388
01:00:30,909 --> 01:00:36,309
some time the bite is tried and true

1389
01:00:33,449 --> 01:00:39,399
when done properly you know the bike can

1390
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:40,630
produce 28 percent plus returns on on

1391
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:44,860
rosin and

1392
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:47,860
oil so we headed up to 32.7 on the first

1393
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:50,289
restaurant eh oh so excellent well it'll

1394
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,849
be great to see that we'll do you know a

1395
01:00:50,289 --> 01:00:53,590
second part video even if I have to get

1396
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:56,079
you guys filming some squishes and maybe

1397
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:59,230
some water hash making we definitely

1398
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:01,719
want to show the the resin content and

1399
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:04,420
of course I'll be photographing the grow

1400
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:07,599
still with my macro lens so during this

1401
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:09,280
video you guys will also be seen what

1402
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,969
the resin looks like growing under these

1403
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:18,670
LED lights it is just a pleasure to be

1404
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:19,929
in here awesome guys well thanks Stefan

1405
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:21,820
for sharing your time with us I

1406
01:01:19,929 --> 01:01:23,500
definitely think that in the future it

1407
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:27,190
would be great to do a hash Church

1408
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:28,659
episode on maybe the future of growing

1409
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:31,179
where we get the tissue culture guys

1410
01:01:28,659 --> 01:01:32,949
where we get the LED light guys have you

1411
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:35,799
guys come in have John and Neil come in

1412
01:01:32,949 --> 01:01:37,599
the growers have some extractors come in

1413
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,519
and just talk about this from all the

1414
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,039
different perspectives of growing

1415
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:43,509
cannabis because I think I think it's

1416
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:44,860
it's a big game-changer and I'm

1417
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:46,720
obviously we've all been hearing about

1418
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:49,059
LED lights for a long time and people

1419
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:52,509
have been you know just as excited as I

1420
01:01:49,059 --> 01:01:54,219
am now five years ago but it wasn't

1421
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:54,940
there the results weren't there and this

1422
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:57,239
to me

1423
01:01:54,940 --> 01:02:00,720
looks like there was

1424
01:01:57,239 --> 01:02:02,899
they're here awesome thanks guys thank

1425
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:02,899
you

1426
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:28,200
[Music]

1427
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:28,200
the old blood medicine

1428
01:02:28,630 --> 01:04:52,289
[Music]

1429
01:04:50,289 --> 01:04:52,289
Oh
