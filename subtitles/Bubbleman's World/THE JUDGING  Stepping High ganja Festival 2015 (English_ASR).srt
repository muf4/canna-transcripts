00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,839
tested now what do I have to say about

47
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,599
number

48
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,279
one she was a little bit moist and

49
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,439
that's why I had to steam for a while

50
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,239
before it really started giving me hits

51
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,199
the flavor was really nice

52
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,360
yeah but I think there might have been a

53
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,478
tiny little bit of that sort of fire

54
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,080
cure going on where the smoke from the

55
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:43,240
fire got into the herb a little bit and

56
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:46,000
just slightly made the herb taste like

57
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,918
burnt firewood I still tasted the flavor

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,680
of the herb it was nice I'll have to go

59
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:51,599
write some notes down now and get back

60
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,439

the sh a little bit yeah no problem

85
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,680
that's how the steam pipe

86
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:01,918
Works basically the equivalent of

87
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,600
heating up the nail each time so because

88
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,758
we stopped sucking on the coals for a

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,400
while they cool down now we'll need to

90
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,879
pull on the piece a little bit more and

91
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:13,279
build that up it's a nice part of

92
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:15,360
steaming how you you get that really

93
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,239
nice rip in your head cuz you constantly

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,800
inhaling exhaling inhaling exhaling just

95
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,079
to heat up the herb enough to uh dry out

96
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,079
the moisture to get the hit

97

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,240
we'll come back to the ladies in a

174
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,519
bit Caleb and I are going to hit number

175
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,120
four all right ready I'll let you hold

176
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,120
it

177
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:23,199
[Music]

178
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,198
nice nice nice

179
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:54,159
[Music]

180
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:57,679
number four tastes pretty nice there was

181
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:00,759
a bit of a fruity taste to it Alo number

182
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:03,278
one is the is the best grade maybe a

183
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:08,199
little bit of the AES got into

184
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,198
VAP while VAP clean

185
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,000
clean oh that was definitely nice I like

186
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,560
how number two and number three yeah

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,198
number two and three so far one of my

188
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:20,198
favorites of is a three ey hit number

189
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:21,758
four pretty good I'm going to go right

190
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:25,359
down what I think

191
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:29,680
now you have one

192
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,159
two three four right so let's take this

193
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:35,919
one out cuz it's kind of confusing right

194
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:36,958
now so this is Pure Plant extracts they

195
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,439
look

196
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:42,559
like infused into a plant here you go

197
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,560
this

198
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,078
one so this is hola kosher all natural

199
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:57,240
hypoallergenic this is plant fats in

200
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,680
five 10 20s and 50 milligrams that are

201
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,480
separated so this is

202
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:06,519
thca that comes in active or nonactive

203
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:11,320
phyto canabo so depends on the patient

204
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:15,600
this is P2 High CBD a low TCA so this is

205
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,600
ACDC uh Swiss gold Harlequin sour tunami

206
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,920
so this is not just like one CBD strain

207
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,560
there like five this one is a one to one

208
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:27,078
utilizing CBD strains that are rich in

209
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:29,359
cvd and cushions and indicia strains so

210
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:30,958
it's your one to one the black means

211
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,720
it's activated the white bottles mean

212
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,439
they're inactive and I'll get to why I

213
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,079
would do this this fourth one is a CBD

214
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,600
and CBN capsule so there's no T in this

215
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:44,479
one so what this one is is this one this

216
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,720
one activated degraded and broken down

217
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,639
to CBN and paired with this one

218
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,560
activated and so now you have the

219
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,759
combination of activated decarbox CBD

220
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:58,119
and CBM so collectively when you take a

221
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,759
five a five a five and a five that's my

222
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,399
stacking program instead of a Rick

223
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,800
Simpson Oil you now can stack your phyto

224
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,120
canono and your canono and it's

225
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,758
nonactive and activated and decarbox

226
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,720
format so you could do fives one week 10

227
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:16,278
the next 20s 40s that is what to heal

228
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,399
canc cancer so that would be like immune

229
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:22,679
system it'll start using as a

230
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,879
chemotherapy so so now check this out

231
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,638
this is all into an EHR software that

232
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,480
we're doing here and we're doing

233
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,600
preclinical and clinicals on these to

234
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,360
make sure that they're safer than

235
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,079
Tylenol because I'm not good enough with

236
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,399
114 times safer than alcohol I want 100

237
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:41,919
times safer than Tylenol talk louder

238
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:44,078
right so the idea here is that instead

239
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,639
of promising someone a magical strain

240
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,519
this is a combination of sequencing now

241
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,198
these are just capsules so that's your

242
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,480
immune system I also have sublinguals

243
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:54,599
and sublinguals allow you to have those

244
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,720
inactive and raw so now we can do the

245
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,159
lock your central nervous system and

246
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,560
your immune system so now you have

247
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:04,558
different notes like a piano or guitar

248
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:08,159
has 12 traumatic notes now now you have

249
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:10,798
those notes so I create act now what the

250
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,679
program so I create act now an avonoid

251
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,318
sequencing charart depending on some

252
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,480
inment as an example if you were

253
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:19,879
insomnia and you couldn't sleep there's

254
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,798
a 20 mgram P4 that has your name on it

255
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,799
that'll allow you to sleep 8 hours be

256
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,959
now if you're sensitive to it and you

257
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,558
slept 14 hours switch to the sublingual

258
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,798
drops and use two at a time four at time

259
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:33,599
and slowly key in your dose and then let

260
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,519
me know what capsule you need because

261
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,879
then we can key that in or I could do A

262
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,279
Time release trans dermal gel so you

263
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,039
have problems sleeping this is amazing

264
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:44,759
no no you haven't even gotten to amazing

265
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:47,119
yet so this is this is the P4 this is

266
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:50,919
the P4 trans dermal

267
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:53,279
gel doesn't smell like so this is like a

268
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,720
patch but you just rub it on so nobody

269
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,879
knows you're wearing it it's like a

270
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,640
clear gel that sits on your skin and I

271
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,039
can make this time release so would you

272
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:07,159
this is cbda and CDN combined so you

273
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:09,759
just do this right that's it that's it

274
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:12,240
and what will happen transdermal it goes

275
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:15,200
into the bloodstream release arthritic

276
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,679
pain or what did it my Dr come here come

277
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,679
here

278
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,080
here amazing so the sublinguals allow so

279
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,038
the sublinguals you can boil so they're

280
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,879
inactive and you can take them home and

281
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:32,400
boil them in water and you get activated

282
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,760
cuz boiling water is 229 inside the

283
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,519
little container you're hitting the 284

284
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:40,839
Mark which is what activates t a lighter

285
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,879
is 451 bakon is 350 all of those things

286
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:46,319
kill all the medicinal properties so

287
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,520
when we talk about raw foods it's 118°

288
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:52,279
and below and so with cannabis anything

289
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,279
anything under the 300 mark you start to

290
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:58,158
get into it phyto can avonoids and it's

291
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,319
Pam medicinal value but TP boil off at

292
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:03,280
96

293
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:05,639
104 114 120 they start changing

294
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:08,359
molecules and those are modulator so I

295
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,759
do a full plant full profile extraction

296
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:13,558
on a plant all three parities addressed

297
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,359
and the Turing pull back out and put

298
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:18,119
back into

too great Spector and properties on that
