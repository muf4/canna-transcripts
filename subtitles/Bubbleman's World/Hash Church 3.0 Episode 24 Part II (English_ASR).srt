1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,278
no recording in there we go button was

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,160
pressed I don't know how that happened

3
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:11,638
but yeah I restarted now I'm gonna have

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,559
to upload this in like two podcasts damn

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:18,000
damn a I can continue continue on

6
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:19,519
gentlemen maybe if you're not one sec if

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,240
you're not going to continue to share

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,239
the screen because that's all anyone can

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,640
see right now is oh sorry sorry sorry

10
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:28,959
yeah yeah there go perfect sorry about

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,599
that no problem we just need to make the

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,000
second half better done the first half

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,000
that way everybody won't even tune in to

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,359
the first half they could just go right

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,878
to the

16
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,719
hardcore and it's h actually one minute

17
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:47,679
warning it's gonna be 420 and Kate Kate

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,480
Verdo in one minute 47 seconds so let's

19
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:53,320
do a mark my just my last point on that

20
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,959
and we can move on is that in the lab

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,679
they're doing that you know maybe a

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,280
nasty workup to get there but that is

23
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,079
that compound then what they're doing

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,640
the initial round of safety testing on

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,879
like we have this isolated drug that was

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,040
made with all these fluorinated whatever

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,280
so safety is based on the the nastiest

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,200
and then I'm sure they progress and

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,239
they're doing continuous safety so but

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,680
in theory the drugs may even get safer

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,640
than when they started because they were

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,960
made with a cleaner process ideally the

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,680
the discovery compound is purified to

34
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,478
Absolute Purity 100% Purity so there is

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,880
no doesn't matter it doesn't matter

36
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:27,118
that's the point I trying to get to so

37
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,280
if you're going to that CBC made with

38
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,759
that nasty process I just had shared if

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,000
was brought the Purity cost who cares

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,399
because maybe it's the elixir of life

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,399
right and I'm a rich guy and maybe I'm

42
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:37,719
going to try CBC first and see if it

43
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:39,680
lets me live forever so I'm willing to

44
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:41,438
spend whatever to get to an ultra perer

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
I don't care how nasty the process was

46
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,000
well maybe maybe you could run it

47
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,839
through the wiper a bunch of times clean

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,319
it up enough and then make a distillate

49
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,040
and crash it out who knows but I think I

50
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,959
think the point is and Marcus we can

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,719
move on after this I hate the Bel this

52
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:59,478
point but I think the 4200 discussion

53
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:02,718
you know is more along the lines of this

54
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:05,359
is why we need it re it needs to be

55
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,599
produced in a regulated environment

56
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,719
because of all these potential things

57
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,560
that could potentially happen is this

58
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,919
guy right that he says Oh My Method

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,920
works but everybody else's method shits

60
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,399
on everybody else says that everybody

61
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,639
else has got toxic [ __ ] but his stuff oh

62
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,280
it's really clean we we don't know but

63
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:27,238
if it's all manufactured in a regulated

64
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,598
environment it would be done so in a way

65
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,400
where we would know what the right op is

66
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:34,759
that makes something that's safe for

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,360
human consumption and hopefully they

68
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,158
would have the right analytical

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,800
techniques in there to know when a batch

70
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:43,959
does not meet product specification and

71
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,280
you got to throw it away right now when

72
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,800
a product doesn't meet product

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,598
specification for Vape I think they put

74
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,000
it into gummies that's like the solution

75
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:55,878
of oh I can't get this through a vape

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,639
COA manufacturer because they're going

77
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:59,878
to look at it and say what's all this

78
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:02,039
other crap in there but you put it into

79
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,479
some dark oil and put it into the

80
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,878
gummies or chocolates and it's it's okay

81
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,039
you know dilution is a solution to

82
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,280
pollution my

83
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,120
friend yeah anyway what do you have to

84
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,878
say about that Mike West you're being

85
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,439
quiet over there I feel like you got

86
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:21,560
some things to

87
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:26,039
say yeah I think ultimately a lot of the

88
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,319
hemp processors had to look at you as

89
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,438
they're processing and working a hemp

90
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,719
you are going to be trying to isolate a

91
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:35,598
in general

92
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,598
CBD that CBD during the isolation you're

93
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,479
going to obviously pull off the the

94
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,839
other cannabinoids which saw the saw the

95
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:46,759
increased valuation but also saw the

96
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,920
development of the accumulation of THC

97
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,759
that then had to get remediated and

98
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:54,280
people have looked at you obviously

99
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,639
turning those other canabo into

100
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,919
potential revenue streams right so the

101
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,359
many of these hemp laabs are trying to

102
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:05,919
generate revenue streams in their own

103
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,000
unique way whether by isolating or

104
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,839
remediating or converting those

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,120
canavs um into other canavs and

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,120
formulating them into different products

107
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,120
and that's one of those things that can

108
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,478
be done safely but

109
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,160
obviously I agree with Dr Mark needs to

110
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,918
be done in a regul regulated environment

111
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,840
because we want we don't want products

112
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,000
being sold to gas stations that have

113
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:35,000
that haven't been produced used in C

114
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,199
then co8 because there's obvious legal

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,680
ramifications if somebody who let's say

116
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,840
that we're producing it and it's a

117
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,560
product that causes you know somebody

118
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,279
who eats a gummy bear out a truck

119
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:52,240
station to become

120
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:54,918
intoxicated um due to some you know side

121
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,519
effect um that could create liabilities

122
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:59,758
for the gummy gummy manufacturer or

123
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,240
whatever whatever product manufacturer

124
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,080
and those those lawsuits have yet to

125
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,879
happen so this is kind of a you know

126
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,719
precautionary tale that we don't want to

127
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,319
see that come back and bite our industry

128
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,919
in the ass and create these legal

129
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,120
ramifications and we're starting to see

130
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,758
that there you know with the development

131
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,240
of CBC and Delta a you know it's a

132
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,280
wonderful way that we can mitigate THC

133
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,519
as well as you know convert some of the

134
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,799
CB CBD into new products but obviously

135
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,799
if we distribute them

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,680
as try and distribute them freely

137
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,319
instead of you know say Distributing

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,199
them in adult only venues then it can

139
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:45,439
create a unwanted attention that comes

140
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:48,240
back and ends up gener

141
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,719
generating uh neg negative publicity

142
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,079
which leads to negative regulatory

143
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,360
environments right there's been some

144
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,519
states that have now passed bans on

145
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,840
Delta 8 even though I would say that

146
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:03,359
Delta 8 is probably a lower risk than

147
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,758
the you know recreational THC that's

148
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,520
found in

149
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:10,520
Colorado so you know Mike I I was on a

150
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,198
uh I was on a zoom call the other night

151
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:16,159
with a group of cannabis

152
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,879
Executives uh both on the hemp and on

153
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,319
the Cannabis side and um the fellow who

154
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:26,000
invited me on wanted me to kind of break

155
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:30,160
down Delta 8 and one of the stories that

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
was shared was an executive who again is

157
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,479
well versed in the Cannabis space and a

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
longtime user and a CEO of a large

159
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:43,199
cannabis company in

160
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,839
California and traveled to an area and

161
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:50,199
bought some actually no what he told me

162
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:54,478
was they went to the um the uh vaping

163
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:57,960
Expo which is typically um uh mostly

164
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:00,639
nicotine mostly nicotine products and

165
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,758
device manufacturers and what people who

166
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,360
work in those Supply chains and he said

167
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:11,919
this year it was very different he said

168
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:14,520
it was 20% nicotine 80% delta8

169
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:19,560
80% of the people at the vaping thing

170
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:23,680
were all delta8 Hustlers or delta8

171
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,720
product manufacturers or whatever so he

172
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,519
brought back a couple products back on

173
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,800
the plane of California with him and he

174
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,758
showed an energy shot that he said yeah

175
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,960
he had you know first class tickets so

176
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:39,639
he had a really comfortable seat and

177
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:42,279
everything took a shot and he said about

178
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,680
10 to 15 minutes later he had an

179
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:48,719
incredible feeling of of wonderful

180
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,000
Euphoria like he'd never experienced

181
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,840
with Delta 9 and being a longtime user

182
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,759
you know he's like wow this is this

183
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,000
stuff's great like this is wonderful

184
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,319
because it tastes good you know

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,279
so he took a few more sips of it well he

186
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,080
said about 10 minutes later he started

187
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,638
feeling a knot in his

188
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,240
stomach about 20 minutes later he broke

189
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,639
out into a cold

190
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,478
sweat and for the last three hours of

191
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,319
that CrossCountry flight he said it was

192
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:21,800
the most miserable flight he'd ever been

193
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:25,439
on before he was incredibly High had

194
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,038
feeling of anxi and

195
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,560
paranoia and was just thinking oh my God

196
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:33,759
this is soul that bodegas and gas

197
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,479
stations to 16-year-old kids and it gets

198
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:39,319
you [ __ ] loaded dude and it's

199
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,639
probably Chuck loaded with that ISO THC

200
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,200
isomer which we don't know what kind of

201
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:48,000
impact that has on longterm and and and

202
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,839
shortterm health and so you're you're

203
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,320
absolutely right this does need to be

204
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,279
regulated

205
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,000
because and and I think again some of

206
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:58,879
the correct me if I'm wrong but some of

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,759
the biggest markets for Delta 8 now are

208
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,799
some of the most cannabis unfriendly

209
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:06,559
States the the states that that don't

210
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:08,199
have a strong Delta 9 Lobby if you see

211
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,518
like what's happened in Colorado and

212
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,120
what I believe was happening in the

213
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,560
other states is the Delta 9 Lobby

214
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,200
doesn't want delta8 at all right they

215
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,319
want you you know there's a certain

216
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,040
level of rigor when it comes to Delta 9

217
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,879
production that just not applied to

218
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:27,240
delta8 so um I hate to sit on a canono

219
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,480
because I know it's safe and I know it's

220
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,959
a good canabo and I know it's good for

221
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,399
those kids but it's just so unfortunate

222
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,359
that we're in this situation that's only

223
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,360
been made possible through the

224
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,600
Ridiculousness of prohibition itself

225
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,320
that we're we're we're stuck in this

226
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,159
current situation I don't know really

227
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,160
know how it will resolve yeah

228
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:52,078
Canada when Canada passed the

229
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:54,120
regulations for THC on the federal level

230
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:56,919
they they made it actually not just Tac

231
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,919
but the extraction of all cannaboids so

232
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:02,360
if you're going to do any of the canono

233
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:05,519
C D or Tac it all falls under the the

234
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,320
recreational processing licenses you can

235
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,759
you can separately get licensed for pro

236
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,000
produ production or processing of pemp

237
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:15,360
but the minute you start extracting it

238
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,200
then you have to have the regulatory

239
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,680
licenses so I and you know ultimately

240
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,600
that's one of the things that has yet to

241
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:25,799
be addressed once I think once you have

242
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:29,360
the FDA involved you know whether it be

243
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:33,078
a food product or a drug product top top

244
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,159
topical or inestable or inhalable

245
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:37,599
otherwise it's going they're going to

246
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,439
have to implement some production

247
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,120
regulatory environments and that's in

248
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,600
general going to require a requirement

249
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,480
of COA right you're going to have to be

250
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,519
able to have a COA and you know that's

251
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,600
going to be not only required by your

252
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,078
insurance broker but also by the you

253
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,800
know Federal Regulatory Commission you

254
00:10:54,078 --> 00:11:01,319
know in the US that's going to be the F

255
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:02,519
FDA um potential potentially the the DEA

256
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,440
or

257
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,399
ATF but it's one of those things that

258
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,639
that's regulated you know if we're doing

259
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,399
a caffinated beverage you know or a THC

260
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,959
beverage you got to make sure that that

261
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,879
beverage is not going to be poisoning

262
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,958
your customers because the regulatory

263
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,159
requirements are going to make your

264
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:23,039
insurance too

265
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,078
expensive plus you know bad press poison

266
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,439
your customers you're going out of

267
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,000
business right so it's one of those

268
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,040
things in the unregulated industry which

269
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,958
you a lot of the hemp processors kind of

270
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:36,039
fall in that legal gray area where're

271
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,559
they're operating on with a state hemp

272
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:41,879
license but many of those State hemp

273
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:44,278
licenses don't that regulatory framework

274
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:47,039
doesn't cover all of the you know not

275
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:49,799
only the extraction but

276
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,480
chemosynthesis so I think that as the

277
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,599
Food and Drug Administration gets

278
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,839
involved on a federal level that you're

279
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,320
going to start to see you know CBD th

280
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:02,639
all the isomerization C coalation and

281
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,560
other you know chemosynthetic

282
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,720
conversions require safety trials before

283
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,119
before they go to a commercial

284
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,079
Market um and that's something that you

285
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,480
know can be done at universities here in

286
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,000
Canada but that when we were trying to

287
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,800
do them down in the states we ended up

288
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,198
having to look at doing that those

289
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,599
product trials abroad because doing

290
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:24,159
research at

291
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,519
universities is difficult with the N of

292
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,958
Monopoly we we hope that with this news

293
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,519
couple weeks ago that's going to open up

294
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,198
door because we'll actually some of the

295
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,480
licensed producers will be able to

296
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:38,039
actually you know work and develop you

297
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,720
know genetics that are formulated we can

298
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,360
extract and formulate them and prepare

299
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,800
them but I

300
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,600
mean it's a long time coming and you

301
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,599
don't we don't want to hold our breath

302
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,159
for we don't want to tell the patients

303
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,120
to hold their breath to be able to

304
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,559
formulate these products for them so

305
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,320
until the until the F Federal regulatory

306
00:12:54,559 --> 00:13:00,039
framework comes out we kind of need to

307
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,760
use these forums peer review and pure

308
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:03,439
self-regulate and use that

309
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,559
self-regulation to create a better

310
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,959
industry that can set an example so that

311
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,518
you know we can educate the The

312
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:13,958
Regulators on what needs to be

313
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,919
included you know I'm actually quite

314
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,838
appalled that there's still States you

315
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,679
know some of the some of the licensed

316
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,560
states that allow recreational still

317
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:24,239
don't

318
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:26,278
require um pesticide testing some of

319
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,399
some of them did some you and there's

320
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:33,679
been EDS and flows Washington had it out

321
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,639
outright ban on or aerobic bacteria

322
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,679
which was really bad for the organic

323
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,959
farmers and then a couple years after

324
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:43,039
regulation on the recreational level

325
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,799
they allowed some bacteria they just

326
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,120
required you to test for the mot toxins

327
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:50,599
so I think and then other places you

328
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,720
know they Oregon always had a fairly

329
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,759
strict pesticide thing but I don't think

330
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,920
Oregon required heavy metals in in the

331
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,800
first round heavy metal test

332
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,360
um and then some of the some of the

333
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,000
other states you know California's kind

334
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,480
of had more Progressive they started

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,399
fairly loose in the medical scene and as

336
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,360
its transition to recreational testing's

337
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,278
gotten a lot stricter so I think each of

338
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,000
those states are acting as LAB Works of

339
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:19,799
demogra Laboratories of democracy and

340
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,600
you know I have no doubt the feds are

341
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:23,278
keeping paying attention to seeing

342
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,959
what's happening in each of those States

343
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,559
and working on a federal level to figure

344
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,559
out how they're going to create those

345
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,559
regulations

346
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,039
but yes to everything you

347
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,440
said yes so I mean and and ultimately

348
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,519
Mark I

349
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,079
mean because it is chemosynthesis right

350
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,639
it's not just extraction well yeah the

351
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:52,078
the conversion well it's interesting

352
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,959
because Dustin started talking about

353
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:57,439
just basically the

354
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:59,919
isomerization of Delta 8 and so or I'm

355
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,279
sorry the isomerization of Delta 9 right

356
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:05,198
so just starting with extract and

357
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:08,078
Distilling it down to a crude and now

358
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:10,359
you have Delta 9 well now all I'm going

359
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:15,000
to do is throw a little bit of

360
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:17,839
dirt IE clay at this which is bed night

361
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,159
clay that's what these acidic Clays are

362
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,399
you know if you um if you push a roller

363
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,600
coaster down the hill it goes down the

364
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,480
hill and it doesn't come back so that's

365
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,519
the thing with Delta n

366
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,600
and so

367
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,679
um I I I think that that way of making

368
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:45,639
Delta 8 and enriching a distillate

369
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:48,638
sample with Delta 8 is inherently more

370
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:53,079
safer than a chemical

371
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:56,440
conversion of CBD isolate through Delta

372
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:58,479
8 or or to to Delta eight I I don't I

373
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,920
don't know if I just confused everyone

374
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,399
so converting Delta 9 into Delta 8 I

375
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:09,360
think is safer than converting CBD into

376
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:11,879
Delta 8 does that make sense Dustin Ju

377
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,399
Just Like a full spectrum you Dustin

378
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:18,559
you're muted let's say a CBC hash

379
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,039
had organically grown hash if it's grown

380
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,758
organically and it's a cultivar that

381
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,198
naturally expresses those cannabinoids

382
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:28,919
and Turpin it would be preferable to

383
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,679
process them you naturally right Asos

384
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,159
oos to having to worry about you know

385
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:35,239
taking taking another conoid to go

386
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,919
through the dirty chemistry which can be

387
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,000
cleaned up but then you have waste

388
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:40,599
products and we all we as

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,559
environmentalists want to minimize those

390
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,879
waste

391
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,078
products so right it's no longer an

392
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,039
extract and I guess you know again on

393
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:50,958
the other side I'll say well I'm just

394
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,278
going to take an extract and throw

395
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:58,559
something natural like clay which is

396
00:16:54,278 --> 00:17:03,958
acidic not realizing that also cleaning

397
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:05,438
up the color is converting this extract

398
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,438
you

399
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:13,199
know I guess that's better because you

400
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:16,919
can't form the other ISO

401
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:21,240
THC uh that way uh because the THC ring

402
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:24,199
structures already formed I guess so I I

403
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,720
I'm inherently just thinking that that's

404
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:30,840
a safer way so if you have to make Delta

405
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,839
8 have a Delta 9

406
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,919
license Delta with no presence of

407
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,440
anything other than just the crude and

408
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,440
it was just like a kind of yeah just

409
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,720
heat and whatever came off the plant he

410
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,320
was basically the wheels of the roller

411
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,360
coaster going down the hill you can use

412
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,558
acid so what acid does is acid makes the

413
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,158
hill that the roller coaster goes down

414
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:07,319
smaller acid lowers the activation

415
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,080
energy in between Delta 8 and Delta 9

416
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,200
but what you're doing with heat is

417
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:12,759
you're just pushing it down the hill in

418
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,840
fact you got to remember you did that in

419
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:19,599
glassware right Dustin yeah glassware is

420
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:23,599
acidic glassware essentially in and of

421
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:27,119
itself is cicc acid right so cicc acid

422
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:29,399
is an acid right so where itself could

423
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,279
catalyze this reaction Mark you shared a

424
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,679
paper with me that was basically just

425
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,079
heat turning CBD into all sorts of crazy

426
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,880
different cans right and just through

427
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,240
heat alone so if I'm smoking a bowl uh

428
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,919
in a glass pipe uh am I'm getting all

429
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,038
sorts of canabo conversions just from

430
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,679
the heat right there into my lungs you

431
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,400
you could yeah I mean yeah absolutely

432
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,600
absolutely there's a guy out there

433
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,440
Marcus Rogan I I didn't see his talk but

434
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,759
he gave a talk last week or a couple

435
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,558
weeks ago about he's doing some

436
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:02,640
aerosolization studies or I don't know

437
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:04,918
if he's got the joint smoking machine or

438
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,720
he is that at

439
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:12,038
UBC uh yeah that guy right yeah so so

440
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,839
he's doing Marcus what he claims is that

441
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:19,158
the THC never vaporizes it never reaches

442
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,359
its boiling point and it's some aerosol

443
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:27,159
formation of liquid

444
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:29,558
THC in in the in in weed smoke so um I

445
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,400
don't know I I mean the other

446
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:33,480
interesting aspect about it is he said

447
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,919
that yeah he's like what is you know

448
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,880
joint smoke is is not hot enough to

449
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,480
vaporize

450
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,240
THC and it's like wait a second are you

451
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,440
talking about the actual Hots of the

452
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,519
joint that's thousands of degrees man

453
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,880
that's that's Marcus Rogan right Dr

454
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,599
marcusan that guy that guy yeah I you

455
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,480
know what I just it it just I was like

456
00:19:54,599 --> 00:20:00,399
this sounds really familiar so I went

457
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,279
into my phone and my emails

458
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,679
and I reached out to him on February

459
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:09,200
27th he got back to me and I guess I

460
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,280
just sort of spaced um getting he he he

461
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,279
got back to me twice so now I'm gonna

462
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,319
have to send him back an email he

463
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,918
interesting guid on Church you know I I

464
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,439
know him truth be told but I think some

465
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:24,000
of his ideas are a little flaky at best

466
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,120
and just they're they're not always

467
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,200
scientifically grounded so would make a

468
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:32,038
for very interesting Lively Church

469
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,319
discussion with Dr now called him out so

470
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:37,558
yeah I know he's gonna kill me now right

471
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,519
no but I'm just saying you know to to

472
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:42,678
come up with this concept that you're

473
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:47,158
not actually vaporizing THC it's like

474
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:50,720
well uh okay then then H how does my dab

475
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:52,799
rig work uh tell me exactly I'm creating

476
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,319
some kind of aerosol that Jets through

477
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,279
the

478
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:59,119
water I don't know just doesn't sound

479
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,399
grounded to me hey I want to welcome uh

480
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:05,239
best friend in the house and dragonfly

481
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,080
Earth medicine um welcome

482
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,679
guys hey

483
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:12,278
there what's going on

484
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,798
dude hey Josh and Kelly how are you

485
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:16,759
farming just farming I feel like that's

486
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:17,918
what you guys are up to farming that's

487
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,359
what farmers

488
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:24,159
do is that what the dragonfly Earth

489
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,158
medicine Farm crew has been up to as

490
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,960
well they look Frozen

491
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,400
maybe I'm frozen everyone else is moving

492
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,400
no you're not

493
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:39,119
Frozen everything dialed

494
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:43,919
[Music]

00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,918

496

499
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:57,440
and then I suddenly heard you while I

500
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,879

through better now let's give that a

502
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,240
shot I'm not sure if it's working but

503
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:08,798
it's like a psychedelic experience to

504
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,278
see if you're like hearing us or if

505
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,079
we're talking and it's like glitchy it's

506
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:16,960
like oh [ __ ] then you're on time and

507
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:18,879
you're off time it's like [ __ ] you know

508
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,759
but big love and respect to everyone

509
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,880
here today and we appreciate the

510
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,400
conversation yeah and just wanted to say

511
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,720
you know in response to what you were

512
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,798
saying Marcus we do feel like you know

513
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,600
these conversations are incredibly

514
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:35,759
important we do feel like all facets of

515
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:38,959
the wheel need to be discussed in order

516
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,839
to understand how it rolls evenly and

517
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,240
equally you know it's like the Dharma

518
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:45,918
wheel if all the spokes on the Dharma

519
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,200
wheel are not taught perfectly then the

520
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,320
wheel doesn't roll properly and all of

521
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,159
these conversations are all part of the

522
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:57,079
spokes of the wheel into US finding our

523
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:59,760
ultimate health and our ultimate

524
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:01,839
placement on this Earth right now and

525
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,599
how are we going to move forward this

526
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,439
plant and I think that all of these

527
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:09,959
conversations are incredibly important

528
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,960
and we're always gonna we're always GNA

529
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,519
uphold the spoke and the wheel that is

530
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,798
the full spectrum that is the fully

531
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,639
regenerative because you know that's our

532
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,400
expertise and that's what we uphold but

533
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,600
we want to say how much we respect and

534
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,880
admire this conversation and the Deep

535
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,759
science that goes into it because it is

536
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,360
important to have all of the colors of

537
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,879
the rainbow invol

538
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,319
that's why we're humans because we're

539
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:39,159
all part of the

540
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:41,839
rainbow nice I like it h humans I like

541
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:43,640
it all Factory can we talk about the

542
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,278
trees real quick we were about you you

543
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,880
mentioned you guys are having something

544
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,400
some issue up there with your old growth

545
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,679
and that maybe dragonfly was involved as

546
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,519
well yep I think they'd be great to

547
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,240
share directly involved we're just very

548
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:00,480
active nature beings we live in a

549
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,919
mountain region and we are actively

550
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,319
protecting the old growth in our area as

551
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:10,200
well but Ferry Creek on Vancouver Island

552
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:12,480
and the fery creek blockade is now the

553
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,759
longest standing blockade in Canadian

554
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:21,159
history there's been at least 175 people

555
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:24,079
arrested in the last safe three weeks um

556
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,600
it's an amazing it's an amazing standoff

557
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,639
in the woods and uh yeah we've been

558
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,398
supporting it in every single way that

559
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,799
we can there's been marches all over

560
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:35,479
British Colombia even in New York uh

561
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:37,639
different places in the world in

562
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,278
solidarity to fairy Creek and we're

563
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,640
trying to um really follow the lead of

564
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:45,798
the indigenous Nations this is their

565
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,759
land this is uh so so we're really

566
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:51,278
talking to them directly at fairy Creek

567
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:54,038
the elders and the Chiefs that own the

568
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:56,240
land outright are trying to be in

569
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:57,839
communication with uh the federal

570
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,839
government as well as the provincial

571
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,599
government they're not really getting

572
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,759
anywhere so we are trying to help

573
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:06,798
disseminate out the information in a

574
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:09,278
proper way by getting it from the

575
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:13,038
indigenous Nations and following their

576
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:15,640
lead they are the ones who've been um up

577
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:19,319
there for the 175 days they've been up

578
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:21,600
there since August so this is a 10mon

579
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:23,480
blockade all through the winter and then

580
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,839
the Canadian government released an

581
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:30,278
injunction that allowed teal Jones group

582
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:33,199
to go in and log one you know the last

583
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:34,960
old growth Watershed Valley on Southern

584
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,919
Vancouver Island and as Marcus said

585
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,200
before there's only

586
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,960
two 7% old and I wanted I want to be

587
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,600
really clear with everybody that these

588
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,519
old growths are really massive yellow

589
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:51,319
old growth Cedars they will not be using

590
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:55,679
these old growths for really anything

591
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:59,319
other than paper or or you know some

592
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:02,798
kind of a fiber board or to paper

593
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:06,278
because it's not a hard wood so what

594
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:09,278
what the Ultimate Reality is in logging

595
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:11,599
old growth forest is that they want to

596
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:15,159
be able to have the land so that they

597
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:17,719
can replant it with the fur and the

598
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:20,799
single species so that they can turn it

599
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,159
into a higher commodity piece if they

600
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,480
replant it then it's worth more money

601
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,600
than the old growth standing so I'll

602
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,159
just build on that by saying the yellow

603
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:32,759
cedar

604
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,760
is different subspecies of the cedar

605
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:39,200
most of the cedar you see on the west

606
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,200
coast around you dust and a lot of

607
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:49,000
it's on uh there's port

608
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:54,158
or and

609
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:57,398
or very rare very awesome from Port

610
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,559
Orford Oregon the yellow cedar has a

611
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:02,439
magnificent incense flavor and a

612
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:05,480
magnificent flavor the natives used this

613
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,919
leader to create Co up in some cases

614
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,880
there's there's stories of them going

615
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,559
all through Polynesia you know back in

616
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,919
the day the Haag guay natives currently

617
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:20,798
were on the sin nation and the S nation

618
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:23,278
in the cies has been called extinct but

619
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,759
they are now winning Court battles to

620
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,558
prove that they have a place here that

621
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,200
they have a language that they have that

622
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:32,678
was just lifted last month yeah recently

623
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,000
they had just become legitimized again

624
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,519
as as a as a native indigenous Nation

625
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,440
we're also near the tanaha nation and

626
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:44,359
they helped save jumbo pass jumbo keep

627
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,278
jumbo wild was a very important uh

628
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:49,918
environmentalist uh Mission so there's

629
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,960
also the Trans Canada Pipeline and

630
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,200
there's a tremendous amount of energy in

631
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,640
the native and Indigenous First Nations

632
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Community to stop the pipeline and

633
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,799
people can look up the tiny house

634
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,880
Warriors and uh the braided Warriors and

635
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:07,119
so many other people that are that are

636
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,120
on the front lines and in Central and

637
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,319
Northern British Columbia to stop the

638
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,479
pipeline and we're just really um

639
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:18,278
getting out very very little information

640
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:21,640
to you all we really highly recommend

641
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:24,640
that everybody go directly to the faery

642
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,880
creek blockade which is on Instagram

643
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,320
Trans Canada pipeline or Trans Canada

644
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,120
Pipeline and the wet and check out I may

645
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:33,079
have said that wrong so that you can

646
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,158
learn directly from these people so you

647
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:37,158
can get the proper education so that

648
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,159
we're you know we're we're not saying

649
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:42,480
the improper things which is just so

650
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:44,039
incredibly important also there's been

651
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,519
uh

652
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:50,960
terrible I I I have to take a second

653
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,798
here

654
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:59,558
actually because

655
00:28:53,798 --> 00:29:01,398
um just last week in cam loops

656
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:05,519
there was

657
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:08,319
215 bodies found

658
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,079
buried underneath the school the

659
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,639
residential school in Camp for the

660
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,720
residential school for the indigenous

661
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,840
Nations the last residential school

662
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,278
closed in

663
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:24,720
1998 residential schools was an amazing

664
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:29,159
horror horrific schooling operation that

665
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,640
tried to break the native connection to

666
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,399
Earth to break the First Nations

667
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,600
connected to disassociate them

668
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:39,558
completely from everything that they

669
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,639
were about to take the native out of the

670
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:48,000
human was the goal of these residential

671
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,000
schools and now we have the cap

672
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:05,599
to three years

673
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:08,519
old um so if that isn't a

674
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,558
call to to all of

675
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,599
humanity to

676
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:16,879
support all of

677
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:21,398
us then I do not know what is if we are

678
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,399
not waking up and recognizing

679
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,558
not figured

680
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,960
out yet that this is the demise of

681
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:40,319
humanity that separates us that causes

682
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,720
us to find

683
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,558
problems in all different people no

684
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,880

claim towards climate change and we

don't agree with that what we agree with

747
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:32,199
keeping nature systems alive because we

748

in on them right now the magic is still

770
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:30,279
there it's bigger and it's brighter than

771
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:33,118
ever and there's more and more and

772
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:37,320
people that are Awakening to letting go

773
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,320
of fear and and and taking on

774
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,000
love thank you guys for coming in and

775
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:47,878
sharing that that was uh Indeed heavy

776
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,358
but uh it uh needs to be talked about

777
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:53,838
and mentioned and everything you guys

778
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:56,199
said was uh super on point it was uh and

779
00:34:53,838 --> 00:35:00,000
I I hate to you know bring it even

780
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:03,799
heavier but that 200 115 is literally

781
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,239
the tiniest tiniest tiniest tip of the

782
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,200
that of the iceberg that is the genocide

783
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,399
of the

784
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,159
indigenous population which just seems

785
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,480
to be like you said it's the it's the

786
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,440
war on nature right like they're the

787
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,000
they're they speak for the trees truly

788
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,358
if the lorox was ever based on anything

789
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,559
it would be the indigenous people and so

790
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,159
it it kind of makes sense that whatever

791
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:28,838
this is that just decides that it needs

792
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,159
to destroy nature nature

793
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:34,279
Destroyer um it seems like the

794
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:36,719
indigenous people are you know battled

795
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:40,400
in that I mean I think it's partially

796
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:43,039
racism but it's I mean yeah it seems to

797
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,240
be even heavier it dep it depends on how

798
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,159
deep the rabbit hole you go okay if

799
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,199
you're and I I get where you're coming

800
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:52,159
from Dr Mark you're probably racism for

801
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:54,919
sure but if you go like deeper down the

802
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:58,159
rabbit hole I think it's like good

803
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,519
versus evil like it's just like that

804
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,920
that oldest energy and and the weird

805
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:04,119
thing is and I was talking about this

806
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,960
with my wife the other day that life

807
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:11,559
itself is tension and it's tension

808
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:14,079
between birth and death and that tension

809
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:15,759
is held your whole life and we all feel

810
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,160
that tension and that kind of seems to

811
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,920
be the value that is life and that you

812
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:22,318
can't ever cuz my wife was like oh

813
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,800
there's just so much evil in the world

814
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:25,480
and I'm like yeah I'm pretty sure it's

815
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,920
balanced I think there can only be a

816
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,639
certain amount of that and a certain

817
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,519
amount of this and then there's the

818
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:33,118
tension between the two and depending on

819
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:35,400
where you navigate in that tension [ __ ]

820
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,760
can get heavier [ __ ] can get a little

821
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,800
lighter oh you're muted but I want to

822
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,960
hear what you're saying

823
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Josh you're muted also if you if you go

824
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,559
down the rabbit

825
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,000
hole with racism you find out we all

826
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:54,920
came from

827
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,318
Africa yeah exactly it's really that

828
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,639
simple yeah well it is really that

829
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:03,759
simple but for people who are blinded by

830
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:05,480
ignorance and anger and hate kind of

831
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,800
like you know going back to that sort of

832
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,240
good versus evil again you know if

833
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,079
you're tapping into that energy you're

834
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,439
uh you know what's just happened there

835
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,119
uh Josh I'm watching the YouTube video

836
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,358
and you're talking but it's it's delayed

837
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,079

really support this brand it's echo

854
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,640
electuary down in uh in Oregon they this

855
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,000
one's one of their single Source but

856
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,759
they do a lot of partner stuff but he

857
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,960
does the best job I've ever come across

858
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,000
of getting the profile of a plant into

859
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,440
an extract using a hydrocarbon it's it's

860
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,838
incredible great guys they know what

861
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,358
they're doing

862
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:29,000
definitely yeah and they support uh it's

863
00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:31,279
three to the B so 3% of their profits go

864
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,559
directly back into B conservatories uh

865
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,480
they have all their own on-site Apiaries

866
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,358
uh where their grows are they they

867
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,679
practice regenerative agriculture um

868
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:42,679
great people three to the B I like

869
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:53,280
that someone was uh meant oh go ahead

870
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,838
well um we have a thing to share and

871
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,480
it's it's has to do with Nick risden and

872
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:01,639
and anyone who doesn't know who Nick

873
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:05,639
risden is can look him up online online

874
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:08,960
on Instagram lime Rising farms uh Nick

875
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:12,159
Rison amazing person he's been through

876
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,800
limes disease is is his one of his

877
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,879
battles it's led to many different

878
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,839
things well it's limes disease with

879
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:23,200
multiple different uh bacterial um

880
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:27,519
infections from the tick bite um and he

881
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:30,879
has just gone in for some uh accumul

882
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:33,119
thery um more yes some not necessarily

883
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,880
therapy but they're they're looking at

884
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,680
his brain they're going in for testing

885
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,000
um to try to put him into and I really

886
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:43,358
want Nick to come on and he will um

887
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,480
another time so a lot of this on

888
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:47,239
paraphrasing he's going to have much

889
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,838
better words he's going to tell us

890
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:52,959
exactly what's going on so I'm just sort

891
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:55,119
of giving a rough um overview he went in

892
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,199
they wanted to see what kind of things

893
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:02,200
they could throw at him to to instill a

894
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:04,919
seizure to see he can get up to 300

895
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:07,639
seizures a day or you know and and and

896
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:10,639
to and to look at those SE seizures on

897
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:12,639
an EKG machine and they had them you

898
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:16,118
know hooked up everywhere on a brain

899
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:19,679
wave machine as well and here's what

900
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:23,480
they found so so this first picture he

901
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:26,598
just shared with us this morning is them

902
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:30,639
um trying to he goes into Grandma

903
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:35,359
seizure and they're trying to stop the

904
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:37,279
seizures with every kind of drug

905
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:39,960
anti-seizure that they had these are his

906
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,760
brain waves even even they try to give

907
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,960
him a um uh some beers which he knew

908
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,160
wasn't FDA approved or anything they

909
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,318
threw everything at him you know all of

910
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,318
the Aderall

911
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,920
now we don't have anym which they had

912
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:05,358
taken away all of his medicines because

913
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,760
they wanted to throw all of their

914
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:11,960
medicines at it he was allowed to take

915
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,040
the Moc canic caps which is what we make

916
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:18,480
which is just a a blend of mushrooms and

917
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:21,279
Ste mushrooms from old growth

918
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,199
forests again they're mushrooms from old

919
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,760
growth forests yeah mixed with hemp

920
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:30,199
grown regeneratively whole a bunch of

921
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:33,280
different adaptogenic herbs compounded

922
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:37,838
adaptogenic intelligent herbs so he took

923
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,400
12 caps a big a big dose and then 45

924
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:42,400
minutes

925
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:47,160
later his bra almost straight lined

926
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:50,480
completely complete total

927
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:52,239
um yeah complete completely balanced

928
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,039
balanced

929
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,559
calmed

930
00:41:54,039 --> 00:42:00,079
and they were amazed and it it was

931
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:00,078
amazing

932
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,119
to on to the incredibly intelligent

933
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,280
conversation that you all were having

934
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,680
before is that when we're dealing with

935
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,599
these adaptogenic secondary metabolites

936
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:26,480
you know they change not only do they

937
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:28,318
change in the making of them but they

938
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,760
change in the uptake of them and the

939
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:35,358
response of them as well so it's sort of

940
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:39,400
hard to to to calculate this stuff but

941
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:40,279
here we are being given a really awesome

942
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,358
uh

943
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,480
representation of of the power of

944
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:48,159
natural medicine and

945
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,880
herbalism you know and a a person who's

946
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,558
putting both of these things together

947
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,920
really beautifully right now in a book

948
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:54,359
that I'm listening to and it made me

949
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,119
kind of want to reach out to him and

950
00:42:54,358 --> 00:43:00,358
maybe invite him onto hash church is um

951
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,200
is Rupert sheldrick's son Merlin

952
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:07,119
sheldrick who wrote a book called

953
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:09,118
entangled life and uh it is really worth

954
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,960
checking out I think it's like a $20

955
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,760
book or something 18 bucks or you can

956
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,000
just get it on Audible and listen to it

957
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,119
and it is Merlin in his voice um sort of

958
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,239
reading the book I which I find really

959
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,200
wonderful it's uh it just kind of is

960
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,000
tying in a lot of what we're talking

961
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,960
about right now gets into the sensory

962
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,800
science he's talking a lot about the mic

963
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,838
Riz he he's been you know he went to

964
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,480
school at Cambridge and basically

965
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:35,838
studied uh a whole variety of different

966
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,240
sort of synergies between plants and

967
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:41,078
learning about bacterias and viruses and

968
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:43,598
how they can like transfer their DNA to

969
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:46,280
one another horizontally and bacteria

970
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,000
can take just a really super unique and

971
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,240
awesome conversation uh but a a lot

972
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
about the mushroom a lot about the

973
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:55,919
micro and uh yeah if you guys haven't

974
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,199
heard of Merlin or you haven't checked

975
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:07,000
out his book check it out

976
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:11,598
um uh Dr James White who studies um the

977
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:15,000
ropas cycle and endo fidic and and Endo

978
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,720
uh endic bacteria fungi and plants

979
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,679
plants have Micro risal fungi attached

980
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:23,759
to their Roots mostly at the tip of the

981
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:27,279
of the roots you have the risasi cycle

982
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,720
which is where the the root transforms

983
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,839
the nutrient and the and the the trace

984
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:35,799
minerals and brings it into the plant

985
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:37,558
now often in soils there's pathogens all

986
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,920
around the soil Paul stamans always

987
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:44,440
talks about how can a one- celled or a

988
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:46,920
single walled organism live in soil with

989
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,800
trillions of pathogens potentially

990
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,159
killing it it's because of its

991
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,680
microbiome it's because of its biome and

992
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:57,039
its capability at the tip of the root

993
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:58,960
and the risasi cycle to pull through

994
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:02,920
through things that are only beneficial

995
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,240
to the plant it's it's a cycle that that

996
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,800
the body does with the microbiome when

997
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:10,679
our biome is healthy we we uptake what's

998
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,720
what's healthy for us just like the

999
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:15,598
plants in the plant root Zone it's going

1000
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:18,399
to suck up what he's tested is all the

1001
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,880
Endo fungi and bacteria that enters the

1002
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,639
plants through the soil are all

1003
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,000
beneficial none of them are pathogenic

1004
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:28,358
the plants not suck it could get

1005
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,880
attacked from the out side it could get

1006
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:33,960
attacked because obviously plants have

1007
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:36,480
issues but what its magic is and

1008
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,159
bringing in chloroplast and plant blood

1009
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,199
is is going to be a beneficial reaction

1010
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:43,879
and so we want to create medicine that

1011
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:47,239
enhances that process because that

1012
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,680
process is what makes us hum beings and

1013
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:51,838
from the earth it's it's what gives us

1014
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:54,919
our ultimate protection everything else

1015
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:57,000
is actually throwing it off you know the

1016
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,800
the chemicals in the water the different

1017
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,159
chemicals the toxic everything it's

1018
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,800
throwing off our magic our magic is so

1019
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,759
powerful that there's medicine and foods

1020
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,240
and water and everything trying to take

1021
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:13,000
it down but when you take it away and

1022
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:16,318
you become strong it's unbelievable what

1023
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,679
happens it's all in the tension trust me

1024
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:21,440
it's all in the tension you can't have

1025
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:24,358
one without the other you just can't

1026
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,280
it's where we come from and it's where

1027
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:28,920
we go and I'm sure it's why we get

1028
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,119
trapped in in that sort of same sort of

1029
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,440
we just have and it's just our human

1030
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,599
nature I think the whole part of being

1031
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,039
here is to divide and to become more

1032
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:39,400
like no I don't want to be a part of

1033
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:40,920
that I want to be a part of this you

1034
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,400
know when you come from everything and

1035
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,318
go to everything kind of fractioning out

1036
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,480
and being like an your own sort of

1037
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:51,119
individual self and finding your tribe

1038
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,599
is um is kind of what it's all about

1039
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,079
while you're here but I promise you

1040
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,710
whatever your tribe is you're going back

1041
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,280
to everything that's just the way it

1042
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:04,920
[Music]

1043
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:06,280
is and it's hard to fit all of that you

1044
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,880
know into a

1045
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,640
body so just just that alone is just so

1046
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,880
complex thanks for

1047
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,960
cannabis I I'm thankful every day

1048
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,640
because of that it's hard to be in a

1049
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,960
body without cannabis hey dragonly guys

1050
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:26,480
have you have you played around with

1051
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,480
Koji at all

1052
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:35,119
absolutely and working with Ki yeah yeah

1053
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,240
absolutely have have you tried catching

1054
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:41,440
uh coji like catching an asp Gillis

1055
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:43,519
strain no we haven't caught anything you

1056
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,480
know and defined it or or or how you

1057
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:48,318
know capture the DNA of it as coji we've

1058
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,199
ordered coji and done all different

1059
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:52,800
kinds of grow out of it and different

1060
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:56,598
types of bean strains and even adding

1061
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:59,280
greens and adding kooo and yeah going

1062
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:02,599
down the rabbit holes of seaweed and its

1063
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,240
interaction with it and the ph and

1064
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:07,280
seaweed and you know taking away the the

1065
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:10,399
gases and why do you

1066
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,519
ask I just finished COI Alchemy and I've

1067
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,800
been talking a lot with a guy on

1068
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,800
Instagram um TM gastronaut super great

1069
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,200
people and so I started playing around

1070
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,920
with like miso marinating my steaks

1071
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,000
which is cool but the Miso it's not

1072
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:27,680
active so I ordered the aspergillis

1073
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:30,159
starter um my goal is to make it easier

1074
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:31,598
to incorporate uh specifically liver is

1075
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:33,879
what I'm after and liver doesn't taste

1076
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,920
beef liver is not the most it's not the

1077
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,760
best tasting thing in in my opinion so

1078
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,240
getting it to a usable State without

1079
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,000
just using a massive amount of like

1080
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:44,679
bacon fat basically and I was talking to

1081
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,239
him about it and I said how does it do

1082
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,919
with liver pate and he said it's

1083
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,798
excellent because it imparts that sweet

1084
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,358
nutty flavor and because it's blended it

1085
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:53,679
becomes like an amino paste so you're

1086
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:55,159
getting you're you're basically making

1087
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,838
like a miso but you know you have a

1088
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:58,798
different name out of a liver paste and

1089
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:02,279
for the rest of you guys if you don't

1090
00:48:58,798 --> 00:49:04,400
know about Koji it's a mold type fungus

1091
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,000
and it's like a microfilamentous fungus

1092
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,760
and it sends its filaments down into

1093
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,519
whatever it's on and puts out exudates

1094
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,119
that convert the proteins carbohydrates

1095
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:15,318
into sugars which then the plant you

1096
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,599
know in a symbiotic relationship that's

1097
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:17,960
that's that function they were talking

1098
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:19,519
about earlier where the the mushroom

1099
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,318
makes this and the plant sucks it up and

1100
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:22,519
it gives up little parts to the mushroom

1101
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:25,480
and they got this little relationship

1102
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:29,480
going on provide for each other um this

1103
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,480
one kind of fun is like a composer

1104
00:49:29,798 --> 00:49:34,759
so steaks or chunks of meat like that um

1105
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:36,199
or you can blend it up and so when you

1106
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,640
when you blend it up it's much easier

1107
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:38,719
for the microfilament this to get down

1108
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:41,679
because youve got all mixed in the

1109
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:43,679
solution so it can turn this beefy

1110
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,639
tasting liver paste which sounds

1111
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,639
terrible and tastes kind of terrible

1112
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:50,279
into something mag tenderize the meat at

1113
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:51,679
all does it tenderize it yeah absolutely

1114
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,079
so when you do it on a

1115
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:55,679
steak absolutely and then when if if you

1116
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,920
do like a reverse this what I did with

1117
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:01,919
the miso paste is marinated it for like

1118
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,838
24 hours in a miso soy white wine mix

1119
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,119
and then did a reverse sear so brought

1120
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:09,400
the steak up to like 110 and then seared

1121
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,559
it on a really hot iron skillet like a

1122
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,400
cast iron skillet and the the malard

1123
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:15,000
reaction with the Miso Pace was

1124
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,920
excellent so you know like the chart out

1125
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,480
the black and blue it was it was primo

1126
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,519
and you know to like they mentioned

1127
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,960
earlier these are from my uh like

1128
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:24,880
holistically managed cattle that we we

1129
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,318
raised just up up the street on some

1130
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,760
pasture that we lease and that system is

1131
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:30,480
working out great they've never been fed

1132
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,599
anything they drink water off off the

1133
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,079
property they just the better we do the

1134
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,240
better the Grass Grows and now we have

1135
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:40,119
multiple years of of soil test data to

1136
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:41,719
prove that we are sequestering a

1137
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,798
significant amount of carbon through

1138
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:46,318
these animals and we we also own a bunch

1139
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:49,119
of land up on the hill and practice

1140
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:51,960
broadscale permaculture in various

1141
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,039
systems I've the only animal that's ever

1142
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,000
died at the Cow pastures other than

1143
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:58,558
maybe a snake got stepped on Once by a

1144
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,280
cow are the cows themselves everything

1145
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,040
out the the elk love it there the deer

1146
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,200
love it there we have beavers creating

1147
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:05,440
dams I got snakes I got Birds I got

1148
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:06,798
everything I love all of it nothing

1149
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,318
there has ever died I've never killed a

1150
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:12,639
single slug on a permaculture Farm

1151
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:13,960
trying to grow greens is and to be fair

1152
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:15,558
we're in the forest in the middle of the

1153
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,960
forest trying to grow some annual crops

1154
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:20,640
and it is just slug genocide up there

1155
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,000
it's it's it's a constant battle with

1156
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,480
these things who's going to get more of

1157
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,679
it so you know I when I when I look at

1158
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,920
cattle farming or or you know and and

1159
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:30,719
One Step better is this permaculture

1160
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,480
system that we're developing is with the

1161
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:36,118
intent that it provides such a a

1162
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:38,039
bountiful production for the native uh

1163
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,119
Wildlife that I could just not have to

1164
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:41,920
do cows anymore and the elk I I'd much

1165
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:43,039
rather just get a couple elk and eat

1166
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,440
that throughout the year I don't have to

1167
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,279
manage them the rest of the time so if I

1168
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,440
can provide a system that makes an

1169
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,119
abundance of elk that's a much better

1170
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:54,039
situation so that that's our long-term

1171
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:56,280
goal but to convert you know a a a patch

1172
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:59,719
of forest into a food forest in the

1173
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,720
midle of the a basically food desert an

1174
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:03,239
industrial Forest like the whole thing's

1175
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:04,798
monocrop for Timber production like

1176
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:06,679
they're talking that's all of Southwest

1177
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:08,318
Washington like 98% of the land down

1178
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:10,558
here is owned by Timber companies so

1179
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,480
we're just I'm just I plot myself in the

1180
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,880
middle so that when hemp destroys the

1181
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,480
timber industry I'll be primally set up

1182
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,920
to expand my permaculture throughout all

1183
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,880
this uh what will become a liability

1184
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,599
like what do you do with a bunch of

1185
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,160
trees when all the you know what's

1186
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:27,920
really interesting right now I can buy

1187
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:30,759
hemp plywood for about half the price of

1188
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:34,280
like Timber based plywood it's it's kind

1189
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:37,000
of fun wow do you get that online or at

1190
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,760
a local building store yeah it's online

1191
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,920
let me let me dig it up someone sent it

1192
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,559
to just the other day I'll pull it up

1193
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:48,000
and see plywood's like tripled and

1194
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:48,000
quadrupled out of control out of

1195
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:52,719
control we're working with the hemp that

1196
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,760
we brought last time we were on here and

1197
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:58,759
we weighed out 12 seeds and you know to

1198
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:02,280
a gram and and it's those kinds of hemps

1199
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:04,720
that so huge that we feel can make a

1200
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:07,200
difference in the timber industry so

1201
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:09,480
we're you know we're working with uh

1202
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,558
implanta and Daryl Hudson out of the

1203
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,159
University of Saskatchewan and and

1204
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:16,680
helping develop you know those food and

1205
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:18,639
fiber strains that that will make a

1206
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:20,919
difference and it can replace the pellet

1207
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:23,039
farms and all of the the toilet paper

1208
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:26,119
all those things so much everyone knows

1209
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:29,558
it and it can offer and it can offer

1210
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:32,680
like no problems to the entire cannabis

1211
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:35,839
industry because he's not ever seen them

1212
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:37,679
flour like they've never flowered out

1213
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,679
before they just keep growing and

1214
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,399
growing and growing and growing so they

1215
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:45,318
create beautiful cellulose beautiful

1216
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:48,440
silicus and you know minimal FL great

1217
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:48,440
fiber and no

1218
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:02,519
flour look at this 3/4 inch thick board

1219
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:04,880
UH 60 bucks that's you know how much

1220
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:06,679
that that's like at least 75 80 at the

1221
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,280
at the store right now maybe even more

1222
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:11,879
even the half inch what glue are they

1223
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,880
using you

1224
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:19,200
know

1225
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:22,799
is8 P Gorilla

1226
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:25,598
Glue yeah I'm not sure so you

1227
00:54:22,798 --> 00:54:27,838
know I think they're using six-star uh

1228
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,519
bubble has actually as their glue it's

1229
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:33,078
like a 6 to1 Ratio or something I would

1230
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:35,480
never been you know a thing that that

1231
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:37,240
was biodegradable so I you know I

1232
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:41,358
wouldn't necessarily expect that of hemp

1233
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:41,358
board but it's still like

1234
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:47,480
wow it can't possibly be as toxic and as

1235
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,639
much of a bumer as the other stuff sure

1236
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:53,119
do these things can these things be so

1237
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:56,558
boarding and decking is one

1238
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:59,280
thing and if it could be used as class

1239
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:03,880
in it's different but can it actually be

1240
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:06,040
used as the under Carriage Lumber

1241
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,760
underneath a deck I mean yeah okay

1242
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:11,759
decking yes but I don't think it could

1243
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:15,680
actually be used for like in place of

1244
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:17,880
like 2 by10 and it's not treated it's

1245
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:20,078
not treated Mark right it's not treated

1246
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,720
so it's not what I just showed you is

1247
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,400
Plywood And yes it's structural you

1248
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:24,879
could use it as sheeting on a building

1249
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,960
and that's what you know plywood or you

1250
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,358
could use it as subfloor above those

1251
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,760
joists that you're talking about if I

1252
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:32,679
was going to yes you could 100% make

1253
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,440
structural pieces out of it it would be

1254
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:35,798
in an ibeam configuration so I'm

1255
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,318
building a house right now and the

1256
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:39,838
traditional Lumber the long stretches

1257
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:42,038
are plywood going this way plywood going

1258
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:44,199
this way in an ibeam shape and it's it's

1259
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:47,000
just as strong and significantly lighter

1260
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:48,919
than the alternative current wood beam

1261
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,719
if I had old growth it would that's a

1262
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,639
whole different story much tighter grain

1263
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,038
y yada but when we're talking about like

1264
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:56,318
the future of building and we're going

1265
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:58,240
to use hemp it's going to be composite

1266
00:55:56,318 --> 00:55:59,960
pieces like this um and you get a lot of

1267
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:01,838
structure just by changing it and the

1268
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,838
real Beauty where where this stuff isn't

1269
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:05,838
quite at yet but will be and when they

1270
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:08,480
said they got huge hemp plants what we

1271
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:11,199
really want is 20 foot tall field grown

1272
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,679
like corn basically because those long

1273
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:14,439
fibers are where the strengths at

1274
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:16,879
because if I take a bunch of very long

1275
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,960
fibers press and glue them together I

1276
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,240
get exponentially more strength than a

1277
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,880
bunch of particle board pie yeah they

1278
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:25,038
they can start they can start even

1279
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,880
putting shorter fiber into oriented

1280
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:30,280
strand boards so or Ed strand board is

1281
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,559
all the wood chips off the bottom of the

1282
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,720
of the Sawmill and what they do is they

1283
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:38,200
yeah press those together into a

1284
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:40,838
laminate and glue it and so the glue

1285
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:42,798
turns out to be the magic I mean yeah

1286
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:45,558
there's lots of cheap sources of

1287
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:48,440
cellulose and how to orient those fibers

1288
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:51,119
to get the real strength the modular

1289
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:53,280
strength of the fibers themselves is

1290
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:56,838
definitely a trick but I think this

1291
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,720
could certainly be used the question I

1292
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:03,318
have I mean even for outdoor cladding

1293
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:06,318
though Dustin um it would have to be um

1294
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:09,038
again the the biggest thing Outdoors is

1295
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:11,318
ultraviolet light so ultraviolet light

1296
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:14,200
will degrade ligant so if you just put a

1297
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:17,079
piece of untreated wood out in the

1298
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:18,439
weather after about a year it turns gray

1299
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:20,519
after about two or three years it'll

1300
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:23,720
fall apart because all you have a

1301
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:26,280
cellulose you've completely degraded all

1302
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:28,798
of the ligant so the real question is is

1303
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,680
how stable is the Matrix that holds all

1304
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:33,358
that together and that will be where

1305
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:35,199
some Innovation needs to happen sure and

1306
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:36,960
and the same issue with Plywood And then

1307
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:38,000
if if that's going to be an issue if I

1308
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,960
got wood that's going to be outside then

1309
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,960
I treat it right with some usually

1310
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,798
pretty toxic chemical nasty chemicals

1311
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,798
yeah right yeah but in in nature I just

1312
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:48,519
do a better job of of material selection

1313
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:51,440
like my Cedar that's going to be exposed

1314
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:53,159
outside is fine because it can go wood

1315
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,000
that's naturally resistant to

1316
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:57,118
degradation that's right uh and then and

1317
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,639
if I needa go evenur I'll Char the end

1318
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,200
of it before I stick it into the ground

1319
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:02,000
and now it's going to last at least two

1320
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:04,798
lifetimes like we're

1321
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,440
good a product called Life Time sorry

1322
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:10,038
Justin if you wanted to finish up

1323
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:13,159
something um as far as the the uh the

1324
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:15,680
siding or cladding as as Mark said you

1325
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:17,639
can use a product called lifetime it's

1326
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,279
made up here in the cies but it's they

1327
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:21,920
send it all over the world the guys the

1328
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,599
European family in a European like it's

1329
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,838
coveted recipe or something but it's

1330
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:30,599
powder and you put it in five gallons of

1331
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:33,199
water and really it smells like rust

1332
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:35,760
water it's it's like it's like I I

1333
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:37,358
forget dioxide what what the main uh

1334
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,760
component is in it but they don't tell

1335
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:41,519
you what's in it but what you do is you

1336
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,280
put it in a a five gallon bucket or or

1337
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:47,880
bigger and you use a paint sprayer and

1338
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:52,640
spray it on natural wood and it's like a

1339
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:54,680
they say an herbal fungal mineral mix

1340
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:57,838
and it kind of darkens the wood a little

1341
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:59,558
bit turns it a bit green um but it's a

1342
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:01,480
totally natural finish that you can

1343
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:03,559
spray on super easy almost just like

1344
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,119
water out of a paint sprayer and we just

1345
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:07,680
used it on our last timber frame

1346
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:11,519
structure and I like it and then we used

1347
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:16,279
we did the the show what is it Shu Shi H

1348
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:18,759
Shi ban the the Charing yeah the Charing

1349
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:21,798
so we did that for Boron baton so we did

1350
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:23,680
like one by8 and then did a baton that

1351
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:26,599
was charred so it's kind of this

1352
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:29,358
interesting look of like black and

1353
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:31,440
yeah but it's natural and in that part

1354
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:34,279
yeah also there's great milk based

1355
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,838
paints out there just you guys have a

1356
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,880
mill a

1357
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:41,519
saw we have three neighbors that have

1358
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,838
Sawmills so we don't have one at the

1359
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:47,199
moment but I like the idea of getting an

1360
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:49,159
Alaskan chain Mill only for the rawness

1361
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:51,399
part of it I I don't see it as a great

1362
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:54,199
Building Material tool but it's also

1363
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:56,880
like we make mountain biking jumps and

1364
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:58,719
green houses and all kinds of sort of

1365
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,160
landscaping style building and that

1366
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:05,038
works really good for us um but we have

1367
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:07,358
really amazing Mills near us so we do uh

1368
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:09,039
salvage wood out of clearcuts and on the

1369
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:11,199
sides of roads and Def and definitely

1370
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:13,440
and out of our Lake for sure M up yeah

1371
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:17,239
the lake is a big source for us for we

1372
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:19,720
full trees and things I imagine you have

1373
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:22,399
like do do you use wood burning heat in

1374
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:24,358
the winter on on site yeah so you have

1375
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,280
some managed Timber production and in

1376
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:29,038
that sense you're probably coping po

1377
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:31,680
whatever your your source is

1378
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,520
right and we just gather it because we

1379
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:35,199
live literally on the side of the

1380
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:37,358
largest Wilderness Area in southern

1381
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,519
British Columbia so raw materials are

1382
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:43,078
not a thing for us it's not get it from

1383
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:45,559
your zone four situation you just you

1384
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:48,480
can get it really easily we just get

1385
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:51,519
dead dead dead Timbers that are already

1386
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,798
down we make sure to leave it and yeah

1387
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:57,440
we're really conscious about our yeah

1388
01:00:54,798 --> 01:01:01,519
how much wood we burn we have Spruce

1389
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:04,440
Hemlock fur Cedar Pine and do you guys

1390
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:06,639
have any uh rocket mess uh setups any

1391
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,079
Rock stove or heater or anything not

1392
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:11,480
right now but I have two green houses my

1393
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:13,760
Wally py and the round one which we call

1394
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:16,440
the mother ship is something I really

1395
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:20,200
want to build a rocket mass more of an

1396
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:22,440
earth fired stove which will have water

1397
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:26,199
going through the beds and then I also

1398
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:29,358
put a 300gal septic tank in the center

1399
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:31,118
of the greenhouse in the ground so once

1400
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:33,318
the water starts flowing through it can

1401
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,200
go into a holding tank in the center of

1402
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:38,880
the greenhouse and there's also air

1403
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:41,960
tubes four 4 inch air tubes going a

1404
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:44,960
th000 feet in the ground six feet under

1405
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:47,519
and then coming up in the center so I I

1406
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:51,000
like the idea of doing somewhat

1407
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:55,719
passive somewhat passive geothermal yeah

1408
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,719
big thermal B battery pretty much

1409
01:01:57,318 --> 01:02:00,880
the air tubes are you catching all the

1410
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,278
the hot air from the peak of it and then

1411
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,640
sucking it down into the

1412
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:09,159
ground the peak of it um I have just

1413
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:13,598
sandwiched two layers of plastic in

1414
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:16,960
between a full 2x4 full two dimensions

1415
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:19,640
and I'm gonna put four air tubes going

1416
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:22,358
down like North Southeast and West and

1417
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:25,038
gather the hot air from the top and then

1418
01:02:22,358 --> 01:02:26,480
put it into the roof at the bottom

1419
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:28,680
because the snow

1420
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:32,318
accumulates near the

1421
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:34,519
base I get any heat from any of the sun

1422
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:36,639
I'll be able to gather it at the hot it

1423
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:38,880
and then sort of force it through like

1424
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:40,078
like for air to make a little bit more

1425
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,079
of the

1426
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,079
bubble

1427
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,679
sweet and we're on Homestead time and we

1428
01:02:47,278 --> 01:02:52,798
don't hire out work so everything is

1429
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:55,278
magical and has its Divine timing and

1430
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:57,719
this lockdown has been very good for us

1431
01:02:55,278 --> 01:03:00,798
working on our farm and we always laugh

1432
01:02:57,719 --> 01:03:03,118
about how really and truly like being

1433
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:05,559
somebody that can't focus or being two

1434
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,480
people that can't focus on one thing for

1435
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:10,519
very long whatever you want to call it

1436
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,920
ad whatever whatever it works good for

1437
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:16,679
us it works great for farming just in

1438
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:22,318
case so what can aboid is that

1439
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:22,318
again exactly exactly I like J

1440
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:28,719
pinolene that's a turpine not a canabo I

1441
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:30,159
know that's why I said that I like it

1442
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:32,439
too um

1443
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:34,358
and what's best friend what have you

1444
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:36,200
been planting on your farm in the last

1445
01:03:34,358 --> 01:03:38,358
week or what let can you tell us what

1446
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:41,358
you've done in the last say the LA oh

1447
01:03:38,358 --> 01:03:43,920
and Dustin I do you use ducks for your

1448
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:46,480
slugs because ducks and cows get along

1449
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,240
really good ducks are really easy on the

1450
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,480
garden they can go all over they love

1451
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:52,479
and if you let and if you let the cows

1452
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,318
raise the baby ducks then they'll

1453
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,240
protect them from any Predators um in

1454
01:03:55,318 --> 01:03:59,480
wherever

1455
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:02,318
you're crazing no we've had lots of

1456
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:05,119
ducks we have no ducks now I only ate

1457
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:07,079
maybe one of them and the rest got we're

1458
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,119
we feed the wildlife it's very difficult

1459
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:11,160
where we are like I said I'm like Mecca

1460
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,599
in the middle of the desert it like

1461
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:13,960
there's nothing to eat anywhere until

1462
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,039
you show up at my spot and then there's

1463
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,159
everything to eat doesn't matter who we

1464
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:20,599
are big small eat plants eat animals

1465
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:23,239
here you go got a dog doesn't do [ __ ]

1466
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:26,119
like we keep our C we lease a bunch of

1467
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:28,199
land down in like uh the flats of of a

1468
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:29,480
slew um about 10 minutes from here and

1469
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:31,919
that's where we raise our cattle so

1470
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,000
they're not yet integrated up and I

1471
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,000
don't think I'm going to integrate

1472
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,798
cattle up into the hill farm it's just

1473
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,358
not I just don't have enough I might

1474
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:40,318
bring some of my small Dexter but I

1475
01:04:38,358 --> 01:04:43,278
think we'll probably do sheep like the

1476
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:45,759
like the haired shedding sheep um and

1477
01:04:43,278 --> 01:04:48,199
then we're in the process of fencing it

1478
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,119
you know with fencing to try and get

1479
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:52,798
established with these trees because I

1480
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,400
when you're at when you've got multiple

1481
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:55,719
thousand trees in the ground it's a lot

1482
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,200
cheaper just to fence the whole thing

1483
01:04:55,719 --> 01:04:59,558
thing than to try to fence each one so

1484
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:02,358
that's where we're at with that right

1485
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:04,039
now we will move back into fully

1486
01:05:02,358 --> 01:05:06,318
integrated and We've ran a lot of

1487
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:08,640
chickens with the cows just to control

1488
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:11,318
flies was great

1489
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:13,118
but I've seen eagles eat my chickens

1490
01:05:11,318 --> 01:05:15,239
I've seen little like marmots eat my

1491
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:17,760
chickens I've seen cats eat my chickens

1492
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:19,519
it's endless uh same with the Ducks so

1493
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,319
everybody loves those

1494
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:23,719
chickens they're sitting ducks man but

1495
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,920
yes they did great for the Slugs it was

1496
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:26,919
an awesome solution we'll we'll get get

1497
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,240
back to it when we figure out how to

1498
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:33,400
keep them I just want to say that Tony

1499
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:34,598
neg Tony neg gave up a beautiful um he

1500
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,680
calls it

1501
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:39,960
cbhd so that's the new term it's

1502
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:44,278
cbhd and then what else I wanted to say

1503
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:47,400
one other thing that uh oh uh aru aru

1504
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:49,039
GIF said uh please say hello to me it

1505
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,599
would make my day well if that's the not

1506
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,240
the easiest way to make someone's day

1507
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:57,278
let's all say hi to aru GIF in the chat

1508
01:05:53,239 --> 01:06:00,598
room hey hi AR

1509
01:05:57,278 --> 01:06:02,920
bless smoke them if you got them smoke

1510
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:07,519
them if you want it got them exactly s

1511
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:11,278
to interrupt there F I think from farmer

1512
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:11,278
yeah exactly that's hey

1513
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:18,920
Dustin Dustin uh have you considered

1514
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:21,480
using raised beds with rocks like right

1515
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:24,639
dead center and your cutout for those

1516
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:27,440
greens with like a rock Fringe even

1517
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:30,118
crushed rock or around the rock rais bed

1518
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,480
for like a just a really Central Rock

1519
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:34,760
rais bed which would pick it up off off

1520
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:38,240
the ground for those slugs and then like

1521
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:41,079
any Rock sand border probably shardy

1522
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:43,798
kind of rock situation might help a lot

1523
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:45,359
they lay off my my beds that are right

1524
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:48,079
in the middle of the yard for sure and

1525
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:49,719
hot and dry but even nearby other beds

1526
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:54,039
that aren't you know they're they're

1527
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:56,318
centered more into the middle of the

1528
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:58,920
site yeah absolutely abolutely so and

1529
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:00,960
and one this property that I bought is

1530
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,519
is just steep downhill so every

1531
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,119
everything that's flat we put there

1532
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:05,920
right with with Terraces we've got the

1533
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:10,240
whole thing integrated into you know

1534
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:11,680
Terrace Swale Pond system um and so yes

1535
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:13,558
some of the beds that are up close to

1536
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:16,239
like some of my access roads which are a

1537
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:18,278
lot of them are just rough rock roads um

1538
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:20,798
they they and they're all raised beds we

1539
01:07:18,278 --> 01:07:22,358
just use cedar that we we thin for the

1540
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:25,759
boundaries of these beds and they're all

1541
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:28,318
raised up the problem is that I'm I'm on

1542
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,200
the I'm like I said Mecca in the desert

1543
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:33,079
and that desert is on the edge of the

1544
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:36,480
rainforest it's like uh 110 in of rain a

1545
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:39,039
year so it is the the amount of slugs is

1546
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:42,358
next level um we've gotten pretty good

1547
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:44,680
at it the the little yeast traps are are

1548
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:47,519
just destroy them um and if we can get

1549
01:07:44,679 --> 01:07:49,000
back into Ducks but yes the ones another

1550
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:50,759
problem is that rocks are extremely

1551
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,719
expensive here because it's all clay

1552
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:54,039
it's I've dug 40 foot down into the

1553
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:55,639
ground building ponds and I've never

1554
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:58,000
once found a natural rock on the

1555
01:07:55,639 --> 01:08:01,480
property anywhere it's all CL and it's

1556
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,159
been this level of for you know so I got

1557
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,639
to bring them in and that's expensive

1558
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:07,759
but yes wherever it's a bad place for

1559
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:11,118
Slugs to be is usually a good place to

1560
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:14,200
grow your greens that's a good

1561
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:16,480
tactic sand might work actually some

1562
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:17,719
more sand like a sand Fringe around

1563
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:19,158
something which is cheaper than the

1564
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:20,319
Rocks some local sand I don't know if

1565
01:08:19,158 --> 01:08:23,719
you have much that we have a lot of

1566
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:26,920
sandam and I'm on granite Bedrock mostly

1567
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:29,279
I like really really enjoy my old

1568
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:32,520
pasture site which is the one spot on my

1569
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:35,640
land uh big thanks to cows it's like

1570
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:40,000
200y old pasture land and everything on

1571
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:43,159
that grows just amazing all on its own

1572
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,560
um really keeps regenerative and U you

1573
01:08:43,158 --> 01:08:48,920
can tell the difference with it so big

1574
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:51,080
thanks to cows and and cow poop just

1575
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:54,279
want to throw that out there I love the

1576
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:56,519
fungal Colony um I don't know how you

1577
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:59,040
say richness to it that I get even for

1578
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:03,279
the quality on the turps and taste into

1579
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:06,000
my uh heavily local cow poop you know

1580
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:08,920
pretty good percentage probably 20 30%

1581
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,869
my hempfield's probably half 50%

1582
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,679
neighbors cow poop

1583
01:09:10,869 --> 01:09:16,039
[Music]

1584
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:19,920
organ and go from there three seasons

1585
01:09:16,039 --> 01:09:23,278
now and it does great does your biomass

1586
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:26,000
ever hit ever hit for bacterial like

1587
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,839
have you ever tested your your biomass

1588
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,838
for like

1589
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:34,838
microbial uh

1590
01:09:29,838 --> 01:09:37,880
infection like do you ever see bacterial

1591
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:40,000
hits I super healthy field in terms of

1592
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:41,679
just what I see anyway visually and I

1593
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,198
have been running some tests this year

1594
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,679
into soil obviously tests on the

1595
01:09:44,198 --> 01:09:49,158
medicine and the plant matter itself um

1596
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:51,319
I haven't seen any Flags pop up or or

1597
01:09:49,158 --> 01:09:53,879
dug deep into having further testing

1598
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:56,039
into the biomass though the leftovers or

1599
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,760
other stuff goes right to the compo any

1600
01:09:56,039 --> 01:10:03,479
you know with that pretty quickly and

1601
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:06,199
and uh yeah super healthy mark on on the

1602
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:08,839
cow the reason why I asked is in

1603
01:10:06,198 --> 01:10:11,079
particular uh all the Amish around here

1604
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:14,039
use a lot of manure in their hemp

1605
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:18,600
farming yet their coas they're they're

1606
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:21,840
getting hit for um just total um it's

1607
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:24,320
not eoli it's just I don't know I think

1608
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:27,319
it's just total bacteria or something

1609
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:27,319
like this some

1610
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:33,158
toic exactly what Mike said totally

1611
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,120
aerobic and and what they come back to

1612
01:10:33,158 --> 01:10:38,119
me is they say well you know what does

1613
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:40,039
this mean and and so my interpretation

1614
01:10:38,119 --> 01:10:44,760
of that and Mike tell me if I'm correct

1615
01:10:40,039 --> 01:10:44,760
on this is that they're doing

1616
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:49,840
aill yeah but I I don't think they're

1617
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,920
streaking plates so I believe what

1618
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,960
they're doing is they do some sort of

1619
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:58,880
genetic analysis and that determines

1620
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:02,480
that was DNA of this bacteria on this

1621
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:06,039
biomass at one time but now the biomass

1622
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:09,879
is ground and dried and it's totally

1623
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:11,479
fine and totally okay to process but

1624
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:13,800
these guys are all like well wait a

1625
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:15,639
second it's got all this microbial and

1626
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,960
the numbers are like in the hundreds of

1627
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:21,079
thousands of colony forming units so

1628
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:25,560
they don't exactly know how to interpret

1629
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:28,158
that data so all right

1630
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:30,880
I would say I don't know I you know more

1631
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:32,960
but I my my field is pretty dry and when

1632
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:36,000
you kind of mention maybe like the the

1633
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,800
dry out for it for the bacteria die off

1634
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,880
perhaps and and if you're going to keep

1635
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:42,560
it I know that like wet and moist you're

1636
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:44,400
going to Harbor environment at least set

1637
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:48,080
it up for your fungal and your bacteria

1638
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:50,479
to thrive so my Fields pretty dusty dry

1639
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:52,800
part of why I did that is it's on top of

1640
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:55,519
Bedrock so you know it's whatever LOM I

1641
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,920
could scrape up after clearcut and and

1642
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:00,440
mix you know kind of 5050 with the cow

1643
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,319
poop but my cow poop was aged when I

1644
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:05,079
went in on that stuff it was at least

1645
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:07,880
one year even two some of it was two

1646
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:12,439
plus years old coming into now for you

1647
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:14,960
know at least so also broke down aged um

1648
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:19,119
saw Dustin on it lot of straw local

1649
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:21,359
straw and saw Dustin it's not cow poop

1650
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:24,599
anymore well you got you got to realize

1651
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:27,679
that the same bacteria that's in compost

1652
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:29,560
is Al going to be ubiquitous within your

1653
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:31,679
Fields it's going to be being blown

1654
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:34,159
around on the air currents and moved

1655
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,560
around by the wind and the rain so

1656
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:39,079
ultimately the the same lactobacillus

1657
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:41,600
that's coming out of the helping the

1658
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:44,399
helping the milk turn into cheese is

1659
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:47,679
also going to be ridiculously found on

1660
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:50,439
your plant material um in the field as

1661
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:52,800
well as during the drying process during

1662
01:12:50,439 --> 01:12:56,039
the drying process should inhibit the

1663
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:59,800
mold as long as it's done in a ideally a

1664
01:12:56,039 --> 01:13:01,519
cool and dry environment but generally

1665
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,679
speaking what's going to happen is those

1666
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,679
microbes are going to form spores those

1667
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:09,920
spores are then capable of being grown

1668
01:13:06,679 --> 01:13:12,800
when they're in a suitable environment

1669
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:15,039
so often times people aren't drying the

1670
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:17,560
plants fast enough or you're getting

1671
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:20,479
that microbial degradation that we were

1672
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:22,600
talking about earlier with hydroxyz

1673
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:24,198
happening either in the field you know

1674
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:26,679
the wine industry they call that Noble

1675
01:13:24,198 --> 01:13:29,279
Rot right they actually make sweet wines

1676
01:13:26,679 --> 01:13:31,960
because it increases the sugar

1677
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:34,960
content exactly there there's some

1678
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:37,399
hydroxyz that I'm sure is going on when

1679
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,560
we have early rains in the canvas

1680
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:42,198
industry that may be forming interesting

1681
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:44,120
canids that were only now being able to

1682
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:47,119
detect the high

1683
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:51,238
accuracy HC yeah hey Mike it's just

1684
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:55,158
hydroxy there's no is in there so

1685
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:57,519
hydroxy thank you Mark yeah well it's

1686
01:13:55,158 --> 01:13:59,319
think that you know as long as it's in

1687
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,679
that biomass form you're probably going

1688
01:13:59,319 --> 01:14:04,799
to have that mold than that chance of

1689
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:06,520
microbial growth and degradation so the

1690
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,719
sooner that people can either turn it

1691
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:12,440
into hash or turn it into

1692
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:16,000
extracts the less degradation of the

1693
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:19,399
canabo and tpin that you're going to

1694
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,399
have so but yeah it's you know

1695
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:23,920
ultimately it's something that the

1696
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:27,079
Washington state had the Zero Tolerance

1697
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:29,039
on all aerobic bacteria the first two

1698
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:31,960
years which was tough for a lot of the

1699
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:34,319
organic farmers because they wouldn't

1700
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:36,679
pass and they would then have to grow

1701
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:38,719
grow cannabis organically and then

1702
01:14:36,679 --> 01:14:40,399
process it through through some sort of

1703
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,719
extraction that filters out any that

1704
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:44,399
microbial

1705
01:14:41,719 --> 01:14:46,319
content um well yeah there's no

1706
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:49,359
microbial content they're just measuring

1707
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:52,238
DNA of microbes that lived on the plant

1708
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:54,238
material during the Harvest and that you

1709
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:57,638
know isn't you know if you're doing some

1710
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:59,479
kind of it depends on extraction there's

1711
01:14:57,639 --> 01:15:03,199
there's

1712
01:14:59,479 --> 01:15:05,439
no most most of the labs though in State

1713
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:07,599
Labs will will just do the plating

1714
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:10,039
there's I'd say the minority of the labs

1715
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:12,760
are actually doing the DNA sequencing

1716
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:14,639
DNA sequencing is probably more

1717
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:17,600
suitable um because then you can

1718
01:15:14,639 --> 01:15:20,359
actually identify you know rather than

1719
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:22,000
identif identify whether it's a good or

1720
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:24,198
bad you want to be able to identify it's

1721
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,719
a harmful bacteria or a bacteria that

1722
01:15:24,198 --> 01:15:29,399
produces those

1723
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:31,319
toxins exactly total aerobic you know

1724
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:34,039
it's going to negatively affect a lot of

1725
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:37,039
the terar because you're not that those

1726
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:39,000
microbes that create those turpine

1727
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:42,198
precursors in the root

1728
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,279
systems um are going to be essentially

1729
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:46,319
have to be scrubbed out of the industry

1730
01:15:44,279 --> 01:15:48,679
otherwise they'll you know naturally

1731
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:51,319
show up in these total aerobic plates

1732
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:52,880
now you know Washington to in the first

1733
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:54,399
two years of legalization took a

1734
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,119
conservative approach put at zero

1735
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:59,839
tolerance I believe Oregon didn't

1736
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:02,279
require microbial testing the first year

1737
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,480
or two and then did but they set it set

1738
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:06,759
it kind of a lower bar in a really

1739
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:09,959
really tight bar on

1740
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:11,800
pesticides um so what ended up happening

1741
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:13,840
with Washington is they didn't require a

1742
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,719
lot of testing and then slowly started

1743
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:19,560
requiring more and more

1744
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:21,359
testing um so it's required everywhere I

1745
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,239
mean ATN I know it's required in

1746
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:25,399
California right it's required

1747
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:27,519
everywhere now

1748
01:16:25,399 --> 01:16:29,920
is like just came on board or is about

1749
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,080
to maybe hasn't even on on P I can't

1750
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:35,960
think of a regulated market that doesn't

1751
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:38,359
require Colorado or it just happened

1752
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:41,000
yeah and and washing Washington didn't

1753
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:43,559
require it it's just they say that they

1754
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,079
they will test test random samples and

1755
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:47,840
if you fail you'll get a recall or

1756
01:16:45,079 --> 01:16:50,719
something like that yeah well California

1757
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:53,960
is interesting because California has a

1758
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:55,439
remediation pathway so if stuff fails it

1759
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:59,600
can be re

1760
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:02,678
mediated and still be in the metric

1761
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:05,960
system the tag system or whatever so

1762
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:07,399
that's kind of a little weird but anyway

1763
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:09,520
well here here's here's the thing with

1764
01:17:07,399 --> 01:17:11,879
that and I hate to say that it's it's a

1765
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,920
good way to save the farmers's crop

1766
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,600
right it a lot because of what's what

1767
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,440
I've seen happen in some some parts some

1768
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,440
parts of the country that are close to

1769
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:23,000
Orchards or close to Vineyards you're

1770
01:17:20,439 --> 01:17:25,439
getting crop drip and you're failing for

1771
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,439
crop pesticides that you didn't spray

1772
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:32,678
for it other cases itated from the soil

1773
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:34,919
F future 4200 you know readership right

1774
01:17:32,679 --> 01:17:38,279
all those folks who were able to save

1775
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:40,119
all that distill it by doing a floros

1776
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:43,000
Sil chromatography or whatever it was

1777
01:17:40,119 --> 01:17:44,960
that they did to get rid of the Eagle 20

1778
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,479
right a sand

1779
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:50,319
scrub I'm sorry what is it yeah a s a

1780
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:53,319
scrub it was sand right silica it's just

1781
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:55,559
a sand so it was sand

1782
01:17:53,319 --> 01:18:00,840
scrub hey you could sell that that's

1783
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:03,840
like a catchy um uh tagline right for a

1784
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:06,000
a business right carbon chemistries

1785
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,639
right Dustin go to carbon right they

1786
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,279
want to sell stuff to the industry so

1787
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:11,760
I'm sure there's going to be patents

1788
01:18:10,279 --> 01:18:14,359
that could developed out of it but

1789
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:16,760
ultimately I do think that part of

1790
01:18:14,359 --> 01:18:19,920
what's called media bid filtration is

1791
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,280
used right I I used it prior to getting

1792
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:25,399
into the Cannabis industry when I was

1793
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:27,039
working in the bof industry and they you

1794
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:30,158
youall know in our industry Murphy

1795
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:36,359
Murray right you know Murphy who does

1796
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:38,198
her her CRC classes in mass and um you

1797
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:40,119
know I first met her on the Adam dun

1798
01:18:38,198 --> 01:18:42,198
show I always thought that was something

1799
01:18:40,119 --> 01:18:46,279
you know kind of interesting going on

1800
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:49,279
there but uh she you know it's very

1801
01:18:46,279 --> 01:18:52,479
interesting to use that as a sort of

1802
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:54,920
like a widespread Technique No matter

1803
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:57,599
whether your stuff's contaminated or not

1804
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:59,880
to just get a more pure fraction but I

1805
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,760
always thought that for the most part

1806
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:05,359
you want to get as full spectrum of an

1807
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:08,719
extract as you possibly can so

1808
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:13,639
fractionating it into these very nice

1809
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:17,399
looking product uh um yeah has its place

1810
01:19:13,639 --> 01:19:20,000
but not if I've been in her personal lab

1811
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:22,079
and she has taken that to Full Circle

1812
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,719
back around to the highest level so not

1813
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:25,319
only does she have like a six foot

1814
01:19:23,719 --> 01:19:27,000
chroma column that she uses a separation

1815
01:19:25,319 --> 01:19:28,960
column that again she fills with dirt

1816
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,800
right sand and dirt basically like you

1817
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:34,760
said uh and then she also has a very

1818
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,679
nice hydrocarbon falling film which

1819
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,239
allows her to selectively change the

1820
01:19:36,679 --> 01:19:42,000
temperature off what what um you know

1821
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:43,678
which fraction she takes recovering yeah

1822
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,399
she then takes all of the choice

1823
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:47,679
fractions and blends them back together

1824
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:49,960
right and and it allows her to separate

1825
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:52,158
out parts that you wouldn't want to

1826
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:54,319
probably smoke exactly not you know

1827
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:56,119
definitely not at scale so it's it's a

1828
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:59,399
very interesting what she's done she's

1829
01:19:56,119 --> 01:20:01,719
she's been isolating lately um Esters

1830
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:03,079
she found she's got one a Jar full of it

1831
01:20:01,719 --> 01:20:04,719
and it's crystallizing on its own and it

1832
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:06,000
smells like bananas it's the craziest

1833
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:07,520
thing that was the first thing she

1834
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,479
showed me when I was in there she also

1835
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:12,520
has lots of blue crystals growing blue

1836
01:20:09,479 --> 01:20:15,198
turpine crystals growing I Amal acetate

1837
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:18,000
isn't that the banana the banana eser

1838
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:19,839
I'm I'm not sure what it is I'm looking

1839
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,119
online I'm just remembering off top of

1840
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:25,039
my head Isa a el acate somebody check me

1841
01:20:22,119 --> 01:20:27,479
on that getting these things tested is a

1842
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:28,880
bit tricky and or very expensive right

1843
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:29,759
like your normal cannabis lab's not

1844
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,639
going to be able to tell you what your

1845
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,480
Esther is they might be able to get you

1846
01:20:31,639 --> 01:20:36,679
on the right path but back to Marcus's

1847
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:38,879
terminology that all these things are

1848
01:20:36,679 --> 01:20:41,760
kind of like all like sometimes you have

1849
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:43,440
to remediate [ __ ] because you got

1850
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,280
pesticides in it and you can't make a

1851
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:48,319
cable product until you remediate other

1852
01:20:46,279 --> 01:20:50,639
times you you're looking to not

1853
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:53,359
remediate but you're looking to what you

1854
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:55,440
were saying Dustin fractionate and

1855
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:57,880
whether you fractionate by

1856
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:59,919
again that sounds badass to have a

1857
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:02,600
falling film evaporator where you could

1858
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:05,279
separate different fractions that's so

1859
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:07,039
cool I mean uh she's in a very good

1860
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:10,359
position I know the guys that she works

1861
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:13,880
with to enable her to be able to do that

1862
01:21:10,359 --> 01:21:15,960
kind of uh work in and R&amp;D it's and look

1863
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,800
when we make when we make water hash

1864
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:19,920
we're fractionating in a sense as well

1865
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,159
we're excluding things by particulate

1866
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,480
size and we want some things to go

1867
01:21:21,158 --> 01:21:23,879
through the bag and some things to stay

1868
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:25,519
on the other side of the bag right it's

1869
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,039
just we're just taking that further down

1870
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,520
the line so it's like where do you draw

1871
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:29,920
the line and then when when we smoke

1872
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:31,320
based on the temperature that's how much

1873
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,920
of of whatever is in there is getting

1874
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:35,319
into our lungs right we're kind of

1875
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:37,199
fractionating it right there too based

1876
01:21:35,319 --> 01:21:39,880
on the the vapor pressure or the you

1877
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:41,399
know the vaporization point of it so a

1878
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:44,520
lot of our interaction other than just

1879
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:46,879
like straight up eating the flow is uh

1880
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:49,120
some form of us selectively getting down

1881
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,840
the line past the flow to the active

1882
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:53,960
ingredients a little bit of

1883
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:55,679
isomerization but a lot of decarbox and

1884
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:58,840
that's it

1885
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:01,960
no ring closing acid chemistry

1886
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:03,560
[ __ ] I recommend eating the a piece

1887
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:07,560
of the bud that you're

1888
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:10,920
smoking because it does release a whole

1889
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:15,400
like the the magic turpine in your

1890
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:17,960
mouth yes and then you know by smoking

1891
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:20,279
it sensation

1892
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,920
of I I would definitely be down to like

1893
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:23,759
soak a bunch of buds in butter and then

1894
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,880
bake them for a little while and then

1895
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:28,679
eat that that's that sounds delet also

1896
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:31,319
just putting a bud in a fresh Bud into

1897
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:33,119
hot water like a tea I mean you know

1898
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:35,960
everyone's heard about it yeah yeah yeah

1899
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:38,399
but like do it it's insane like the the

1900
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:40,079
Turpin in the water are just like wow

1901
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:42,359
everyone's heard of it here in Canada

1902
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:45,158
especially because that was one of Kirk

1903
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:47,439
Tad's main arguments when he explained

1904
01:22:45,158 --> 01:22:50,759
to the judge as it sits right now this

1905
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:53,399
cannabis is legal and then if like your

1906
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:56,320
grandmother like took it and put it in a

1907
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:59,599
teabag and put it into hot water now she

1908
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:01,439
could Face 14 years in prison and the

1909
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:03,079
judge was kind of like that was it for

1910
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:05,000
him he was just like yeah we have to

1911
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:06,279
allow extracts like there's there's just

1912
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,600
no there's not going to be any way

1913
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:11,399
around it and just like that just in BC

1914
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:14,159
at first across Canada we went from

1915
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:16,519
having um you know no ability to do

1916
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:18,399
extracts to kind of overnight suddenly

1917
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:20,639
you know extracts were allowed and then

1918
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:23,359
and then they also redefined the word

1919
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:25,119
marijuana which was like marijuana meant

1920
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:27,079
just the plant

1921
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:28,960
you know the flowers or whatnot then the

1922
01:23:27,079 --> 01:23:31,600
judge was like no marijuana this is how

1923
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:34,119
we got extracts to be allowed he said

1924
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,880
marijuana is every component of the

1925
01:23:34,119 --> 01:23:37,279
plant so if you have a license and you

1926
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:40,079
can have like a pound then you're

1927
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:42,399
allowed to have a pound of any part of

1928
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:45,600
the plant and so that was the game

1929
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:47,759
changer here in Canada so yeah shut up

1930
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,880
to we had always heard about you know

1931
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,880
being put in your tea mom's tea etc etc

1932
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,440
and so we always used to kind of laugh

1933
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,840
at the idea because it was never the

1934
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:58,359
thought of I'm going to take a fresh bud

1935
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:00,159
and put it in this tea and you know let

1936
01:23:58,359 --> 01:24:03,279
its Tarpin dissolve we didn't even know

1937
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:05,119
what Tarpin were in the sense of what we

1938
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:07,479
were actually ingesting and then to

1939
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:10,880
think of then just putting a flower in

1940
01:24:07,479 --> 01:24:12,479
boiling water just seemed ant antithesis

1941
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,800
of anything that we were trying to do to

1942
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:16,678
quote unquote get as high but of course

1943
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,719
leave it to you know older generations

1944
01:24:16,679 --> 01:24:20,520
to know there was something there and

1945
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:23,158
that science has caught up to us

1946
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:25,760
understanding about the tpes and all

1947
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:29,238
that that actually does come out in the

1948
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:32,840
water so you don't necessarily get the

1949
01:24:29,238 --> 01:24:36,079
tpin are certainly soluble but the

1950
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:38,760
cannabinoids are in their acid forms are

1951
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:42,118
not particularly water soluble at all

1952
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:44,320
even in hot water correct yet Jamaican

1953
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:47,439
grandmothers you know have been doing

1954
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:49,079
this from like for a very long time like

1955
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:52,118
even while they're kind of like harshing

1956
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:55,639
on the grandkids for smok and spliffs in

1957
01:24:52,118 --> 01:24:58,880
the back room when their backs are s or

1958
01:24:55,639 --> 01:25:01,199
previously to that to have like cramps

1959
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:03,359
from their periods or whatnot like there

1960
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:07,359
were mothers using this stuff it was

1961
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:11,000
like kind of the ancient medicine heard

1962
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:13,839
stor but what I I can't help but wonder

1963
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:18,800
is if they could have somehow tested the

1964
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:22,520
bud before the grandma made her tea and

1965
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:25,920
after she made her tea and dried it and

1966
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:27,719
seen what was the difference I'm curious

1967
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:30,118
well I mean if I'm getting the turps out

1968
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:31,719
of the trikes uh because the water's so

1969
01:25:30,118 --> 01:25:33,719
hot you know in theory I'm probably

1970
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:35,800
dissolving a lot of the trikes it's the

1971
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:38,000
canabo may not be soluble in the water

1972
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:39,679
but if I drink all of that water I'm

1973
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,960
gonna get all those canabo inside of me

1974
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:42,440
like they what do they float on the top

1975
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,639
so I don't you know they just floating

1976
01:25:42,439 --> 01:25:45,039
around there instead of mixed into the

1977
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:47,239
thing if I drink it all and get that top

1978
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:49,519
layer down down my gut I'm I'm getting

1979
01:25:47,238 --> 01:25:53,599
those canids inside of me for

1980
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:55,960
sure I'm not so sure about that have you

1981
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,639
actually test

1982
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:59,279
it could definitely stick to the to the

1983
01:25:57,639 --> 01:26:00,920
rim of the cup right but in you know if

1984
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:02,840
it was on the top if I boiled it and

1985
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:04,440
used a little and used a straw and

1986
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,119
sucked it up or just put my lips down on

1987
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:07,118
the top of the cup right sucked it out

1988
01:26:06,118 --> 01:26:09,839
of the

1989
01:26:07,118 --> 01:26:11,799
top my what's the what's the compelling

1990
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,360
nature I mean so if you're just if

1991
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:17,279
you're just putting cannabis into a tea

1992
01:26:14,359 --> 01:26:20,519
bag and you drop the tea bag in the hot

1993
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:24,519
water like Sam said the canabo aren't

1994
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:26,280
going to be soluble e well you know very

1995
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:28,600
it depends on how long you leave it in

1996
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:30,639
the hot water for it depends on how

1997
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:33,760
tenacious you are I guess in your

1998
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:35,639
boiling water yeah if you're above or

1999
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:38,320
below the melting point of the canabo

2000
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:41,039
they should melt the tpin are going to

2001
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:43,960
help co- solvate the Tron but it's going

2002
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:46,519
to form a bofilm on the surface right

2003
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:49,079
who's gonna drink boiling hot

2004
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,679
water you let it cool down the canabo

2005
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:52,399
are still going to be there right the

2006
01:26:50,679 --> 01:26:55,000
canabo aren't going back to the flower

2007
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:57,000
when it cools down

2008
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
just gonna leave sticky film all over

2009
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,399
the place right the point is they're not

2010
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,639
going to be on the butt anymore is my

2011
01:27:01,399 --> 01:27:08,158
argument yeah so utilizing an animal

2012
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:10,400
milk like is used in bang that that's a

2013
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:13,920
homog a now that's different it's got a

2014
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:17,638
do it in milk now you're winning yeah

2015
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:20,719
guys I I've been um prescribing tea to

2016
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:23,880
my patients for a really long time just

2017
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:26,880
pregnantly just just putting flowers in

2018
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:28,239
tea and you can ask all them it it

2019
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:31,679
definitely

2020
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:34,759
works and also definitely no we're not

2021
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:37,440
saying does it work I've heard it from

2022
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:38,480
many many people but it works what I'm

2023
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:41,479
saying

2024
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:44,198
is what percentage of the active

2025
01:27:41,479 --> 01:27:46,759
ingredient is being delivered to the

2026
01:27:44,198 --> 01:27:49,759
patient and what percent is left in the

2027
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:52,199
plant that was my only question a good

2028
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,600
question we have enough scientists here

2029
01:27:52,198 --> 01:27:56,839
that can actually just boil some can ab

2030
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:59,079
and figure out what's left I mean come

2031
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:01,639
on enough of y'all know how to work has

2032
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:05,118
chroma you need an emulsify you need

2033
01:28:01,639 --> 01:28:07,118
something to emulsify the fats into the

2034
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:09,920
water layer we've talked about this many

2035
01:28:07,118 --> 01:28:11,319
times and you know this is not anything

2036
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:15,158
that's

2037
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:19,319
easily done with just plant material and

2038
01:28:15,158 --> 01:28:21,319
water no you put plant bubble I goat

2039
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:23,158
butter oh they put the goat butter in

2040
01:28:21,319 --> 01:28:26,158
there trust me there's a fat in there

2041
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:27,879
too in prison they use uh they use uh

2042
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:30,479
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups because they

2043
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:31,760
have soy lethin in the peanut butter cup

2044
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:34,678
so they would actually chew up their

2045
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:36,560
last bud and then chew it with a peanut

2046
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:38,440
butter cup so it would break down

2047
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:41,400
because nobody wants to smoke their last

2048
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:43,638
Bud damn that's why I paid so much for

2049
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:46,839
those peanut butter cups in the who's

2050
01:28:43,639 --> 01:28:49,279
gal there you know but if I can hash

2051
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:51,440
from ice water then I should be able to

2052
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:53,479
make hash from hot water where I just

2053
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:54,759
agitated the [ __ ] out of it and used it

2054
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:57,479
to you know

2055
01:28:54,760 --> 01:29:00,560
if I pressure wash with hot water a bud

2056
01:28:57,479 --> 01:29:04,079
a plant and I'm I'm curious how much

2057
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:07,920
research have you done on this if for

2058
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:12,559
example I actually took water

2059
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:16,279
has and put it in a tall tall large

2060
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:20,119
glass container and poured boiling hot

2061
01:29:16,279 --> 01:29:22,559
water in it to see what would happen so

2062
01:29:20,118 --> 01:29:24,679
I mean I've been playing around doing

2063
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:28,560
this Rd

2064
01:29:24,679 --> 01:29:32,359
on canvas a long long time and uh I'm

2065
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:34,320
still curious what I did ask about you

2066
01:29:32,359 --> 01:29:37,439
you had lots of starting material to

2067
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:41,479
experiment with that that's for sure and

2068
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:44,158
it it was legal to do the work once that

2069
01:29:41,479 --> 01:29:46,039
once that Beaker cooled down you could

2070
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:47,399
drink it and that hash is getting inside

2071
01:29:46,039 --> 01:29:50,039
of you whether it's soluble in the water

2072
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:52,759
or not right unless it's no it's not

2073
01:29:50,039 --> 01:29:55,399
very Sol it's not very soluble in the

2074
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:59,679
water but in this this particular case

2075
01:29:55,399 --> 01:30:04,279
what did happen was the hot water would

2076
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:08,679
cause the uh the

2077
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:11,399
massive uh bubble hash to sink down to

2078
01:30:08,679 --> 01:30:16,000
the bottom of the container where it

2079
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:19,238
would get hot hotter and it would bubble

2080
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:22,960
back up like a lava lamp it would spread

2081
01:30:19,238 --> 01:30:25,399
on the top cool off and sink back down

2082
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:28,560
again so what it did is gave me a few

2083
01:30:25,399 --> 01:30:30,599
hours of mindless fun you know it's kind

2084
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,679
of more passive medicine a little bit

2085
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:35,440
more homeopathic you know you know

2086
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:37,480
person that's making ganja tea is

2087
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:39,039
probably a farmer you know I wouldn't

2088
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:42,000
say that someone's going to go to the

2089
01:30:39,039 --> 01:30:44,600
store in Canada and buy legal can

2090
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,560
Canadian cannabis wheat and go home and

2091
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:50,560
make ganja tea and heal their alses I

2092
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:52,400
think the idea is that you are living

2093
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:55,000
and breathing the medicine you're

2094
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:57,799
smoking it you're doing G to te you have

2095
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,960
oils everyone knows that oils and those

2096
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:01,320
kinds of things dissolve the Tricom so

2097
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:03,880
if you really want to dissolve the

2098
01:31:01,319 --> 01:31:06,118
Tricom you might have like the butter

2099
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:08,840
and the the things like that but if you

2100
01:31:06,118 --> 01:31:10,238
make tea you know you might if you

2101
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:12,119
really want the medicine you probably

2102
01:31:10,238 --> 01:31:14,638
eat the butt afterwards you don't use a

2103
01:31:12,118 --> 01:31:18,319
tea bag and then you eat the butt

2104
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:20,239
afterwards like when you make Garden Tea

2105
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:22,238
like we have products that are that are

2106
01:31:20,238 --> 01:31:26,079
you know we don't recommend people using

2107
01:31:22,238 --> 01:31:28,799
a a bag to brew their tea they the water

2108
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:30,840
should go in you along with all the worm

2109
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,639
castings and all the herbs should be in

2110
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:34,480
your body afterward yeah water

2111
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:36,239
extraction from a plant is not the same

2112
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:38,079
as water extraction from an extract

2113
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:40,158
because the plant has much more lipids

2114
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:42,359
present and if I'm heating those lipids

2115
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:44,000
off the plant surface up and then

2116
01:31:42,359 --> 01:31:48,319
there's canabo floating around I've got

2117
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:50,359
a little bit of a lipid emolion going on

2118
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:51,599
you know that's what winterization is

2119
01:31:50,359 --> 01:31:53,399
when we're processing it's all these

2120
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,199
extra lipids that we extracted that

2121
01:31:53,399 --> 01:31:57,319
we're trying to get rid of those lipids

2122
01:31:55,198 --> 01:31:59,359
are very cannabis soluble a lot of

2123
01:31:57,319 --> 01:32:01,679
people lose a lot of their canabo to

2124
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:03,960
that fat cake that they've got because

2125
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:06,158
they didn't wash them back out uh so you

2126
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:07,760
can and you can load those lipids up so

2127
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:11,399
and that's all coming from the plant so

2128
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:13,280
hot water plant extraction has some tiny

2129
01:32:11,399 --> 01:32:15,000
percentage of canabo that are becoming

2130
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:15,920
soluble just from the what's going on

2131
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
with the

2132
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:22,158
pl no I I agree with this because when

2133
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,600
I've uh interviewed people in

2134
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:29,719
traditional cannabis producing countries

2135
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:32,079
where men and especially women would uh

2136
01:32:29,719 --> 01:32:34,239
make tea as you're talking about and

2137
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:37,039
they would say you know that it gave

2138
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:40,079
them this benefit or that benefit or

2139
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:44,238
this benefit and uh I was just wondering

2140
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:48,679
if anybody actually knew how much of the

2141
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:52,039
THC and other cannabinoids or tpes I

2142
01:32:48,679 --> 01:32:54,719
imagine most of the tures are gone uh

2143
01:32:52,039 --> 01:32:58,760
still remain in the in the plant

2144
01:32:54,719 --> 01:33:02,639
material that's all yeah so like like

2145
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:05,639
like conventional tea or what camil CIS

2146
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:07,800
or whatever it is those are all water

2147
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:09,639
soluble um

2148
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:13,199
polyphenols that are actually the

2149
01:33:09,639 --> 01:33:15,600
polyphenol portion is the aglycone of a

2150
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:18,799
much larger molecule that looks kind of

2151
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:21,560
like the ananin so these are very large

2152
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:24,119
water soluble molecules that come out in

2153
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:26,800
the tea I mean and so that's you know

2154
01:33:24,118 --> 01:33:30,479
canabo aren't a glycones they're not

2155
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:31,320
they they're fat soluble yeah stuck in

2156
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:33,678
the

2157
01:33:31,319 --> 01:33:36,679
tro you're not going to easily

2158
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:38,359
solubilize it in hot water I always

2159
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:40,000
found it interesting though and Sam I

2160
01:33:38,359 --> 01:33:42,639
don't know if you've ever looked at this

2161
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:46,600
before it appears as though there's a

2162
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:49,639
good process that uses hot water to do

2163
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:52,560
extraction and and almost kind of like I

2164
01:33:49,639 --> 01:33:56,800
won't say it's like ice waterer hashing

2165
01:33:52,560 --> 01:34:00,520
but it's hash in a way using hot water

2166
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:02,840
or super pressurized steam or Dustin I

2167
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:06,719
don't know if you know about this little

2168
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:10,279
all I'm I'm not familiar with it and if

2169
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:13,480
you find a reference or and you Dustin's

2170
01:34:10,279 --> 01:34:17,639
about to tell us about it but um okay

2171
01:34:13,479 --> 01:34:21,399
they make a pretty um high percentage

2172
01:34:17,639 --> 01:34:23,359
cbda product from from hemp now and I've

2173
01:34:21,399 --> 01:34:25,920
seen this coming out of Oregon Dustin do

2174
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:29,198
you know anything about that about that

2175
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:31,199
science is a wonderful thing yeah well

2176
01:34:29,198 --> 01:34:34,599
this is Hash Church holy

2177
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:37,158
[ __ ] about hash put that put that lava

2178
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:39,320
lamp image back in your mind and then

2179
01:34:37,158 --> 01:34:40,920
imagine that I can wash you know through

2180
01:34:39,319 --> 01:34:43,319
that lava lamp I can send a different

2181
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:46,118
solvent down that will allow me to grab

2182
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:48,479
the hash and leave the water behind like

2183
01:34:46,118 --> 01:34:50,599
it typically in in in like your cooking

2184
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:52,198
oil industry that's going to be hexane

2185
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:54,719
um but guys are getting crazy with it

2186
01:34:52,198 --> 01:34:56,759
they're like percolating propane through

2187
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:58,639
it so that you know the beauty there is

2188
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:00,440
that the propane can then be separated

2189
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:02,800
from your hash at a very low temperature

2190
01:35:00,439 --> 01:35:05,599
so if I'm trying to save all my acids

2191
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:07,800
and whatever uh non-water soluble Turpin

2192
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,159
that might be left um they're getting

2193
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,199
crazy with it so it's just a liquid

2194
01:35:09,158 --> 01:35:12,679
liquid extraction from this glob that's

2195
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:14,079
in your water and the hot water the

2196
01:35:12,679 --> 01:35:17,920
pressure water that's just to break the

2197
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:20,760
trikes off and get it get it in the mix

2198
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:24,679
right well I mean again some hybrid of

2199
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:26,840
that process to me sounds pretty

2200
01:35:24,679 --> 01:35:29,880
scalable but sounds like something that

2201
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:33,159
you'd want to have really good

2202
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:35,760
regulation around the equipment and the

2203
01:35:33,158 --> 01:35:37,920
process and the manufacturer and just

2204
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:41,000
like when I look at the size of the

2205
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:43,639
tanks at Marcus's facility I can imagine

2206
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,279
that that process being carried out at

2207
01:35:43,639 --> 01:35:48,359
that at that tremendous scale there look

2208
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:50,679
there's a that makes a very clean

2209
01:35:48,359 --> 01:35:52,559
product I was amazed how clean the

2210
01:35:50,679 --> 01:35:54,880
product is I didn't know the level of

2211
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:57,239
detail about the process that you just

2212
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,679
described so thank you and there is a

2213
01:35:57,238 --> 01:36:01,359
few more that are floating around um one

2214
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,319
of them is like an acidic wash which

2215
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:08,118
just warm acid and you're just it's it's

2216
01:36:03,319 --> 01:36:10,439
very low um it's not it's not very uh

2217
01:36:08,118 --> 01:36:13,479
abrasive right and then we can do an

2218
01:36:10,439 --> 01:36:14,839
acid base crash out from there um

2219
01:36:13,479 --> 01:36:16,559
because we're targeting those acidic

2220
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:18,319
cannabinoids that one's got a lot more

2221
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:21,039
steps involved and then the other one is

2222
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:22,840
an enzymatic type in extraction where

2223
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:24,880
it's warm with enzymes and enzymes are

2224
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:27,079
breaking down the the the tri Chrome

2225
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,679
surfaces and then that's allowing the

2226
01:36:27,079 --> 01:36:30,479
cannaboids and turps and everything to

2227
01:36:28,679 --> 01:36:32,279
come out and like we said they pop to

2228
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:34,079
the top and then become a lava lamp Pub

2229
01:36:32,279 --> 01:36:37,198
and then you know if you want to stay

2230
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:40,039
truly solventless there's ways to get

2231
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:41,919
the water off without any solvents but

2232
01:36:40,039 --> 01:36:43,679
um you're leaving a purity step behind

2233
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:46,560
when you do that that may be beneficial

2234
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:49,158
or not now I we we got to ask and the

2235
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:53,719
rest of the church wants to know from

2236
01:36:49,158 --> 01:36:56,879
Sam did you patent the hash lava lamp I

2237
01:36:53,719 --> 01:36:59,239
mean come on that that that's like a

2238
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:03,319
[ __ ] statement if you have enough

2239
01:36:59,238 --> 01:37:07,319
hash to fill a lava lamp you got lots of

2240
01:37:03,319 --> 01:37:11,000
hash right well but I could have P it

2241
01:37:07,319 --> 01:37:15,238
but to be honest I was thinking well how

2242
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:17,520
am I ever gonna sell bees when cannabis

2243
01:37:15,238 --> 01:37:21,158
wasn't even legal when

2244
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:23,520
I but uh yeah I'm really I'm sorry I

2245
01:37:21,158 --> 01:37:26,439
didn't do it now it would have made my

2246
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:29,000
retirement much more plush dude I'll

2247
01:37:26,439 --> 01:37:31,198
guarantee you I guarantee you this that

2248
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,679
most people's hash it wouldn't work with

2249
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:36,198
yours worked because of the utter and

2250
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:38,079
complete ridiculous quality and Purity

2251
01:37:36,198 --> 01:37:40,678
that you can get it to but like I just

2252
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:43,359
doubt that every resin would do the same

2253
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:46,480
thing yeah just would have the no green

2254
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:49,198
line at the top we could use this

2255
01:37:46,479 --> 01:37:53,118
episode alone just to blow it up someone

2256
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:54,238
needs to invent the hash lava lamp man

2257
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:57,238
come on

2258
01:37:54,238 --> 01:37:58,879
