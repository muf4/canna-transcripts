himself well I'm really excited to give

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,620
the freedom fighter of the Year award

55
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,569
because that's what I think this event

56
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:50,160
is ultimately about it's about freedom

57
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:52,079
that's what we all share and I think we

58
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,330
all understand freedom in a way because

59
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:58,879
we know what it feels like to have our

60
00:04:54,329 --> 00:05:01,529
freedom taken away sometimes needlessly

61
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,569
but we're here in Amsterdam and we're

62
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:06,389
living in a world that's changing really

63
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:08,370
really rapidly

64
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,319
and it's not going to change itself

65
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,990
we're all gonna have to take part so if

66
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,540
you love freedom and you love cannabis

67
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:22,910

public defender and as somebody who

77

honor on this day because I am so

95
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:57,430
grateful that pipelines magazine that

96
00:06:54,939 --> 00:07:00,399

97
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,110
battle to keep this treaty together to

98
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,019
keep this community safe and to make

99
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:08,389
this community free for decades I want

100
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:11,579
to thank my time at the top for doing it

101
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:14,439
[Applause]

102
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:16,300
before I went to work on the initiative

103
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,589
by the to compete in the or I went to

104
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,960
work for the American Civil Liberties

105
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:21,758
Union watching to the same I was a

106
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:24,698
criminal defense attorney for over a

107
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,979
decade and so many of our family members

108
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:29,340
so many of our brothers and sisters have

109
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:32,168
suffered the battery ran at the door

110
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:35,168
facing mandatory minimum sentences of

111
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:37,149
five to ten years literally watching

112
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:38,978
their children be put down on the floor

113
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:40,568
with guns to their heads all because

114
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:42,218
they were growing a plan all because

115
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:45,848
they were enjoying the grief of enjoying

116
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:47,468
that plans and that is why I decided to

117
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:50,439
take on the work that ultimately led to

118
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:52,209
this day and I'm just filled with joy to

119
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,218
