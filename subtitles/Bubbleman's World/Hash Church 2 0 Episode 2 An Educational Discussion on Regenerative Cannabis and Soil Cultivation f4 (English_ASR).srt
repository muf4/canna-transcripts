00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:01,870
winter sleep mode we've had a bit of

63
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,059
rain which is quite lovely because we've

64
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,310
been more or less back into drought

65
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,709
conditions for the last three months up

66
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,539
here so we've had almost no rain and now

67
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:12,789
January's starting to bring some rain so

68
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:16,840
things are coming alive the moss is all

69
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:17,818
green and so on so yeah yeah it's

70
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,039
beautiful actually

71
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:30,759
nice Lynette that's super good to your

72
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:33,780

73
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:36,489
really exciting so you guys got some

74
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,459
winter mode soil building happening

75
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,650
right now right what happened is we put

76
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:43,750
out some you know soil builder all those

77
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,299
seeds and so on that we put out early

78
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,579
and then the turkeys came along and ate

79
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:51,639
almost all of them so I've got another

80
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:53,319
batch to throw out right now and I'm

81
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:55,750
going to be doing that probably tomorrow

82
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:58,479
and early this week you know soil

83
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,789
building was it clover and vetch and pea

84
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,939
and father and stuff like that to keep

85
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:06,668
the soil alive during the winter time

86
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:08,680
yeah right now mating season there's

87
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:11,199
about we have about 30 turkeys that live

88
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,569
in our meadow Wow

89
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:20,348
dances with their feathers all spread

90
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:22,870
out it's really exciting and they're

91
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:25,000
here so clearly they fly over the fence

92
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,840
to get to those seeds we didn't think

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,519
they could do it they're crafty

94
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,379
they sleep up in the trees every night

95
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,769
so they're probably wake up scoping the

96
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:37,899
gardens and everything no I just want to

97
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:40,089
see him fly into the trees because they

98
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:43,029
can't lift off very much you know it's

99
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:45,549
like a big 747 for them to get that huge

100
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:48,849
body up so they kind of cruise up into

101
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,069
the lower branches of the trees OOP

102
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,160
can't be a bad thing in the oh no oh

103
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:57,279
it's definitely beautiful for sure yeah

104
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:04,900
it's it's nothing but all poop is a good

105
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:06,879
thing definitely all right I just sent

106
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:08,529
the email out again just to make sure

107
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,750
that everyone I've been in communication

108
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:13,388
with almost everyone this morning but

109
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,550
maybe the email didn't go through so I

110
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,439
just sent it out again to make sure that

111
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,030

Nikki it would be great to hear a little

118
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:44,348
bit of a history about the Emerald

00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:46,029
triangle and Palace you all have been up

120
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:49,209
there for a long time and maybe how

121
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:51,879
things have changed we've been up here

122
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:55,149
actually living up here and growing up

123
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:57,038
here since 2004 but we have many many

124
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:58,348
friends who've been up here since the

125
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,639
early 70s

126
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:03,310
ever since um we just been talking

127
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,110
within the last few days and we were

128
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,589
always having friends you know send us

129
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,080
down a path there's some city I actually

130
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:13,888
grew my first crop in San Francisco up

131
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:18,129
on Telegraph Hill under Coit Tower in

132
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:20,620
1977-78 had 13 little plants but in

133
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:22,418
those days what I realized my big

134
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,788
realization was the plants needed food

135
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:28,259
and I have to admit my first thing I

136
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:30,610
gave was Miracle Grow and it was like

137
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:34,000
anything to see where they really liked

138
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,229
it you know and they responded but you

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,629
know after a while the whole learning

140
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,810
curve of finding out what what you know

141
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:40,668
how plants really

142
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,709
and the whole living soil thing

143
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:46,310
underneath the soil it was a revelation

144
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:47,989
to me and so then we moved up here we

145
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,600
started to you know move much more and

146
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,860
more toward organic soil but I have to

147
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,660
admit in the beginning I didn't know

148
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,850
much about this so I would just go down

149
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,100
to the local nursery and they had all

150
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,470
these bags these five-pound bags let's

151
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:04,250
see I probably with some green sand some

152
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:06,650
some oyster shells some wonder what else

153
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,889
was there volcanic rock all these

154
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:11,359
different things that I would put in

155
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:13,460
what some of those other things that we

156
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,870
were putting in and I just threw him in

157
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:20,239
I didn't know anything about what I was

158
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:22,939
doing but the play each tissue right but

159
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,250
Bank board pnina bushes to avoid plain

160
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:27,319
surveillance and so on yeah I was

161
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,350
actually up here more like ninety nine

162
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,849
still late 90s and that was in when

163
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,660
there was still helicopters circling

164
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,879
overhead and you had to really learn how

165
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:43,180
to be invisible in the forest it was

166
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:45,918
kind of exciting message yeah it was and

167
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,569
it was things have really really changed

168
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,099
because it used to be that it was the

169
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:51,288
family a lot it started off this

170
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,960
basically communes and families up here

171
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:55,699
that moved way just to get out of the

172
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:57,349
city in the late 60's hippies they

173
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,860
wanted to get out of the city they moved

174
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,510
up to the Emerald triangle and this and

175
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,979
probably had a lot of seeds and stems in

176
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:05,509
it because it came from Mexico and I'm

177
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:08,478
sure they dropped in the soil and I

178
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:10,849
realized wow let's grow this I'm gonna

179
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,189
make a living and so then the people in

180
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,650
the beginning it was you know in the

181
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:18,350
first years up here first decades

182
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:19,969
actually it was very scary because there

183
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,910
were actually federal agents that would

184
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,889
hang out outside of growth of nerves

185
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,200
nurseries to see who was going in to get

186
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:28,038
a bunch of soil or stuff so people had

187
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,620
to be very clever

188
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:32,569
well people had to make their own stuff

189
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,418
in the woods and that people would piss

190
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,879
and jugs all winter long and save their

191
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:40,098
urine to put on the plants all summer

192
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,958
long and was one of those things you had

193
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:45,830
to be really secretly I had to hide your

194
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:47,958
your drip lines and you know grow under

195
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,180
the manzanita bushes so if you got 4 to

196
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,319
5 ounces per plant that was actually

197
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:53,838
pretty a pretty good hard

198
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,550
right and there were people who are real

199
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,279
real renegades who would hike back into

200
00:08:55,549 --> 00:09:01,008
the remote forest with no roads you know

201
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:02,838
10 20 miles back in and have a little

202
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:04,730
renegade grow back there and you know

203
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,889
they call it the money tree right and

204
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,629
they'd come back out with a bag full of

205
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:12,948
stuff on their back and hitchhike into

206
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:15,169
town yeah very rustic and very isolated

207
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:17,809
up here and and I have to say as far as

208
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:20,208
the quality of the cannabis actually so

209
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:23,568
I mean when I start smoking cannabis in

210
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:26,359
1969 and it was you know Mexican not

211
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:28,549
very great by the time people started

212
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,079
growing up here even in the beginning if

213
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:31,549
they didn't know what they were doing it

214
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:33,409
was still better yeah yeah it was

215
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:35,750
homegrown and everybody wanted to get

216
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:39,110
California homegrown even I mean in the

217
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:42,078
80s in the city we were spelling people

218
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,269
were selling cannabis for like 500 bucks

219
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:45,919
an ounce is what it was if you could get

220
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:48,639
cannabis from the Emerald triangle or

221
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:52,698
pot whatever we called it back then we

222
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,139
first it was good it was really good you

223
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:56,028
know was a step I would love to have a

224
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:59,568
piece of that to just compare right now

225
00:09:56,028 --> 00:10:01,189
to what was what everybody calls

226
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:03,679
sinsemilla because everything from

227
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,899
Mexico was coming up with seeds and

228
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,269
stems and sticks and at least half of

229
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:10,879
your weight was material you couldn't

230
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:12,799
actually smoke right and so in those

231
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,509
things that was the thing that's that

232
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,698
yeah you know you had to surf through

233
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:18,350
your all your weed and get the seeds and

234
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:21,259
the stems out to finally smoke and then

235
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:24,920
all of a sudden but a boom Samiha comes

236
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:27,679
in from up north or from hawaii - and it

237
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:30,409
was in a revelation yeah yeah yeah and

238
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,419
so as far as I mean we've been judges in

239
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:35,778
the Emerald cup since it started 14

240
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:37,549
years ago in 2003 so I guess you could

241
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:39,409
say we've seen a whole lot of cannabis

242
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:42,649
go through this county and in this area

243
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:44,389
and the quality has changed what I've

244
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:47,299
noticed the most that's changed over the

245
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:49,370
years is what gets entered so I'd say

246
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:52,219
when we first started doing it it was a

247
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,839
lot more smoke up camera luck in 2003

248
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,269
there was a lot more skunky kind of

249
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,639
varieties then it moved into a whole lot

250
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:01,698
of pushes for many years it was almost

251
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,950
all cush it was so cush and now it's

252
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:05,479
getting into a lot more flour and

253
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:09,320
floral and fruity flavors that are

254
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:13,190
coming in no they do they do and people

255
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,470
like that mix as taste change I have

256
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,720
definitely watched the change of what

257
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,840
people prefer it's interesting over the

258
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,269
years I just want to add that that when

259
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,750
you said the money tree that reminded me

260
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:28,879
of this wonderful movie from 1992 about

261
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,100
growers in Northern California the story

262
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,799
if you haven't seen it absolutely find

263
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,509
it the the crop is real in the movie

264
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:37,459
it's very rare that you see real

265
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:39,439
beautiful incredible plants and the

266
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,019
story goes that the guy grew the crop

267
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,870
filmed the movie and funded the movie

268
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:48,439
with the crop he grew and so it's really

269
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,870
quite a you know a be kind of movie but

270
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,960
I think as any grower from Northern

271
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,970
California it's very much appreciative

272
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,009
and it is called the money tree so I

273
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:02,660
just had to mention that writing that

274
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:04,730
down was the whole thing there was this

275
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:06,379
underground society and that's the one

276
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,149
thing that all of us are kind of worried

277
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:10,669
that we're going to lose there was a

278
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:12,439
based on trust it was based on knowing

279
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:15,679
each other was based on face-to-face

280
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,720
contact and you know you just knew that

281
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,429
you only needed a new two or three

282
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,350
people and then you could get rid of

283
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:23,809
your entire crop and they only needed to

284
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,670
know four or five people so it's a

285
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:27,619
really closed cell kind of thing and

286
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:29,990
that's why so very people really do

287
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,580
people got busted and so on and it was

288
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,789
just a trust thing you know there was a

289
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,850
knowing a secret society and people

290
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:40,189
shared information constantly I mean up

291
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,769
until this very well you're just

292
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:47,030
information seeds and stars every take

293
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:48,350
you know you know when to harvest all

294
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,919
those things because nobody knew

295
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:54,500
anything about this plant itself being

296
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:57,199
taught mm-hmm absolutely

297
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,539
we did have a few more panelists that

298
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,020

company about eight or nine years ago

323
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:24,379
after having grown up on a farm and

324
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,029
being around biodynamic farming and kind

325
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:29,779
of being around the entire large

326
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:31,549
biodynamic farming process and wasn't

327
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,980
until I got more into sustainability

328
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:36,159
corporate sustainability the landscape

329
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,750
side of it that I started exploring

330
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:42,949
compost as the individual component and

331
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,629
its effects in horticulture and started

332
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,250
the company mainly for backyard

333
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:49,009
gardeners looking for a good backed

334
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,929
alternative to grow food and it was

335
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:52,669
through this community and some people

336
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:55,399
on this phone call and a lot of their

337
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:57,439
friends that really came to us and

338
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,409
started embracing the quality of compost

339
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,060
and really then kind of started this

340
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:04,579
discovery of learning more and more

341
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:06,919
about how to make the best compost in

342
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,020
the world and the kind of focus of our

343
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:11,990
company is mainly just focusing on that

344
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:14,569
high quality biodynamic compost focusing

345
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,970
on the role of the cow of the biodynamic

346
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:20,990
and probiotic inoculations that are used

347
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:24,050
in the soil and through focusing on this

348
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,028
singular lifeblood of the soil and of

349
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:28,878
the plant

350
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:30,679
for still trying to incorporate a lot of

351
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,839
the more holistic principles of

352
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,818
biodynamic farming the closed loop so

353
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,220
the irony is I love to talk about

354
00:15:34,818 --> 00:15:38,899
compost and we sell compost but our

355
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,610
passion is teaching people how to make

356
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:43,009
their own compost so they don't have to

357
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,870
buy our compost so they can make their

358
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:52,370
own and then we can go to someone else

359
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:54,110
the beautiful thing so there's the intro

360
00:15:52,370 --> 00:16:01,459
I love it how about Scott what do you

361
00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:04,399
what's up with Scott there you go

362
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,938
how's it going Scott um actually I'm

363
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:12,589
Scott

364
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:14,149
so welcome internet world's where does

365
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:16,120
it start

366
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:19,129
I come from an agricultural background

367
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,049
my uncle's a produce broker so from a

368
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:24,170
young age we were crawling into fields

369
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:27,258
and talking with farmers and that sort

370
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:28,639
of thing some high some high school

371
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:32,120
friends went pretty heavy into the

372
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,278
indoor scene back in the mid 2000s and I

373
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,028
got to participate and and see that

374
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:41,929
action I think where I really got

375
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:45,169
inspired was when people inside my

376
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:47,750
growing circle started asking me for

377
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:49,519
things like Eagle 20 and and whatnot

378
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,259
because they thought because my family

379
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,789
was in agriculture that we had a magic

380
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:55,430
account to buy all kinds of chemicals

381
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:57,198
and so I think that's actually when I

382
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:59,419
really started getting inspired inspired

383
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,909
because I figured if people were

384
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:03,889
resorting to horrific chemicals that you

385
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:05,209
can't even access to deal with problems

386
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:08,929
someone should actually look into the

387
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:11,808
real solution and so I became literally

388
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:15,199
obsessed with finding out why cannabis

389
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:18,349
gets powdery mildew and how do we get

390
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:23,269
rid of it so I think that's when I

391
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:26,240
really became inspired and then at a

392
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:29,389
certain point I was working on the

393
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,819
family farm

394
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,220
it wasn't very big but it is a it was

395
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:37,579
some acreage and we wanted to try some

396
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,690
teas so I called into forever flowering

397
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,168
to try and get a hold of some of the

398
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,090
dragonfly

399
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:42,919
earth medicine products and I was going

400
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:44,749
to try to use the lush roots and the

401
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,600
brilliant black and whatnot at

402
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:49,730
agricultural scale and I had a long

403
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,918
conversation with Erika Trevor flowering

404
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,480
and and he encouraged me to look into a

405
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,788
Laningham he said something to the

406
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,769
effect of you know if there's money on

407
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:59,868
the line and this is important you

408
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:01,819
should you should get a hold of Elaine

409
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:04,278
and figure out how to use the microscope

410
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:08,868
as an actual tool not a not a casual

411
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:12,019
observation device and I think that was

412
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:13,608
in mid-2013 and at that point the only

413
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:16,278
way to get a hold of Elaine was you had

414
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:19,970
to find her on the road somewhere and so

415
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:21,798
at that time she in have her classes as

416
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,440
soon as she offered her online classes

417
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:26,058
we you know went pretty heavily with

418
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,340
that and I've pretty much been obsessed

419
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:31,970
with using a microscope to count

420
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:35,209
organisms in the soil and now we work

421
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,118
with commercial facilities in the last

422
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,079
couple years my wife and I have

423
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:40,128
positively influenced well over a

424
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:43,579
million square feet of indoor

425
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:45,648
cultivation and a considerable amount of

426
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:47,599
outdoor we're starting to get into the

427
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:50,748
bigger greenhouses with California going

428
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:53,199
rec so like today I'm in a hotel and in

429
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:55,608
the middle of nowhere working on a

430
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,090
50,000 square foot greenhouse is pretty

431
00:18:55,608 --> 00:19:01,608
cool so currently living yeah currently

432
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:05,329
living what I would consider a dream

433
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:08,089
situation and super thankful that I've

434
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:10,069
been completely obsessed with how to

435
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:13,249
produce cannabis free of pests and

436
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:17,589
disease without using chemicals now's

437
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:19,850
the time to execute so things are good

438
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:24,230
wonderful wonderful thanks so much

439
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:26,599
that's a super crucial tool to us all

440
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,730
doing the living soils and and these

441
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:30,528
kind of biological systems and knowing

442
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,450
that the flavor is the best through that

443
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:34,878
you know and just wanting to be able to

444
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,889
bring that to scale so that the masses

445
00:19:34,878 --> 00:19:40,488
could have it not all just your good

446
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:42,469
friends that's great well a Steve what

447
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:43,608
do you what's going on down in Nevada

448
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:47,749
what you tell us a quick thing about

449
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:50,558
green life productions and yourself and

450
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:58,089
your soils that you can work on and

451
00:19:50,558 --> 00:20:03,668
how you what was that the last part how

452
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:06,668
you came to the program right now okay

453
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:09,419
so yeah my name's T Cantwell I grew up

454
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:12,490
heavily involved in mixed martial arts

455
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:16,210
kickboxing jujitsu MMA UFC all that cool

456
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:17,769
stuff I got into canvas just after years

457
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,028
and years of just physical abuse to my

458
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:20,259
body and just kind of looking for that

459
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:22,388
long-term solution

460
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:26,649
I'm always grew up smoking pot though my

461
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:28,209
whole life for the most part but yeah I

462
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:30,128
start getting real heavily into cannabis

463
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,069
um towards the end of my career in my

464
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:35,079
early 20s has been pretty sustaining

465
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:36,819
some pretty bad injuries over time and

466
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:38,558
didn't give him the proper time to heal

467
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:41,918
just kept competing on top of them

468
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,178
injury death injury so I found cannabis

469
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,528
and it was really helping me not just

470
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:45,940
and ask my injuries not just help me

471
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:49,480
with the pain but I felt it has actually

472
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,769
helped me heal my injuries so it was

473
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,409
kind of a big eye-opener I feel a

474
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:54,099
healthy folk good about it so I got dope

475
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:55,629
into the plant

476
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:57,878
I'm learning about the plant life at

477
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:59,528
grow my own medicine did with a patient

478
00:20:57,878 --> 00:21:04,240
for years under the Nevada medical

479
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:06,638
marijuana patient program and then yeah

480
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,859
then then the recreational scene kind of

481
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:11,859
started popping up or the least that the

482
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:14,888
the medical scene unregulated medical

483
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:16,569
scene so I was lucky enough I reached

484
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:18,368
out to some former sponsors in mind that

485
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:21,038
that I sponsored me in the UFC some

486
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:22,720
small town Floyd Ace Hardware deployed

487
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,690
family out and prompt they put together

488
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,879
a good local team and we just built out

489
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,490
the best facility the most regenerative

490
00:21:27,878 --> 00:21:32,319
facility we could at the time being that

491
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,128
we were the first to actually get up and

492
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:35,168
going in Nevada

493
00:21:33,128 --> 00:21:37,808
there was no regulations as far as

494
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:40,860
greenhouses go pesticides things like

495
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:43,298
that so we went big on the indoor

496
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:47,378
our goal has been to be like the most

497
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:50,019
sustainable indoor facility possible we

498
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:51,609
we do everything we can to take care

499
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:55,480
about what we're doing not just the

500
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:57,668
product but the environment as well so

501
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,618
we introduce living soil to indoors on a

502
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:01,059
large commercial scale we've been

503
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,509
extremely successful that doesn't mean

504
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:02,829
that we have

505
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:05,049
problems with it doesn't mean we haven't

506
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:08,289
learned our lesson here and there learn

507
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:10,869
what to do what not to do but for the

508
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:12,879
most part it's uh we've had a an

509
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:14,939
extremely blessed opportunity to work

510
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,280
with and meet so many amazing people

511
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,710
like yourselves Josh and Kelly like

512
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:22,269
Scott and Sarah like other people in the

513
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,940
industry that just kind of shared their

514
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:26,740
passion with us and kind of and shared

515
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,110
their techniques and their techniques

516
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,089
and experience and their everything that

517
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:32,559
they have to offer to the table so I

518
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:34,629
just so could all a man we've been doing

519
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,220
the best we can working through these

520
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,040
regulations trying to put out the best

521
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,350
cleanest safest product possible while

522
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,029
again contributing to a clean safe

523
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:47,289
environment and you know cultivating

524
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:49,509
this plant responsibly excellent that's

525
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:52,859
great it looks like i'm nickolay about

526
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:55,569
my nose now green source gardens also

527
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:57,689
hey Nick and Liz can you guys come on

528
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:57,689
now

529
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,040
okay well that's okay don't figure out

530
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,079
how to unmute their microphone here

531
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,759
shortly I don't think their microphones

532
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,629
muted but it's okay to have some

533
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:15,490
technical difficulties it's how we learn

534
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,140
to make things flow wonderfully so I

535
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,180
don't mind a little hiccup and a bump

536
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,009
here and there and I'm just I want to

537
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,509
tell everyone that I'm super excited to

538
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:25,059
get into this conversation today and

539
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:32,470
have you all here it's it's really

540
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:34,990
lovely it is it is and you know what I

541
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:37,750
think that we can take this conversation

542
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,609
and get a more little more directed and

543
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,549
I was wondering maybe if we'd start with

544
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:46,029
the compost maybe a column and you could

545
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:49,960
go a little deeper and tell us about bio

546
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:54,940
dynamics and maybe some about Rodale and

547
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:57,220
composting historically and how it

548
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,559
affects your piles and and what makes

549
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,059
what how the biodynamic preps really

550
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:03,309
really help the piles differently than a

551
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:06,009
regular column and and also since you

552
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:07,289
all are you know working with a lot I

553
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:09,160
know that you have a lot of other

554
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:10,720
agricultural people that you're working

555
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,300
with that you are working a lot in the

556
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,589
cannabis industry and maybe how you're

557
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:15,849
you know making

558
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:18,308
your compost and things that's

559
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:20,759
particularly the cannabis industry into

560
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:23,500
particularly to the planet

561
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:27,990
good well those those are all great

562
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:31,000
questions I would typically save that

563
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:35,200
you know compost as four main elements

564
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,558
there's earth water air and fire and if

565
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,620
you think about compost just in the

566
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,298
broader sense is it's not and this is

567
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:45,519
the right audience it's even the

568
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:47,079
agricultural circles compost is often we

569
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,179
thought of as the stuff that you sort of

570
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:52,058
throw away you stick in a corner of the

571
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:54,730
farm and just let it break down and then

572
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:58,808
you go back and you use it and not this

573
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:03,159
active process but it's really a process

574
00:24:58,808 --> 00:25:06,548
between the decomposing but also using

575
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:08,528
that root word the composition so going

576
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:10,778
into making your own compost is

577
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:14,440
understanding that there's a composition

578
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:16,480
to this that and this is where I stress

579
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,070
then when it comes into most compost

580
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,579
operations that you see it's the

581
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:24,058
difference between organics recycling

582
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:26,528
versus intentional composting and

583
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:28,389
organics recycling is what happens under

584
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:31,240
a tree it's when you combine a bunch of

585
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:32,830
materials you recycle organic material

586
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,839
or you divert material out of the

587
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:37,509
landfill all of which have their place

588
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:41,949
and are absolutely critical for our

589
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:44,200
whole survival but besides the organics

590
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:47,440
recycling there's intentional compost it

591
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,380
an intentional composting though you

592
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,048
really should still start from the

593
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:55,990
perspective of what do you have the most

594
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:56,528
of on your own land and then build from

595
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,798
there

596
00:25:56,528 --> 00:26:01,950
so in Malibu's it's slightly different

597
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:04,000
because if we said we're gonna start

598
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,038
intentionally compost and we want to

599
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,589
make one of the most best compost known

600
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:10,509
to man we looked at a lot of different

601
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:13,658
methods and we looked at the biodynamic

602
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:17,079
method and I'll get into a few of the

603
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:19,870
reasons for that but one of which then

604
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:22,028
was looked at the cow so in my situation

605
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:24,158
I don't own a dairy farm

606
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:27,519
I don't own a lumber mill I don't own

607
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,540
any type of operation where I have a lot

608
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,519
of byproducts

609
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:33,460
in our company we went out to go get the

610
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:37,119
byproducts in your situation you might

611
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,100
have a very wooded property or you might

612
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,109
have a farm nearby or a vegetable

613
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:44,279
processing facility so in your situation

614
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:46,539
you might work backwards based on what

615
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,950
can you get your hands on the most and

616
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:49,869
then build your recipe from there but we

617
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:53,250
started with the cow and one of the

618
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:56,529
reasons is the female mother dairy cow

619
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:59,109
the truly organic mother dairy cow who's

620
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:02,740
outside eating grass who's already given

621
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:07,539
birth to a calf produces very specific

622
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:09,240
enzymes inner digestive system and not

623
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:11,680
only are you looking at the same

624
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,870
probiotics that go through and come out

625
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,029
in mother's milk that you'll find used

626
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:18,669
for kefir and for yogurt cultures and

627
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:20,700
all these living properties and enzymes

628
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:23,769
and the milk it comes out in the manure

629
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,360
secondly there's also this balance in

630
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:29,710
the manure because of the cow's

631
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:32,349
digestive system so the bacterial the

632
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:35,620
beneficial fungi everything within that

633
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:37,839
cow system produces a perfectly balanced

634
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:40,839
manure chicken manure is very hot

635
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:43,000
horse manure is very dry and fibrous pig

636
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:44,459
manure is great sheep manure is great

637
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,339
you have tons of different

638
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,690
characteristics of manure each one

639
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:51,730
produces a different bulk density when

640
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:54,250
it's finished produces a different pH

641
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,920
when it's finished has different organic

642
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,720
nitrate characteristics to it so they're

643
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,450
all kind of have their different things

644
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,339
and we use that the second though is the

645
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:07,569
cow because of eating all the grass

646
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:09,970
there's this kind of connection between

647
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:11,500
what the pasture needs and taking from

648
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,470
the pasture and giving back to the

649
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,599
pasture so it's almost as if the cow is

650
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:19,710
sort of balancing that level of

651
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:22,509
fertility in the soil as it goes along

652
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,340
the other thing that we find is and I'll

653
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:26,109
let Scott talk a lot more to this with

654
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:30,639
just the beneficial bacteria the

655
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:33,129
beneficial fungi the living aspects of

656
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,660
this finished compost and when people

657
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:37,330
look at a lot of the aspects of

658
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,400
biodynamic or organic they're always

659
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:41,049
trying to point fingers of what it is or

660
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,040
what it is and can you prove this can

661
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:45,279
you prove that

662
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:46,839
and some of the purists just say well my

663
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:51,129
plants taste better or my plants are

664
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:52,869
stronger some of the Cal Poly and UC

665
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,460
Davis things say well there's no

666
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:57,789
negligible proof that we can come up

667
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:01,059
with but what we're seeing a lot on one

668
00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:04,599
scientific concept i'll introduce is SAR

669
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:07,899
as systemic acquired resistance and it

670
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:10,359
sounds complicated at first but systemic

671
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,300
lee acquiring resistance to pests as the

672
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:14,949
disease and plants do this in the same

673
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:16,599
form and fashion that kids who are

674
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,660
allowed to go outside and play in the

675
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:22,240
dirt do there are three times more

676
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:24,430
likely not to contract asthma and

677
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,980
respiratory diseases kids who grow up on

678
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:29,860
farms around manure who who play in the

679
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:32,650
dirt are more likely not to get sick

680
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:35,139
there's an anti bleach effect it builds

681
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:36,850
up acquired resistance in your system

682
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,009
and the plants do this as well if they

683
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:41,740
have a healthy soil with a healthy

684
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:45,609
biological diversity to pull from they

685
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:48,130
are going to become stronger so compare

686
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:50,259
apples to apples in the same exact

687
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:52,540
environments there might not be that

688
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:55,240
much of a difference but if you

689
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:59,259
introduce pests or disease or any stress

690
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,880
factors drought heat any of these stress

691
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:02,609
factors that we're seeing now more and

692
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,140
more due to climate change

693
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:07,329
plants become stronger because they have

694
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,580
a healthier ecosystem you're also

695
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:12,220
treating the soil and you're treating

696
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:15,879
the entire biological intelligence in

697
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,650
the soil and that's directly stolen from

698
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,510
GreenSource Gardens the concept of

699
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,550
biological intelligence planted between

700
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:25,480
I love it and it will keep stealing it

701
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:27,069
thank you guys so every compost has

702
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,480
these different characteristics so

703
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:31,000
really we're looking for that rich

704
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,039
characteristic and when you're blending

705
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,349
your carbonaceous materials and your

706
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,879
manure that's your earth element of your

707
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:38,469
compost so when you think of the four

708
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,590
elements you have carbon and nitrogen

709
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:43,720
ratio that's your earthly component

710
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:45,459
there's a certain ratio that it has to

711
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,350
fall in or the pile is not going to work

712
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,440
but again that's why I say work

713
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:52,959
backwards from what you have in the

714
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,519
highest volume and tweak your recipes

715
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,169
going from there because accomplice is

716
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:00,639
going to shrink 56

717
00:30:56,169 --> 00:31:04,509
possibly even 70% we find moisture is a

718
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,309
difficult variable to control especially

719
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:08,319
here in Oregon we use some breathable

720
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:10,658
covers on the compost piles in the

721
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,460
winter time we built the piles much

722
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:14,320
bigger when they start out in the summer

723
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,480
time and almost used like a layer of

724
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,428
straw on the outside to insulate it

725
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,470
because moisture is your other variable

726
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:23,850
you're not going to be able to start a

727
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,960
pile with a moisture above 65 70 percent

728
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:28,359
but you're not going to be able to get a

729
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,669
pile to go and truly finish if it starts

730
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:33,189
out of 40 percent or less so you want a

731
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:35,409
good moisture characteristic in your

732
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,140
compost pile to end up with a good moist

733
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:41,890
compost that allows a lot of that life

734
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:44,860
to breathe and this is all going and air

735
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:50,200
as the next factor so we have water

736
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:52,148
earth and air and the air the pile wants

737
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,950
to breathe from the bottom so a lot of

738
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:57,599
people don't understand it's how you

739
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:59,860
construct your piles that adding

740
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,019
porosity in the bottom of the pile

741
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:04,000
allows the oxygen to circulate which is

742
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:07,450
going to allow the final variable of

743
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,579
heat so earth air and water you can

744
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:12,940
control and heat is the final byproduct

745
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:14,288
of all of this now certainly you know

746
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,259
it's exciting to have Jeff on the call

747
00:32:14,288 --> 00:32:18,788
let him talk a lot more about the

748
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:21,669
microbes but what we're looking in the

749
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:24,339
compost is to heat the tile above a

750
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:26,500
hundred and thirty-three degrees we want

751
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:28,240
the thermal fields to show up all the

752
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,179
beneficials that show up above a hundred

753
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,788
and thirty-three degrees but we don't

754
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:35,798
want that pile to crack 160 degrees

755
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:38,589
because at 160 degrees some of those

756
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:40,210
beneficial microbes start dying off so

757
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:42,668
there's a delicate balance we're trying

758
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,740
to get the pile to peak up and to get to

759
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,169
a certain level and then allow it to go

760
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,990
through this kind of cooling down

761
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:52,570
mesophilic stage of the compost now in

762
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:55,240
the biodynamic practice we use specific

763
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:56,678
inoculations and these are extracts that

764
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,269
you'll hear and you'll find at your same

765
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:03,669
health food store dandelion chamomile

766
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:04,960
yarrow silica oak bark okay you might

767
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:06,370
not find the silica at the health food

768
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,140
store but you'll find a lot of these at

769
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:09,829
the health food store because there's

770
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,769
healing properties

771
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:16,009
now they're composted themselves it's

772
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:18,048
not just the arrow for example it's the

773
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:19,788
leaf it's the flower of the arrow plant

774
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:21,739
that's been juiced and pressed and hung

775
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:24,378
out to dry and fermented through its own

776
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:27,590
process and then buried into the compost

777
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:29,538
pile as an inoculant but this is where I

778
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:32,509
go back to this whole concept that when

779
00:33:29,538 --> 00:33:35,509
you're making intentional compost you're

780
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:38,139
composing and what's exciting is to see

781
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:40,399
so many people in this world especially

782
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:42,019
now when you go to the question Kelly

783
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:43,668
asked about how do you make compost for

784
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:45,679
the cannabis world you say well what do

785
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:49,669
my plants need that might be more unique

786
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:52,369
to that crop and how can I compose this

787
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:55,249
pile of material in my backyard or in my

788
00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:58,069
garden to get this end result so you see

789
00:33:55,249 --> 00:34:00,889
people now growing a low and comfrey

790
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:04,038
next to their compost pile to include

791
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:05,569
into the compost you can take worms and

792
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:08,418
add it to the compost you can put

793
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:10,940
biochar into the compost you can add

794
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:13,429
rock dust into the composter into the

795
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,858
work pile so you're utilizing these

796
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:17,809
components that you might be adding

797
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:20,598
later on to the plant instead what

798
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:23,000
you're doing is you're utilizing them to

799
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,369
add to the compost to allow it to go

800
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,128
through this transformative process all

801
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:31,250
these materials together to homogenize

802
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:33,648
and to diversify so you're essentially

803
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,599
you're building your own compost by

804
00:34:33,648 --> 00:34:41,029
growing and adding these other unique

805
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:42,318
inputs free soil application which just

806
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,809
in my opinion makes it far more

807
00:34:42,318 --> 00:34:47,480
effective and makes the entire soil far

808
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:50,869
more mature and it just reinforces this

809
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,639
concept when you have truly healthy soil

810
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:54,889
and healthy components and a lot of

811
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,318
biological diversity especially adding

812
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:59,990
some of these natural materials that are

813
00:34:57,318 --> 00:35:02,630
used by humans and plants and have

814
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:04,669
medicinal properties you're gonna grow

815
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,818
strong plants and every plant is going

816
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,230
to be an expression of that unique soil

817
00:35:06,818 --> 00:35:11,449
which then we can also talk later about

818
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,818
the concept of true are but tewara is

819
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:15,858
really expression of that unique

820
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:18,980
characteristic of that soil in that

821
00:35:15,858 --> 00:35:20,480
plant rather than using pesticides or

822
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,159
fertilizers or anything from somewhere

823
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,360
else to kind of create a generic

824
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:27,049
baseline

825
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,430
you're enhancing the uniqueness of all

826
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:29,930
these aspects and that's one of the

827
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:33,349
things we love in an Oregon we use

828
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:35,690
Oregon cows the Oregon compost has

829
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:37,670
oregon-based mycorrhizae in it I've

830
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,349
learned about our compost from cover

831
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,970
crop experts who have stopped and

832
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:43,339
ovulating their cover crop but use a

833
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:45,379
dusting of Malibu because it contains

834
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,910
indigenous micros ease now that's over

835
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,829
my head I don't specialize in

836
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:50,629
mycorrhizae but that's the beautiful

837
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:52,400
thing about this community is sometimes

838
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:54,980
you just learned so much more than you

839
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,750
ever think you have to teach by talking

840
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,730
to people who use your product to share

841
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:01,190
your same passion so and that's the

842
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:03,380
little bit about composting and that's

843
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:05,780
the beauty of the community right thanks

844
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,849
: that was really awesome and totally

845
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,560
complete I think that you know there

846
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:11,929
gonna be a lot of questions as we go

847
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:15,230
into this but learning about compost is

848
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:17,809
just such a amazing basic thing to

849
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:21,349
understand living soils and or a base

850
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:22,909
thing for our farm - yeah or even an

851
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:24,860
inoculant like you were saying you know

852
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:27,339
we've used malibu compost as an

853
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:30,289
inoculant into our teas you know as much

854
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,420
biodiversity as we can have we're always

855
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:35,150
looking for good positive biodiversity

856
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,519
and this helps us get into Jeff now that

857
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:40,160
he's here and maybe dive into some of

858
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:41,750
the the microbes and the fungi and you

859
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,759
just got done finishing teeming with

860
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,139
fungi and maybe you can tell us a little

861
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,570
bit about what's going on with you and

862
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:49,250
and a little bit about yourself in your

863
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,800
new book Jeff so we'd love to hear about

864
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,599
what's been going on with you and and I

865
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,000
think that you can add a lot more to

866
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,360
what coulomb just said as well so it's

867
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,360
all you

868
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:07,030
he's got to unmute his mic first welcome

869
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:10,240
by the way Jeff little click on the old

870
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:14,350
mic and we want will hear what you have

871
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:21,449
to say you're still muted try to unmute

872
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:21,449
let's see yeah there you are all right

873
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:31,989
Anchorage Alaska it's still dark those

874
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:37,110
are my greenhouse lights that you're on

875
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:40,209
my face it's freezing here so you know

876
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:43,150
fine I am Jeff Lauren fells I wrote

877
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,599
three books I like to call myself Lord

878
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:48,039
of the routes teeming with microbes

879
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,409
teeming with nutrients and teeming with

880
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:52,449
fungi and of course all three of them

881
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:53,920
have a lot to do with compost or I

882
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:55,539
should say compost has a lot to do with

883
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,139
all three of them because as far as I'm

884
00:37:55,539 --> 00:38:01,059
concerned compost is the base and if you

885
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:02,529
don't have great compost you're not

886
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:04,210
gonna have great plants that's just all

887
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,490
there is to it

888
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,409
you could make it or you can buy it or

889
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:10,750
you can buy it and then you can add to

890
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:12,460
it to make your own which is I think

891
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,440
what Congress was getting at there you

892
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:17,800
know his products are all Oregon

893
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,579
products his microbes are as much Oregon

894
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,280
as possible

895
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:23,500
I live in Anchorage Alaska I like to

896
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,320
have indigenous microbes from my area

897
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,329
and so I will take Malibu compost and

898
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,080
I'll add some Alaska you masoor some of

899
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:35,230
my own compost into it so that I get my

900
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,779
local microbes in it one of the things

901
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,820
that I've learned over the years reading

902
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,800
about compost and dealing with compost

903
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,350
and I think you know pretty much anybody

904
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,720
that's into growing knows how to make

905
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:48,579
compost not everybody knows how to make

906
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,219
it as well as the biodynamic folks do

907
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:53,829
but but but I think we all make compost

908
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:56,919
but but over the past five or ten years

909
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:59,259
the big advice edition there's been two

910
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,780
of them that I've been given and that I

911
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:06,370
think are very very worth following the

912
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:08,920
first is to add up to 10% clay into your

913
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:10,429
mix and that's obviously because the

914
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,950
clay has

915
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:14,960
electric properties that enable it to

916
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:17,389
hold on to some of the microbes as well

917
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,490
as lots of the nutrients I think people

918
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:21,019
don't often remember that microbes can

919
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:24,649
have an electric charge on them as well

920
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:27,409
and and so adding 10% clay into your

921
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:30,410
compost pile obviously has been very

922
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:32,088
very effective for that reason and then

923
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,980
the other thing is I know that people

924
00:39:32,088 --> 00:39:37,818
think that compost has mycorrhizal fungi

925
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:40,010
in it very often there will be a micro

926
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:42,318
iyslah fungi in compost because it blows

927
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:46,040
in from from the area where it's being

928
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:48,050
made but generally the number of spores

929
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:52,190
of mycorrhizae fungi and compost is

930
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:54,470
either low or none and so what you need

931
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:57,858
to do is really add mycorrhizal compost

932
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:59,539
mycorrhizal fungi into compost and in

933
00:39:57,858 --> 00:40:02,838
the particular instance of cannabis

934
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:05,568
there's really only one mycorrhizal

935
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:09,259
fungi that works and so after you make

936
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:12,558
your compost and right before you apply

937
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:16,549
it and use it then you want to add the

938
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:18,290
rise of feigus interest CDs that's the

939
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:20,509
only mycorrhizal fungi that does

940
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:23,929
anything with regard as far as we know

941
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:25,849
with regard to the cannabis plant so so

942
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:29,118
yeah it can be in your compost because

943
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:31,730
it blows in if you're if you've got

944
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,849
plants or you've got spores that are in

945
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,530
the near vicinity but generally you need

946
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:39,619
to add mycorrhizal fungi to compost

947
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:42,349
because the mycorrhizal fungi are

948
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:44,990
attracted by the roots which send out a

949
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:46,789
signal and you don't have living roots

950
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:48,709
and you compost and so they're not

951
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:52,400
sending out that signal to generate the

952
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:54,530
mycorrhizal populations the age of the

953
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,269
compost I think is pretty important a

954
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:59,660
lot of people use their compost when

955
00:40:56,269 --> 00:41:02,269
it's way too young and that has two

956
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:04,969
implications the first is that the

957
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:08,269
compost might not really fully be

958
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:11,269
compost yet compost piles have to be

959
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:13,960
turned if you're if you're making active

960
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:16,460
compost as opposed to static compost and

961
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:20,420
what people have found is that most

962
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:22,429
compost piles are not turned enough or

963
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:24,409
completely and so that there are areas

964
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:27,919
of the compost that don't go through the

965
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:29,690
and 33 degree heating process they have

966
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,530
the potential if you use manure in your

967
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:34,610
pile of of contain e.coli but but more

968
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:37,010
important you're not going through the

969
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,660
composting process or as important as

970
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:41,030
should say you're not going through the

971
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:43,099
composting process you know if you don't

972
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:47,030
continually turn and make sure that all

973
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:51,019
the material in the pile unposted so

974
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:52,910
that's that's really kind of key then I

975
00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:54,769
think a lot of people don't test their

976
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:56,059
compost again depending on what you put

977
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:58,190
in your compost and comb is absolutely

978
00:41:56,059 --> 00:41:59,989
right and what we what we tend to do is

979
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,119
take compost and we make designer

980
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:03,799
compost all of us that are growing our

981
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,989
own cannabis making your own compost

982
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,220
we're we're tweaking our compost trying

983
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:11,119
to make the very best compost we

984
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:14,449
possibly can and and you know we we add

985
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,699
stuff to it and and we got a we got a

986
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:19,429
really think about about how we're

987
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:22,519
making our designer compost and whether

988
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:25,339
it's it's it's you know what we really

989
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:27,530
want to have so for cannabis plants our

990
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:32,120
cannabis plants we know like a more

991
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:34,130
bacterial soil than a fungal soil in

992
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:36,949
terms of dominance and so you can add

993
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:42,380
more green material and make your

994
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:46,429
compost a more bacteria oriented compost

995
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:48,110
you can as Colin said add in the things

996
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:50,509
that you would normally put in your

997
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:52,610
plant as fertilizers or into your soil

998
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:55,040
to feed the microbes in the soil you

999
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:58,700
feed the compost and you can end up

1000
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,469
using up to up to three-quarters lesson

1001
00:42:58,699 --> 00:43:02,629
so in other words up to one quarter of

1002
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:06,049
the of the quantity of the stuff that

1003
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:08,150
you would normally need you can use in

1004
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:10,610
the compost pile much much less because

1005
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:12,769
it gets worked into the bodies of the

1006
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:16,519
microbes which ultimately hold these

1007
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:21,530
nutrients and and then ultimately end up

1008
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:23,300
feeding the plants as we know so yeah I

1009
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:26,750
don't think there's really too much much

1010
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,160
more to add compost is it oh yeah I was

1011
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,570
getting at was that you've got to test

1012
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,420
the compost to make sure that you're

1013
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:36,080
you're loading your plants with the

1014
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:38,090
right ratios of material you don't want

1015
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,549
to end up with way

1016
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:43,309
too much phosphorus and that can happen

1017
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,600
if you make your compost one way it'll

1018
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:45,860
end up with tremendous amounts of

1019
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:48,559
phosphorus and if you have too much

1020
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:51,079
phosphorus then once you do use the

1021
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,880
compost things happen that don't happen

1022
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:54,799
if you don't have so much phosphorus you

1023
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,320
don't attract the mycorrhizal fungi your

1024
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,970
plants don't need to do that so you

1025
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,070
don't get the same soil structure you

1026
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:03,189
don't get the same inputs coming in from

1027
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:05,630
the mycorrhizal fungi from the biology

1028
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:08,000
biology that surrounds the mycorrhizal

1029
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:09,769
fungi so you got a really kind of fool

1030
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,760
around and tweak what you do and one of

1031
00:44:09,769 --> 00:44:13,820
the things you got to do is you got to

1032
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,430
test your stuff testing is knowledge and

1033
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:18,200
and information is power and if you

1034
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:20,899
don't test your compost even though it

1035
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:22,129
costs a little bit of money you know I

1036
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,809
think you're making a big mistake

1037
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:25,220
and when I say testing I think you need

1038
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:28,190
to test the first several things I think

1039
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:31,869
you need to test it for NPK I think you

1040
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:35,960
need to test it for for the fungal

1041
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:37,730
bacterial ratio and maybe which one is

1042
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,159
active versus which one isn't that's the

1043
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:41,719
soil food web test and lately I've been

1044
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:45,649
talking about a new kind of test called

1045
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:48,589
a microbial biomass test where you can

1046
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:50,780
actually measure the microbial density

1047
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:53,150
of your soil the microbial biomass of

1048
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:54,650
your soil this wasn't possible before

1049
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,750
without spending a tremendous amount of

1050
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:59,480
money but now there's something called a

1051
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:01,340
micro bio leader which you can get off

1052
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,900
the internet and it's going to be

1053
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,490
distributed now in stores because they

1054
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,980
just made deals with several big

1055
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:11,029
distributorships and for ten dollars you

1056
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:13,670
can test your soils to see whether your

1057
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:16,519
micro bio mass which is really

1058
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:19,369
correlated high biomass good nutrients

1059
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:22,880
low biomass not so good nutrients and

1060
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:24,259
you can correlate with what you're doing

1061
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,930
so if you're adding something into your

1062
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:28,790
compost is that improving the biomass of

1063
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:31,609
your compost if you're putting your

1064
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:34,250
compost down on your plants you can test

1065
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:36,500
them to see whether that compost is

1066
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:40,429
improving and increasing the biomass in

1067
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,750
the soil it's a very interesting new way

1068
00:45:40,429 --> 00:45:43,730
of measuring stuff so I think you need

1069
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:47,750
to do those three tests of course the

1070
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:49,699
NPK is the other one and once you do

1071
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,559
that you get a real feel for what what

1072
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:55,039
you're doing and what you're making

1073
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:57,070
so I love it no that's that's super

1074
00:45:55,039 --> 00:46:00,650
important it tells us about the

1075
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:03,590
microorganisms their their role and it

1076
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:05,440
really is teaching us that you know you

1077
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:07,519
know part of climate change is

1078
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,500
agriculture a really big thing is you

1079
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:11,900
know runoff and dead zones in the ocean

1080
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,849
have a lot to do with agricultural

1081
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,760
runoff going into the ocean and killing

1082
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:18,710
the micro life and everything so you

1083
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,210
know that's that's a huge importance as

1084
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,920
retaining what you're putting in you

1085
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,480
don't want you just don't want to throw

1086
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,789
your money away and you don't want to

1087
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:28,820
throw it and you know crucial inputs

1088
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:31,340
away and harder microbes yeah exactly

1089
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:34,039
and and also you know in the end it

1090
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:35,720
gives you a good you know buy a product

1091
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:37,789
of hash I mean we're on hash search

1092
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:39,369
after all and you know to bring in the

1093
00:46:37,789 --> 00:46:42,980
right trichomes you know to have a

1094
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:45,980
diverse microbial system in your in your

1095
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:48,500
soil is gonna give you you know really

1096
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:51,260
good plant health and then also hash

1097
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,699
production and I thought um that we

1098
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,050
would be nice to introduce a few more

1099
00:46:52,699 --> 00:46:56,000
people that are on the panel and then

1100
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,980
possibly move in to keep going with the

1101
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,840
science aspect of it and talk to Scott

1102
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,610
Oh about some of the some of the soil

1103
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:06,559
tests he's been doing so yeah so let's

1104
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:08,780
move on to em and go ahead and talk a

1105
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:11,150
little bit about your farm and what it

1106
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:13,100
is that you do and we know that you're

1107
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:15,170
running a rec farm a really large rec

1108
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:17,420
farm in Oregon and you're doing it all

1109
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:19,670
organically and way beyond your pure

1110
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,500
certified farm and you guys are doing

1111
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:23,360
really awesome things tell us a little

1112
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:33,619
bit about who you are and what you're

1113
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:37,070
doing there thank you yeah my partner

1114
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:39,889
and I have been working together

1115
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:45,250
building organic soil for cannabis

1116
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:45,250
production for quite a few years now and

1117
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:53,349
there's been a real learning curve to

1118
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:55,969
find a lot of these elements of

1119
00:47:53,349 --> 00:48:00,549
diversity and balance that are being

1120
00:47:55,969 --> 00:48:00,549
referenced here we're

1121
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:08,799
currently working up to scale for our

1122
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:11,289
tier 2 license in Oregon we're running

1123
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:15,730
about 5,000 square feet of light

1124
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:18,509
assisted greenhouse canopy and we've got

1125
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:22,599
a few thousand square feet of outdoor

1126
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:24,430
canopy which is sheltered under the

1127
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:28,179
protection of hoop houses with some

1128
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:30,879
environmental control components in

1129
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:33,719
there being as we are just south of

1130
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:38,010
Portland up in the northern limit valley

1131
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:40,779
moisture is always a challenge for us so

1132
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:42,700
we've got a lot of climate control

1133
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:47,380
equipment that we need to employ in

1134
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:50,469
order to maintain consistency in our

1135
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:53,530
production year round which is a big

1136
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:55,959
challenge but we're kind of figuring our

1137
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:58,840
way and how to set up these greenhouses

1138
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:01,480
properly to utilize as much benefit of

1139
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,280
the Sun as we can and just really work

1140
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:08,139
towards minimizing our energy

1141
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:11,619
consumption but we do see an important

1142
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:15,569
niche in the market for you know

1143
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:19,450
producing extremely high quality you

1144
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:25,300
know indoor quality type flower to the

1145
00:49:19,449 --> 00:49:27,969
market and so much of that slice of the

1146
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:30,850
market is consumed by you know where

1147
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:34,089
health growers that are in many regards

1148
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:37,659
throwing a lot of energy out the door

1149
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:41,650
and not utilizing the benefits that the

1150
00:49:37,659 --> 00:49:44,559
Sun gives us so that's that's our

1151
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:53,320
primary model right now is the light

1152
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:55,029
assisted greenhouse and we have been

1153
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,960
fortunate to find a nice piece of land

1154
00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:03,490
that we moved into a couple of years ago

1155
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:05,440
that's got pretty solid native soil it's

1156
00:50:03,489 --> 00:50:10,029
a little high in clay

1157
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:14,200
we built our are sort of custom gnome

1158
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:20,619
soil blend with a lot of Malibu

1159
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:22,919
is incorporated and diversity as keeps

1160
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:27,010
coming up diversity is so important so

1161
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:31,380
we've you know turn to some other local

1162
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:34,329
compost suppliers and as Jeff referenced

1163
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:37,690
we've really learned the value of

1164
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:39,220
testing the compost we've had some rough

1165
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:42,700
and tumble along the way through

1166
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:46,689
building certain batches bodies of soil

1167
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:50,558
as I think of them a little bit

1168
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:52,869
willy-nilly along the way as far as well

1169
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,089
just say hey we'll take we like this

1170
00:50:52,869 --> 00:50:57,490
fungal you know mushroom based compost

1171
00:50:55,088 --> 00:51:01,058
and we like this grow bacterial basement

1172
00:50:57,489 --> 00:51:03,459
compost we'll combine it with a healthy

1173
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:06,670
percentage of Malibu produced across the

1174
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:10,179
valley from us here in Oregon bringing

1175
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:12,608
in a lot of the indigenous we collect

1176
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:14,919
indigenous microorganisms for from our

1177
00:51:12,608 --> 00:51:20,828
own farm and are regularly distributing

1178
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:22,869
those inoculating the soil and and then

1179
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:26,140
we just sort of had a general sense of a

1180
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:28,599
blanket amendment mix that would add

1181
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:31,568
value nutrient from a nutrient

1182
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:34,420
perspective and we've just kind of had

1183
00:51:31,568 --> 00:51:36,639
some mixed results along the way nothing

1184
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:39,970
too bad but you definitely see when

1185
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:42,460
things are really aligned and all the

1186
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:45,848
diversity is working well together and

1187
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:49,420
balanced the quality of growth and

1188
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:52,528
production that we see is is you know

1189
00:51:49,420 --> 00:52:00,000
that that's the goal in all cases so

1190
00:51:52,528 --> 00:52:04,150
we've really had to learn to to

1191
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,250
understand all these very complex soil

1192
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:09,480
analysis and understanding the balance

1193
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:12,900
between all the primary and secondary

1194
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:16,599
nutrients and all the trace elements and

1195
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:18,670
it really is a web of information that

1196
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:21,519
sometimes can be a challenge to unfold

1197
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:23,139
and just through looking at a lot of

1198
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:25,000
data here in the last couple of years

1199
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:26,170
things have really started to slip into

1200
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,519
place

1201
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:29,320
and we've learned that we can't

1202
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:33,190
necessarily just take for granted that

1203
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:34,840
if we employ a certain XYZ we're going

1204
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:37,480
to consistently have the same result

1205
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:41,110
unless we are very clear on what XY and

1206
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:46,869
Z represent so it's been really exciting

1207
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:49,450
to to learn and apply a lot of these

1208
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:52,900
understandings at the scale that we're

1209
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:55,179
at we're looking to expand in the next

1210
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,800
year to the full scope of our license

1211
00:52:55,179 --> 00:53:01,379
which will be nearly double the

1212
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:04,720
production that we're currently at and

1213
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:09,670
so I feel like we're primed really well

1214
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:12,789
to rise up as we expand the market here

1215
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:16,059
and try to just hold our own as we're

1216
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:19,570
facing pretty massive oversupply issues

1217
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:21,639
here in the state that's a school we

1218
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:24,430
really appreciate that information each

1219
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:26,170
farm has such a unique story and we'll

1220
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:28,059
just move right on to Nick and Liz from

1221
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:29,380
green source you can expire and reduce

1222
00:53:28,059 --> 00:53:31,779
yourself and explain a little bit about

1223
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:34,599
your farm and we'll keep moving through

1224
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:36,490
the people and and then we'll get to

1225
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:38,730
yeah more conversation thank you

1226
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:38,729
everybody

1227
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:44,149
see if Nick in love here

1228
00:53:45,019 --> 00:53:53,539
yes yes okay and we got you here me yes

1229
00:53:52,760 --> 00:54:01,850
we can hear you

1230
00:53:53,539 --> 00:54:09,519
nope go ahead hey if it starts to in a

1231
00:54:01,849 --> 00:54:09,519
weird spot um we are green first Gardens

1232
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:21,109
we're know and uh talking about our

1233
00:54:17,269 --> 00:54:24,980
story I think the first it might not

1234
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:28,490
work very well you guys are coming in

1235
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:36,530
and out a little bit yeah that's

1236
00:54:28,489 --> 00:54:39,949
probably shoddy satellite internet so we

1237
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:43,040
won't be able to take part well we love

1238
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:44,659
and appreciate you guys we uh I'm you

1239
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:46,460
know there might be a way actually if

1240
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:48,289
they go to the bandwidth button at the

1241
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:50,900
top of the screen it looks like a Wi-Fi

1242
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:53,599
signal and if you click on that adjust

1243
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,608
bandwidth usage you might be able to

1244
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:58,159
take it and it's you know it usually is

1245
00:54:55,608 --> 00:55:00,909
in the auto HD top spot and you can

1246
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:03,799
slide it all the way down to the left

1247
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:05,420
it's that you can't have a camera on but

1248
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:09,100
it might be able to allow your voice to

1249
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:12,460
come through better okay how is it sound

1250
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:19,940
that sounds pretty good sound better

1251
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:22,420
well okay okay well anyways so let's go

1252
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,420
to Duke

1253
00:55:22,929 --> 00:55:28,309
thanks you guys thank you guys you guys

1254
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:29,750
were worried about that and so we're we

1255
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:31,340
know we're working through it but that's

1256
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:32,869
the way it goes but I guess you know I

1257
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,608
guess I could take a minute and just

1258
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:36,530
introduce you guys a little bit because

1259
00:55:34,608 --> 00:55:39,380
I feel like I know you all so well and

1260
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:41,150
you all are now family to us and we've

1261
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,970
been out to your farm but Nick and Liz's

1262
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:48,260
farm out in green source is in Oregon

1263
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:50,509
they moved on to their farm last year so

1264
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:53,240
this is their second year cultivating

1265
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:56,690
cannabis they have a rec farm and

1266
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:59,209
they took a whole hillside and turned it

1267
00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:02,539
into beautiful terraces through Hugo

1268
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:05,030
culture they mounted it on top of rocks

1269
00:56:02,539 --> 00:56:06,409
it was a fairly rocky soil which are a

1270
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:08,060
lot of people feel like that makes a

1271
00:56:06,409 --> 00:56:10,009
tour you can't grow things but they

1272
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:12,489
showed that a little effort and a lot of

1273
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:14,330
love you can bring the sticks out of the

1274
00:56:12,489 --> 00:56:17,479
forest and you can have wonderful

1275
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:20,119
animals and and they can help transform

1276
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,590
the soil with with you know some faith

1277
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:23,180
and the hard hard work

1278
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:25,940
and Nick and Liz really haven't brought

1279
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:29,419
anything onto their property except for

1280
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:32,000
local you know no spray all organic hey

1281
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:34,490
they feed it to their animals and then

1282
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,710
transfer all the compost onto their soil

1283
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:39,229
beds with a tremendous amount of

1284
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:42,699
biodiversity they're utilizing king

1285
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:45,860
stropharia mushrooms they are utilizing

1286
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:49,039
comfrey and all different types of

1287
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:51,050
wonderful companion planting as well as

1288
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,960
food so they're pulling potatoes or Saba

1289
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:55,670
beans out from underneath their their

1290
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,590
cannabis plants they're having wonderful

1291
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:59,750
harvests and food throughout the whole

1292
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:02,000
season along with their cannabis the end

1293
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,800
of you know fall and you know they

1294
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,599
really helped start the Hugo culture

1295
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:08,780
revolution that's happening in the whole

1296
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:10,819
water retention through roots and you

1297
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:13,280
know they have a beautiful farm and and

1298
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:15,170
we really love Nick and Liz so thank you

1299
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,030
for being here maybe you can add some to

1300
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:19,909
the chat on the side and maybe we can

1301
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:21,619
move over quickly to Colorado and see

1302
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:26,118
what's happening with Duke diamond and

1303
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:29,050
the Dominion seed company and soil bye

1304
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:29,050

real good yeah very good welcome Duke

1306
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:40,130
welcome thanks for having me man I

1307
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:44,000
haven't talked to you since like a forum

1308
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:47,289
back in like 2005 or six or something

1309
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,559
man I'm glad to see you're doing good

1310
00:57:47,289 --> 00:57:56,090
absolutely still trucking along that's

1311
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:57,619
that man saw you can do so that was Duke

1312
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:59,090
a little bit about your story and a

1313
00:57:57,619 --> 00:58:00,559
little about the soils that you like to

1314
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:02,420
work with and what really brings the

1315
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,369
flavor to your herb because when we met

1316
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:07,880
up with you all down in the Emerald cup

1317
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:09,710
and uh and smells your herb it was

1318
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,960
definitely some of the top most

1319
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:13,760
flavorful ganja going on there and what

1320
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:18,170
what are you using with soils to create

1321
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:23,960
that well I'd say like there's a there's

1322
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:27,490
a few different few different factors so

1323
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:30,619
ideally with the soil mix and everything

1324
00:58:27,489 --> 00:58:33,199
the bud that y'all were smoking on there

1325
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:35,599
so that's been grown in the same soil

1326
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:39,829
it's been in the same pot about three

1327
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:44,170
years now and it's it's the way I like

1328
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:48,019
to mix my soil that first time there's a

1329
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:49,700
couple things that I changed here you

1330
00:58:48,019 --> 00:58:51,380
know when I when I moved down here

1331
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:56,509
because the you know change in

1332
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:59,390
technology one lighting and - um I

1333
00:58:56,510 --> 00:59:01,610
discovered like gray stones that was

1334
00:58:59,389 --> 00:59:03,889
real nice because it used to be I would

1335
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:06,980
you know at least yearly I'd have to

1336
00:59:03,889 --> 00:59:09,529
bust open those wreaths balls and Rhea

1337
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:11,179
men with Peres life with the gray spend

1338
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:14,030
stuff they don't they don't break down

1339
00:59:11,179 --> 00:59:16,369
like para lights so that was like a big

1340
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:22,130
help so I haven't had to do any of that

1341
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:24,409
which is really cool i layer it with a

1342
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:27,619
layer at the very bottom of the pot

1343
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:31,730
that's about two to three inches like a

1344
00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:37,130
good good drainage layer and then I keep

1345
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:38,659
things if I lived in Oregon or like in

1346
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:41,420
the Pacific Northwest

1347
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:43,759
I would Airy ate a little bit more so

1348
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:48,380
than I do here

1349
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:50,869
and the the environment here in Colorado

1350
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:54,019
like you know it's very arid so

1351
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:55,640
sometimes like where somebody say an

1352
00:59:54,019 --> 00:59:57,800
Oregon might be having to run

1353
00:59:55,639 --> 01:00:01,129
dehumidifiers I might actually have to

1354
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:04,130
run a humidifier you know to keep things

1355
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:06,500
where I like it so those are gonna a few

1356
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:10,539
factors as far as the soil mix and

1357
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:13,608
what's in it I like to be very diverse

1358
01:00:10,539 --> 01:00:16,309
some people say oh well you know I added

1359
01:00:13,608 --> 01:00:18,590
a bunch of you know this send for my

1360
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:20,420
calcium supplement and that said I like

1361
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:23,590
to add like a few different things

1362
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:26,210
different sources for the same thing

1363
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:28,700
things break down at different speeds

1364
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:31,929
and also I'm looking at like a more of a

1365
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:35,089
quicker instant gratification as well as

1366
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:36,559
long-term soil health you know something

1367
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,390
like oyster shell that would take a

1368
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:41,420
longer longer period of time to break

1369
01:00:38,389 --> 01:00:44,989
down I like to keep everything kind of

1370
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:48,980
even keeled I'm not too hot you know but

1371
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:50,868
a good good stout mix and I like to I

1372
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:55,010
like to have things more in my control

1373
01:00:50,869 --> 01:00:57,470
to where I'm I'm kind of in control on

1374
01:00:55,010 --> 01:01:01,070
the boost and the peaks and being able

1375
01:00:57,469 --> 01:01:05,539
to kind of pull things away to you know

1376
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:08,480
encourage them to to not flush out at

1377
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:09,980
the end but to to get a nice fade you

1378
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,590
know where I don't have anything in

1379
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:15,769
excess toward the end of a run where I'm

1380
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:20,510
actually getting a fade and they kind of

1381
01:01:15,769 --> 01:01:24,050
finish out naturally the other thing I

1382
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:25,880
would say would be you know I use you

1383
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:29,660
know of course your Dragonfly product

1384
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:33,230
all throughout about midway through I

1385
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:35,750
take it a take it away and I'll give it

1386
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:38,809
like one more good boost I like to do

1387
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:42,320
like earthworm casting tea and I like to

1388
01:01:38,809 --> 01:01:44,150
do a like a bat guano from a fruit bat

1389
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:46,010
you know specifically

1390
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:48,769
oh it's figured like if they're eating

1391
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:50,570
fruit you know and they digest it and

1392
01:01:48,769 --> 01:01:53,599
everything then you know that kind of

1393
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:57,850
translates to to a higher terpene

1394
01:01:53,599 --> 01:02:00,170
content at the end as well and then also

1395
01:01:57,849 --> 01:02:03,409
something like we figured out back in

1396
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:06,559
the day so you know originally I'm from

1397
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:08,210
Virginia so it wasn't as easy as like if

1398
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:10,309
you have a light bulb burn out or

1399
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:11,809
something get wrong you can't well I

1400
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:13,159
mean you could run know how to restore

1401
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:16,250
but you're probably gonna go to prison

1402
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:19,579
but you couldn't just get a light bulb

1403
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:21,619
so we had HPS go out and we just said

1404
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:24,049
screw it we ended up running the metal

1405
01:02:21,619 --> 01:02:27,409
halide the whole time and notice how

1406
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:29,240
much resin came out like we lost you

1407
01:02:27,409 --> 01:02:31,279
know flower density and all I'm like a

1408
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:33,649
little bit of weight but the amount of

1409
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,769
resin and the stink really came out so

1410
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:39,710
we kind of came on to something back

1411
01:02:36,769 --> 01:02:41,690
then but translating in the current day

1412
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:45,650
like we have these de lights so I like

1413
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:47,450
to mix the spectrum up a little bit you

1414
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:49,550
know the plants they're they're like our

1415
01:02:47,449 --> 01:02:52,189
eyeballs you know you have rods and

1416
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:56,090
cones so they're very responsive to

1417
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:58,730
different different spectrums light we

1418
01:02:56,090 --> 01:03:01,190
found that you know the Blues they bring

1419
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:03,349
out a lot more of the resin and I'm

1420
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:06,260
finding that you know you're getting a

1421
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:10,279
higher terpene content for sure so the

1422
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:13,550
last you about 21 days I like to try to

1423
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:18,080
curb it as much pure blue as possible

1424
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:21,289
and you know moving into more of just a

1425
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:23,599
straight water toward the end um I like

1426
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:25,730
to I like to kind of think of the

1427
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,589
microbes to like workers at an

1428
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:31,159
industrial plant that are building

1429
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:33,769
something you know so I like to kind of

1430
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:36,289
be able to curb the microbial dominance

1431
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:37,820
toward the end and really like

1432
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:39,769
throughout their whole growth cycle

1433
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:41,809
depending on what I'm looking for them

1434
01:03:39,769 --> 01:03:44,179
to do I like to encourage the microbes

1435
01:03:41,809 --> 01:03:46,789
that are gonna be encouraged and what we

1436
01:03:44,179 --> 01:03:48,980
want to be done and kind of keep tall

1437
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:51,230
the ones more just kind of subtle on the

1438
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:54,820
back burner and changed the dominance of

1439
01:03:51,230 --> 01:04:00,019
the microbes as the cycle progresses and

1440
01:03:54,820 --> 01:04:03,200
you know by the by the end of it um you

1441
01:04:00,019 --> 01:04:07,849
know we went from a bacterial dominance

1442
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:09,710
to bacterial fungal kinda even to more

1443
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:11,929
of a fungal dominance with a few

1444
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:14,570
bacterial boost

1445
01:04:11,929 --> 01:04:16,609
I believe like the bacterials they it

1446
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:20,450
seems like if you supplement a little

1447
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:24,019
bit more of the bacterials at certain

1448
01:04:20,449 --> 01:04:27,019
points when you're feeding for terpenes

1449
01:04:24,019 --> 01:04:29,329
because like I'm not just growing

1450
01:04:27,019 --> 01:04:32,300
flowers you know I think like I'm

1451
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:35,509
growing biomass of course but at the end

1452
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:37,789
of the day I'm trying to grow resin

1453
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:40,340
glands I'm trying to you know grow track

1454
01:04:37,789 --> 01:04:43,159
try cons um you know I'm looking for

1455
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:45,829
terpene content so I'm building you know

1456
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:49,819
biomass and flour but my focus is really

1457
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:54,949
on the omec lands so cool yeah so like

1458
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:58,519
my feeds are starting yeah say like

1459
01:04:54,949 --> 01:05:00,859
around in the 30s mmm my feeds start to

1460
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:03,619
drift away from building biomass and

1461
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:08,019
then I'm feeding specifically for resin

1462
01:05:03,619 --> 01:05:11,900
and terpene content and I'm doing that

1463
01:05:08,019 --> 01:05:14,090
like a lot of people laugh when I tell

1464
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:18,920
them like what a water mouth plants with

1465
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:21,380
but uh I mean it works that's so like

1466
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:23,650
taking like fruit juice and stuff and

1467
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:26,869
breaking them down beforehand with

1468
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:28,550
certain microbes and all and supplement

1469
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:32,239
them little bits of that into the beads

1470
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:34,820
and that's also the way like I get a

1471
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:37,729
good magnesium boost to help facilitate

1472
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:41,440
the phosphorous uptake in the middle

1473
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:43,280
toward the end of the cycle is

1474
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,070
cranberries you know they're like

1475
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,280
they're very rich in magnesium so if I

1476
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:50,990
can sit there and break those down

1477
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:54,350
beforehand when I feed it you know to

1478
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:56,779
the to the pots it's more more instantly

1479
01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:58,549
available you know because like I like

1480
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:01,160
things to break down on their own and

1481
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:04,370
the soil pot you know feeding everything

1482
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:10,250
but I think I said you know I like to

1483
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:12,109
have things in my control so that sounds

1484
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:14,150
good nods that's that's a good thing and

1485
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:15,920
that might actually let us go get into

1486
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:18,289
Scott and I would love to hear from

1487
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,000
Scott if we all have a little patience

1488
01:06:18,289 --> 01:06:21,380
that we can get through you know just

1489
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,389
listening to everyone then we can get

1490
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:26,400
into some question and answer and and

1491
01:06:23,389 --> 01:06:28,199
crease them dialogue between everyone

1492
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,050
we're gonna have maybe Scott I would

1493
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:32,189
love to hear from Scott some of the

1494
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:34,200
information that you're getting from the

1495
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:36,030
living soil test that you're doing at

1496
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:39,449
different places what you're seeing as

1497
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:40,920
some of the limitations or some of the

1498
01:06:39,449 --> 01:06:42,539
parameters where you feel like it may

1499
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:46,130
have gone too far and I'd love to hear

1500
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:48,989
some more about the tests of brewing and

1501
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:52,710
what you're finding with that and also I

1502
01:06:48,989 --> 01:06:54,959
think yeah we're gonna get Carolyn

1503
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:56,929
mountain girl on here soon and we're

1504
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,309
gonna have get to hear her story so

1505
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:02,419
anyway thank you Scott come on and let

1506
01:06:59,309 --> 01:07:05,239
us know and let you what you're finding

1507
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:08,369
right on thanks for having me on again

1508
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:10,109
for the people that missed earlier um

1509
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:11,579
one of the main reasons I'm here is

1510
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:14,039
because the inspiration a dragonfly

1511
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:16,949
earth medicine and so just intense

1512
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:19,889
thanks to you guys and you know I'm a

1513
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:23,519
really concrete obsessive data guy and

1514
01:07:19,889 --> 01:07:25,230
you guys helped me introduce the concept

1515
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,210
in my brain that all the answers I need

1516
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:29,400
are already around me in nature you know

1517
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:35,550
and if I can just look at my environment

1518
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:37,380
the environment is trying to communicate

1519
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:41,550
what that environment is telling to me

1520
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:44,700
which is been tremendous to fine-tuning

1521
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:47,190
my intuition I guess you could say so

1522
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:48,869
so thank you for you guys oh thank you

1523
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:50,670
and maybe you can pepper in some of your

1524
01:07:48,869 --> 01:07:51,900
work with Steve too because you know I

1525
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:53,670
know you're working with green life

1526
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,590
there and and that's a really important

1527
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:57,599
project I think for the whole industry

1528
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:59,789
really and so you can almost you know

1529
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:04,289
you know fill us in with that as you're

1530
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:06,329
telling us for sure so what I do is I

1531
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:09,539
use a microscope to count organisms I

1532
01:08:06,329 --> 01:08:12,659
learned that through a Laningham many

1533
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:14,099
years ago you had to find somebody that

1534
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:16,289
knew how to do this technique and

1535
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:18,000
convinced them to allow you to learn it

1536
01:08:16,289 --> 01:08:20,550
from them through work trades and things

1537
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,380
like that so back in 2014 when I was

1538
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:25,199
learning to do this I'd convince other

1539
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:27,900
advisors to teach me and now you can

1540
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:30,059
jump on Elaine's classes and pay $600

1541
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:32,579
and learn in a few months what took me a

1542
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:34,530
year and a half to really sort out so I

1543
01:08:32,579 --> 01:08:36,600
think the communities in for some really

1544
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:38,699
exciting exciting change you're coming

1545
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,088
up as more people come online that can

1546
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:41,759
do this

1547
01:08:39,088 --> 01:08:43,469
type of mathematics I think one of the

1548
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:46,859
the things that the living soul

1549
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:49,649
community is lacking is you know a

1550
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:52,880
measurement device of living you know we

1551
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:57,838
say living soil but by what measure

1552
01:08:52,880 --> 01:09:01,250
intentions are very very important and

1553
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:03,568
intention definitely has an impact but

1554
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:06,118
this is biological life that you're

1555
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:08,909
creating and we're essentially doing

1556
01:09:06,118 --> 01:09:10,469
animal husbandry so and we're doing

1557
01:09:08,908 --> 01:09:12,479
animal husbandry with animals that we

1558
01:09:10,469 --> 01:09:14,039
cannot see and so we need to create a

1559
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:16,798
hospitable environment where they can

1560
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:19,948
actually live and thrive so I think one

1561
01:09:16,798 --> 01:09:22,229
of the biggest disconnects is you know

1562
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:25,169
how the biological system actually works

1563
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:28,019
and so I got a little visual aid here I

1564
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:30,630
don't see if I can put that in there let

1565
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:35,549
me put myself up here so I can see hold

1566
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:37,380
on there you go there you go so this is

1567
01:09:35,548 --> 01:09:40,109
a timeline that represents a concept

1568
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:43,440
called ecological succession and if we

1569
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:45,779
start way over here on this side we've

1570
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:54,298
got you know either a major catastrophic

1571
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:55,860
flood or maybe bail ups he end up over

1572
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:58,679
here at old-growth forest right so

1573
01:09:55,859 --> 01:10:00,569
climax forest and this timeline measures

1574
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:03,239
the biological activity that's going on

1575
01:10:00,569 --> 01:10:05,789
in the soil so above-ground we can very

1576
01:10:03,238 --> 01:10:09,539
clearly see the ecosystem transition

1577
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:11,519
from rocks to shrubs row crops bushes

1578
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:13,408
trees and then we eventually end up at

1579
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,449
you know the redwood forest and you can

1580
01:10:13,408 --> 01:10:17,789
very clearly quantify these numbers with

1581
01:10:15,448 --> 01:10:21,750
a microscope and you know 30 to 40

1582
01:10:17,789 --> 01:10:25,380
minutes mathematically the most common

1583
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:27,329
numbers I see this is reversed is it

1584
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:38,670
reversed for me are you guys I'm I just

1585
01:10:27,329 --> 01:10:40,319
hi yeah it's probably far we I'm doing

1586
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:42,449
backwards backwards and backwards okay

1587
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,279
so the most common numbers

1588
01:10:42,448 --> 01:10:47,908
mathematically I see from the cannabis

1589
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:50,399
soil samples are point 0 9 to 0.12 fungi

1590
01:10:47,908 --> 01:10:51,839
to bacteria ratio so this is one of the

1591
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:52,559
numbers that we can measure very clearly

1592
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,270
and you

1593
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,280
you calculate the biomass of the fungi

1594
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:57,870
and you calculate the biomass of the

1595
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:01,079
bacteria and that gives us a number

1596
01:10:57,869 --> 01:11:03,630
right so the most common living soil is

1597
01:11:01,079 --> 01:11:06,090
way over here much closer to bear rock

1598
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:08,010
than it is to the ecosystem that

1599
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:11,190
cannabis would naturally thrive in and

1600
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:14,220
so mathematically according to Elaine's

1601
01:11:11,189 --> 01:11:17,009
work that she's done cannabis really

1602
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:19,800
wants to be in the equal bacteria to

1603
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:21,900
equal biomass of fungi and bacteria or

1604
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:25,289
all the way up to five times the fungal

1605
01:11:21,899 --> 01:11:26,789
biomass is bacterial biomass and so this

1606
01:11:25,289 --> 01:11:29,729
is a very important number that we can

1607
01:11:26,789 --> 01:11:31,590
we can quantify very clearly it's just

1608
01:11:29,729 --> 01:11:34,289
one of the numbers but it's an important

1609
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:36,869
number because it speaks to stability of

1610
01:11:34,289 --> 01:11:41,369
the system the bacteria and the fungi

1611
01:11:36,869 --> 01:11:42,899
are the storage systems in the soil that

1612
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:46,769
provide nutrients to our plants and then

1613
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:48,119
they have predators and prey so when I

1614
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:50,640
first started doing this work the last

1615
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:52,739
thing I wanted to do is be a lab and

1616
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:56,160
that seems to be where we're the most

1617
01:11:52,739 --> 01:12:00,029
useful so that's what we do my wife is

1618
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:01,920
also trained to do the organism number

1619
01:12:00,029 --> 01:12:03,509
so we both to do this type of math so

1620
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,579
this is kind of what we came up with to

1621
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:08,699
help convey these really complex

1622
01:12:05,579 --> 01:12:10,380
concepts on this side we have all the

1623
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:12,630
different organism categories so here's

1624
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:15,720
you know fungi and bacteria which are

1625
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:20,190
storage systems flageolets of maybe

1626
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:22,650
these other protozoa are the opening

1627
01:12:20,189 --> 01:12:24,509
device to the bags of fertilizer that

1628
01:12:22,649 --> 01:12:25,589
are in the soil and then down here on

1629
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:27,210
the bottom we have the anaerobic

1630
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:29,460
indicators so these are the

1631
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:31,470
disease-causing fungi these are the

1632
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:35,579
ciliates which are anaerobic predators

1633
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:38,520
of the bacteria and these are the values

1634
01:12:35,579 --> 01:12:41,220
that are defined by Elaine Ingham for

1635
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,590
the productive systems that cannabis

1636
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:46,140
would naturally occurrence so you know

1637
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:47,989
here we have a sample that was a healthy

1638
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:50,430
yield and this isn't by any means

1639
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:53,699
concrete or the highest values this is

1640
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:55,890
just an example of a good soil so blue

1641
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:58,289
boxes indicate that we are exceeding

1642
01:12:55,890 --> 01:13:01,289
these minimum values and green means

1643
01:12:58,289 --> 01:13:03,239
that were within range and so we need a

1644
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:06,149
certain population of bacteria and fungi

1645
01:13:03,239 --> 01:13:07,948
to even be considered a living ecosystem

1646
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:09,988
and then how quickly those organisms

1647
01:13:07,948 --> 01:13:12,569
convert into nutrients is based on

1648
01:13:09,988 --> 01:13:14,908
what's eating it and if the conditions

1649
01:13:12,569 --> 01:13:18,179
are oxygen rich or oxygen deprived

1650
01:13:14,908 --> 01:13:20,549
determines who is consuming the fungi

1651
01:13:18,179 --> 01:13:23,670
and bacteria so these are three other

1652
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:26,279
samples that have done this one says

1653
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:29,510
spider mites and mold and recip mites so

1654
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:33,329
red boxes indicate significantly low

1655
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:35,820
much much lower or approaching

1656
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:38,429
catastrophic situation and orange is

1657
01:13:35,819 --> 01:13:40,109
slightly under so you can see that as we

1658
01:13:38,429 --> 01:13:43,469
get to the worst pest we get more and

1659
01:13:40,109 --> 01:13:46,559
more red boxes and what's significant

1660
01:13:43,469 --> 01:13:48,560
about recip mites for example are the

1661
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,750
extremely high values for

1662
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:53,580
disease-causing fungi which this is a

1663
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:55,679
number that should be more appropriate

1664
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:59,579
to like the beneficial fungi like if we

1665
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:03,239
look at the good example we got a 345

1666
01:13:59,579 --> 01:14:05,760
fungi way down here at russet mites and

1667
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:08,908
mold we have 300 disease-causing fungi

1668
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:11,100
so from my perspective it's completely

1669
01:14:08,908 --> 01:14:15,019
flipped upside down as to what the

1670
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:15,020
makeup of a healthy soil should be and

1671
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:21,659
and then if we translate that to recive

1672
01:14:19,948 --> 01:14:23,399
mites the most common question I get is

1673
01:14:21,658 --> 01:14:24,988
how do you kill recip mites I don't know

1674
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:27,569
I'm not into killing things I'm into

1675
01:14:24,988 --> 01:14:29,099
creating living soil systems but I can

1676
01:14:27,569 --> 01:14:30,960
tell you that in all five of these

1677
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:34,860
recipe examples we have a tremendous

1678
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:37,050
amount of red boxes these first three

1679
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:39,420
samples are from a farm that had high

1680
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:41,760
elevation they were brewing compost tea

1681
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:44,130
for three days with a tremendous amount

1682
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:47,010
of food input so it was turning it

1683
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:50,460
horrendously anaerobic and so you can

1684
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:52,500
see way down here this ciliate right

1685
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:56,399
here this is the anaerobic predator of

1686
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:57,840
bacteria and we have numbers that are

1687
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:00,469
more appropriate to the aerobic

1688
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:03,360
organisms and way down here we have

1689
01:15:00,469 --> 01:15:05,189
fungi numbers of the disease-causing on

1690
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:07,710
my seats these are water molds which are

1691
01:15:05,189 --> 01:15:09,960
responsible for PM are in the population

1692
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:11,789
values that are more appropriate for the

1693
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:15,270
ideal numbers and if you look way up

1694
01:15:11,789 --> 01:15:17,069
here if bacteria are the fertilizer bags

1695
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:19,139
in the soil and the fungi are the

1696
01:15:17,069 --> 01:15:19,920
fertilizer bags in the soil you know

1697
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:22,770
with significant

1698
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,779
less than 300 we only have 80 this is

1699
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:27,150
extremely dysfunctional nutrient storage

1700
01:15:24,779 --> 01:15:29,488
from a mathematical perspective and then

1701
01:15:27,149 --> 01:15:31,529
if you go to these two samples this came

1702
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:34,259
from a different farm that had two

1703
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:36,539
different locations on the property in

1704
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:38,699
this example the rest of mites

1705
01:15:36,539 --> 01:15:41,310
completely overtook the garden and we

1706
01:15:38,698 --> 01:15:42,899
had crop loss in this situation they

1707
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:45,000
were able to battle the rest at night

1708
01:15:42,899 --> 01:15:48,029
back and actually pull off a harvest and

1709
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,310
if you look down here at the anaerobic

1710
01:15:48,029 --> 01:15:54,979
fungi and the anaerobic predator

1711
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:58,140
bacteria we have obscenely high numbers

1712
01:15:54,979 --> 01:16:00,629
there's certain ratios the problems seem

1713
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:03,570
to pop up the oh my seats for example

1714
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:08,310
when this disease-causing fungi number

1715
01:16:03,569 --> 01:16:10,380
gets to or exceeds 25% of the good fungi

1716
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:12,390
we start to have mold and disease

1717
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:16,109
pressure pop up like clockwork you know

1718
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:18,810
and so you know this is these are

1719
01:16:16,109 --> 01:16:21,899
numbers that are known not known by many

1720
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:24,390
people I'm trying to do my best to be a

1721
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:28,710
communicator for the industry and the

1722
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:31,560
community about you know what these

1723
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:34,020
numbers mean and you know the biggest

1724
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:39,270
the biggest obstacle right now is people

1725
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:40,739
are failing to understand that you know

1726
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:42,510
this living soil is extremely dynamic

1727
01:16:40,738 --> 01:16:44,669
and if you're if you're brewing a

1728
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:47,610
compost tea you were spare about that

1729
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:49,890
you are creating life in a tank and the

1730
01:16:47,609 --> 01:16:51,960
temperature the water temperature your

1731
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:55,579
elevation all these things compound

1732
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:58,260
tremendously into the end result and

1733
01:16:55,579 --> 01:17:00,179
working at the commercial scale we've

1734
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:04,320
removed teas and that really blows

1735
01:17:00,179 --> 01:17:06,270
people's minds but what we found is the

1736
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:08,630
compost tea is far too far too dynamic

1737
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:12,989
for the commercial setting and it only

1738
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:14,909
antagonizes because you're growing

1739
01:17:12,988 --> 01:17:16,589
populations of organisms that might not

1740
01:17:14,909 --> 01:17:17,760
have anything to do with what's going on

1741
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:20,579
in the soil and people are actually

1742
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:23,699
perpetuating disease and if you go back

1743
01:17:20,579 --> 01:17:25,619
to the rest of my example here's five

1744
01:17:23,698 --> 01:17:27,329
samples from Russ at my Gardens where

1745
01:17:25,619 --> 01:17:28,948
they're all doing what they would

1746
01:17:27,329 --> 01:17:31,979
consider a fungally dominated compost

1747
01:17:28,948 --> 01:17:33,889
tea whatever that means it is fungally

1748
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:35,659
dominated it's dominated

1749
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:39,770
disease-causing fungi that's leading to

1750
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:44,149
rest at my pest pressure right and then

1751
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:46,130
at the commercial scale the biggest

1752
01:17:44,149 --> 01:17:50,029
obstacle is honestly a mindset change

1753
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:51,920
and trying to comprehend where these

1754
01:17:50,029 --> 01:17:55,519
organisms are and how these organisms

1755
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:57,590
are being distributed the most common

1756
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,930
thing we see whether it's a you know

1757
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:03,039
four by four tenth or it's a thirty five

1758
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:05,630
thousand square foot facility like GLP

1759
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:07,250
how are these organisms being spread

1760
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:10,760
across the property because they're not

1761
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:12,500
being spread across evenly just like the

1762
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:14,449
hot air in the greenhouse will separate

1763
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:16,399
or stratify in the hot air stays at the

1764
01:18:14,449 --> 01:18:18,949
top and then there's a defying layer and

1765
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:19,639
the cold air comes below organisms

1766
01:18:18,949 --> 01:18:22,519
stratifying

1767
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:24,110
in a compost tea tank and so nematodes

1768
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:26,420
have a density greater than water so

1769
01:18:24,109 --> 01:18:30,429
they sink immediately and our most

1770
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:33,140
common almost favorite thing to do is

1771
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:36,860
distribute nematodes unevenly so here is

1772
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:39,530
a this is a design to be a overhead view

1773
01:18:36,859 --> 01:18:42,979
of four groups of plants in any size

1774
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:45,429
greenhouse and you know so here's our

1775
01:18:42,979 --> 01:18:47,779
reservoir and every Monday morning

1776
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:51,800
employee goes to the whiteboard and they

1777
01:18:47,779 --> 01:18:53,359
see a gnat pressure in all Bay's do

1778
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:56,119
nematodes so they go to the refrigerator

1779
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:57,259
and they get nematodes and they put them

1780
01:18:56,119 --> 01:18:58,729
into the reservoir because that's what

1781
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:00,949
we like to do put everything in the res

1782
01:18:58,729 --> 01:19:03,019
and the nematodes sink to the bottom

1783
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:05,720
immediately because they have a density

1784
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:06,830
greater than water and then our

1785
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:08,690
reservoir you know our employee

1786
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:14,600
stretches out the hose to the longest

1787
01:19:08,689 --> 01:19:16,909
distance and you know the employee

1788
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,920
stretches out the hose all the way and

1789
01:19:16,909 --> 01:19:20,449
comes up way here and starts and the

1790
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,460
nematodes are at the bottom of the tank

1791
01:19:20,449 --> 01:19:24,679
and the hose is being drawn from the

1792
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:28,220
bottom of the tank so all the nematodes

1793
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:29,810
end up here and then they slowly make

1794
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,190
their way around and since the hose is

1795
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:36,740
all the ways stretched out well why

1796
01:19:31,189 --> 01:19:38,000
don't we take it to the other side this

1797
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:39,949
is the hardest whiteboarding I've ever

1798
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,779
done and so I think we stretch it out to

1799
01:19:39,949 --> 01:19:44,029
this side and then they either go to

1800
01:19:41,779 --> 01:19:45,889
here or they go to here whatever they do

1801
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:47,689
they do it the same every Monday and

1802
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:49,310
they do it same for every

1803
01:19:47,689 --> 01:19:51,919
in the building and so the patterns

1804
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:57,500
start to develop the same so if we were

1805
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:59,090
to count nematodes you know so if we

1806
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:01,760
were to count nematodes on a coverslip

1807
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:03,260
if anybody can do this you know so if we

1808
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,530
look at where they started first there

1809
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:08,480
might be 12 nematodes per slide up in

1810
01:20:06,529 --> 01:20:11,329
this space you got tremendous protection

1811
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:13,459
of this ecosystem with predator

1812
01:20:11,329 --> 01:20:15,948
nematodes and then we come over here and

1813
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:17,630
you know five and four would be adequate

1814
01:20:15,948 --> 01:20:19,399
for the commercial but we have a

1815
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:21,020
situation where this group of plants

1816
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:24,109
didn't get any because they all got

1817
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:26,090
distributed across the other ecosystems

1818
01:20:24,109 --> 01:20:27,738
and then we move into Bay two and we

1819
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:29,600
repeat this formula and we move into Bay

1820
01:20:27,738 --> 01:20:30,979
three we report this process we move

1821
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:35,660
into Bay four and we repeat this process

1822
01:20:30,979 --> 01:20:38,299
and you know we have you know by a

1823
01:20:35,659 --> 01:20:41,180
percentage of square footage we have 25%

1824
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:44,000
of our bay with zero protection of

1825
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:46,340
predatory nematodes doing anything to

1826
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,560
protect you and then you know this

1827
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:50,090
example that I'm speaking of was you

1828
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:53,330
know four or five four or five

1829
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:57,230
thousand-square-foot Bay's so 25% of all

1830
01:20:53,329 --> 01:20:59,630
Bay's has zero protection from larvae of

1831
01:20:57,229 --> 01:21:02,679
pests through the form of predator

1832
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:05,090
nematodes and just the simple act of

1833
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:07,430
changing the way in which we distribute

1834
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:08,900
these nematodes you know instead of

1835
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:10,750
putting them into a thousand gallon

1836
01:21:08,899 --> 01:21:12,829
reservoir put them into an 8-ounce

1837
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:15,710
scientific wash bottle a little squirt

1838
01:21:12,829 --> 01:21:16,880
bottle you know there can be hundreds

1839
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:18,710
and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

1840
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,090
and hundreds of nematodes in a single

1841
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:23,480
drop from an eyedropper

1842
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:25,010
you know we we send people nematodes and

1843
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:26,569
avow and just have them go around with a

1844
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:30,469
dropper because really all you need to

1845
01:21:26,569 --> 01:21:34,698
do to distribute them evenly and so good

1846
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:38,560
I was just gonna come in and saying that

1847
01:21:34,698 --> 01:21:41,089
you know it's Muses if that if we add

1848
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,190
nutrients to the soil then we just allow

1849
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:45,860
the soil to do our brewing rather than

1850
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:49,250
creating a separate Brewer of different

1851
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:51,589
microorganisms so maybe what is your

1852
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:54,170
take on brewing nutrients rather than

1853
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:56,179
brewing a you know microbiology if we're

1854
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:59,989
allowing the soil to do the microbiology

1855
01:21:56,179 --> 01:22:00,940
what about giving the the microbiology

1856
01:21:59,988 --> 01:22:02,889
in the soil

1857
01:22:00,939 --> 01:22:05,829
nutrients through some type of brewing

1858
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:10,449
or maybe assistance quick team steeping

1859
01:22:05,829 --> 01:22:13,119
of materials yeah so so there's compost

1860
01:22:10,448 --> 01:22:14,859
tea which you put compost into a a water

1861
01:22:13,119 --> 01:22:17,198
tank and you aerate it for a specified

1862
01:22:14,859 --> 01:22:19,479
amount of time and you add food hamlets

1863
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:20,829
we would call that a compost tea there's

1864
01:22:19,479 --> 01:22:23,799
another technique called a compost

1865
01:22:20,829 --> 01:22:26,198
extract which is simply just dislodging

1866
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:28,600
organisms from the surface of the

1867
01:22:26,198 --> 01:22:30,579
compost into the water the caveat to

1868
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:32,440
that concept is you need compost with

1869
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:34,689
actual organisms to dislodge into the

1870
01:22:32,439 --> 01:22:37,059
water and that's the that's the most

1871
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:39,069
difficult aspect it's really difficult

1872
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:43,360
to get organisms to survive the process

1873
01:22:39,069 --> 01:22:46,719
that is composting yard to a bag to your

1874
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:48,670
property you know Malibu's was the first

1875
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:50,260
brand that I saw real fungi in that I

1876
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:52,600
could buy from the store so that was

1877
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:54,699
really exciting way back in the day so

1878
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:56,050
they're able to get actual beneficial

1879
01:22:54,698 --> 01:23:00,460
fungi all the way through the process

1880
01:22:56,050 --> 01:23:02,980
was extremely important but we you know

1881
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:05,079
we actually make thermal compost to the

1882
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:07,119
style of Elaine's to get certain

1883
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:10,000
populations and ratio of our organisms

1884
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:12,219
when you have compost that has adequate

1885
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:15,819
populations to do this technique you can

1886
01:23:12,219 --> 01:23:18,399
just very low-tech dislodge them into

1887
01:23:15,819 --> 01:23:20,710
the water the benefit to that is your

1888
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:22,929
dislodging the organisms into the water

1889
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:25,390
and then the organisms will penetrate as

1890
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:27,280
deep as the water does when we brew a

1891
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:29,469
compost tea and we apply it to the soil

1892
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:31,869
surface these organisms are producing

1893
01:23:29,469 --> 01:23:34,029
blues and they attach to the organic

1894
01:23:31,869 --> 01:23:35,909
matter at the very top surface and they

1895
01:23:34,029 --> 01:23:38,259
never come into contact with the roots

1896
01:23:35,909 --> 01:23:40,479
what ends up happening with an extract

1897
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:42,460
is you get the organisms from the

1898
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:44,859
compost which is the transport mechanism

1899
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:47,948
to your plant you dislodge them into

1900
01:23:44,859 --> 01:23:49,929
water and without exciting them with

1901
01:23:47,948 --> 01:23:52,029
aeration of foods you can get them to

1902
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:53,770
penetrate the entire soil profile come

1903
01:23:52,029 --> 01:23:55,269
into contact with the roots and then the

1904
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:57,610
plant starts to take over and do the

1905
01:23:55,270 --> 01:24:00,190
brewing the biggest obstacle of tea

1906
01:23:57,609 --> 01:24:02,380
brewing is how do the conditions in your

1907
01:24:00,189 --> 01:24:04,779
tea brew have anything to do with the

1908
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:08,199
conditions in your soil and your growing

1909
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:09,939
life in a tank that has a certain

1910
01:24:08,198 --> 01:24:11,769
temperature a certain set of conditions

1911
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:13,539
and then you move it into a soil that

1912
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:15,159
has significantly different conditions

1913
01:24:13,539 --> 01:24:17,769
one of the biggest down

1914
01:24:15,158 --> 01:24:21,578
sides the tea brewing is your selecting

1915
01:24:17,769 --> 01:24:25,090
for organisms that enjoy or can at least

1916
01:24:21,578 --> 01:24:26,529
tolerate a water environment you know

1917
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:28,719
mathematically you end up with a lot of

1918
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:30,849
water molds by definition and which are

1919
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:33,090
these on my seats and so the repetitive

1920
01:24:30,849 --> 01:24:37,469
fungal dominant brewing techniques

1921
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:40,418
perpetuates these on my seats right here

1922
01:24:37,469 --> 01:24:42,158
perpetuates the water molds they get

1923
01:24:40,418 --> 01:24:43,840
lined in all the tubes and hoses and and

1924
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:46,868
so I think we've kind of come to the

1925
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:48,909
same concept of you guys have and you

1926
01:24:46,868 --> 01:24:51,130
mentioned that the Emerald cup that you

1927
01:24:48,908 --> 01:24:53,259
stopped the thermal composting you just

1928
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:55,889
put the material into the beds and we

1929
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:58,179
let nature handle the composting and

1930
01:24:55,889 --> 01:25:01,689
we're kind of turning our beds into the

1931
01:24:58,179 --> 01:25:03,788
compost pile and I guess it seems to be

1932
01:25:01,689 --> 01:25:05,559
working out and Jeff I wanted to we

1933
01:25:03,788 --> 01:25:07,899
wanted to go on to you and appreciate

1934
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:09,699
your information Scott thank you Scott

1935
01:25:07,899 --> 01:25:11,589
everything that you're doing is really

1936
01:25:09,698 --> 01:25:13,688
bringing so much light and another side

1937
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:16,239
to the whole thing it's really creating

1938
01:25:13,689 --> 01:25:18,010
a holistic picture with a w we really

1939
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:19,688
appreciate you know everything that

1940
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:22,689
you're doing for the whole community

1941
01:25:19,689 --> 01:25:25,989
your work is enough we're gonna be doing

1942
01:25:22,689 --> 01:25:27,939
a workshop on January 26th to 29th up in

1943
01:25:25,988 --> 01:25:31,118
Portland Oregon the website is

1944
01:25:27,939 --> 01:25:33,809
regenerative organic cannabis calm or

1945
01:25:31,118 --> 01:25:36,429
you can check into Dutch blooms on

1946
01:25:33,809 --> 01:25:38,559
Instagram we're going to talk about this

1947
01:25:36,429 --> 01:25:41,529
for several hours and get deep into the

1948
01:25:38,559 --> 01:25:43,119
nitty-gritty of it and it's too much to

1949
01:25:41,529 --> 01:25:46,238
really crammed into twenty minutes you

1950
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:48,279
know I want to actually thank Dutch

1951
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:49,988
blooms as well because he was kind at

1952
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:52,478
the beginning of the inspiration of

1953
01:25:49,988 --> 01:25:54,759
putting a panel together like this it

1954
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:57,010
was and I ended up contacting dragonfly

1955
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:58,748
earth medicine and they were the ones

1956
01:25:57,010 --> 01:26:01,860
that put it together but prior to that I

1957
01:25:58,748 --> 01:26:04,510
was talking to Dutch blooms based on the

1958
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:06,488
panel or the conference that you're

1959
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:07,900
talking about there because I saw it and

1960
01:26:06,488 --> 01:26:10,629
I was like oh I'd love to do a show on

1961
01:26:07,899 --> 01:26:12,188
that that would be really great so yeah

1962
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:13,779
I don't wanna miss you're gonna be at

1963
01:26:12,189 --> 01:26:15,579
that show a lot of us that are here on

1964
01:26:13,779 --> 01:26:18,340
this panel are gonna be at that show so

1965
01:26:15,578 --> 01:26:21,130
it'll be really a chance to continue to

1966
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:23,498
go deeper yeah so Jeff I wanted to bring

1967
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:25,208
you into the conversation and just sort

1968
01:26:23,498 --> 01:26:27,729
of we're talking about scientific

1969
01:26:25,208 --> 01:26:31,420
studies you know that Scotto is having

1970
01:26:27,729 --> 01:26:33,519
and how is this specific to cannabis and

1971
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:35,619
we're talking about you know bringing up

1972
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:38,470
our fungi rates is equal to our

1973
01:26:35,619 --> 01:26:40,930
bacterial rates how can we do that in

1974
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:45,550
our soil in a way that is good for

1975
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:47,350
cannabis cultivation well first of all I

1976
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:50,949
want to I want to say that I think what

1977
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:54,070
Scott has done is is important for the

1978
01:26:50,949 --> 01:26:57,069
listener to distinguish the things that

1979
01:26:54,069 --> 01:27:01,119
a lot of the individual growers will do

1980
01:26:57,069 --> 01:27:04,329
in their homes don't scale up to a

1981
01:27:01,119 --> 01:27:05,529
commercial grow and you know I guess you

1982
01:27:04,329 --> 01:27:07,180
got to decide maybe not just a

1983
01:27:05,529 --> 01:27:10,359
commercial grower but to a large group

1984
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:11,409
so people as the laws change and you

1985
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:13,449
know you're coming out in the closet

1986
01:27:11,409 --> 01:27:14,559
where you're going one plant and all of

1987
01:27:13,449 --> 01:27:17,529
a sudden you've got a big greenhouse

1988
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:19,900
you've got to start thinking you know a

1989
01:27:17,529 --> 01:27:21,488
little a little not a little but you

1990
01:27:19,899 --> 01:27:23,139
gotta start thinking quite a lot

1991
01:27:21,488 --> 01:27:26,979
differently and I think I think Scott's

1992
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:29,110
you've really demonstrated that I mean

1993
01:27:26,979 --> 01:27:30,759
compost he you know in my little

1994
01:27:29,109 --> 01:27:33,960
greenhouse but I have one or two plants

1995
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:37,270
works great you know what I advise my

1996
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:38,949
you know my local growers got a 25,000

1997
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:40,180
square foot greenhouse to do compost tea

1998
01:27:38,949 --> 01:27:41,949
absolutely not

1999
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:43,690
so yeah I mean I think it's all

2000
01:27:41,949 --> 01:27:47,079
fascinating stuff and I think the more

2001
01:27:43,689 --> 01:27:49,899
information we get the more we're gonna

2002
01:27:47,079 --> 01:27:51,309
be able to determine what our plants

2003
01:27:49,899 --> 01:27:53,349
need when they need it

2004
01:27:51,310 --> 01:27:56,200
so we'll be acting less with an

2005
01:27:53,350 --> 01:28:02,289
intuition and a lot more with regard to

2006
01:27:56,199 --> 01:28:04,029
science so again I think Scott really

2007
01:28:02,289 --> 01:28:06,039
got to be congratulated and I think this

2008
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:08,289
thing that's gonna happen you know the

2009
01:28:06,039 --> 01:28:10,630
26th 27th 20 it's gonna be fascinating

2010
01:28:08,289 --> 01:28:11,890
and I hope it's going to be taped so

2011
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:13,720
that so it's gonna be available to

2012
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:15,340
people because I think it's the panel's

2013
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:18,960
look pretty darn good other speakers

2014
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:18,960
look pretty darn good but but anyway

2015
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:30,610
exactly what your question is well you

2016
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:32,199
know how we can you know add to our

2017
01:28:30,609 --> 01:28:34,089
soils you know what it's going to take

2018
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:38,880
to create those numbers or if you have

2019
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:38,880
any you know ideas on that sure well

2020
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:44,889
weather

2021
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:46,599
is a small home grower or you know a big

2022
01:28:44,889 --> 01:28:48,400
commercial grower but but obviously we

2023
01:28:46,599 --> 01:28:50,409
want to be as regenitive as possible and

2024
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:53,348
and and we want to we want to comply

2025
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:55,179
with what I consider to be you know the

2026
01:28:53,349 --> 01:28:58,300
the key rule and that's the rule of

2027
01:28:55,179 --> 01:29:02,699
return or the law of return which is one

2028
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:05,590
of the key laws of nutrient feeding

2029
01:29:02,698 --> 01:29:07,839
plants what falls down from a planet

2030
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:10,239
generally is enough to feed that plant

2031
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:12,099
and so when the redwoods grow they never

2032
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:14,408
need to be fertilized because they're

2033
01:29:12,099 --> 01:29:16,779
feeding themselves they're returning to

2034
01:29:14,408 --> 01:29:18,819
the soil through the loss of the needles

2035
01:29:16,779 --> 01:29:20,769
you know embark dead trees and

2036
01:29:18,819 --> 01:29:22,029
everything else all the good nutrients

2037
01:29:20,770 --> 01:29:24,280
that they've taken out of the soil and

2038
01:29:22,029 --> 01:29:26,769
so in theory there's a balance we come

2039
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:30,639
along as cannabis growers and of course

2040
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:33,760
we violate that law of return we break

2041
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:35,949
the law of return and so we've got to be

2042
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:39,520
able to put back into the soils the

2043
01:29:35,948 --> 01:29:41,848
kinds of stuff that that are gonna that

2044
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:46,060
are going to take the place of what

2045
01:29:41,849 --> 01:29:47,440
we're taking out of the soil I'm always

2046
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:48,880
interested when I hear somebody and I

2047
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:50,698
think Scott maybe you were one of the

2048
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:54,279
ones who said that I think it was you

2049
01:29:50,698 --> 01:29:56,379
you know people who reuse their soil in

2050
01:29:54,279 --> 01:29:58,359
their cannabis grow so many people just

2051
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:59,920
throw their soil out which to me he just

2052
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:01,569
tells me that they don't understand

2053
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,710
their soil and they don't understand

2054
01:30:01,569 --> 01:30:04,238
testing this soil and they don't

2055
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:07,810
understand adding and building the soil

2056
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:10,149
and and and and and creating a living

2057
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:11,800
organism which they don't need to throw

2058
01:30:10,149 --> 01:30:13,448
out but which thrives on which they can

2059
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,760
add to them which gets better even as

2060
01:30:13,448 --> 01:30:18,460
you grow more and more stuff so in order

2061
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:20,739
to get the the kind of soil that I would

2062
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:26,380
want to get you know you've got to have

2063
01:30:20,738 --> 01:30:28,149
you got to have two things one is access

2064
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:32,170
to testing obviously and I would do a

2065
01:30:28,149 --> 01:30:33,429
soil food web test but again I don't

2066
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:37,170
know Scott are you doing your own

2067
01:30:33,429 --> 01:30:42,279
testing now is your test commercial

2068
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:46,000
crash the soil it is so sorry

2069
01:30:42,279 --> 01:30:47,590
yeah we yeah we we just do kind of the

2070
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,050
opposite of advertising and marketing

2071
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:53,969
we've really tried to be way below the

2072
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:57,610
radar and be quiet about what we eat

2073
01:30:53,969 --> 01:30:58,929
well yeah I mean just there's a lot of

2074
01:30:57,609 --> 01:31:00,368
noise out there so I didn't want to

2075
01:30:58,929 --> 01:31:07,569
contribute to the noise I just wanted to

2076
01:31:00,368 --> 01:31:09,939
contribute with results and so yeah I

2077
01:31:07,569 --> 01:31:14,889
think if people can prepare their test

2078
01:31:09,939 --> 01:31:17,109
to yours yeah one thing I'd like to add

2079
01:31:14,889 --> 01:31:19,480
is when we start talking about scaling

2080
01:31:17,109 --> 01:31:21,908
we start talking you know are we scaling

2081
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:23,799
indoors are we scaling in a field or are

2082
01:31:21,908 --> 01:31:25,960
we scaling in a greenhouse and really it

2083
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:27,940
is kind of a different setup when you

2084
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:29,469
have the dynamics of earth and you have

2085
01:31:27,939 --> 01:31:30,879
the dot or you have the dynamics of

2086
01:31:29,469 --> 01:31:32,829
greenhouse which is sort of like an

2087
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,829
enclosed setting and then you have the

2088
01:31:32,829 --> 01:31:38,649
dynamics of indoors and we're looking at

2089
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:41,319
indoor soil building as you know what

2090
01:31:38,649 --> 01:31:43,149
about adding a little bit of hay or

2091
01:31:41,319 --> 01:31:46,118
little bits of carbon or even little

2092
01:31:43,149 --> 01:31:49,238
bits of sawdust in small ratios to be

2093
01:31:46,118 --> 01:31:50,829
able to sustain that carbon life over

2094
01:31:49,238 --> 01:31:54,549
the turn and that's almost like bringing

2095
01:31:50,829 --> 01:31:56,948
that the the wood and like an outdoors

2096
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:58,630
there's you know so much more use of

2097
01:31:56,948 --> 01:32:00,729
wood and so much more use of wood chips

2098
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:02,819
to bring in that kind of fungal

2099
01:32:00,729 --> 01:32:05,888
dominance into our soil in order to

2100
01:32:02,819 --> 01:32:07,988
retain them more organisms once they

2101
01:32:05,889 --> 01:32:10,029
grow and also to create the life because

2102
01:32:07,988 --> 01:32:11,979
like Scott was saying we bring in

2103
01:32:10,029 --> 01:32:14,279
compost tea and we add it to the soil

2104
01:32:11,979 --> 01:32:18,399
well if there's not enough biomass or

2105
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:20,139
carbon or organic matter in the soil and

2106
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:22,750
there's nothing for it to grow on and it

2107
01:32:20,139 --> 01:32:24,609
can't stay living and I think another

2108
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:26,469
thing that I wanted to add of what Josh

2109
01:32:24,609 --> 01:32:28,389
was saying is just looking at an you

2110
01:32:26,469 --> 01:32:30,100
know on a more human level because I

2111
01:32:28,389 --> 01:32:32,409
always seem to bring it back to that is

2112
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:35,289
that you know people like us who have

2113
01:32:32,408 --> 01:32:38,289
these really long you know 12-year beds

2114
01:32:35,289 --> 01:32:40,899
that go on and on I call that a gut of

2115
01:32:38,289 --> 01:32:42,719
Steel in the same way that we call a gut

2116
01:32:40,899 --> 01:32:45,609
of Steel of someone who has really good

2117
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:48,010
microbiology in their in their belly

2118
01:32:45,609 --> 01:32:50,979
there's a lot more things that you can

2119
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:53,619
throw at long-term soils because they

2120
01:32:50,979 --> 01:32:56,138
have the natural defenses to be able to

2121
01:32:53,618 --> 01:32:58,029
create a good soil it has a memory of a

2122
01:32:56,139 --> 01:32:59,829
good soil and when we're talking about

2123
01:32:58,029 --> 01:33:02,500
indoor soils we're talking about a

2124
01:32:59,829 --> 01:33:04,420
really sensitive gut a gut that you know

2125
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:06,880
is more difficult and things that you

2126
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:10,029
throw at it we have to be very careful

2127
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:11,829
um so I just think that that's an

2128
01:33:10,029 --> 01:33:13,960
important part of what we're talking

2129
01:33:11,829 --> 01:33:15,969
about as well well I think it is but I

2130
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,399
think again soil is soil and if you're

2131
01:33:15,969 --> 01:33:20,679
gonna make good I mean the microbes the

2132
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:22,509
microbes that you want to grow or the

2133
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:24,460
microbes that the plant needs and they

2134
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:27,539
don't you know whether you're indoors or

2135
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:30,639
outdoors they're pretty much the same

2136
01:33:27,539 --> 01:33:32,289
although so I think it's maybe just more

2137
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:35,679
of a question of how you do it your

2138
01:33:32,289 --> 01:33:37,029
cleanliness and and again thinking it

2139
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:39,819
through so that you don't put your

2140
01:33:37,029 --> 01:33:41,170
nematodes on one end of the field you

2141
01:33:39,819 --> 01:33:42,789
know and forget that you got the other

2142
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:45,489
end it's not getting any misstep but I

2143
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:47,289
always multiply plants I'm always

2144
01:33:45,488 --> 01:33:49,718
surprised when I walk into a grow and I

2145
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:52,569
find plants indoor or outdoor that for

2146
01:33:49,719 --> 01:33:55,079
mulch I just I just think it's

2147
01:33:52,569 --> 01:33:58,000
incredibly important again because we

2148
01:33:55,079 --> 01:33:59,439
we're designing a system where we know

2149
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,649
we're going to break the law of return

2150
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:04,960
we've got to add in any compost tea

2151
01:34:02,649 --> 01:34:06,879
alone is not enough if you're using a

2152
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:11,649
big gigantic grow it's not advisable

2153
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:13,869
I don't think and so so mulches tend to

2154
01:34:11,649 --> 01:34:17,649
be a terrific addition and I add a

2155
01:34:13,869 --> 01:34:19,179
compost layer when I may add micros and

2156
01:34:17,649 --> 01:34:21,339
I think that's always very important as

2157
01:34:19,179 --> 01:34:24,520
well and a cover crop I think is is the

2158
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:26,409
third thing all of these things you know

2159
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:28,690
the cover crop in particular because the

2160
01:34:26,408 --> 01:34:31,299
cover crop you don't break the log

2161
01:34:28,689 --> 01:34:33,250
returned it does go back into the soil

2162
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:34,869
it is refeeding and regenerating and

2163
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,369
adding that carbon and the nitrogen and

2164
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:39,698
the right Nick and the right ratio so

2165
01:34:36,369 --> 01:34:41,710
yeah I mean I bare soil is the big bad

2166
01:34:39,698 --> 01:34:43,689
thing let's start right there it really

2167
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:45,730
is in the cover cropping a lot of people

2168
01:34:43,689 --> 01:34:47,710
I think laughs it's it too long and they

2169
01:34:45,729 --> 01:34:49,899
and they let it kind of grip into the

2170
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:51,520
soil and then it can become antagonistic

2171
01:34:49,899 --> 01:34:53,289
it can be part become part of the

2172
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:56,050
pathogen too and I really feel you need

2173
01:34:53,289 --> 01:34:58,179
to keep the cover crops green and and

2174
01:34:56,050 --> 01:35:01,449
full of life and utilize its green

2175
01:34:58,179 --> 01:35:03,819
manure aspect of it and you know that's

2176
01:35:01,448 --> 01:35:04,899
a that's a way to keep it healthy in

2177
01:35:03,819 --> 01:35:07,389
there and you don't want to have

2178
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:09,129
anything stagnating in there and you

2179
01:35:07,389 --> 01:35:11,440
know what the peas growing up your

2180
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:13,239
plants well you know maybe there's a

2181
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:15,158
food forest setting where that makes

2182
01:35:13,238 --> 01:35:16,869
sense outdoors but I definitely don't

2183
01:35:15,158 --> 01:35:20,189
think you want that doing happening

2184
01:35:16,869 --> 01:35:23,880
indoors i I see that Jesse's in here

2185
01:35:20,189 --> 01:35:26,279
from the regenerative cannabis farm

2186
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:28,260
award and bio vortex and he does a lot

2187
01:35:26,279 --> 01:35:31,409
of beautiful things for the industry we

2188
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:33,750
want to we want to you know recognize

2189
01:35:31,409 --> 01:35:35,369
you appreciate you for a second I was

2190
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:37,050
just thinking maybe really quickly we

2191
01:35:35,369 --> 01:35:38,909
would just go to Steve and and just

2192
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:40,230
because we were just talking about with

2193
01:35:38,909 --> 01:35:43,559
Scott and stuff then we would just

2194
01:35:40,229 --> 01:35:45,209
finish off that kind of a what a little

2195
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:47,160
bit about his journey with his endure

2196
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:48,930
sales and then I think we can explore

2197
01:35:47,159 --> 01:35:50,970
our outdoor soils and stuff does that

2198
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:52,700
sound good yes you can say hi and

2199
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:56,750
everyone everything to everyone

2200
01:35:52,699 --> 01:35:56,750
hi everyone yeah that sounds great

2201
01:35:57,050 --> 01:36:00,960
excellent thank you we love and

2202
01:35:58,859 --> 01:36:02,909
appreciate you yeah hey Steve can you

2203
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:05,640
tell us a little bit about some of your

2204
01:36:02,909 --> 01:36:07,109
original soils what how you started

2205
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:11,630
maybe a little bit about your lighting

2206
01:36:07,109 --> 01:36:15,089
and and what you're doing currently uh

2207
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:17,430
yeah so you know I got in a no-till

2208
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:19,079
probably closed about five years ago we

2209
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:19,909
got our first commercial grow out in the

2210
01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:23,609
prompt ivenna

2211
01:36:19,909 --> 01:36:26,519
going about three years ago and then you

2212
01:36:23,609 --> 01:36:28,380
leave we've learned so much everything

2213
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:31,020
you could possibly do wrong we've done

2214
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:32,909
at some point and we've learned to value

2215
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:35,730
it because that's all you can do is just

2216
01:36:32,909 --> 01:36:37,109
kind of learn from your lessons a lot of

2217
01:36:35,729 --> 01:36:38,819
the things I was talking about we've

2218
01:36:37,109 --> 01:36:41,449
learned firsthand as far as equal

2219
01:36:38,819 --> 01:36:45,329
distribution flat bottom tea Brewers

2220
01:36:41,449 --> 01:36:46,529
just cleanliness that the industry in

2221
01:36:45,329 --> 01:36:48,329
general that a lot of people complain

2222
01:36:46,529 --> 01:36:49,979
about regulations we've actually used to

2223
01:36:48,329 --> 01:36:54,059
our benefit to help us you know become

2224
01:36:49,979 --> 01:36:57,839
better growers you know in our original

2225
01:36:54,060 --> 01:37:01,950
facility Pro we have three rooms we were

2226
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:05,069
on a ten cycle now and the benefit of

2227
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:07,769
being indoors is is is in three years we

2228
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:09,659
pulled off ten cycles and it was times

2229
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:12,390
three that's that's thirty years worth

2230
01:37:09,659 --> 01:37:14,699
of of a data that we've been able to

2231
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:18,990
take and actually and play with and

2232
01:37:14,699 --> 01:37:20,699
actually analyze and in our large scale

2233
01:37:18,989 --> 01:37:24,179
no less so it's not like we're talking

2234
01:37:20,699 --> 01:37:27,329
you know 10 plants we're talking 500

2235
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:30,869
plants a room and we turn them every

2236
01:37:27,329 --> 01:37:32,210
single month and one of the things that

2237
01:37:30,869 --> 01:37:34,769
we've learned over time is just

2238
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:36,060
basically simplifying it and not trying

2239
01:37:34,770 --> 01:37:40,710
to over complicate things it's really

2240
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:42,150
key don't try to reinvent the wheel God

2241
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:43,350
mother nature whatever you want to call

2242
01:37:42,149 --> 01:37:45,719
it is there he done it is there he

2243
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:47,640
learned it has already taught us it all

2244
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:50,490
you guys basically do is just trying to

2245
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:52,740
learn from that the arrogance of man is

2246
01:37:50,489 --> 01:37:55,529
kind of try to do everything better do

2247
01:37:52,739 --> 01:37:58,079
everything faster but there's a time for

2248
01:37:55,529 --> 01:38:00,179
every purpose so you basically follow

2249
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:02,569
that kind of that methodology and

2250
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:02,570
basically

2251
01:38:03,288 --> 01:38:07,788
the plant but no I don't believe

2252
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:11,328
anybody's properly cultivating soil we

2253
01:38:07,788 --> 01:38:13,189
all know the the the ways that shortcuts

2254
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:16,219
and cultivate this plant to make it

2255
01:38:13,189 --> 01:38:17,868
profitable to our needs but none of us

2256
01:38:16,219 --> 01:38:20,059
actually take the time to cultivate the

2257
01:38:17,868 --> 01:38:21,439
soil to do the job it needs to be able

2258
01:38:20,059 --> 01:38:24,139
to reproduce everybody is constantly

2259
01:38:21,439 --> 01:38:27,038
inoculating an ovulating you know I

2260
01:38:24,139 --> 01:38:31,489
believe inoculants are like the new

2261
01:38:27,038 --> 01:38:32,868
bloom boosters there's a new NPK in the

2262
01:38:31,488 --> 01:38:34,129
day if you're working with the living

2263
01:38:32,868 --> 01:38:35,779
soil you shouldn't need so many

2264
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:37,760
inoculants these she doesn't feel it not

2265
01:38:35,779 --> 01:38:40,069
clean it a lot a lot less and actually

2266
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:41,750
people let the soil do its job and do

2267
01:38:40,069 --> 01:38:43,399
its full cycle

2268
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:46,670
so anyways I'm getting little bit off

2269
01:38:43,399 --> 01:38:48,198
track but for the most part we've

2270
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:50,149
learned a lot we started off with the

2271
01:38:48,198 --> 01:38:52,939
the basic no-till mix that there's so

2272
01:38:50,149 --> 01:38:56,388
many people are familiar with a lot of

2273
01:38:52,939 --> 01:38:58,308
heading mean and we ran to probably run

2274
01:38:56,389 --> 01:39:00,859
into things as far as contaminated

2275
01:38:58,309 --> 01:39:03,760
inputs on commitment testing on your

2276
01:39:00,859 --> 01:39:07,788
soil not only your plants not only doing

2277
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:09,619
a biology test but your NPK tests but

2278
01:39:07,788 --> 01:39:11,779
also testing your inputs you know you

2279
01:39:09,618 --> 01:39:14,089
bring in a dirty dirty input full of

2280
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:16,368
e.coli you spread that across your

2281
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:19,429
garden even thing you're not you're

2282
01:39:16,368 --> 01:39:22,429
gonna have issues so I think knowing

2283
01:39:19,429 --> 01:39:23,840
what inputs to introduce what inputs you

2284
01:39:22,429 --> 01:39:29,538
you should probably just better stay

2285
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:31,849
away from is gonna be key but also again

2286
01:39:29,538 --> 01:39:33,229
just uh just simplifying it so everybody

2287
01:39:31,849 --> 01:39:35,110
could do it don't try to recreate the

2288
01:39:33,229 --> 01:39:39,109
wheel don't try to go above and beyond

2289
01:39:35,109 --> 01:39:41,420
we do we move away from T's T's in

2290
01:39:39,109 --> 01:39:45,679
general for the most part we used to the

2291
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:46,969
extracts things like that but our first

2292
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:49,670
facility again we started off with a

2293
01:39:46,969 --> 01:39:52,480
basic mix la même our new facility we

2294
01:39:49,670 --> 01:39:55,609
just took over $35 per facility it was a

2295
01:39:52,479 --> 01:39:58,069
hydroponic facility they ran in current

2296
01:39:55,609 --> 01:40:01,009
culture on hydroponic systems belleville

2297
01:39:58,069 --> 01:40:03,828
ended bulbs it was a real race car of a

2298
01:40:01,010 --> 01:40:06,079
facility if you will we moved in and

2299
01:40:03,828 --> 01:40:08,929
gutted the entire thing and we brought

2300
01:40:06,078 --> 01:40:10,578
in living soil honestly kind of and the

2301
01:40:08,929 --> 01:40:12,109
investors eyes went backwards they had

2302
01:40:10,578 --> 01:40:15,018
this trick race car and we brought in a

2303
01:40:12,109 --> 01:40:16,349
bunch of dirt but we've been extremely

2304
01:40:15,019 --> 01:40:20,280
successful

2305
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:26,640
I'm successful with that

2306
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:27,630
I said that's funny yeah but and we're

2307
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:29,250
working through it you know we're trying

2308
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:31,380
to as the edge we show me where ask me

2309
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:32,640
it kind of got to earn our keep a little

2310
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,260
bit I can't just walk in and stomp our

2311
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:36,990
feet so we're kind of showing were worth

2312
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:39,449
and what we can do I had to do it right

2313
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:41,699
slowly but surely we're making changes

2314
01:40:39,449 --> 01:40:43,319
my new are new soil recipe will be

2315
01:40:41,699 --> 01:40:45,119
completely removed away from me so

2316
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:49,289
there's actually three hundred yards

2317
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:49,739
zero mean we did use peat I apologize

2318
01:40:49,289 --> 01:40:50,939
for that

2319
01:40:49,739 --> 01:40:52,349
kind of starting to trying to move away

2320
01:40:50,939 --> 01:40:54,269
from that and try to find better more

2321
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:57,900
renewable sources I'm kind of filled

2322
01:40:54,270 --> 01:41:00,780
that void but we go to the hydro system

2323
01:40:57,899 --> 01:41:02,909
I'm not really using living soil we

2324
01:41:00,779 --> 01:41:04,529
created a new type of bed on that we

2325
01:41:02,909 --> 01:41:07,289
believe is better for living soil I'm

2326
01:41:04,529 --> 01:41:09,090
never seeing promising results from it

2327
01:41:07,289 --> 01:41:12,149
kind of solves all the issues that we

2328
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:14,190
were having on a commercial scale but

2329
01:41:12,149 --> 01:41:19,409
for the most part our challenges turned

2330
01:41:14,189 --> 01:41:21,899
again make it a more when the

2331
01:41:19,409 --> 01:41:24,329
hardest-hit network like what does your

2332
01:41:21,899 --> 01:41:28,019
new business what does the new bed like

2333
01:41:24,329 --> 01:41:29,369
look like compared to the other one so

2334
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:32,160
what we learned in our old facility at

2335
01:41:29,369 --> 01:41:33,630
GOP and inspect really in the last year

2336
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:36,960
as we've been working more soil food web

2337
01:41:33,630 --> 01:41:39,750
unless more feeding the soil then versus

2338
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,670
bypassing it and feeding the plant as

2339
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:44,130
our multiple layers really come to life

2340
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:46,649
what we've learned is that our mulch

2341
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:48,690
layer will hold more moisture than the

2342
01:41:46,649 --> 01:41:50,429
fabric beds especially if they're

2343
01:41:48,689 --> 01:41:53,039
sitting on like the grade or like the

2344
01:41:50,430 --> 01:41:55,560
bottom that will allow air to get to it

2345
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:59,069
and then what happens is is your soil

2346
01:41:55,560 --> 01:42:02,100
will actually dry from the bottom up and

2347
01:41:59,069 --> 01:42:05,189
it's kind of it creates a whole number

2348
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:08,870
of problems in our situation it was

2349
01:42:05,189 --> 01:42:08,869
creating a bubble actually do a really

2350
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:17,000
sounds like yeah you're sound just cut

2351
01:42:14,539 --> 01:42:20,899
out for some reason Steve I'm not sure

2352
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:22,550
why his mom microphone looks muted okay

2353
01:42:20,899 --> 01:42:26,869
something happened to your microphone

2354
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:28,579
there he goes yep all right cool I don't

2355
01:42:26,869 --> 01:42:30,019
have a whiteboard like Scott if I did

2356
01:42:28,579 --> 01:42:31,789
draw a little demonstration of our

2357
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:36,350
problem I knew I was on the ask this

2358
01:42:31,789 --> 01:42:39,289
question at some point so here you have

2359
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:41,960
your basic bed and what happened is is

2360
01:42:39,289 --> 01:42:43,489
if you can see we would have air that

2361
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:45,439
would come from the bottom and the sides

2362
01:42:43,489 --> 01:42:47,300
and it would create a bubble and it

2363
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:50,119
would limit our soil volume and our

2364
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:52,520
actual biology our soil food web if you

2365
01:42:50,119 --> 01:42:54,800
will you lower our root space our root

2366
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:56,480
the ability for our roots to actually

2367
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:59,390
chase water the volume herbs can

2368
01:42:56,479 --> 01:43:01,009
actually fill and in and what happened

2369
01:42:59,390 --> 01:43:02,810
was is we would actually try to push

2370
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:04,940
down on this bubble and we just try to

2371
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:06,800
push down on by watering it too much so

2372
01:43:04,939 --> 01:43:08,779
then we would over water and I'm going

2373
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,060
to go anaerobic so then this whole

2374
01:43:08,779 --> 01:43:14,509
multiply turn anaerobic trying to push

2375
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:16,400
down on this bubble right here so then

2376
01:43:14,510 --> 01:43:18,170
on our new beds what we did I want

2377
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:20,269
action in our old beds we wrapped them

2378
01:43:18,170 --> 01:43:23,619
with basically a plastic to try to slow

2379
01:43:20,270 --> 01:43:26,270
down the evaporation from the sides and

2380
01:43:23,619 --> 01:43:28,489
on new beds we actually had grass roots

2381
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:31,070
build in actually a moisture barrier

2382
01:43:28,489 --> 01:43:33,739
um 3/4 of the bed actually has a

2383
01:43:31,069 --> 01:43:35,449
moisture barrier versus the fabric and

2384
01:43:33,739 --> 01:43:37,250
what that does is it allows us to rate

2385
01:43:35,449 --> 01:43:39,199
more like a water based in effect like

2386
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:41,149
you know a lot of outdoor people are

2387
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:42,710
trying to sink water and store water in

2388
01:43:41,149 --> 01:43:44,839
the ground we're trying to use that same

2389
01:43:42,710 --> 01:43:46,850
concept indoors on obviously a much

2390
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:47,750
smaller scale again you're not trying to

2391
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:49,490
reinvent the wheel

2392
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:52,010
we're just how make it smaller and spin

2393
01:43:49,489 --> 01:43:53,989
it faster so what we're doing here is

2394
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:55,579
we're creating more of a water based in

2395
01:43:53,989 --> 01:43:57,829
effect we're actually able to sink the

2396
01:43:55,579 --> 01:43:59,300
water and it more naturally and allow

2397
01:43:57,829 --> 01:44:02,180
the roots to chase that water

2398
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:03,680
we still have fabric in the top tilt out

2399
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:05,030
air in the top because that's where the

2400
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:06,320
most biological activities and being the

2401
01:44:05,029 --> 01:44:09,199
multi layer and that's them surface

2402
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:10,699
roots and them vertical roots and

2403
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:13,819
instill that allows air pruning in the

2404
01:44:10,699 --> 01:44:15,829
vertical roots in the top but again it

2405
01:44:13,819 --> 01:44:17,599
allows the fabric bottom allows drainage

2406
01:44:15,829 --> 01:44:19,460
as well we have drainage without waste

2407
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:21,890
so we're still draining we have a higher

2408
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:23,270
level of rock at the bottom so still

2409
01:44:21,890 --> 01:44:24,210
draining to the bottom and then we're

2410
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:27,060
using a capital

2411
01:44:24,210 --> 01:44:29,159
action to actually equally distribute

2412
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:31,080
that water more evenly we also do not

2413
01:44:29,159 --> 01:44:33,869
want any carrots so the way these work

2414
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:35,519
is they'll fire on they'll sink that

2415
01:44:33,869 --> 01:44:37,199
water until they shut off and then

2416
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:43,650
capillary action allow it to raise it

2417
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:46,289
and spread it anyways I think

2418
01:44:43,649 --> 01:44:47,909
intuitively that makes sense it's really

2419
01:44:46,289 --> 01:44:49,529
is kind of mimicking what what's

2420
01:44:47,909 --> 01:44:52,170
happening outdoors you're putting more

2421
01:44:49,529 --> 01:44:54,238
rocks in the bottom what roots love to

2422
01:44:52,170 --> 01:44:57,930
wrap around rocks you could even river

2423
01:44:54,238 --> 01:45:01,619
rock if you wanted hummus you could use

2424
01:44:57,930 --> 01:45:03,360
some ganja stocks or some kind of sticks

2425
01:45:01,619 --> 01:45:04,859
some some finer sticks and you could

2426
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:06,750
layer that through the bottom of your

2427
01:45:04,859 --> 01:45:08,369
beds to I think originally when you

2428
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:10,619
started and I think that might give you

2429
01:45:08,369 --> 01:45:13,529
a a narration in the bottom and also

2430
01:45:10,619 --> 01:45:14,939
keep the water towards the bottom that

2431
01:45:13,529 --> 01:45:17,460
sounds really really cool I really

2432
01:45:14,939 --> 01:45:19,409
appreciate those diagrams that's really

2433
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:20,340
really excellent thank you for that and

2434
01:45:19,409 --> 01:45:24,960
I don't think you really need a

2435
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:26,880
whiteboard you know anyway it's awesome

2436
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:30,359
I'm wondering if we can hear from a

2437
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:32,159
scene and then maybe we can or not a

2438
01:45:30,359 --> 01:45:35,699
theme but Jesse but you know and maybe

2439
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:37,680
it is a theme and and and then maybe I

2440
01:45:35,699 --> 01:45:40,649
mean it's nice to talk about what

2441
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:43,320
Appalachian is and and terroir and get

2442
01:45:40,649 --> 01:45:44,099
it and maybe hear from colum and more

2443
01:45:43,319 --> 01:45:45,630
yeah

2444
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:46,680
Swami can tell us about what he what

2445
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:48,539
he's learned about terroir and

2446
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:51,780
appellation of stuff but Jesse please

2447
01:45:48,539 --> 01:45:53,550
please tell us if cannabis and what's

2448
01:45:51,779 --> 01:45:56,719
happening out outdoors and what you're

2449
01:45:53,550 --> 01:45:56,719
seeing in a revolution

2450
01:45:57,470 --> 01:46:03,329
yeah hi um well first off I just once I

2451
01:46:01,109 --> 01:46:06,479
really enjoyed hearing the last couple

2452
01:46:03,329 --> 01:46:08,699
bits and Jeff is very much right like we

2453
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:10,799
want to start with you know thinking

2454
01:46:08,699 --> 01:46:12,989
about keeping soil covered like the

2455
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:15,029
enemy is has uncovered soil so the

2456
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:17,069
mulching the cover cropping these are

2457
01:46:15,029 --> 01:46:20,699
the the most important things to be

2458
01:46:17,069 --> 01:46:22,710
doing so I guess yeah the question is

2459
01:46:20,699 --> 01:46:26,460
about regenerative cannabis and what's

2460
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:27,720
going on with that so like we created

2461
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:29,489
this award called the regenerative

2462
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:31,590
canvas farm award a couple years ago to

2463
01:46:29,489 --> 01:46:34,769
kind of really push forward these

2464
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:36,750
permaculture ideas and have them become

2465
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:38,160
a little bit more main place and have

2466
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:40,560
them be something that people are

2467
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:42,599
competing for instead of it just being

2468
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:45,000
about the best products and flowers but

2469
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:47,670
really about practices and care for the

2470
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,229
earth and soil building and we have

2471
01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:50,760
found that I mean that's that's actually

2472
01:46:49,229 --> 01:46:52,799
giving the best flowers to at that

2473
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:56,130
connection with nature that connection

2474
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:58,739
with living soil is gonna give you just

2475
01:46:56,130 --> 01:47:00,449
really beautiful flowers that that

2476
01:46:58,739 --> 01:47:02,460
resonate with the kind of psychoactive

2477
01:47:00,449 --> 01:47:04,039
effects that you want to as well as like

2478
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:06,390
being the best interpreting production

2479
01:47:04,039 --> 01:47:08,850
so it's been really amazing to see all

2480
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:12,570
these community members all over really

2481
01:47:08,850 --> 01:47:17,160
start working towards soil building as

2482
01:47:12,569 --> 01:47:19,529
as the I guess the the flagship of

2483
01:47:17,159 --> 01:47:21,840
operations of thinking about living soil

2484
01:47:19,529 --> 01:47:23,460
and you know we're seeing all these

2485
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:27,480
human cultures being built everywhere

2486
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:30,739
and we're seeing higher levels it turns

2487
01:47:27,479 --> 01:47:33,119
and better quality but we're also seeing

2488
01:47:30,739 --> 01:47:35,789
better care for the watersheds we're

2489
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:37,890
seeing you know like we're building

2490
01:47:35,789 --> 01:47:41,279
these biological filters when we're

2491
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:45,570
building really fungal rich mycelium

2492
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:47,279
like based growing mediums using like

2493
01:47:45,569 --> 01:47:49,559
Google culture type techniques and the

2494
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:51,840
mulching and these are like you know

2495
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:54,900
you're purifying the water you're

2496
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:57,750
playing a positive role in building

2497
01:47:54,899 --> 01:47:59,789
biodiversity in your system and then

2498
01:47:57,750 --> 01:48:02,310
beyond that you're also like you're

2499
01:47:59,789 --> 01:48:03,689
building polyculture with with Google

2500
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:05,520
culture style growing criminal culture

2501
01:48:03,689 --> 01:48:07,589
style growing you're growing lots of

2502
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,780
other plants with it food plants but

2503
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:11,760
also just native plants and stuff that's

2504
01:48:09,779 --> 01:48:13,679
good for pollinators

2505
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,900
and would you just really build that

2506
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:18,118
biodiversity or you're inviting health

2507
01:48:15,899 --> 01:48:21,448
in your area when you're bringing lots

2508
01:48:18,118 --> 01:48:24,210
of pollinators in you're bringing all of

2509
01:48:21,448 --> 01:48:25,738
the the creatures that are going to keep

2510
01:48:24,210 --> 01:48:28,230
everything in balance so like when you

2511
01:48:25,738 --> 01:48:30,000
have pests and if you have a hundred

2512
01:48:28,229 --> 01:48:32,039
things that eat them then you know pests

2513
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,630
don't become the same thing they they

2514
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:35,158
might not even really be pests they

2515
01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:36,840
might just be telling you other things

2516
01:48:35,158 --> 01:48:38,819
that are unbalanced they might be things

2517
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:40,920
that are communicating to you that are

2518
01:48:38,819 --> 01:48:42,809
helping actually the plant evolve and

2519
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:44,969
helping your system evolve because

2520
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:47,520
really where you see passes with

2521
01:48:44,969 --> 01:48:50,399
monoculture and with chemical nutrients

2522
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:52,679
and with exposed soil and disturbance

2523
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:54,299
it's when we throw something off balance

2524
01:48:52,679 --> 01:48:55,770
that's when pests come over to try to

2525
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:59,550
put it back into balance and that

2526
01:48:55,770 --> 01:49:02,280
initial part of its it's not very

2527
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:03,630
pleasant you know to have the bugs that

2528
01:49:02,279 --> 01:49:06,238
are eating what you're trying to grow

2529
01:49:03,630 --> 01:49:09,539
and the thorns grow back and the you

2530
01:49:06,238 --> 01:49:11,578
know that the more you know like poison

2531
01:49:09,539 --> 01:49:13,260
oak and and thorny plants like those are

2532
01:49:11,578 --> 01:49:16,170
the first things that you see with

2533
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:19,909
disturbance and I think they're helping

2534
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:24,719
to kind of rebuild a biology and keep us

2535
01:49:19,908 --> 01:49:26,399
at that bave a little bit so we created

2536
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:28,889
a website just recently called the

2537
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:30,598
regenerative cannabis farming

2538
01:49:28,889 --> 01:49:34,020
well it's regenerative cannabis farming

2539
01:49:30,599 --> 01:49:36,810
org with with dan maher of high-type

2540
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:38,400
permaculture we started creating a free

2541
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:42,590
resource for people to come and see

2542
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:44,638
different farms that are utilizing more

2543
01:49:42,590 --> 01:49:47,489
permaculture based and regenerative

2544
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:51,179
farming and so we feature the farms that

2545
01:49:47,488 --> 01:49:53,309
we gave we honored at the mo cut for the

2546
01:49:51,179 --> 01:49:54,750
regenitive cannabis farm award and we're

2547
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:57,420
gonna actually continue that on with the

2548
01:49:54,750 --> 01:50:01,260
cultivation classic this year may May

2549
01:49:57,420 --> 01:50:04,408
12th up in Portland and that's that's an

2550
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:07,289
amazing event where we really dive into

2551
01:50:04,408 --> 01:50:08,879
the science of of cannabis that the

2552
01:50:07,289 --> 01:50:12,029
cultivars we're talking about the genes

2553
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:14,760
we're talking about you know Philo's is

2554
01:50:12,029 --> 01:50:18,509
a big part of it we map the winners and

2555
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:20,789
and talk about what that means the the

2556
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:22,800
information how we can interpret that we

2557
01:50:20,789 --> 01:50:24,420
really dive into the chemo types and

2558
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:28,779
make that and from

2559
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:30,489
available for everyone we also give all

2560
01:50:28,779 --> 01:50:32,229
that information to to a project called

2561
01:50:30,488 --> 01:50:33,609
the open canvas project with violet

2562
01:50:32,229 --> 01:50:34,988
Philo's also donates all their

2563
01:50:33,609 --> 01:50:37,179
information more and more labs are

2564
01:50:34,988 --> 01:50:39,729
starting to donate their information and

2565
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:43,239
what what the open canvas project is is

2566
01:50:39,729 --> 01:50:45,339
a nonprofit organization that's designed

2567
01:50:43,238 --> 01:50:48,579
to we're basically building a database

2568
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:50,770
of as much chemo type and genetic

2569
01:50:48,579 --> 01:50:54,460
information that we can to help fight

2570
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:56,560
against potential harmful broad-spectrum

2571
01:50:54,460 --> 01:51:00,719
plant patents the utility patents that

2572
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:04,660
can be way too wide stroked and actually

2573
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:06,279
hinder innovation and and medicine so

2574
01:51:04,659 --> 01:51:08,469
what we want to do is show that these

2575
01:51:06,279 --> 01:51:11,829
things are already prior art and that

2576
01:51:08,469 --> 01:51:14,469
they they should be free for everyone to

2577
01:51:11,829 --> 01:51:18,189
to play with at the same time having

2578
01:51:14,469 --> 01:51:19,750
some you know like very narrow patents

2579
01:51:18,189 --> 01:51:21,939
to help promote innovation isn't

2580
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:23,319
necessarily the worst thing but you know

2581
01:51:21,939 --> 01:51:26,469
we saw what happened with the patent

2582
01:51:23,319 --> 01:51:29,019
trolls with software in the early days

2583
01:51:26,469 --> 01:51:30,789
of computers and stuff that was open

2584
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:33,219
source all of a sudden like patent

2585
01:51:30,789 --> 01:51:34,600
trolls were like oh nobody has a patent

2586
01:51:33,219 --> 01:51:36,579
on this I'll make a patent on this and

2587
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:38,260
then I'll you know sue a whole bunch of

2588
01:51:36,579 --> 01:51:40,300
people for something that I didn't

2589
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:42,010
invent and we want to prevent that stuff

2590
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:44,289
from happening we want cameras to be you

2591
01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:46,150
know open that's really great we're here

2592
01:51:44,289 --> 01:51:47,439
in Vancouver British Columbia right at

2593
01:51:46,149 --> 01:51:48,969
the moment and we have luckily been

2594
01:51:47,439 --> 01:51:51,519
hanging out with Marcus and we were at

2595
01:51:48,969 --> 01:51:57,489
the lift cannabis Expo and Jeremy plumb

2596
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:59,530
is here project and Mowgli was here and

2597
01:51:57,488 --> 01:52:02,979
he was talking with Jonathan page so as

2598
01:51:59,529 --> 01:52:04,300
well as the the living soil and the

2599
01:52:02,979 --> 01:52:06,189
regenerative movement and the

2600
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:08,140
consciousness and the movement towards

2601
01:52:06,189 --> 01:52:10,000
craft cannabis is spreading through

2602
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:12,610
Canada it's spreading through the rest

2603
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,189
of the world everyone's paying attention

2604
01:52:12,609 --> 01:52:16,929
there's a lot of talk about regulations

2605
01:52:15,189 --> 01:52:18,429
and how it's going to affect us we think

2606
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:20,050
that this conversation is really

2607
01:52:18,430 --> 01:52:22,360
valuable because we have people from

2608
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:25,420
different parts of the country different

2609
01:52:22,359 --> 01:52:26,589
parts of the world indoor and outdoor

2610
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:28,960
and this is the way that we're going to

2611
01:52:26,590 --> 01:52:31,960
be able to survive with big agriculture

2612
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:34,989
coming and we have anandhi labs here in

2613
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:36,760
BC and we have Philo's and in Portland

2614
01:52:34,988 --> 01:52:37,489
doing a lot of that work and what we're

2615
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,989
and what we're

2616
01:52:37,489 --> 01:52:41,029
finding us through the testing you know

2617
01:52:38,989 --> 01:52:42,710
we're testing terpenes and we're and

2618
01:52:41,029 --> 01:52:44,359
we're testing cannabinoids and we're

2619
01:52:42,710 --> 01:52:47,420
testing mineral levels we're testing

2620
01:52:44,359 --> 01:52:50,420
soil but we're also still realizing that

2621
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:53,090
you can have the same particular

2622
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:54,859
cultivar even the same clone in the same

2623
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:57,079
soil and you can have two different

2624
01:52:54,859 --> 01:52:59,509
growers that are actually growing this

2625
01:52:57,079 --> 01:53:01,159
particular plant in the same soil and

2626
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:02,780
you're going to come up with different

2627
01:53:01,159 --> 01:53:05,420
terpenes you're going to come up with

2628
01:53:02,779 --> 01:53:07,159
different cannabinoids I believe that

2629
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:10,279
we're utilizing this term as the

2630
01:53:07,159 --> 01:53:13,670
entourage effect meaning that you know

2631
01:53:10,279 --> 01:53:15,829
cannabis is a sentient being it's it's

2632
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:18,409
gathering information not only from the

2633
01:53:15,829 --> 01:53:21,470
soil but also from us because we have

2634
01:53:18,409 --> 01:53:23,180
brought it forward into humanity you

2635
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:25,490
know through humans and cannabis have

2636
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:26,920
always been brought together and I feel

2637
01:53:25,489 --> 01:53:30,529
like this might be a perfect time to

2638
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:34,340
talk about tewara and Appalachia and

2639
01:53:30,529 --> 01:53:37,909
areas of cannabis growing I know

2640
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:41,360
Swami you know a lot about your war in

2641
01:53:37,909 --> 01:53:44,180
your particular area and how it can

2642
01:53:41,359 --> 01:53:46,489
relate to craft cannabis and the face of

2643
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:49,190
like say the big agriculture once big

2644
01:53:46,489 --> 01:53:52,130
agriculture takes over how is

2645
01:53:49,189 --> 01:53:55,309
Appalachian and terroir and bio bio

2646
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:56,810
regions going to help us um Swami I

2647
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:59,060
don't know if you mind telling us a

2648
01:53:56,810 --> 01:54:01,550
little bit about that and thank you

2649
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:05,270
Jesse well thank you all

2650
01:54:01,550 --> 01:54:08,150
this is absolutely thrilling I'm in awe

2651
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:09,950
of all you folks how much you know Jeff

2652
01:54:08,149 --> 01:54:12,649
flow and fells you just opened my mind

2653
01:54:09,949 --> 01:54:15,170
about how above and below as above so

2654
01:54:12,649 --> 01:54:17,629
below relates to soil Scott you're just

2655
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:20,779
statistics and so on or mind-boggling

2656
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:22,819
teas compost ah it's amazing but the

2657
01:54:20,779 --> 01:54:26,449
thing I want to say also is this is also

2658
01:54:22,819 --> 01:54:28,250
new and cutting edge as it's the most

2659
01:54:26,449 --> 01:54:31,099
ancient way that human beings have

2660
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:33,289
actually grown living soil is not a new

2661
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:36,340
thing we all know that and it's a

2662
01:54:33,289 --> 01:54:36,340
neighbor in the country

2663
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:43,039
so the tewara issue if you really want a

2664
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:47,380
little more detailed stuff you can check

2665
01:54:43,039 --> 01:54:51,408
the blog I just posted on finally select

2666
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:54,529
dot-com and and then you can get someone

2667
01:54:51,408 --> 01:54:57,618
but tewara is essentially the microbiome

2668
01:54:54,529 --> 01:55:00,168
it's the entire living in context in

2669
01:54:57,618 --> 01:55:02,149
which something occurs and every

2670
01:55:00,168 --> 01:55:05,300
organism on the planet seems to have

2671
01:55:02,149 --> 01:55:08,089
been derived from the initial terroir

2672
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:11,029
and which it presented itself and so

2673
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:12,439
it's an expression of that terroir you

2674
01:55:11,029 --> 01:55:14,389
know literally of course it means it

2675
01:55:12,439 --> 01:55:16,329
means the earth itself but you're

2676
01:55:14,389 --> 01:55:19,519
culturally it means that the

2677
01:55:16,328 --> 01:55:21,380
ethnobotanical interaction of a species

2678
01:55:19,519 --> 01:55:23,119
with its surrounding and with the human

2679
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:25,189
beings who are interacting with it and

2680
01:55:23,118 --> 01:55:29,359
of course we know we've been interacting

2681
01:55:25,189 --> 01:55:32,360
with us for for over 10,000 years idea

2682
01:55:29,359 --> 01:55:35,509
that it's all alive and that as above so

2683
01:55:32,359 --> 01:55:38,688
below emphasizes the spiritual aspect of

2684
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:40,280
cannabis and and how it comes out in in

2685
01:55:38,689 --> 01:55:42,050
the way we want it there's another

2686
01:55:40,279 --> 01:55:43,880
aspect of this which I've just been

2687
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:47,510
learning about it's called epigenetics

2688
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:50,599
and epigenetics is what happens after

2689
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:52,729
the genes have manifested into reality

2690
01:55:50,599 --> 01:55:55,939
it's the input that we put through love

2691
01:55:52,729 --> 01:55:58,760
and attention and care that makes as you

2692
01:55:55,939 --> 01:56:00,650
just said clearly that the same seat and

2693
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:03,079
the same genetics from in a different

2694
01:56:00,649 --> 01:56:05,058
place is an expression of the people and

2695
01:56:03,078 --> 01:56:07,099
that's the symbiotic relationship we

2696
01:56:05,059 --> 01:56:09,529
have with this plant which is more

2697
01:56:07,099 --> 01:56:12,828
extreme than anywhere else so the idea

2698
01:56:09,529 --> 01:56:14,630
of an appellation and a terroir you

2699
01:56:12,828 --> 01:56:17,569
probably know the appellation comes from

2700
01:56:14,630 --> 01:56:19,969
Jim Appel it is called or I am called

2701
01:56:17,569 --> 01:56:22,578
and that means what is the name of the

2702
01:56:19,969 --> 01:56:25,458
place where it's originating and what is

2703
01:56:22,578 --> 01:56:28,880
specific and unique about that place and

2704
01:56:25,458 --> 01:56:31,668
can it be tasted and sampled and

2705
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:33,590
detected in the final product you know

2706
01:56:31,668 --> 01:56:35,569
it's like Bordeaux wine you know

2707
01:56:33,590 --> 01:56:38,050
actually it tastes and looks and smells

2708
01:56:35,569 --> 01:56:40,969
different from burgundy wine and so on

2709
01:56:38,050 --> 01:56:44,090
aid to establish the actual scientific

2710
01:56:40,969 --> 01:56:47,719
basis of why a particular area region

2711
01:56:44,090 --> 01:56:49,309
section a tewara is unique so we're in

2712
01:56:47,719 --> 01:56:50,809
the process through the menacing

2713
01:56:49,309 --> 01:56:52,788
Appalachian project and through the

2714
01:56:50,809 --> 01:56:57,038
state of California to create these

2715
01:56:52,788 --> 01:56:59,300
zones and identify the actual biological

2716
01:56:57,038 --> 01:57:02,179
meteorological soil all that stuff which

2717
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:05,420
is unique about an area and specifically

2718
01:57:02,179 --> 01:57:08,050
in Mendocino County we're working on

2719
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:10,909
the moment eleven separate regions and

2720
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:13,430
gathering biological and weather data

2721
01:57:10,909 --> 01:57:16,880
about those regions but also the data

2722
01:57:13,430 --> 01:57:18,980
that we share as a community I so

2723
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:21,319
exciting about the living soil movement

2724
01:57:18,979 --> 01:57:23,719
spreading out through Jesse's efforts

2725
01:57:21,319 --> 01:57:26,479
and and the other people whose names I

2726
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:29,180
can't bring to mind but this is a so

2727
01:57:26,479 --> 01:57:31,219
important this is really important I'm

2728
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:33,500
tingling from the thrill of learning

2729
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:35,090
about how soil and compost and mulching

2730
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:38,300
and all that stuff has been working

2731
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:40,250
together I grew up on helping my aunts

2732
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:43,220
and uncles on a dairy farm and all we

2733
01:57:40,250 --> 01:57:46,130
did was manure and my uncle want one the

2734
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:48,320
best dairy milk fat contest every year

2735
01:57:46,130 --> 01:57:50,300
at the fair it was a completely natural

2736
01:57:48,319 --> 01:57:53,960
farm there's virtually nothing off it

2737
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:55,489
and it was a dairy farm I'm thrilled to

2738
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:58,489
be able to try and work in that

2739
01:57:55,489 --> 01:58:00,979
direction on this farm and working with

2740
01:57:58,489 --> 01:58:04,069
Kelly and and Josh about how to really

2741
01:58:00,979 --> 01:58:05,899
create our soil in a new way but terroir

2742
01:58:04,069 --> 01:58:09,109
is the one thing an appellation is going

2743
01:58:05,899 --> 01:58:10,579
to save the small farmer it's just you

2744
01:58:09,109 --> 01:58:12,469
know it's that what makes you special

2745
01:58:10,579 --> 01:58:14,689
it's you're a value-added thing and

2746
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:16,820
we're making certain certifications it's

2747
01:58:14,689 --> 01:58:19,519
not just to where you grow but that

2748
01:58:16,819 --> 01:58:21,829
you're growing in the soil living soil

2749
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:23,960
you're growing with certain techniques

2750
01:58:21,829 --> 01:58:26,000
that are you know defined as organic and

2751
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:29,210
so on and biologic and we're making a

2752
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:31,430
very strict collation more like the

2753
01:58:29,210 --> 01:58:33,230
French wine and we're hoping to push

2754
01:58:31,430 --> 01:58:35,000
that through the state legislature and

2755
01:58:33,229 --> 01:58:38,719
on the county level starting here in

2756
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:40,789
California whoo awesome thank you so

2757
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:43,490
much Swami that really gave a full

2758
01:58:40,789 --> 01:58:45,529
spectrum definition of what terroir is

2759
01:58:43,489 --> 01:58:47,090
and now Dan I wanted we wanted to bring

2760
01:58:45,529 --> 01:58:49,309
you in on this because you're in the

2761
01:58:47,090 --> 01:58:51,529
Willamette Valley of Oregon and the

2762
01:58:49,310 --> 01:58:53,570
terroir there you know is really quite

2763
01:58:51,529 --> 01:58:54,889
special and you're creating a new space

2764
01:58:53,569 --> 01:58:58,309
and you have all this new information

2765
01:58:54,890 --> 01:59:02,000
and also you utilize you know local

2766
01:58:58,310 --> 01:59:05,480
biomass terroir material to put into

2767
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:08,210
your soil you know you like us make make

2768
01:59:05,479 --> 01:59:09,889
teas out of vegetation and I'd love to

2769
01:59:08,210 --> 01:59:12,859
hear a little bit more about how you're

2770
01:59:09,890 --> 01:59:18,130
utilizing your biomass terroir to create

2771
01:59:12,859 --> 01:59:18,130
such amazing terpene rich flowers

2772
01:59:19,109 --> 01:59:26,460
yeah thanks you know a lot of it is has

2773
01:59:24,029 --> 01:59:28,529
been picked up through our relationship

2774
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:31,319
with you guys through the years and

2775
01:59:28,529 --> 01:59:34,889
you've really enriched our open our

2776
01:59:31,319 --> 01:59:37,079
minds and rich our growing practices

2777
01:59:34,890 --> 01:59:40,320
I remember Kelly the first time I spoke

2778
01:59:37,079 --> 01:59:46,279
with you I went on for a couple hours

2779
01:59:40,319 --> 01:59:49,529
anyways and I was you know looking for

2780
01:59:46,279 --> 01:59:53,039
some help with a couple of soil issues

2781
01:59:49,529 --> 01:59:55,409
we were having at the time and inquiring

2782
01:59:53,039 --> 01:59:57,569
about you know bringing your products

2783
01:59:55,409 --> 02:00:01,590
and at some scale with the project I was

2784
01:59:57,569 --> 02:00:03,539
working on at the time and your your

2785
02:00:01,590 --> 02:00:04,409
response was more or less you know

2786
02:00:03,539 --> 02:00:08,550
you're in the Willamette Valley

2787
02:00:04,409 --> 02:00:12,059
everything is all around you in the

2788
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:17,489
years since we've really tapped into

2789
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:22,820
that and have really managed to largely

2790
02:00:17,489 --> 02:00:22,819
keep the loop very closed in regard to

2791
02:00:23,689 --> 02:00:31,559
and in turn the plants you know we have

2792
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:35,340
had to bring in some fairly large

2793
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:39,690
quantities of houmous material in order

2794
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:41,940
to scale up on the level that we've

2795
02:00:39,689 --> 02:00:44,819
needed to do in order to kind of make

2796
02:00:41,939 --> 02:00:50,299
this business work once we bring in our

2797
02:00:44,819 --> 02:00:54,029
original houmous base and build the soil

2798
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:57,800
get to that starting point we've been

2799
02:00:54,029 --> 02:01:00,389
able to continue to increase the

2800
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:04,110
biological and nutrient value of that

2801
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:09,060
soil through what's available to us on

2802
02:01:04,109 --> 02:01:10,949
our land you know metals horsetail first

2803
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:14,039
lane the list goes on and on

2804
02:01:10,949 --> 02:01:19,380
we're fortunate enough to have about

2805
02:01:14,039 --> 02:01:25,590
four acres of mixed orchard trees so we

2806
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:28,440
do a lot of you know mulching and we do

2807
02:01:25,590 --> 02:01:30,989
a lot of these plant teas that you

2808
02:01:28,439 --> 02:01:33,059
reference just super simple plant for

2809
02:01:30,989 --> 02:01:37,979
mint sand and creating

2810
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:42,150
you know liquid fermented nutrient and

2811
02:01:37,979 --> 02:01:46,169
biology rich teas that are very easy to

2812
02:01:42,149 --> 02:01:53,969
make and it definitely contributes

2813
02:01:46,170 --> 02:01:57,779
hugely to the terpene profiles I think

2814
02:01:53,970 --> 02:02:01,079
it was Duke referenced the addition of

2815
02:01:57,779 --> 02:02:06,420
fruits and I can't help it but feel that

2816
02:02:01,079 --> 02:02:08,699
the plum apple pear ferments that we

2817
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:10,619
make on the farm you know you typically

2818
02:02:08,699 --> 02:02:14,639
two to three hundred gallons every

2819
02:02:10,619 --> 02:02:19,260
summer and then we use those throughout

2820
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:22,680
the year just really add a lot of

2821
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:26,699
diversity from all the different

2822
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:28,680
elements of you know there's some that

2823
02:02:26,699 --> 02:02:30,899
would say phosphorus is phosphorus but I

2824
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:35,909
can't help but feel like some being the

2825
02:02:30,899 --> 02:02:39,299
soil phosphorus from multiple sources is

2826
02:02:35,909 --> 02:02:43,199
going to develop a more rich profile in

2827
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:46,470
the end product and it's something that

2828
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:48,510
all of that tied in with that personal

2829
02:02:46,470 --> 02:02:50,280
connection that's being referenced here

2830
02:02:48,510 --> 02:02:53,220
which is a little bit more difficult to

2831
02:02:50,279 --> 02:02:55,139
quantify it's all part of this

2832
02:02:53,220 --> 02:02:58,289
complicated equation that we're

2833
02:02:55,140 --> 02:03:03,270
constantly trying to look at and and

2834
02:02:58,289 --> 02:03:04,649
work with and stay in tune with but but

2835
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:11,040
there's really no question in my mind

2836
02:03:04,649 --> 02:03:16,439
that all of this diversity and and you

2837
02:03:11,039 --> 02:03:21,229
know feeding the soil from a wide range

2838
02:03:16,439 --> 02:03:23,429
of different plant sources does really

2839
02:03:21,229 --> 02:03:25,109
wonderful things that might be a little

2840
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:28,140
bit difficult to quantify from a

2841
02:03:25,109 --> 02:03:30,869
scientific perspective but we certainly

2842
02:03:28,140 --> 02:03:32,940
see it in our results yes and you have

2843
02:03:30,869 --> 02:03:34,649
really beautiful flowers and we really

2844
02:03:32,939 --> 02:03:37,259
appreciate the intention that you put

2845
02:03:34,649 --> 02:03:39,750
into it and you know it's a leap of

2846
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:41,550
faith I think Nick and Liz and and you

2847
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:43,109
and just a bunch of the people in the

2848
02:03:41,550 --> 02:03:45,079
Peter certified farm movement have

2849
02:03:43,109 --> 02:03:46,889
really showed that the faith is really

2850
02:03:45,079 --> 02:03:49,559
you know

2851
02:03:46,890 --> 02:03:52,860
valuable and Scott helping us quantify

2852
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:56,490
it and the books from jeffer are really

2853
02:03:52,859 --> 02:04:00,269
invaluable I'm wondering from Duke how

2854
02:03:56,489 --> 02:04:04,529
you may use different soils for breeding

2855
02:04:00,270 --> 02:04:06,570
are do you find anything like you have a

2856
02:04:04,529 --> 02:04:09,300
really special skunk does it like a

2857
02:04:06,569 --> 02:04:10,679
certain soil or anything like that i'm

2858
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:13,529
just wondering dick if you have anything

2859
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:15,180
to add here duke another question that I

2860
02:04:13,529 --> 02:04:17,309
wanted to ask you is I know that you

2861
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:19,110
have an incredible spirituality in

2862
02:04:17,310 --> 02:04:21,210
connection to the plants it's very

2863
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:23,670
obvious and meeting you it's obvious and

2864
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:24,899
smelling your your plants and also you

2865
02:04:23,670 --> 02:04:26,520
know we've grown out a lot of your

2866
02:04:24,899 --> 02:04:28,649
varieties that you've given us and

2867
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:30,660
they've just been so vigorous and so

2868
02:04:28,649 --> 02:04:31,889
amazing I was just wondering if you

2869
02:04:30,659 --> 02:04:33,779
could talk a little bit about your

2870
02:04:31,890 --> 02:04:36,329
spiritual connection to the plant and

2871
02:04:33,779 --> 02:04:40,619
why you're breeding and your flowers are

2872
02:04:36,329 --> 02:04:46,279
so amazing all right thank you

2873
02:04:40,619 --> 02:04:52,380
yeah thanks for all that um so I guess

2874
02:04:46,279 --> 02:04:54,779
first as far as like like going back to

2875
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:57,960
Nome like what he's saying like with our

2876
02:04:54,779 --> 02:05:02,369
with our degree permits right so let's

2877
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:05,310
say we're growing Caleo in one pot and

2878
02:05:02,369 --> 02:05:08,069
let's say I'm growing you know red kills

2879
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:10,920
skunk in another pot and let's say we're

2880
02:05:08,069 --> 02:05:13,859
growing like something powerfully like a

2881
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:16,079
blueberry or you know something that's

2882
02:05:13,859 --> 02:05:20,969
more in like the the blueberry grape

2883
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:23,340
realm right so if I take like a let's

2884
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:26,970
say like I do what I do I take a lot of

2885
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:29,460
different fruits and vegetables I mince

2886
02:05:26,970 --> 02:05:32,490
them all up and I'm basically making

2887
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:34,829
like pre nut like toilet wine right

2888
02:05:32,489 --> 02:05:36,719
well it really cuz you know I'm not

2889
02:05:34,829 --> 02:05:39,269
adding yeast and getting alcohol right

2890
02:05:36,720 --> 02:05:42,960
but um you know breaking I'm making a

2891
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:45,060
fruit ferment so if it got orange in

2892
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:47,880
there I also have blueberry in there I

2893
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:50,670
have all these different things so let's

2894
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:53,579
say like you know I mix it in the water

2895
02:05:50,670 --> 02:05:56,329
and I water all these these four plants

2896
02:05:53,579 --> 02:06:00,840
with it it's not gonna make the orange

2897
02:05:56,329 --> 02:06:02,550
Caleo tastes like a blueberry or a mango

2898
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:04,560
anything else you know and it's not

2899
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:07,050
going to take the blueberry plant and

2900
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:09,900
make it taste like an orange because

2901
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:12,600
they're they're genetically they're

2902
02:06:09,899 --> 02:06:15,479
they're terpene profile it's helping to

2903
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:19,110
reach it's helping for that plant to

2904
02:06:15,479 --> 02:06:23,519
reach its potential for its term terpene

2905
02:06:19,109 --> 02:06:26,039
profile and overall chemo type so it's

2906
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:28,470
not really gonna switch anything up but

2907
02:06:26,039 --> 02:06:32,039
everything that it needs is it's

2908
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:34,590
available through this and you know like

2909
02:06:32,039 --> 02:06:36,510
with uh like bananas that I have you

2910
02:06:34,590 --> 02:06:38,430
know in the stuff that's you know that's

2911
02:06:36,510 --> 02:06:40,500
gonna give us a lot of potassium you

2912
02:06:38,430 --> 02:06:42,750
know and certain other things are gonna

2913
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:44,640
give us you know a lot more calcium and

2914
02:06:42,750 --> 02:06:49,140
other things magnesium so we're also

2915
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:51,000
feeding as well but those those things

2916
02:06:49,140 --> 02:06:53,550
as they're breaking down that's what I

2917
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:55,819
was talking about like you know halfway

2918
02:06:53,550 --> 02:06:59,730
through the cycle you know I'm more

2919
02:06:55,819 --> 02:07:02,789
concentrating on feeding the resin and

2920
02:06:59,729 --> 02:07:08,129
the terpenes then the biomass at that

2921
02:07:02,789 --> 02:07:12,500
point so that that helps with that um as

2922
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:17,039
far as like the the biomass growing part

2923
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:19,199
yeah you know so I guess the it'll it'll

2924
02:07:17,039 --> 02:07:21,510
jump into a question to like why I'm

2925
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:23,519
doing and how I'm doing everything as

2926
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:28,619
far as like breeding and stuff like that

2927
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:30,990
um and if if I had a commercial grow or

2928
02:07:28,619 --> 02:07:34,439
like if I was you know supplying a chain

2929
02:07:30,989 --> 02:07:37,199
you know I would be you know more

2930
02:07:34,439 --> 02:07:40,259
inclined to like monocrop rooms or beds

2931
02:07:37,199 --> 02:07:43,619
or areas and and I would be looking to

2932
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:46,170
hit the maximum potential for just that

2933
02:07:43,619 --> 02:07:48,689
and I believe there's a lot of things

2934
02:07:46,170 --> 02:07:51,630
that can I can grow pretty much dead on

2935
02:07:48,689 --> 02:07:53,579
similar like I can grab headband and I

2936
02:07:51,630 --> 02:07:56,400
can grow triangle cush about the same

2937
02:07:53,579 --> 02:07:59,670
like feed and regimen and all and they

2938
02:07:56,399 --> 02:08:02,009
do great there are couple minor minor

2939
02:07:59,670 --> 02:08:04,319
tweaks that I could make the each one to

2940
02:08:02,010 --> 02:08:08,239
help them excel better but like if I'm

2941
02:08:04,319 --> 02:08:12,170
growing say say like one of my skunks I

2942
02:08:08,239 --> 02:08:14,349
would need to feed it a little harder at

2943
02:08:12,170 --> 02:08:17,019
different points then

2944
02:08:14,349 --> 02:08:18,519
would be harder toward the other ones

2945
02:08:17,019 --> 02:08:21,519
you know what I mean so like there's

2946
02:08:18,519 --> 02:08:23,979
slight tweaks with that and then I could

2947
02:08:21,519 --> 02:08:26,559
even like mix it up even more and like

2948
02:08:23,979 --> 02:08:29,050
we have all old Afghani that we had from

2949
02:08:26,559 --> 02:08:32,918
back in Virginia it's light sensitive

2950
02:08:29,050 --> 02:08:36,248
you know like the we malls that that say

2951
02:08:32,918 --> 02:08:38,889
like My Chem dog or my head man might

2952
02:08:36,248 --> 02:08:42,938
like it's too bright for that Afghani it

2953
02:08:38,889 --> 02:08:44,378
just does not like that you know so so

2954
02:08:42,939 --> 02:08:48,999
there's a lot of factors into like

2955
02:08:44,378 --> 02:08:51,429
tweaking each each thing to to to its

2956
02:08:48,998 --> 02:08:54,668
maximum potential but as far as the

2957
02:08:51,429 --> 02:08:59,708
terpene contents go I find that you know

2958
02:08:54,668 --> 02:09:04,019
you can pretty much mix up a whole bunch

2959
02:08:59,708 --> 02:09:06,578
of different stuff hello kid

2960
02:09:04,019 --> 02:09:10,329
you can mix up a whole bunch of stuff

2961
02:09:06,578 --> 02:09:12,488
and it's kind of all month into one and

2962
02:09:10,328 --> 02:09:15,248
it not only is like feeding it but it's

2963
02:09:12,488 --> 02:09:17,348
also helping to get to its chirping

2964
02:09:15,248 --> 02:09:19,688
potential without you know you're not

2965
02:09:17,349 --> 02:09:22,090
curving it away from anything because

2966
02:09:19,689 --> 02:09:24,309
genetically it's it's unable to smell

2967
02:09:22,090 --> 02:09:26,619
like an orange so you know it's gonna

2968
02:09:24,309 --> 02:09:29,260
take kind of what it needs and reach its

2969
02:09:26,618 --> 02:09:30,549
potential God could we talk about that

2970
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:32,498
just for a couple of couple of minutes

2971
02:09:30,550 --> 02:09:33,939
because I that's sort of it the key of

2972
02:09:32,498 --> 02:09:35,228
what what I thought we were gonna be

2973
02:09:33,939 --> 02:09:38,409
talking about today that's how to make

2974
02:09:35,229 --> 02:09:40,628
the very best yet and I think it all

2975
02:09:38,408 --> 02:09:42,279
comes down to that little gland Mike

2976
02:09:40,628 --> 02:09:43,658
am I wrong in saying that does anybody

2977
02:09:42,279 --> 02:09:46,090
think I'm wrong and saying that it's

2978
02:09:43,658 --> 02:09:48,668
it's the terpenes in that glam that

2979
02:09:46,090 --> 02:09:50,260
we're all shooting for you're absolutely

2980
02:09:48,668 --> 02:09:56,439
right but you know you're absolutely

2981
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:59,649
right okay just steal the show just for

2982
02:09:56,439 --> 02:10:01,269
two seconds is that Alright absolutely

2983
02:09:59,649 --> 02:10:02,169
it's all you Jeff steal it for more than

2984
02:10:01,269 --> 02:10:04,899
two seconds

2985
02:10:02,168 --> 02:10:06,398
well because I've been struggling with

2986
02:10:04,899 --> 02:10:07,599
this for a while because you know you

2987
02:10:06,399 --> 02:10:09,340
always hear all sorts of different

2988
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:11,469
things it's sort of like the flushing

2989
02:10:09,340 --> 02:10:13,208
debate you know what's what's the truth

2990
02:10:11,469 --> 02:10:15,340
and the truth always comes down to

2991
02:10:13,208 --> 02:10:16,988
what's the science and once you figure

2992
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:19,689
out the science then you can you know

2993
02:10:16,988 --> 02:10:21,279
figure out what the truth is well I

2994
02:10:19,689 --> 02:10:22,510
won't give an answer to what I think

2995
02:10:21,279 --> 02:10:23,889
about flushing because that's a whole

2996
02:10:22,510 --> 02:10:26,559
public we all know the different show

2997
02:10:23,889 --> 02:10:28,260
but but what we're what we're beginning

2998
02:10:26,559 --> 02:10:30,329
to hear an awful lot about

2999
02:10:28,260 --> 02:10:34,110
are people who've got inoculants for

3000
02:10:30,328 --> 02:10:36,808
example that they contend increase the

3001
02:10:34,109 --> 02:10:38,670
terpene content and i and i you know and

3002
02:10:36,809 --> 02:10:41,519
i I think we've gotta start

3003
02:10:38,670 --> 02:10:43,340
distinguishing what what is going on

3004
02:10:41,519 --> 02:10:45,690
when we talk about these things

3005
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:47,038
because from my perspective and again

3006
02:10:45,689 --> 02:10:49,518
correct me if I'm wrong and then I'm

3007
02:10:47,038 --> 02:10:51,779
just a complete novice on this stuff

3008
02:10:49,519 --> 02:10:54,449
what you've got and what just been

3009
02:10:51,779 --> 02:10:58,408
explained is you've got you know your

3010
02:10:54,448 --> 02:11:01,259
basic terpene spine and attached to that

3011
02:10:58,408 --> 02:11:03,179
terpene spine our you know little

3012
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:05,280
different arms that give that terpene a

3013
02:11:03,179 --> 02:11:06,210
different taste and so you've got an

3014
02:11:05,279 --> 02:11:08,670
orange to rapini

3015
02:11:06,210 --> 02:11:12,510
you know a lemon terpene you got a

3016
02:11:08,670 --> 02:11:15,510
blueberry terpene etc etc it's the it's

3017
02:11:12,510 --> 02:11:17,820
the microbes that break down whatever

3018
02:11:15,510 --> 02:11:21,000
goes into that soil and if you're

3019
02:11:17,819 --> 02:11:23,308
putting terpenes into that soil those

3020
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:24,840
microbes are breaking down that turkey

3021
02:11:23,309 --> 02:11:26,760
now they have been also talk to each

3022
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:27,989
other using terpenes which is

3023
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:29,329
interesting but i don't think it really

3024
02:11:27,988 --> 02:11:31,649
has too much of a direct application

3025
02:11:29,328 --> 02:11:33,779
it's just interesting and kind of

3026
02:11:31,649 --> 02:11:36,929
mind-boggling that terpenes is a

3027
02:11:33,779 --> 02:11:38,819
language communicating system but but

3028
02:11:36,929 --> 02:11:40,679
it's that it's the microbes in the soil

3029
02:11:38,819 --> 02:11:41,788
that are breaking down whatever you're

3030
02:11:40,679 --> 02:11:45,179
putting in there

3031
02:11:41,788 --> 02:11:48,300
that create the basic building blocks

3032
02:11:45,179 --> 02:11:51,719
that are needed by the plant that's

3033
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:54,300
already got a pre prequel program DNA to

3034
02:11:51,719 --> 02:11:55,649
make a particular type of terpene I

3035
02:11:54,300 --> 02:11:59,250
think that's what what's been explained

3036
02:11:55,649 --> 02:12:03,779
and and and I I guess where I where I

3037
02:11:59,250 --> 02:12:07,260
get confused is people are beginning to

3038
02:12:03,779 --> 02:12:09,319
say that by any particular bacterium to

3039
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:12,599
the soil they're getting a spectacular

3040
02:12:09,319 --> 02:12:13,768
terpene expression and other people are

3041
02:12:12,599 --> 02:12:17,550
beginning to say

3042
02:12:13,769 --> 02:12:20,099
anning the the base material to an

3043
02:12:17,550 --> 02:12:24,090
existing microbiology is all you need to

3044
02:12:20,099 --> 02:12:26,219
do and I'm I'm struggling with with it

3045
02:12:24,090 --> 02:12:28,500
all because ultimately the only thing

3046
02:12:26,219 --> 02:12:30,689
that counts is that the plant makes as

3047
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:36,238
many of those glands as possible and

3048
02:12:30,689 --> 02:12:39,448
that those glands contain all of the

3049
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:42,179
enzymes that are necessary to reassemble

3050
02:12:39,448 --> 02:12:44,669
or all of the nutrients that the back

3051
02:12:42,180 --> 02:12:47,460
and fungi have broken down and go into

3052
02:12:44,670 --> 02:12:50,640
the plant system too so that the plant

3053
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:53,520
cell itself can make those individual

3054
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:55,350
terpenes and you know so should we be

3055
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:57,990
concentrating on growing the very best

3056
02:12:55,350 --> 02:13:01,140
plant we possibly can that can grow as

3057
02:12:57,989 --> 02:13:02,969
many of those glands which will

3058
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:06,119
themselves have all these enzymes and

3059
02:13:02,970 --> 02:13:09,240
etc so or do we concentrate on growing

3060
02:13:06,119 --> 02:13:17,309
particular kinds of microbes that's

3061
02:13:09,239 --> 02:13:18,229
somehow and I jump in here yeah yeah go

3062
02:13:17,310 --> 02:13:21,840
ahead Swami

3063
02:13:18,229 --> 02:13:24,839
well terpene of course is the thing but

3064
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:27,420
the two questions you want to ask one is

3065
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:29,789
why is the plant itself making the

3066
02:13:27,420 --> 02:13:32,880
terpenes regardless of what ingredients

3067
02:13:29,789 --> 02:13:35,970
go microbiologically to make it and in

3068
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:37,800
my terpene expression I found the

3069
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:40,470
mountains main thing that increased my

3070
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:44,220
terpene count was to harvest in the dark

3071
02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:45,900
before first light really 6:00 a.m. in

3072
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:47,670
the morning and that's when you get your

3073
02:13:45,899 --> 02:13:50,279
maximum turkeys because if you look at a

3074
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:54,180
graph of the terpene saturation it Peaks

3075
02:13:50,279 --> 02:13:57,599
just before daylight and why is that the

3076
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:59,970
reason I was told by a chemical chemical

3077
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:01,890
biologist is that the terpenes are what

3078
02:13:59,970 --> 02:14:04,710
the plant puts out to protect itself

3079
02:14:01,890 --> 02:14:07,980
during the night from mold and mildew it

3080
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:10,260
also puts them out to attract other fly

3081
02:14:07,979 --> 02:14:13,049
other ingredients that can protect it

3082
02:14:10,260 --> 02:14:15,659
insects and so on and drive away others

3083
02:14:13,050 --> 02:14:17,670
that it doesn't want so it's a it's a

3084
02:14:15,659 --> 02:14:20,039
defense mechanism that the plant uses

3085
02:14:17,670 --> 02:14:21,510
and and part of the thing about creating

3086
02:14:20,039 --> 02:14:24,180
through pedes I think also has to do is

3087
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:26,730
stressing the plant so all of these

3088
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:28,500
things are part of you know the genetics

3089
02:14:26,729 --> 02:14:30,479
of the plant the nurturance of the plant

3090
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:33,510
the soil and so on but harvesting at a

3091
02:14:30,479 --> 02:14:34,139
certain time and also having a plant be

3092
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:37,020
stressed

3093
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:39,030
will my terpenes jump by a factor of at

3094
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:42,210
least 10 as soon as I harvest it in the

3095
02:14:39,029 --> 02:14:44,099
dark really because I'm I mean there are

3096
02:14:42,210 --> 02:14:47,399
equally people who will tell you that

3097
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:50,130
these epic lands themselves act as a UVB

3098
02:14:47,399 --> 02:14:52,319
protector and so that it produced pretty

3099
02:14:50,130 --> 02:14:55,289
heavily during the daytime as well let's

3100
02:14:52,319 --> 02:14:55,979
instead think we've got to get some data

3101
02:14:55,289 --> 02:14:58,859
put the yes

3102
02:14:55,979 --> 02:15:02,129
I agree I would just add that it is

3103
02:14:58,859 --> 02:15:04,259
definitely how the relationship that

3104
02:15:02,130 --> 02:15:05,730
with humans I'm quite certain began but

3105
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:08,699
also just to give you guys a little

3106
02:15:05,729 --> 02:15:10,619
quick I put it up once already but I'll

3107
02:15:08,699 --> 02:15:13,109
put the screenshare up this is inside a

3108
02:15:10,619 --> 02:15:15,420
glandular trichomes and so you see these

3109
02:15:13,109 --> 02:15:17,939
vacuoles there's plastids and vacuoles

3110
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:19,649
the vacuoles are producing phenols which

3111
02:15:17,939 --> 02:15:21,809
are alcohols and the plastids are

3112
02:15:19,649 --> 02:15:24,000
producing the terpenes these are the

3113
02:15:21,810 --> 02:15:27,239
actual building blocks of cannabinoids

3114
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:29,189
and the entire terpene profile these are

3115
02:15:27,238 --> 02:15:31,559
pushing up into that upper secretory

3116
02:15:29,189 --> 02:15:33,599
cavity and you know with the lights

3117
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:35,760
different different rays are hitting

3118
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:38,130
that and that's cooking into existence

3119
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:40,710
all of the cannabinoids which starts

3120
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:42,539
with CBG and then eventually goes into

3121
02:15:40,710 --> 02:15:44,760
the whole variety of cannabinoids that

3122
02:15:42,539 --> 02:15:46,829
the gene synthesis can produce and then

3123
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:49,470
of course the terpene profile as well so

3124
02:15:46,829 --> 02:15:51,659
terpenes which are hydrocarbons are in

3125
02:15:49,470 --> 02:15:55,680
fact the building blocks of all

3126
02:15:51,659 --> 02:15:57,599
cannabinoids yeah and it's really

3127
02:15:55,680 --> 02:16:00,210
interesting what you were saying Swami

3128
02:15:57,600 --> 02:16:02,340
is you know the morning thing just being

3129
02:16:00,210 --> 02:16:04,949
an herbologist and studying herbs you

3130
02:16:02,340 --> 02:16:07,619
know when you go back into a lot of the

3131
02:16:04,949 --> 02:16:11,909
ancient Sanskrit and when there's either

3132
02:16:07,619 --> 02:16:14,779
Chinese medicinals or ru Vedic

3133
02:16:11,909 --> 02:16:17,519
medicinals they do absolutely talk about

3134
02:16:14,779 --> 02:16:19,769
you know taking that plant at very first

3135
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:22,080
light so it's interesting they didn't

3136
02:16:19,770 --> 02:16:25,380
have the science behind that 5,000 years

3137
02:16:22,079 --> 02:16:27,180
ago and if they had their senses than

3138
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:30,119
they had their connection to the earth

3139
02:16:27,180 --> 02:16:32,250
and they knew what worked best well

3140
02:16:30,119 --> 02:16:34,500
that's an issue how do you relate to the

3141
02:16:32,250 --> 02:16:36,209
plant and we've talked earlier about the

3142
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:38,159
intuitive way of growing which all the

3143
02:16:36,209 --> 02:16:40,379
hippies in the old day started to do and

3144
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:42,750
that's what people do but the culture of

3145
02:16:40,379 --> 02:16:45,000
passing on third generation what happens

3146
02:16:42,750 --> 02:16:47,610
how do you do this when it's dry when

3147
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:49,709
it's wet and so on this respondent

3148
02:16:47,610 --> 02:16:51,510
intuitively to the plant but for me to

3149
02:16:49,709 --> 02:16:53,729
get the science from all you folks is

3150
02:16:51,510 --> 02:16:56,099
absolutely thrilling and I'm learning so

3151
02:16:53,729 --> 02:16:58,558
much here but there is this whole thing

3152
02:16:56,099 --> 02:17:00,808
the plant is so symbiotic with us is

3153
02:16:58,558 --> 02:17:04,049
that it will also produce the terpenes

3154
02:17:00,808 --> 02:17:06,268
I'm convinced that you need and so what

3155
02:17:04,049 --> 02:17:08,549
by feeding it and encouraging it to do

3156
02:17:06,269 --> 02:17:09,360
that especially harvesting now if you

3157
02:17:08,549 --> 02:17:10,920
harvest in the

3158
02:17:09,360 --> 02:17:13,079
morning also when it's cold you're going

3159
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:15,750
to lose a lot fewer terpenes and

3160
02:17:13,079 --> 02:17:17,700
trichomes and stone on your gloves and

3161
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:19,889
hands when you're harvesting so

3162
02:17:17,700 --> 02:17:21,210
harvesting late in the afternoon I think

3163
02:17:19,889 --> 02:17:23,309
it's probably the worst thing you can

3164
02:17:21,209 --> 02:17:24,840
possibly do for your for your cannabis

3165
02:17:23,309 --> 02:17:26,430
because your end handles will end up

3166
02:17:24,841 --> 02:17:28,770
sticky and so on and so forth

3167
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:31,409
harvesting the cold and in the dark it

3168
02:17:28,770 --> 02:17:32,940
and I I if I can I prefer to heart take

3169
02:17:31,409 --> 02:17:34,889
the whole plant and hang it upside down

3170
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:38,310
which is the ancient way that harvest

3171
02:17:34,889 --> 02:17:39,719
herbs also well yeah I love that go

3172
02:17:38,309 --> 02:17:42,809
ahead Jeff let me ask you a question

3173
02:17:39,719 --> 02:17:46,739
again because I you know is it is it a

3174
02:17:42,809 --> 02:17:48,930
question of when you harvest in terms of

3175
02:17:46,739 --> 02:17:51,659
the morning or night or is it a question

3176
02:17:48,930 --> 02:17:55,139
of the humidity which is lower or in the

3177
02:17:51,659 --> 02:17:57,209
early morning hours I mean this is what

3178
02:17:55,139 --> 02:18:00,109
we we need that we need to really nail

3179
02:17:57,209 --> 02:18:02,189
down in order to be able to unify

3180
02:18:00,110 --> 02:18:05,130
instructions on how to get the very best

3181
02:18:02,190 --> 02:18:06,480
terpenes and Senator cetera one

3182
02:18:05,129 --> 02:18:08,789
explanation this is going to sound

3183
02:18:06,479 --> 02:18:11,479
really kind of fun you know there's a

3184
02:18:08,790 --> 02:18:14,160
lot of studies lately about about the

3185
02:18:11,479 --> 02:18:17,250
human biome and what we what we carry

3186
02:18:14,159 --> 02:18:20,280
around us not in US but around us and so

3187
02:18:17,250 --> 02:18:22,920
when you walk by a stranger you are

3188
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:26,190
invading and he is or she is invading

3189
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:28,559
your bio your space and so there are all

3190
02:18:26,190 --> 02:18:31,220
sorts of bacteria and stuff that just

3191
02:18:28,559 --> 02:18:34,109
sort of hangs around you and and and

3192
02:18:31,219 --> 02:18:37,859
there is a theory that as you work with

3193
02:18:34,110 --> 02:18:43,950
your plants those bacteria that are

3194
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:45,810
around you signal or caused to trigger

3195
02:18:43,950 --> 02:18:48,870
signals that are either in the soil

3196
02:18:45,809 --> 02:18:53,209
microbiology or in the microbiology in

3197
02:18:48,870 --> 02:18:56,460
the plant or the plant itself that's

3198
02:18:53,209 --> 02:18:58,800
that's very interesting because the

3199
02:18:56,459 --> 02:19:02,099
plant is so symbiotic with us because of

3200
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:04,199
our own internal endocannabinoids and it

3201
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:06,841
knows what what it what we need

3202
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:08,430
see when I harvest I do a very peculiar

3203
02:19:06,841 --> 02:19:10,559
thing when I harvest I go out the day

3204
02:19:08,430 --> 02:19:12,510
before I know all these plants are close

3205
02:19:10,559 --> 02:19:15,479
to ready but I will go out and with

3206
02:19:12,510 --> 02:19:17,520
kinesiology I'll muscle test each plant

3207
02:19:15,479 --> 02:19:19,619
and I will ask that plant late in the

3208
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:20,880
afternoon are you ready to come in

3209
02:19:19,620 --> 02:19:23,219
tomorrow and it'll give

3210
02:19:20,879 --> 02:19:25,589
your muscle test yes or no I'll say do

3211
02:19:23,218 --> 02:19:27,449
you want to come in tomorrow and if it

3212
02:19:25,590 --> 02:19:28,920
both says yes it's ready and yes it

3213
02:19:27,450 --> 02:19:31,229
wants to come in then I'll ask the third

3214
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:34,340
question I say should I leave you for a

3215
02:19:31,228 --> 02:19:36,989
few more days and the plant will say no

3216
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:39,599
it's better than that plant itself

3217
02:19:36,989 --> 02:19:41,369
because I listen I took that seat and it

3218
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:42,989
was in my hand and I said a prayer on

3219
02:19:41,370 --> 02:19:45,210
some people even put the seed in their

3220
02:19:42,989 --> 02:19:47,010
mouth before they put it in the thing

3221
02:19:45,209 --> 02:19:49,559
this is what you're talking about that

3222
02:19:47,010 --> 02:19:54,360
bacteria that biome that we have around

3223
02:19:49,559 --> 02:19:57,180
ourselves but it's also love a mystical

3224
02:19:54,360 --> 02:19:59,069
ingredient that we put onto it and and

3225
02:19:57,180 --> 02:20:02,309
that as you touch the plant you're

3226
02:19:59,069 --> 02:20:04,770
putting your vibe on it and so that's a

3227
02:20:02,309 --> 02:20:07,260
crucial ingredient and it is that total

3228
02:20:04,770 --> 02:20:09,210
interaction and then the other thing is

3229
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:12,450
what are terpenes in the plant finally

3230
02:20:09,209 --> 02:20:14,549
telling us the terpene as we open up a

3231
02:20:12,450 --> 02:20:16,110
bud and break it and so and so forth

3232
02:20:14,549 --> 02:20:19,170
that's one of the thrills of being a

3233
02:20:16,110 --> 02:20:21,930
judge in the Emerald cup I smell a 600

3234
02:20:19,170 --> 02:20:23,670
plants right and it's like a thrill but

3235
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:25,920
what is it telling us that terpene

3236
02:20:23,670 --> 02:20:29,639
profile exploding into your nose is

3237
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:32,189
giving you a precognition they'll do for

3238
02:20:29,639 --> 02:20:33,750
you and so it's just like an orange when

3239
02:20:32,189 --> 02:20:36,090
you open up in ours you already know

3240
02:20:33,750 --> 02:20:37,920
what that vitamin C and everything is

3241
02:20:36,090 --> 02:20:39,960
going to do for your body knows it your

3242
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:42,450
body intelligent and the terpene is

3243
02:20:39,959 --> 02:20:46,259
signaling exactly that this is that

3244
02:20:42,450 --> 02:20:47,820
pining or that mercy or that little or

3245
02:20:46,260 --> 02:20:49,260
whatever it is and you know what it's

3246
02:20:47,819 --> 02:20:51,209
going to do because it's done it before

3247
02:20:49,260 --> 02:20:54,420
and so that's why you select that

3248
02:20:51,209 --> 02:20:57,089
particular strain to grow and that's why

3249
02:20:54,420 --> 02:20:59,309
that strain rose for you in that way

3250
02:20:57,090 --> 02:21:01,620
because it knows you need that this

3251
02:20:59,309 --> 02:21:03,478
communication between the plant is the

3252
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:06,420
most extreme in cannabis and any other

3253
02:21:03,478 --> 02:21:09,059
plant in the whole kingdom you need to

3254
02:21:06,420 --> 02:21:13,879
take advantage and listen listen to the

3255
02:21:09,059 --> 02:21:16,529
plant more than anything else yeah mommy

3256
02:21:13,879 --> 02:21:18,569
one thing that I wanted to say is that I

3257
02:21:16,530 --> 02:21:20,340
know that a lot of you all can relate to

3258
02:21:18,569 --> 02:21:21,959
this you know a lot of growers out there

3259
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:24,960
will definitely think that you know my

3260
02:21:21,959 --> 02:21:26,909
bud is the best you know it's not just

3261
02:21:24,959 --> 02:21:29,429
the fact that there that there bud is

3262
02:21:26,909 --> 02:21:32,340
above and beyond maybe other people or

3263
02:21:29,430 --> 02:21:33,630
but it might be the best for them it's

3264
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:34,620
something that they've grown and that

3265
02:21:33,629 --> 02:21:37,399
they've put there in 10

3266
02:21:34,620 --> 02:21:39,660
- I know I suffer from migraines and

3267
02:21:37,399 --> 02:21:41,760
absolutely if I'm away from my own

3268
02:21:39,659 --> 02:21:44,190
flowers during that time I'm absolutely

3269
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:45,450
suffering much longer than if I'm with

3270
02:21:44,190 --> 02:21:47,730
my own flowers

3271
02:21:45,450 --> 02:21:49,380
I think Jeff you know to go with what

3272
02:21:47,729 --> 02:21:51,510
you're saying was you know I think we

3273
02:21:49,379 --> 02:21:53,850
can all agree that really diversity is

3274
02:21:51,510 --> 02:21:56,610
what we're after you know the one

3275
02:21:53,851 --> 02:21:58,409
bacteria the one fungi that works that

3276
02:21:56,610 --> 02:21:59,909
might show up in tests is really

3277
02:21:58,409 --> 02:22:02,280
beneficial and it's probably something

3278
02:21:59,909 --> 02:22:04,049
to pay attention to but I really feel

3279
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:06,000
it's the diversity that really gives us

3280
02:22:04,049 --> 02:22:08,549
the advantage it's what really makes us

3281
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:10,351
it gives us the adaptation that we might

3282
02:22:08,549 --> 02:22:11,879
need we might not know what organism

3283
02:22:10,351 --> 02:22:14,101
really is gonna thrive in that moment

3284
02:22:11,879 --> 02:22:18,479
and that's why we're adding more and we

3285
02:22:14,101 --> 02:22:20,670
see the soil as a like a dinner you know

3286
02:22:18,479 --> 02:22:23,100
the soil is the dinner for the planets

3287
02:22:20,670 --> 02:22:26,760
it's what really does sustain it and any

3288
02:22:23,101 --> 02:22:28,440
tea or terpene maybe fruit ferment or

3289
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:30,690
any kind of aperitifs

3290
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:33,569
any desserts yeah any kind a type of

3291
02:22:30,690 --> 02:22:36,780
plant botanical tea that we can make it

3292
02:22:33,569 --> 02:22:39,090
may not be a direct terpene from the

3293
02:22:36,780 --> 02:22:41,400
plant directly into the plant like Dukla

3294
02:22:39,090 --> 02:22:43,620
say it may not be I giving a blueberry

3295
02:22:41,399 --> 02:22:45,209
I'm into the plant is gonna make the

3296
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:47,340
plant smell like blueberries I think

3297
02:22:45,209 --> 02:22:50,479
what it does is it gives flavonoids and

3298
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:54,360
amino acids and it gives that that that

3299
02:22:50,479 --> 02:22:56,850
micro that even finer layer of support

3300
02:22:54,360 --> 02:22:58,650
to the plant and it gives it the ability

3301
02:22:56,851 --> 02:23:00,480
to express itself and it's the

3302
02:22:58,649 --> 02:23:02,159
expression which is the intuition of the

3303
02:23:00,479 --> 02:23:04,979
plant that we're basically respecting

3304
02:23:02,159 --> 02:23:07,950
its evolution to let it respect itself

3305
02:23:04,979 --> 02:23:11,219
and us and through the diversity grow

3306
02:23:07,950 --> 02:23:18,690
the best medicine I was you know I think

3307
02:23:11,219 --> 02:23:21,179
you're absolutely correct our soils are

3308
02:23:18,690 --> 02:23:24,510
feeding our plants our plants only need

3309
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:27,030
those 18 nutrients they can take those

3310
02:23:24,510 --> 02:23:29,760
18 nutrients and convert them into all

3311
02:23:27,030 --> 02:23:33,510
the turkeys we need but we got to make

3312
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:35,670
sure that the soil has those nutrients

3313
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:38,370
in it so that the microbes can supply

3314
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:40,170
those nutrients to the plant okay a lot

3315
02:23:38,370 --> 02:23:43,410
of times we just think it's you know

3316
02:23:40,170 --> 02:23:45,060
we're putting terpene producing bacteria

3317
02:23:43,409 --> 02:23:46,680
in the soil and they're putting terpenes

3318
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:48,430
into the plant that's not how it works

3319
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:54,280
that plant

3320
02:23:48,430 --> 02:23:58,239
is an unbelievable unbelievabl factory

3321
02:23:54,280 --> 02:24:00,760
system and and it takes those 18

3322
02:23:58,239 --> 02:24:03,399
nutrients and makes those things inside

3323
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:04,989
the plant in that cell where that gland

3324
02:24:03,399 --> 02:24:07,510
is that's why that I thought that

3325
02:24:04,989 --> 02:24:08,799
diagram is phenomenal there are so many

3326
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:11,771
things that are happening in that

3327
02:24:08,799 --> 02:24:15,489
diagram there are 10,000 different

3328
02:24:11,771 --> 02:24:17,980
enzymes making that particular turkey

3329
02:24:15,489 --> 02:24:19,869
that we need it's fascinating and I

3330
02:24:17,979 --> 02:24:22,109
think that maybe Coulomb I don't know if

3331
02:24:19,870 --> 02:24:24,579
you you could speak to how are you seen

3332
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:26,110
biodynamic compost even Jesse you can

3333
02:24:24,579 --> 02:24:28,120
come in after this and I'm totally open

3334
02:24:26,110 --> 02:24:30,130
to anyone asking questions you know from

3335
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:32,771
this moment on and and just that in the

3336
02:24:30,129 --> 02:24:35,139
conversation role but you know make sure

3337
02:24:32,771 --> 02:24:38,290
everyone's you know I'm being able to

3338
02:24:35,139 --> 02:24:40,420
add I just you see my nameks ism is kind

3339
02:24:38,290 --> 02:24:42,430
of a magical you know ancient thing

3340
02:24:40,420 --> 02:24:44,079
that's in our future right now it's

3341
02:24:42,430 --> 02:24:45,430
what's leading us and how have you Eve

3342
02:24:44,079 --> 02:24:47,860
worked with a lot of farms you've seen

3343
02:24:45,430 --> 02:24:50,260
them not use compost then you've seen a

3344
02:24:47,860 --> 02:24:53,409
Muser compost how have you seen farms

3345
02:24:50,260 --> 02:24:55,469
change based off you know using that

3346
02:24:53,409 --> 02:24:59,500
type that type of medium and their gross

3347
02:24:55,469 --> 02:25:02,409
well well I think one way to you know

3348
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:05,920
understand it is you know I always like

3349
02:25:02,409 --> 02:25:08,860
to kind of you know joke that Malibu is

3350
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:12,521
like a gateway drug to Baia dynamics you

3351
02:25:08,860 --> 02:25:14,590
know but biodynamics should be this kind

3352
02:25:12,521 --> 02:25:17,590
of gateway drug to understanding this

3353
02:25:14,590 --> 02:25:19,840
idea that soil is alive the same way

3354
02:25:17,590 --> 02:25:22,710
plants are alive you know we can measure

3355
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:25,299
the respirometer e-rate of our soil but

3356
02:25:22,709 --> 02:25:26,770
you know California won't allow you to

3357
02:25:25,299 --> 02:25:28,689
you use the words health healthy

3358
02:25:26,771 --> 02:25:30,370
healthier and healthiest on any kind of

3359
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:35,829
label you know we've all gone through

3360
02:25:30,370 --> 02:25:38,320
this the you know idea of by dynamics as

3361
02:25:35,829 --> 02:25:40,299
a whole as this idea of creating a micro

3362
02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:43,629
system you know your plant has a true

3363
02:25:40,299 --> 02:25:46,869
war and then there's this to war of your

3364
02:25:43,629 --> 02:25:49,149
own your own garden your own farm your

3365
02:25:46,870 --> 02:25:51,160
own footprint and then it goes into you

3366
02:25:49,149 --> 02:25:53,520
know your valley you know eleven

3367
02:25:51,159 --> 02:25:56,229
different appellations of Malibu of

3368
02:25:53,521 --> 02:25:59,230
Mendocino County or you know the same

3369
02:25:56,229 --> 02:26:02,020
way you see it in wine but it's kind of

3370
02:25:59,229 --> 02:26:05,648
creating this own individual ecosystem

3371
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:08,470
and in that ecosystem you're wanting

3372
02:26:05,648 --> 02:26:12,578
this individual expression of the soil

3373
02:26:08,469 --> 02:26:15,309
and the life in that soil and enhancing

3374
02:26:12,578 --> 02:26:18,100
kind of that uniqueness and so that's

3375
02:26:15,309 --> 02:26:21,158
where you know it comes down there's a

3376
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:22,300
lot of questionable outside inputs that

3377
02:26:21,158 --> 02:26:23,859
you can bring in because then you

3378
02:26:22,299 --> 02:26:25,568
constantly have to look at where do

3379
02:26:23,859 --> 02:26:27,309
those come from or what are those derive

3380
02:26:25,568 --> 02:26:29,648
from what's the background of that is

3381
02:26:27,309 --> 02:26:35,228
there a pesticide or herbicide footprint

3382
02:26:29,648 --> 02:26:36,939
you know anywhere along the way and but

3383
02:26:35,228 --> 02:26:38,469
essentially with this idea of true are

3384
02:26:36,939 --> 02:26:40,210
you're creating this living unique

3385
02:26:38,469 --> 02:26:42,278
ecosystem and and the plants are

3386
02:26:40,209 --> 02:26:46,148
thriving from that and you have this

3387
02:26:42,279 --> 02:26:47,828
kind of spiritual component just in that

3388
02:26:46,148 --> 02:26:49,328
you're understanding that it's an

3389
02:26:47,828 --> 02:26:51,670
expression of the best that you can be

3390
02:26:49,328 --> 02:26:55,270
and biodynamics Rudolf Steiner he also

3391
02:26:51,670 --> 02:26:56,710
founded the Waldorf schools you know I

3392
02:26:55,270 --> 02:26:59,619
was fortunate enough to go to a Waldorf

3393
02:26:56,709 --> 02:27:01,898
School but it's one of the ideas of that

3394
02:26:59,619 --> 02:27:04,600
approach to education you know through

3395
02:27:01,898 --> 02:27:06,788
the class sizes each child should be the

3396
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:07,960
best individual expression of who they

3397
02:27:06,789 --> 02:27:09,609
can be and so there's this idea of

3398
02:27:07,959 --> 02:27:13,538
really kind of trying to reach your own

3399
02:27:09,609 --> 02:27:16,779
full potential and I always caution

3400
02:27:13,539 --> 02:27:18,460
people who will use Malibu compost and

3401
02:27:16,779 --> 02:27:20,229
they say things come alive you know but

3402
02:27:18,459 --> 02:27:22,959
if they're like love the bud density man

3403
02:27:20,228 --> 02:27:25,840
or my buds really popped you know or

3404
02:27:22,959 --> 02:27:28,959
like don't get caught up and looking at

3405
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:32,850
one aspect maybe it's helping everything

3406
02:27:28,959 --> 02:27:36,129
work together but this then should be a

3407
02:27:32,850 --> 02:27:38,380
step forward to realize what more can

3408
02:27:36,129 --> 02:27:40,328
work together what's local it and don't

3409
02:27:38,379 --> 02:27:42,009
fall into the trap of oh well I bought

3410
02:27:40,328 --> 02:27:45,719
this so now I'm just gonna buy more of

3411
02:27:42,010 --> 02:27:48,219
this instead of buying more of that and

3412
02:27:45,719 --> 02:27:50,648
through that you're really able to

3413
02:27:48,219 --> 02:27:52,898
cultivate kind of a different way of

3414
02:27:50,648 --> 02:27:54,908
looking at your own garden you know you

3415
02:27:52,898 --> 02:27:56,528
might not have animals on your farm but

3416
02:27:54,908 --> 02:27:58,478
do you have a riparian corridor through

3417
02:27:56,529 --> 02:28:01,029
the property you know what's the history

3418
02:27:58,478 --> 02:28:02,948
of that landscape you know here in the

3419
02:28:01,029 --> 02:28:04,930
lamin valley or certain other areas

3420
02:28:02,949 --> 02:28:08,310
along the humble Mendocino Coast you

3421
02:28:04,930 --> 02:28:08,309
know the role of salmon the role of

3422
02:28:08,398 --> 02:28:12,340
wildlife that used to go around I always

3423
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:14,170
say does a bear [ __ ] in the woods yes

3424
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:16,360
and it used to eat the salmon and [ __ ]

3425
02:28:14,170 --> 02:28:18,729
that and so you

3426
02:28:16,360 --> 02:28:21,280
have this sort of footprint of that land

3427
02:28:18,729 --> 02:28:22,600
which is going back even a step to when

3428
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:25,110
we're talking about how can these

3429
02:28:22,601 --> 02:28:27,431
terpenes become the best expression but

3430
02:28:25,110 --> 02:28:30,880
understanding that kind of history of

3431
02:28:27,431 --> 02:28:33,310
that biology and I love the term Scot

3432
02:28:30,879 --> 02:28:34,930
I'm stealing that now the animal

3433
02:28:33,310 --> 02:28:37,029
husbandry you know when he talks about

3434
02:28:34,931 --> 02:28:39,880
animal husbandry of microbes you know

3435
02:28:37,030 --> 02:28:42,431
that's that's something that a lot of

3436
02:28:39,879 --> 02:28:43,750
people don't even think about you know

3437
02:28:42,431 --> 02:28:47,771
when they're brewing compost teas or

3438
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:49,959
extracts but thinking about the role of

3439
02:28:47,771 --> 02:28:53,471
that animal husbandry and everything

3440
02:28:49,959 --> 02:28:55,239
that went into our soil you know we do

3441
02:28:53,470 --> 02:28:57,609
make a potting soil we just don't use

3442
02:28:55,239 --> 02:28:59,261
blood meal bone meal feather meal those

3443
02:28:57,610 --> 02:29:00,730
are the quick fixes but those are

3444
02:28:59,261 --> 02:29:03,040
typically coming from a slaughterhouse

3445
02:29:00,729 --> 02:29:04,569
if unless you can control it and you

3446
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:07,771
know where that's come coming from

3447
02:29:04,569 --> 02:29:10,720
that's one of those biological

3448
02:29:07,771 --> 02:29:13,801
microbiological genetic and ethical

3449
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:16,600
footprints on your inputs as well so I

3450
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:18,550
think part of it is it can be sometimes

3451
02:29:16,601 --> 02:29:21,239
as simple as being introduced to a

3452
02:29:18,550 --> 02:29:24,369
simple way of seeing your plants thrive

3453
02:29:21,239 --> 02:29:27,069
that then triggers just a different way

3454
02:29:24,370 --> 02:29:28,750
of thinking about the entire cycle of

3455
02:29:27,069 --> 02:29:32,949
what it means to be a plant what it

3456
02:29:28,750 --> 02:29:35,261
means to raise a plant and let that be

3457
02:29:32,950 --> 02:29:38,320
sort of a stepping stone and that you

3458
02:29:35,261 --> 02:29:40,870
know even adding that biological ethical

3459
02:29:38,319 --> 02:29:43,270
component into it should be you know

3460
02:29:40,870 --> 02:29:45,370
another tool in our bag of you know this

3461
02:29:43,271 --> 02:29:48,400
kicking people off the bottle that we're

3462
02:29:45,370 --> 02:29:50,740
all United for as well yeah I appreciate

3463
02:29:48,399 --> 02:29:53,109
to talk about ethical inputs and not

3464
02:29:50,739 --> 02:29:54,851
using blood and bone and ID even and

3465
02:29:53,110 --> 02:29:57,460
even taking a look at you know mined

3466
02:29:54,851 --> 02:29:59,440
products you know the soft rock

3467
02:29:57,459 --> 02:30:01,300
phosphates and all that stuff I mean I

3468
02:29:59,440 --> 02:30:03,399
think Nick and Liz if they were here

3469
02:30:01,300 --> 02:30:06,069
from Green source would be talking about

3470
02:30:03,399 --> 02:30:08,739
you know the reality of just the

3471
02:30:06,069 --> 02:30:10,959
breakdown of material and having

3472
02:30:08,739 --> 02:30:12,851
different material providing the plant

3473
02:30:10,959 --> 02:30:15,100
really all it needs and all this other

3474
02:30:12,851 --> 02:30:19,060
stuff is just a bunch of carbon

3475
02:30:15,101 --> 02:30:22,060
footprint potential noise and yeah I was

3476
02:30:19,060 --> 02:30:23,591
wondering um I was also wanting to come

3477
02:30:22,060 --> 02:30:25,750
in and just say that you know just a

3478
02:30:23,591 --> 02:30:27,550
side notes that for all of the listeners

3479
02:30:25,750 --> 02:30:29,629
out there the importance of really

3480
02:30:27,550 --> 02:30:32,449
looking into your inputs

3481
02:30:29,629 --> 02:30:33,529
don't trust a label call the company you

3482
02:30:32,450 --> 02:30:35,540
know if you want to know more about

3483
02:30:33,530 --> 02:30:38,090
Malibu compost these guys are the most

3484
02:30:35,540 --> 02:30:39,830
open book in the world they are an

3485
02:30:38,090 --> 02:30:41,750
ethical company because they offer

3486
02:30:39,829 --> 02:30:44,059
information about what it is that they

3487
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:45,620
do you know call the company has find

3488
02:30:44,059 --> 02:30:48,699
out what you're putting in it you just

3489
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:51,140
can't trust a label like I said yeah and

3490
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:52,670
you know that's that's something that

3491
02:30:51,139 --> 02:30:54,829
we've really learned through extracts

3492
02:30:52,670 --> 02:30:58,040
and and what Marcus has done here is has

3493
02:30:54,829 --> 02:31:01,579
created a you know a hash panel which

3494
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:03,680
which is the where you really see what

3495
02:31:01,579 --> 02:31:04,670
what the EM how the inputs have affected

3496
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:06,439
you because you're concentrating

3497
02:31:04,670 --> 02:31:10,819
everything and anything that was

3498
02:31:06,439 --> 02:31:13,639
potentially carcinogenic or or or

3499
02:31:10,819 --> 02:31:15,469
pathogenic pathogenic or whatever you

3500
02:31:13,639 --> 02:31:17,599
know shows up in the hash and I know

3501
02:31:15,469 --> 02:31:19,398
Jesse you're really into your really

3502
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:21,020
work with hashed a lot and I'm wondering

3503
02:31:19,398 --> 02:31:23,719
how you've seen hash change with

3504
02:31:21,020 --> 02:31:26,120
regenerative soils is and different

3505
02:31:23,719 --> 02:31:30,349
farms and also : by the way I like your

3506
02:31:26,120 --> 02:31:33,770
million gazer hoodie Josh and Sondra

3507
02:31:30,350 --> 02:31:35,479
what's up anyway Jesse didn't want to

3508
02:31:33,770 --> 02:31:37,159
talk about hash and regenerative soils

3509
02:31:35,478 --> 02:31:39,309
and how it affects it and anyone else

3510
02:31:37,159 --> 02:31:42,289
can add and I'd love to hear Duke about

3511
02:31:39,309 --> 02:31:43,670
how you boost your chirps a little bit

3512
02:31:42,290 --> 02:31:45,350
more - well and you would just talked

3513
02:31:43,670 --> 02:31:47,659
about your recipe as well let's hear a

3514
02:31:45,350 --> 02:31:52,220
little bit about that recipe - Duke yeah

3515
02:31:47,659 --> 02:31:53,510
um so I guess where I left off was we

3516
02:31:52,219 --> 02:31:56,688
were talking about like the Freak

3517
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:59,148
ferment and all that stuff and keeping

3518
02:31:56,689 --> 02:32:01,040
it as diverse as possible because it's

3519
02:31:59,148 --> 02:32:03,289
not gonna make the orange smell like you

3520
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:08,840
know smoke but whole vice versa with the

3521
02:32:03,290 --> 02:32:11,840
skunk so it's not that we have skunk is

3522
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:14,478
not a terpene blueberry is not a turfy

3523
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:17,540
you know they're they're different

3524
02:32:14,478 --> 02:32:20,719
ratios of the terpenes that are in

3525
02:32:17,540 --> 02:32:23,689
cannabis and certain combinations of

3526
02:32:20,719 --> 02:32:29,719
those ratios that give us the smell of a

3527
02:32:23,689 --> 02:32:33,350
skunk a blueberry etc so the idea is to

3528
02:32:29,719 --> 02:32:36,319
uh to keep everything as diverse as

3529
02:32:33,350 --> 02:32:38,030
possible from you know in my in my firm

3530
02:32:36,319 --> 02:32:41,750
and I mean there's carrots there's

3531
02:32:38,030 --> 02:32:42,949
Tomatoes there's lemons limes from

3532
02:32:41,750 --> 02:32:44,930
different from

3533
02:32:42,949 --> 02:32:49,158
different regions to different types of

3534
02:32:44,930 --> 02:32:52,279
mangoes etc etc etc so if I take that

3535
02:32:49,158 --> 02:32:55,248
ferment and I'll break it down and then

3536
02:32:52,279 --> 02:32:57,918
I add that to it by the time it gets to

3537
02:32:55,248 --> 02:32:59,869
the soil a lot of its murk down already

3538
02:32:57,918 --> 02:33:03,548
but the soil is gonna continue to break

3539
02:32:59,869 --> 02:33:06,439
that down the other the other aspect of

3540
02:33:03,549 --> 02:33:09,049
getting plants to potential I find is

3541
02:33:06,439 --> 02:33:12,439
like in the wild you know their their

3542
02:33:09,049 --> 02:33:15,439
stressors and like like Jeff will say

3543
02:33:12,439 --> 02:33:18,350
and you know sunlight you know UV it's

3544
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:21,918
trying to give itself some sunscreen so

3545
02:33:18,350 --> 02:33:23,748
that would be an instance of indoors or

3546
02:33:21,918 --> 02:33:26,359
you know where we're trying to replicate

3547
02:33:23,748 --> 02:33:28,850
Mother Nature we're gonna give it a

3548
02:33:26,359 --> 02:33:30,559
stressor you know being a very intense

3549
02:33:28,850 --> 02:33:33,918
light and then we're gonna try to

3550
02:33:30,559 --> 02:33:36,648
facilitate its response to that stress

3551
02:33:33,918 --> 02:33:39,770
so if they're wanting to kick in with

3552
02:33:36,648 --> 02:33:42,648
the salicylic acid I might go ahead and

3553
02:33:39,770 --> 02:33:45,168
feed it like a low a low water to give

3554
02:33:42,648 --> 02:33:49,788
it the salicylic acid and then try to

3555
02:33:45,168 --> 02:33:53,809
give it things to to produce more oils

3556
02:33:49,789 --> 02:33:56,418
and resins and like Swami was saying you

3557
02:33:53,809 --> 02:33:58,100
know they do produce smells for a reason

3558
02:33:56,418 --> 02:33:59,718
I mean they're not just doing it just

3559
02:33:58,100 --> 02:34:02,270
for the heck of it they're doing it to

3560
02:33:59,718 --> 02:34:06,738
attract certain things and repel other

3561
02:34:02,270 --> 02:34:08,779
things and I also found that a long long

3562
02:34:06,738 --> 02:34:11,779
time ago I used to go up to Maine and

3563
02:34:08,779 --> 02:34:14,060
work with this old man and he he

3564
02:34:11,779 --> 02:34:15,859
believed and taken a stick and kind of

3565
02:34:14,059 --> 02:34:17,509
whipping plants and he said hey it makes

3566
02:34:15,859 --> 02:34:19,699
them more potent I used to think he was

3567
02:34:17,509 --> 02:34:22,009
crazy then I got there really thinking

3568
02:34:19,699 --> 02:34:23,959
about him like well yeah so like if the

3569
02:34:22,009 --> 02:34:25,998
plants getting nibbled on you know about

3570
02:34:23,959 --> 02:34:27,739
say like rabbits or whatever it's gonna

3571
02:34:25,998 --> 02:34:30,020
want to try to repeal that now how would

3572
02:34:27,738 --> 02:34:32,350
it try to repel that it would want to

3573
02:34:30,020 --> 02:34:35,180
produce something to kind of you know a

3574
02:34:32,350 --> 02:34:37,520
toxin or a poison to try to make that

3575
02:34:35,180 --> 02:34:39,259
rabbit you know say hey don't eat me

3576
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:43,399
anymore you know so maybe it's gonna

3577
02:34:39,259 --> 02:34:45,738
produce more more THC you know higher

3578
02:34:43,398 --> 02:34:48,108
terpene levels to maybe try to stink it

3579
02:34:45,738 --> 02:34:53,389
away you know or keep certain bugs away

3580
02:34:48,109 --> 02:34:55,699
so you know I'm I'm also into triggering

3581
02:34:53,389 --> 02:34:56,958
a response and then trying to facilitate

3582
02:34:55,699 --> 02:34:59,569
that respond

3583
02:34:56,959 --> 02:35:01,519
to the best of my ability as well as

3584
02:34:59,568 --> 02:35:04,788
like urban spectrum of light and

3585
02:35:01,519 --> 02:35:08,299
everything and I'm big on when it comes

3586
02:35:04,789 --> 02:35:10,549
to harvest day giving them a little bit

3587
02:35:08,299 --> 02:35:13,219
like I like to cut my white cycle down

3588
02:35:10,549 --> 02:35:13,879
as the as the Grove you know comes to a

3589
02:35:13,218 --> 02:35:16,218
close

3590
02:35:13,879 --> 02:35:19,009
sometimes I'm down to like ten hours of

3591
02:35:16,218 --> 02:35:21,138
light 14 hours of dark and then on that

3592
02:35:19,009 --> 02:35:23,179
last night you know about an hour so

3593
02:35:21,138 --> 02:35:25,218
before the lights would come back on

3594
02:35:23,179 --> 02:35:27,828
that's where I'm looking to start

3595
02:35:25,218 --> 02:35:29,358
chopping as well cooler temperatures and

3596
02:35:27,828 --> 02:35:32,869
everything trying to replicate like

3597
02:35:29,359 --> 02:35:36,889
autumn and then as far as the the

3598
02:35:32,869 --> 02:35:40,939
breeding goes my primary my primary

3599
02:35:36,888 --> 02:35:42,798
breeding is for medical patients I take

3600
02:35:40,939 --> 02:35:46,759
care of the keys really sick kids that

3601
02:35:42,799 --> 02:35:49,849
have like dystonia autism cerebral palsy

3602
02:35:46,759 --> 02:35:53,238
multiple sclerosis GI problems and stuff

3603
02:35:49,849 --> 02:35:57,558
and it's really interesting to see that

3604
02:35:53,238 --> 02:35:59,658
you know it's not just THC CBD CBG all

3605
02:35:57,558 --> 02:36:03,078
this good stuff like you were saying you

3606
02:35:59,658 --> 02:36:05,838
know it's entourage effect and it's the

3607
02:36:03,078 --> 02:36:08,628
terpene profiles that make these things

3608
02:36:05,838 --> 02:36:12,818
unique and that really makes them truly

3609
02:36:08,629 --> 02:36:17,059
medicine so one cultivar might help with

3610
02:36:12,818 --> 02:36:19,548
incontinence issues with one terpene

3611
02:36:17,058 --> 02:36:23,268
profile of another you know helps with

3612
02:36:19,549 --> 02:36:26,569
the you know seizures and tremors and

3613
02:36:23,269 --> 02:36:28,789
things like that muscle spasms because

3614
02:36:26,568 --> 02:36:33,918
you know I can take two things that have

3615
02:36:28,789 --> 02:36:36,019
the exact amount of THC CBD CBN CBG but

3616
02:36:33,918 --> 02:36:38,748
why do they act differently for this kid

3617
02:36:36,019 --> 02:36:40,488
or myself or any of you this because of

3618
02:36:38,748 --> 02:36:44,148
the turkey in profile and how they all

3619
02:36:40,488 --> 02:36:46,248
act together so I've been doing a lot of

3620
02:36:44,148 --> 02:36:48,408
breeding that goes along with that and

3621
02:36:46,248 --> 02:36:50,808
it's not just like an individual thing

3622
02:36:48,408 --> 02:36:53,418
like where it's medicinal for me it's

3623
02:36:50,808 --> 02:36:56,148
also a medicinal for them and it's also

3624
02:36:53,418 --> 02:36:58,849
medicinal for other folks as well and I

3625
02:36:56,148 --> 02:37:00,769
mean yeah you know it'll screw you up

3626
02:36:58,849 --> 02:37:02,648
like a football bat too you know that's

3627
02:37:00,769 --> 02:37:04,728
all great for people are just you know

3628
02:37:02,648 --> 02:37:09,408
recreationally you know getting stoned

3629
02:37:04,728 --> 02:37:10,818
but um that's primarily where a lot of

3630
02:37:09,408 --> 02:37:14,088
the focus goes is in

3631
02:37:10,818 --> 02:37:17,689
to effect and and part of effect is

3632
02:37:14,088 --> 02:37:19,158
smell and you know though bra chemo type

3633
02:37:17,689 --> 02:37:20,779
and then you know of course I'm trying

3634
02:37:19,158 --> 02:37:23,478
to breathe on pest resistance mode

3635
02:37:20,779 --> 02:37:28,100
resistance structure leaf to cow its

3636
02:37:23,478 --> 02:37:31,608
ratio etc etc so by doing all these

3637
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:35,180
things and being able to grow them in

3638
02:37:31,609 --> 02:37:37,520
soil and keeping things organic and grow

3639
02:37:35,180 --> 02:37:40,279
into potential I get to actually see and

3640
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:43,310
my breeding steps where I'm at you know

3641
02:37:40,279 --> 02:37:44,899
terpene wise cuz I do believe that you

3642
02:37:43,309 --> 02:37:47,958
know that's probably really well the

3643
02:37:44,898 --> 02:37:51,168
most important important things that uh

3644
02:37:47,959 --> 02:37:52,970
that's gonna be able to get awesome that

3645
02:37:51,168 --> 02:37:55,578
sounds great hey I wanted to give a a

3646
02:37:52,969 --> 02:37:56,809
big up to Virginia out there and all the

3647
02:37:55,578 --> 02:37:59,238
breeders and stuff from Virginia I'm

3648
02:37:56,809 --> 02:38:03,549
from Virginia - so when Duke and I get

3649
02:37:59,238 --> 02:38:03,549
together we give big high-five Virginia

3650
02:38:05,289 --> 02:38:10,039
it's awesome place I wish they would uh

3651
02:38:07,879 --> 02:38:12,470
they would change the law and everything

3652
02:38:10,039 --> 02:38:15,979
but that would make it just a little bit

3653
02:38:12,469 --> 02:38:17,238
more awesome and and Jesse go ahead so

3654
02:38:15,978 --> 02:38:20,139
we want to hear what you have to say

3655
02:38:17,238 --> 02:38:23,389
about regenerative farming and terpenes

3656
02:38:20,139 --> 02:38:25,189
um yeah I guess we got to remember the

3657
02:38:23,389 --> 02:38:26,838
infinite complexity of all the stuff

3658
02:38:25,189 --> 02:38:28,488
that we're talking about you know you

3659
02:38:26,838 --> 02:38:30,859
can't say one thing does this or that

3660
02:38:28,488 --> 02:38:33,168
we're about control groups and suppose

3661
02:38:30,859 --> 02:38:37,609
you do a control group you take out the

3662
02:38:33,168 --> 02:38:39,918
universe and all the interesting little

3663
02:38:37,609 --> 02:38:42,379
things that that are at play but I

3664
02:38:39,918 --> 02:38:45,738
definitely think genetics are you know

3665
02:38:42,379 --> 02:38:47,779
first and then having a very diverse

3666
02:38:45,738 --> 02:38:49,698
rhizosphere for those genetics to

3667
02:38:47,779 --> 02:38:52,939
communicate with the biology in the soil

3668
02:38:49,699 --> 02:38:54,859
and and also the connection between us

3669
02:38:52,939 --> 02:38:58,068
you know our own intentions and what

3670
02:38:54,859 --> 02:39:00,918
we're trying to create and when we do

3671
02:38:58,068 --> 02:39:04,088
that as a farm when we actually breed in

3672
02:39:00,918 --> 02:39:06,439
a specific direction I think that's

3673
02:39:04,088 --> 02:39:08,748
probably the most productive to try to

3674
02:39:06,439 --> 02:39:11,779
create a certain terpene profile the

3675
02:39:08,748 --> 02:39:15,139
next would be get like really that that

3676
02:39:11,779 --> 02:39:17,779
soil what you're putting into it and you

3677
02:39:15,139 --> 02:39:20,299
know I I know like I do hundreds of

3678
02:39:17,779 --> 02:39:22,129
different genetics each year and you

3679
02:39:20,299 --> 02:39:24,709
know the ones grown in the exact same

3680
02:39:22,129 --> 02:39:27,010
place and a very similar environment

3681
02:39:24,709 --> 02:39:32,478
as far as the soil and biology goes they

3682
02:39:27,010 --> 02:39:35,620
differ wildly based off of what what the

3683
02:39:32,478 --> 02:39:39,260
genes are what you you know selected for

3684
02:39:35,620 --> 02:39:41,060
and also we we find that the same genes

3685
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:42,260
when we take them and grow them in

3686
02:39:41,059 --> 02:39:46,510
different locations with different

3687
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:49,630
biology will have completely different

3688
02:39:46,510 --> 02:39:51,800
ratios of terpenes and cannabinoids to

3689
02:39:49,629 --> 02:39:55,399
Samantha Miller has even said that she's

3690
02:39:51,799 --> 02:39:58,069
seen clones be completely unrecognizable

3691
02:39:55,399 --> 02:39:59,629
as far as a chemo type goes even though

3692
02:39:58,069 --> 02:40:01,190
they have the exact same genetic based

3693
02:39:59,629 --> 02:40:03,489
off of where they were grown light

3694
02:40:01,190 --> 02:40:05,930
spectrum and biology in the soil and

3695
02:40:03,489 --> 02:40:08,360
other factors that the weather the

3696
02:40:05,930 --> 02:40:13,159
temperature the humidity all these

3697
02:40:08,360 --> 02:40:14,900
things are at play for me in in in for

3698
02:40:13,159 --> 02:40:16,010
hash production at you know I'm looking

3699
02:40:14,899 --> 02:40:20,959
at the genetic what's going to create

3700
02:40:16,010 --> 02:40:23,239
the type of trichome consistency shape

3701
02:40:20,959 --> 02:40:24,259
like we want you know good-sized heads

3702
02:40:23,239 --> 02:40:26,239
we want something that's gonna catch

3703
02:40:24,260 --> 02:40:28,850
well also something will be consistent

3704
02:40:26,239 --> 02:40:31,909
not just a lot of terpenes could be

3705
02:40:28,850 --> 02:40:33,590
pretty volatile and you know certain CBD

3706
02:40:31,909 --> 02:40:36,379
varieties they don't catch well they

3707
02:40:33,590 --> 02:40:38,239
grease out so you know actually looking

3708
02:40:36,379 --> 02:40:40,129
at the physical characteristics of the

3709
02:40:38,239 --> 02:40:41,569
trichomes how it's gonna catch but also

3710
02:40:40,129 --> 02:40:43,099
you want to know that you have the

3711
02:40:41,569 --> 02:40:44,840
cannabinoid profile that you're looking

3712
02:40:43,100 --> 02:40:47,750
for and that you're having something

3713
02:40:44,840 --> 02:40:50,569
interesting with the terpenes and I find

3714
02:40:47,750 --> 02:40:52,819
the best way to do that is building a

3715
02:40:50,569 --> 02:40:54,500
very very diverse living soil attracting

3716
02:40:52,819 --> 02:40:57,860
lots of diversity lots of flowers lots

3717
02:40:54,500 --> 02:40:59,510
of polyculture in your area and then

3718
02:40:57,860 --> 02:41:01,640
really taking care of it making sure no

3719
02:40:59,510 --> 02:41:04,309
dust hits it I don't like to spray with

3720
02:41:01,639 --> 02:41:06,379
even anything I do you know as far as

3721
02:41:04,309 --> 02:41:09,769
nursery I love the natural mystic from

3722
02:41:06,379 --> 02:41:12,199
dragonfly and I love doing I do the 508

3723
02:41:09,770 --> 02:41:14,780
prep which is a horse tell ferment and

3724
02:41:12,200 --> 02:41:17,110
the 501 which is a ground quartz crystal

3725
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:20,120
that's buried in a horn biodynamic

3726
02:41:17,110 --> 02:41:23,000
preparation early on in the spring very

3727
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:24,470
very early veg kind of treatment then at

3728
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:27,170
that point all I try to do is keep them

3729
02:41:24,469 --> 02:41:30,109
as clean as possible so when they do get

3730
02:41:27,170 --> 02:41:32,870
washed and simply Adam is the one who

3731
02:41:30,110 --> 02:41:35,000
does that and he's a savant when it

3732
02:41:32,870 --> 02:41:37,940
comes to just like paying attention to

3733
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:38,629
how to clean trichomes in the best way

3734
02:41:37,940 --> 02:41:42,350
and really

3735
02:41:38,629 --> 02:41:43,728
bring out the the nuances of a planet

3736
02:41:42,350 --> 02:41:46,790
like it's just an amazing gourmet

3737
02:41:43,728 --> 02:41:48,619
experience when you have really perfect

3738
02:41:46,790 --> 02:41:50,210
ice water actually it's just like free

3739
02:41:48,620 --> 02:41:51,979
of any contaminants that's been grown

3740
02:41:50,209 --> 02:41:54,199
living sort that hasn't there's no dust

3741
02:41:51,978 --> 02:41:55,879
nothing's been sprayed it's an

3742
02:41:54,200 --> 02:41:58,640
expression of the art that you put into

3743
02:41:55,879 --> 02:42:00,859
it and then to have that focus of

3744
02:41:58,639 --> 02:42:02,500
intention of cleaning it as well as

3745
02:42:00,860 --> 02:42:05,659
possible so people can really just

3746
02:42:02,500 --> 02:42:08,000
experience that that rich terpene in the

3747
02:42:05,659 --> 02:42:09,590
art that we put into it so I think

3748
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:13,430
everyone needs to remember like we are

3749
02:42:09,590 --> 02:42:15,469
we're artists we are we're in an

3750
02:42:13,430 --> 02:42:17,450
evolutionary process with cannabis we're

3751
02:42:15,469 --> 02:42:19,938
part of the same thing I like to think

3752
02:42:17,450 --> 02:42:21,860
of dogs as a similar relationship is

3753
02:42:19,939 --> 02:42:23,479
with cannabis like when we put intention

3754
02:42:21,860 --> 02:42:26,479
into breeding for a function and

3755
02:42:23,478 --> 02:42:27,949
location how fast we were able to create

3756
02:42:26,478 --> 02:42:30,379
different types of dog breeders it

3757
02:42:27,950 --> 02:42:32,510
breeds it's absolutely astounding we

3758
02:42:30,379 --> 02:42:34,759
look from wolves to having a border

3759
02:42:32,510 --> 02:42:36,680
collie that could understand 2,000

3760
02:42:34,760 --> 02:42:39,370
different commands and move sheep all

3761
02:42:36,680 --> 02:42:42,020
across the landscape I mean that's like

3762
02:42:39,370 --> 02:42:44,270
unbelievably infinitely complex and

3763
02:42:42,020 --> 02:42:46,220
strange that we were able to have that

3764
02:42:44,270 --> 02:42:47,930
relationship with an animal and I really

3765
02:42:46,219 --> 02:42:51,590
believe we have that with with cannabis

3766
02:42:47,930 --> 02:42:54,309
and cannabis is has the most ability to

3767
02:42:51,590 --> 02:42:56,600
create the most diverse phytochemical

3768
02:42:54,309 --> 02:42:58,148
arrangement that we know in a plant so

3769
02:42:56,600 --> 02:43:00,979
we have this ability to create these

3770
02:42:58,148 --> 02:43:05,539
compounds that are you know immensely

3771
02:43:00,978 --> 02:43:07,340
medically important and and but also

3772
02:43:05,540 --> 02:43:09,680
just complex we can create all these

3773
02:43:07,340 --> 02:43:12,559
combinations to do what we need whether

3774
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:16,040
it is you know a psychological effect to

3775
02:43:12,559 --> 02:43:17,659
help I mean they're all medicinal you

3776
02:43:16,040 --> 02:43:19,070
know whether it's it's it's helping your

3777
02:43:17,659 --> 02:43:21,379
own psyche whether it's helping your

3778
02:43:19,069 --> 02:43:23,148
body whether it's helping pain relief

3779
02:43:21,379 --> 02:43:27,829
whether it's antimicrobial antifungal

3780
02:43:23,148 --> 02:43:30,469
whether it's you know just the relaxing

3781
02:43:27,829 --> 02:43:32,780
effects the there's so many things that

3782
02:43:30,469 --> 02:43:36,709
that we can do with this green soybeans

3783
02:43:32,780 --> 02:43:39,140
yeah hey Marcus I and we're talking

3784
02:43:36,709 --> 02:43:41,809
about all these trichomes and everything

3785
02:43:39,139 --> 02:43:44,959
and you you have taken unbelievable

3786
02:43:41,809 --> 02:43:47,600
photos and and thousands and thousands

3787
02:43:44,959 --> 02:43:49,938
of photos of different trichome heads do

3788
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:51,859
you notice a difference between you know

3789
02:43:49,939 --> 02:43:53,929
indoor trichome heads

3790
02:43:51,859 --> 02:43:56,179
host to outdoor or can you tell us a

3791
02:43:53,929 --> 02:43:58,908
little bit about that and soil as

3792
02:43:56,179 --> 02:44:00,918
opposed to maybe hydro I mean more so

3793
02:43:58,908 --> 02:44:04,849
what I can really tell her that I've

3794
02:44:00,918 --> 02:44:06,679
does I've really learned to easily see

3795
02:44:04,849 --> 02:44:09,309
the different types of trichomes the

3796
02:44:06,679 --> 02:44:11,629
capitate stocks which can be quite tall

3797
02:44:09,309 --> 02:44:14,208
sometimes twice as tall on some

3798
02:44:11,629 --> 02:44:16,338
cultivars compared to others not

3799
02:44:14,209 --> 02:44:18,918
necessarily related to being indoor or

3800
02:44:16,338 --> 02:44:21,439
outdoor or close to the equator but

3801
02:44:18,918 --> 02:44:22,668
definitely the sessile stocked which are

3802
02:44:21,439 --> 02:44:24,379
a little bit shorter and then the

3803
02:44:22,668 --> 02:44:27,138
bulbous which are flat and lay on the

3804
02:44:24,379 --> 02:44:29,810
leaves what I've really noticed is that

3805
02:44:27,138 --> 02:44:32,448
all the plants seem to produce all three

3806
02:44:29,809 --> 02:44:35,838
varieties the cultivars that are high in

3807
02:44:32,449 --> 02:44:38,418
CBD seem to often hold a lot of that CBD

3808
02:44:35,838 --> 02:44:40,638
profile inside the bulbous head versus

3809
02:44:38,418 --> 02:44:43,728
the capitate stalk and the sessile as

3810
02:44:40,638 --> 02:44:45,318
mechanical trichome separators whether

3811
02:44:43,728 --> 02:44:47,929
you're using like a bubble bag type

3812
02:44:45,318 --> 02:44:50,179
product or mechanical screens that

3813
02:44:47,929 --> 02:44:52,520
you're bouncing and cleaning over you're

3814
02:44:50,179 --> 02:44:55,908
really only getting from get from dried

3815
02:44:52,520 --> 02:44:57,560
cannabis the the two types they break

3816
02:44:55,908 --> 02:44:59,148
off the easiest leave the capitate

3817
02:44:57,559 --> 02:45:02,028
stalked and the sessile stalk the

3818
02:44:59,148 --> 02:45:05,349
bulbous itself is a little bit harder to

3819
02:45:02,029 --> 02:45:08,569
get off though generally people who make

3820
02:45:05,349 --> 02:45:10,459
solvent extracts or oil like rosin will

3821
02:45:08,568 --> 02:45:13,818
get a much higher yield than they will

3822
02:45:10,459 --> 02:45:16,039
using the same cultivar for ice water

3823
02:45:13,818 --> 02:45:19,128
hash and the reason that is is because

3824
02:45:16,039 --> 02:45:21,259
those bulbous heads are a lot harder to

3825
02:45:19,129 --> 02:45:23,539
get off so I haven't really seen like

3826
02:45:21,259 --> 02:45:25,488
you know and I have taken a lot of

3827
02:45:23,539 --> 02:45:28,579
photos of trichomes I've gone into that

3828
02:45:25,488 --> 02:45:30,618
world really close and I can't really

3829
02:45:28,578 --> 02:45:32,388
say that you know when I'm looking at

3830
02:45:30,619 --> 02:45:34,639
the plant I I would know for a fact

3831
02:45:32,388 --> 02:45:37,309
aside from maybe that when it's like a

3832
02:45:34,638 --> 02:45:39,588
really hardcore field grown cultivar

3833
02:45:37,309 --> 02:45:43,368
well you do tend to see other things

3834
02:45:39,588 --> 02:45:45,259
that have contaminated or added

3835
02:45:43,369 --> 02:45:47,449
themselves on to the plant sometimes

3836
02:45:45,259 --> 02:45:49,539
like a little type of fly or something

3837
02:45:47,449 --> 02:45:52,369
else whereas sometimes in an indoor

3838
02:45:49,539 --> 02:45:54,799
facility it might be like completely

3839
02:45:52,369 --> 02:45:57,139
completely clean but otherwise the the

3840
02:45:54,799 --> 02:45:59,299
trichomes look generally the same that

3841
02:45:57,138 --> 02:46:01,338
sounds really good a lot of talk up here

3842
02:45:59,299 --> 02:46:05,060
in Canada at the moment with

3843
02:46:01,338 --> 02:46:08,750
legalization is with outdoor growing

3844
02:46:05,059 --> 02:46:10,549
the 10,000 CFU microbial count tests on

3845
02:46:08,750 --> 02:46:11,889
the flowers and everyone's nervous that

3846
02:46:10,549 --> 02:46:15,349
they're not going to be able to grow

3847
02:46:11,889 --> 02:46:18,049
flowers outdoors without irradiating the

3848
02:46:15,350 --> 02:46:20,059
weed organically at all we're putting it

3849
02:46:18,049 --> 02:46:23,319
through some kind of process which is

3850
02:46:20,059 --> 02:46:26,119
going to clean the ganja and make it um

3851
02:46:23,319 --> 02:46:29,020
miscible and suitable for you that I

3852
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:31,900
says anyone have any input on that

3853
02:46:29,020 --> 02:46:35,329
outdoor growing and cleanliness maybe

3854
02:46:31,899 --> 02:46:37,010
yeah anyone I I have a little spot if

3855
02:46:35,329 --> 02:46:40,069
you don't mind me jumping in earthquake

3856
02:46:37,010 --> 02:46:42,559
site please Scott thank you so I think

3857
02:46:40,069 --> 02:46:44,899
one of the things that we don't have any

3858
02:46:42,559 --> 02:46:48,319
reference point to or how how these

3859
02:46:44,899 --> 02:46:50,389
microbes actually work and on a really

3860
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:52,639
basic level it's a competition aspect if

3861
02:46:50,389 --> 02:46:54,260
there's something negative on the

3862
02:46:52,639 --> 02:46:56,239
material that means there's not

3863
02:46:54,260 --> 02:46:58,280
something beneficial there to occupy

3864
02:46:56,239 --> 02:47:01,940
that state space and to protect for it

3865
02:46:58,280 --> 02:47:03,560
and so in a lot of the no-till or living

3866
02:47:01,940 --> 02:47:07,579
soil facilities we've worked with in

3867
02:47:03,559 --> 02:47:11,559
other tightly regulated states you know

3868
02:47:07,579 --> 02:47:14,780
if they're failing for coliforms and and

3869
02:47:11,559 --> 02:47:17,209
these increased microbial counts almost

3870
02:47:14,780 --> 02:47:19,010
always they have high values down in

3871
02:47:17,209 --> 02:47:21,949
these disease-causing fungi because it's

3872
02:47:19,010 --> 02:47:24,079
replicated and so from our perspective

3873
02:47:21,950 --> 02:47:25,909
if you're if you're failing tests were

3874
02:47:24,079 --> 02:47:29,629
too high of you know call for forming

3875
02:47:25,909 --> 02:47:31,610
units of something that will grow out on

3876
02:47:29,629 --> 02:47:33,379
a petri dish that means the conditions

3877
02:47:31,610 --> 02:47:35,690
in your soil are more suited to

3878
02:47:33,379 --> 02:47:38,659
disease-causing organisms and so it

3879
02:47:35,690 --> 02:47:40,760
becomes a competition more of a concept

3880
02:47:38,659 --> 02:47:44,389
down in Nevada it's been really

3881
02:47:40,760 --> 02:47:47,300
difficult to navigate the total arrow

3882
02:47:44,389 --> 02:47:50,059
that counts so you can't use something

3883
02:47:47,299 --> 02:47:51,829
like natural mystic it will do a great

3884
02:47:50,059 --> 02:47:53,899
job at knocking back the PM but then you

3885
02:47:51,829 --> 02:47:56,120
can trigger a test for increased

3886
02:47:53,899 --> 02:47:59,239
beneficial organisms which is quite

3887
02:47:56,120 --> 02:48:00,890
insane but if you're growing a really

3888
02:47:59,239 --> 02:48:02,959
healthy soil you don't fail that test

3889
02:48:00,889 --> 02:48:06,109
its but you just you start to see the

3890
02:48:02,959 --> 02:48:07,939
other aspect of it where if you're if

3891
02:48:06,110 --> 02:48:09,409
you're growing a lot of water molds in

3892
02:48:07,940 --> 02:48:12,140
your soil due to your process of your

3893
02:48:09,409 --> 02:48:16,280
inputs you are exponentially more likely

3894
02:48:12,139 --> 02:48:18,689
to fail a test for those same things one

3895
02:48:16,280 --> 02:48:20,851
of the one of the strategies for

3896
02:48:18,690 --> 02:48:22,530
for getting through those tests is using

3897
02:48:20,851 --> 02:48:24,659
organisms that don't culture well on a

3898
02:48:22,530 --> 02:48:26,820
petri dish like the test does so you

3899
02:48:24,659 --> 02:48:28,409
kind of switch to others as a whole

3900
02:48:26,819 --> 02:48:31,229
that's right a nine-hour conversation

3901
02:48:28,409 --> 02:48:33,329
but you know maybe Steve can comment as

3902
02:48:31,229 --> 02:48:36,869
to how he's seen his test results change

3903
02:48:33,329 --> 02:48:38,521
alongside with the soil data and how

3904
02:48:36,870 --> 02:48:40,710
that leads to increased terpenes and

3905
02:48:38,521 --> 02:48:41,940
cannabinoids most people don't know this

3906
02:48:40,709 --> 02:48:44,250
because the information has been quite

3907
02:48:41,940 --> 02:48:46,079
protected from Alleyne but you know the

3908
02:48:44,250 --> 02:48:48,959
populations of organisms needed to

3909
02:48:46,079 --> 02:48:51,479
express properly the CBD and whatnot

3910
02:48:48,959 --> 02:48:54,270
those populations are known

3911
02:48:51,479 --> 02:48:57,689
she doesn't really share them for

3912
02:48:54,271 --> 02:49:00,980
whatever obvious reasons but we just did

3913
02:48:57,690 --> 02:49:03,631
a art we just did an article with

3914
02:49:00,979 --> 02:49:05,819
sun-grown magazine I think it was yeah

3915
02:49:03,630 --> 02:49:09,180
Sanger our magazine and Elaine actually

3916
02:49:05,819 --> 02:49:11,789
revealed those populations which blew my

3917
02:49:09,181 --> 02:49:14,460
mind because you know I had done a

3918
02:49:11,790 --> 02:49:16,591
tremendous amount of manual labor on the

3919
02:49:14,459 --> 02:49:18,209
farm and Saturday dinner table for two

3920
02:49:16,591 --> 02:49:20,851
years before she shared those numbers

3921
02:49:18,209 --> 02:49:23,220
with me so the fact that she's sharing

3922
02:49:20,851 --> 02:49:25,440
them publicly in a magazine shows the

3923
02:49:23,220 --> 02:49:27,421
transition that's happening and and with

3924
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:29,790
the new education so that's that's super

3925
02:49:27,421 --> 02:49:31,681
exciting I'll leave the information to

3926
02:49:29,790 --> 02:49:33,421
Elaine in her own words too to the

3927
02:49:31,681 --> 02:49:35,971
article but do you know that these

3928
02:49:33,421 --> 02:49:37,829
numbers are known and you know it

3929
02:49:35,970 --> 02:49:40,529
correlates with that f2b graph that I

3930
02:49:37,829 --> 02:49:42,421
showed you and the people that have a

3931
02:49:40,530 --> 02:49:43,891
higher fungal biomass are absolutely

3932
02:49:42,421 --> 02:49:46,050
expressing better terpenes and

3933
02:49:43,890 --> 02:49:47,729
cannabinoids so I know Steve you want to

3934
02:49:46,050 --> 02:49:53,819
jump on from the testing side and that

3935
02:49:47,729 --> 02:49:55,680
could be beneficial okay a minute so

3936
02:49:53,819 --> 02:49:56,789
yeah to what Scott was saying and

3937
02:49:55,681 --> 02:49:59,159
everybody for that matter

3938
02:49:56,790 --> 02:50:01,710
I think everybody's right as far as the

3939
02:49:59,159 --> 02:50:05,819
inter Kings go from what our tests have

3940
02:50:01,709 --> 02:50:07,829
shown as far as as far as chemo type

3941
02:50:05,819 --> 02:50:10,050
expression I think we got to also keep

3942
02:50:07,829 --> 02:50:12,989
in mind that there's a variable there

3943
02:50:10,050 --> 02:50:15,750
that hasn't been dialed in yet which is

3944
02:50:12,989 --> 02:50:18,239
the labs are they doing liquid or they

3945
02:50:15,750 --> 02:50:20,459
doing gas things like that there's no

3946
02:50:18,239 --> 02:50:22,319
standardization there so it's hard to to

3947
02:50:20,459 --> 02:50:24,959
properly chemo type or it's not hard

3948
02:50:22,319 --> 02:50:27,209
it's early I don't think all the data is

3949
02:50:24,959 --> 02:50:29,069
there yet because like we've been loyal

3950
02:50:27,209 --> 02:50:30,720
to our labs and they themselves has

3951
02:50:29,069 --> 02:50:31,159
changed their practices which is

3952
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:33,229
scramble

3953
02:50:31,159 --> 02:50:35,719
our data so it's been hard to go back

3954
02:50:33,229 --> 02:50:37,549
and kind of really chase phenotypes and

3955
02:50:35,719 --> 02:50:40,939
chemo types that represent them anyways

3956
02:50:37,549 --> 02:50:42,289
but to that well trying to say is dude

3957
02:50:40,940 --> 02:50:44,870
you're right as far as your light

3958
02:50:42,290 --> 02:50:46,370
spectrum goes as far as your planet

3959
02:50:44,870 --> 02:50:47,930
blaze nutrients making sure the plant

3960
02:50:46,370 --> 02:50:50,150
has everything it needs to produce and

3961
02:50:47,930 --> 02:50:51,771
to make what it needs Swamy you're right

3962
02:50:50,149 --> 02:50:53,840
as far as I'm harvesting at night I

3963
02:50:51,771 --> 02:50:55,641
believe that more leads to the stomata

3964
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:57,200
making sure the stomata is actually

3965
02:50:55,640 --> 02:51:02,000
closed you're not gassing out your terms

3966
02:50:57,200 --> 02:51:03,620
upon harvesting and then as far as Jesse

3967
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:05,360
I mean as far as the Sun nothing goes

3968
02:51:03,620 --> 02:51:06,561
better from the Sun and I'm sure it's

3969
02:51:05,360 --> 02:51:08,601
only a matter of time before you find

3970
02:51:06,560 --> 02:51:11,029
out what is the best moon cycle to

3971
02:51:08,601 --> 02:51:12,460
harvest on and everything as far as that

3972
02:51:11,030 --> 02:51:14,780
and all the magic that goes behind that

3973
02:51:12,459 --> 02:51:17,989
and then Scott's what Scott has been

3974
02:51:14,780 --> 02:51:19,820
saying as far as the f2b ratio yeah they

3975
02:51:17,989 --> 02:51:21,500
have to be ratio again it's just given

3976
02:51:19,819 --> 02:51:23,270
that plant everything it needs and if it

3977
02:51:21,500 --> 02:51:25,280
needs a little something that the fun of

3978
02:51:23,271 --> 02:51:26,811
the fungi is willing to give it then

3979
02:51:25,280 --> 02:51:29,300
yeah you gotta have in the proper ratios

3980
02:51:26,810 --> 02:51:31,819
and one of those things is defense when

3981
02:51:29,299 --> 02:51:34,609
you have beneficial fungi you are a lot

3982
02:51:31,819 --> 02:51:36,590
susceptible to anaerobic or to bad

3983
02:51:34,610 --> 02:51:39,530
pathogenic fungi and we've seen that on

3984
02:51:36,590 --> 02:51:41,420
our data as well the better our or have

3985
02:51:39,530 --> 02:51:43,820
to be ratio the the lesser problems we

3986
02:51:41,420 --> 02:51:54,469
have but again I talked a lot so I'll

3987
02:51:43,819 --> 02:51:57,079
let you guys get back at it yeah when I

3988
02:51:54,469 --> 02:51:59,270
went to attended a conference we were at

3989
02:51:57,079 --> 02:52:04,129
one of the panels was about testing in

3990
02:51:59,271 --> 02:52:07,340
California or new for 90% of the growers

3991
02:52:04,129 --> 02:52:09,560
in the state but the thing is that

3992
02:52:07,340 --> 02:52:12,380
what's the difference between beneficial

3993
02:52:09,560 --> 02:52:14,649
and malevolent microbes are on a leaf or

3994
02:52:12,379 --> 02:52:16,759
on upon a bud or something like that and

3995
02:52:14,649 --> 02:52:18,529
that so far they haven't really

3996
02:52:16,760 --> 02:52:20,659
distinguished what they call a total

3997
02:52:18,530 --> 02:52:22,460
total plate count or something I think

3998
02:52:20,659 --> 02:52:24,619
it just you can connect my words on that

3999
02:52:22,459 --> 02:52:26,689
but the idea is that they still haven't

4000
02:52:24,620 --> 02:52:29,690
really been distinguishing between bad

4001
02:52:26,690 --> 02:52:31,790
and good microbes on a leaf and the

4002
02:52:29,690 --> 02:52:32,989
state is now very aware of that and

4003
02:52:31,790 --> 02:52:35,500
there's been a lot of pressure from

4004
02:52:32,989 --> 02:52:38,659
Kristin Nevada from the International

4005
02:52:35,500 --> 02:52:40,700
cannabis farm services to change that

4006
02:52:38,659 --> 02:52:42,979
and be more aware so the testing people

4007
02:52:40,700 --> 02:52:43,909
were all of a sudden given a task that

4008
02:52:42,979 --> 02:52:47,689
they had never

4009
02:52:43,909 --> 02:52:50,629
done before which is test pesticides for

4010
02:52:47,690 --> 02:52:52,640
cannabis and also the idea that no

4011
02:52:50,629 --> 02:52:55,729
pesticides are really tested for being

4012
02:52:52,640 --> 02:52:58,219
smoked we don't you know bike for

4013
02:52:55,729 --> 02:53:02,060
example Eagle coin it Eagle 20 is okay

4014
02:52:58,219 --> 02:53:04,489
for plums but we don't smoke grape skins

4015
02:53:02,060 --> 02:53:06,680
or plum skins but we do smoke cannabis

4016
02:53:04,489 --> 02:53:09,351
so that's when it changes so they're

4017
02:53:06,680 --> 02:53:10,610
different conditions governing cannabis

4018
02:53:09,351 --> 02:53:12,440
than almost any other thing because

4019
02:53:10,610 --> 02:53:14,870
cannabis is smoked it's made into

4020
02:53:12,440 --> 02:53:16,310
edibles its extracted now one of the

4021
02:53:14,870 --> 02:53:18,260
things they found in terms of some of

4022
02:53:16,310 --> 02:53:20,899
the microbial is that people late in the

4023
02:53:18,260 --> 02:53:22,640
season we're using doctors iams which is

4024
02:53:20,899 --> 02:53:24,890
to prevent certain mildew by an

4025
02:53:22,640 --> 02:53:27,920
enzymatic process but that's then

4026
02:53:24,890 --> 02:53:30,709
detectable as a microbe and also it

4027
02:53:27,920 --> 02:53:32,840
contains yeast to make it happen so that

4028
02:53:30,709 --> 02:53:36,199
being done really late in the season as

4029
02:53:32,840 --> 02:53:38,989
a stopgap measure doesn't happen you

4030
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:40,760
know what I what steve is saying do it

4031
02:53:38,989 --> 02:53:42,110
in the soil in the beginning and your

4032
02:53:40,760 --> 02:53:44,360
plants are healthy and they don't need

4033
02:53:42,110 --> 02:53:47,060
it Scott too so that's the key thing

4034
02:53:44,360 --> 02:53:49,010
that the pesticides now have to be much

4035
02:53:47,060 --> 02:53:50,659
more or not even the pesticide the

4036
02:53:49,010 --> 02:53:52,880
microbial test which people are afraid

4037
02:53:50,659 --> 02:53:54,890
of has to be more specific and more

4038
02:53:52,879 --> 02:53:57,259
sophisticated to say there definitely

4039
02:53:54,890 --> 02:54:01,190
are beneficial microbes that you want on

4040
02:53:57,260 --> 02:54:03,290
there right what happens to it when it's

4041
02:54:01,190 --> 02:54:05,780
smoked as different from when it's eaten

4042
02:54:03,290 --> 02:54:08,120
raw and so they have to be cognizant of

4043
02:54:05,780 --> 02:54:09,860
that so they're only tasked to come out

4044
02:54:08,120 --> 02:54:13,220
with their pesticide regulations in

4045
02:54:09,860 --> 02:54:14,540
California by I think 2022 or something

4046
02:54:13,219 --> 02:54:16,909
like that so they're still in the

4047
02:54:14,540 --> 02:54:19,521
process of doing all that testing to

4048
02:54:16,909 --> 02:54:21,200
find out what really has to be so in the

4049
02:54:19,521 --> 02:54:23,840
beginning in California they said all

4050
02:54:21,200 --> 02:54:25,970
sixty-six normal pesticides no go and

4051
02:54:23,840 --> 02:54:28,340
they're still working at the microbial

4052
02:54:25,969 --> 02:54:31,609
test but the key is if you're going to

4053
02:54:28,340 --> 02:54:33,500
spray anything do it way way early to

4054
02:54:31,610 --> 02:54:35,090
prevent anything from happening and you

4055
02:54:33,500 --> 02:54:37,010
just can't do it onto those delicate

4056
02:54:35,090 --> 02:54:40,430
flowers or the leaves because it will

4057
02:54:37,010 --> 02:54:42,110
test us in microbial good or bad or as I

4058
02:54:40,430 --> 02:54:51,710
like to say if you're going to spray

4059
02:54:42,110 --> 02:54:53,630
anything don't and swanny absolutely we

4060
02:54:51,709 --> 02:54:55,399
can all agree that the microbial testing

4061
02:54:53,629 --> 02:54:57,259
needs more help you know they're just

4062
02:54:55,399 --> 02:54:58,850
now starting to have those

4063
02:54:57,260 --> 02:55:00,859
Shinzon how they're going to be testing

4064
02:54:58,850 --> 02:55:03,290
up here in Canada and I really hope that

4065
02:55:00,859 --> 02:55:05,659
the Canadian laws and the people that

4066
02:55:03,290 --> 02:55:07,160
are making these laws and restrictions

4067
02:55:05,659 --> 02:55:09,109
are listening to what it is that we're

4068
02:55:07,159 --> 02:55:10,879
saying and what the rest of everybody is

4069
02:55:09,109 --> 02:55:13,790
saying because even a dust particle can

4070
02:55:10,879 --> 02:55:18,670
come up on that microbial and it just

4071
02:55:13,790 --> 02:55:18,670
doesn't make any sense at all Simon

4072
02:55:19,299 --> 02:55:24,369
yet to bring up the point about Eagle 22

4073
02:55:22,568 --> 02:55:27,879
and Michael butanol and the difference

4074
02:55:24,370 --> 02:55:29,670
between smoking it when he burned

4075
02:55:27,879 --> 02:55:33,039
Michael butanol which is the active

4076
02:55:29,670 --> 02:55:34,659
fungicide in equal 20 it burns as

4077
02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:37,120
hydrogen cyanide the same stuff we

4078
02:55:34,659 --> 02:55:38,350
killed people in gas chambers so yeah

4079
02:55:37,120 --> 02:55:39,760
that's that's different we need to be

4080
02:55:38,350 --> 02:55:41,140
careful about that we don't and it also

4081
02:55:39,760 --> 02:55:42,398
concentrates and trichomes and it

4082
02:55:41,139 --> 02:55:45,430
concentrates and hash so we're talking

4083
02:55:42,398 --> 02:55:47,318
about extracts we're gonna get a very

4084
02:55:45,430 --> 02:55:50,139
elevated level of that if it's used at

4085
02:55:47,318 --> 02:55:52,959
all and if it's used even on mothers and

4086
02:55:50,139 --> 02:55:54,909
even potentially a generation before we

4087
02:55:52,959 --> 02:55:56,709
will still see it systemically in the

4088
02:55:54,909 --> 02:55:59,590
next generation of clones we've actually

4089
02:55:56,709 --> 02:56:01,509
seen it seven generations we we've seen

4090
02:55:59,590 --> 02:56:03,068
it in seven generations of clones and

4091
02:56:01,510 --> 02:56:05,228
nobody's gone any further than seven

4092
02:56:03,068 --> 02:56:10,079
generations Formica butanol to show up

4093
02:56:05,228 --> 02:56:12,639
so we have to be incredibly even even

4094
02:56:10,079 --> 02:56:14,500
organically yeah yeah even when it's

4095
02:56:12,639 --> 02:56:16,449
taken away from all of the the

4096
02:56:14,500 --> 02:56:18,309
synthetics and that system and it's put

4097
02:56:16,450 --> 02:56:20,350
into a beautiful regenerative cannabis

4098
02:56:18,309 --> 02:56:22,840
garden it's still carrying that micro

4099
02:56:20,350 --> 02:56:24,760
butanol for seven generations and also

4100
02:56:22,840 --> 02:56:25,780
just the health of the plant like you

4101
02:56:24,760 --> 02:56:28,059
know we're trying to get rid of a

4102
02:56:25,780 --> 02:56:30,520
disease and powdery mildew you know I

4103
02:56:28,059 --> 02:56:32,859
guess the reason is for health or to

4104
02:56:30,520 --> 02:56:34,270
sell the product but if there couldn't

4105
02:56:32,859 --> 02:56:38,579
be anything weren't unhealthy for a

4106
02:56:34,270 --> 02:56:42,760
plant planted it's okay have evolved to

4107
02:56:38,579 --> 02:56:43,959
grow with fungus and and have them in

4108
02:56:42,760 --> 02:56:45,700
their system so when you're when you're

4109
02:56:43,959 --> 02:56:47,978
taking them out you're really destroying

4110
02:56:45,700 --> 02:56:49,979
the health of the plant and potentially

4111
02:56:47,978 --> 02:56:53,409
like opening yourself up to other issues

4112
02:56:49,978 --> 02:56:55,629
as far as like you know beneficial

4113
02:56:53,409 --> 02:56:57,039
microbes and stuff in testing I think it

4114
02:56:55,629 --> 02:56:59,500
makes a lot of sense to actually just

4115
02:56:57,040 --> 02:57:02,939
culture out the pathogens so we're

4116
02:56:59,500 --> 02:57:05,379
talking about ecoli the Salmonella the

4117
02:57:02,939 --> 02:57:08,170
Aspergillus those are things that can

4118
02:57:05,379 --> 02:57:10,029
actually be potentially harmful you know

4119
02:57:08,170 --> 02:57:12,010
if you're smoking a joint and getting it

4120
02:57:10,030 --> 02:57:14,050
on your lip so like let's just test the

4121
02:57:12,010 --> 02:57:17,500
actual known pathogens and leave the

4122
02:57:14,049 --> 02:57:19,719
beneficials out of it that's that's my

4123
02:57:17,500 --> 02:57:21,728
thoughts on it and and also to spray

4124
02:57:19,719 --> 02:57:23,679
early on I think is is the way to go if

4125
02:57:21,728 --> 02:57:26,049
you're going to build up that beneficial

4126
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:28,359
population do it really really early I

4127
02:57:26,049 --> 02:57:31,059
do like just no spray you know unless

4128
02:57:28,359 --> 02:57:32,381
little bio dynamics or early on in a

4129
02:57:31,059 --> 02:57:34,300
nursery but

4130
02:57:32,380 --> 02:57:35,979
if you're gonna do it get it right

4131
02:57:34,300 --> 02:57:40,449
before that flowering time get that

4132
02:57:35,979 --> 02:57:43,060
population of beneficials up and not

4133
02:57:40,450 --> 02:57:52,870
need to have to add things later on yeah

4134
02:57:43,060 --> 02:57:56,351
we go ahead can we somehow make sure

4135
02:57:52,870 --> 02:57:59,650
that we've got the ethic the rule that

4136
02:57:56,351 --> 02:58:05,069
if something goes wrong you throw the

4137
02:57:59,649 --> 02:58:07,029
crop out I mean you know the idea is

4138
02:58:05,069 --> 02:58:09,220
California being commercial and they

4139
02:58:07,030 --> 02:58:12,311
can't afford to lose a crop I'm sorry

4140
02:58:09,220 --> 02:58:14,649
you know it just doesn't work that way

4141
02:58:12,310 --> 02:58:17,261
if you've got something wrong with your

4142
02:58:14,649 --> 02:58:20,261
stuff you need to spray maybe you need

4143
02:58:17,261 --> 02:58:23,341
to think about losing on this particular

4144
02:58:20,261 --> 02:58:26,620
one I think it's really important and I

4145
02:58:23,341 --> 02:58:29,229
don't think as a consumer we can over

4146
02:58:26,620 --> 02:58:33,421
over express our desire to make sure

4147
02:58:29,229 --> 02:58:35,800
that we're getting clean organic stuff I

4148
02:58:33,421 --> 02:58:37,841
would like to agree with you on that

4149
02:58:35,800 --> 02:58:40,060
a hundred and fifty percent just being

4150
02:58:37,841 --> 02:58:44,171
at lift on Friday at the business

4151
02:58:40,060 --> 02:58:47,140
conference the first talk I saw was by

4152
02:58:44,171 --> 02:58:48,521
this company called Zeile as Eddy il I

4153
02:58:47,140 --> 02:58:51,069
believe and they were like we've got

4154
02:58:48,521 --> 02:58:53,650
this machine it can do forty kilos an

4155
02:58:51,069 --> 02:58:56,739
hour and if you have twenty thousand

4156
02:58:53,649 --> 02:58:58,449
pounds of moldy pots we can clean it up

4157
02:58:56,739 --> 02:59:01,030
and I was just I was holding my head

4158
02:58:58,450 --> 02:59:02,740
just like that I was like oh no oh this

4159
02:59:01,030 --> 02:59:04,360
is bad this is like the whole this is

4160
02:59:02,739 --> 02:59:05,739
how the whole distillate market got

4161
02:59:04,360 --> 02:59:07,480
produced and I'm not [ __ ] on

4162
02:59:05,739 --> 02:59:09,729
monomolecular medicines it's very

4163
02:59:07,479 --> 02:59:11,470
important but let's just be honest this

4164
02:59:09,729 --> 02:59:13,899
whole distillate and fruit turps is kind

4165
02:59:11,470 --> 02:59:15,671
of like the hot dog of the of the

4166
02:59:13,899 --> 02:59:18,399
cannabis industry right now it's like

4167
02:59:15,671 --> 02:59:20,979
the last leg of prohibition based profit

4168
02:59:18,399 --> 02:59:24,069
margins that people are grasping to the

4169
02:59:20,979 --> 02:59:25,720
best that they can and it just makes me

4170
02:59:24,069 --> 02:59:27,489
nervous to think that instead of that's

4171
02:59:25,720 --> 02:59:29,261
why I'm so happy with this panel today

4172
02:59:27,489 --> 02:59:33,369
because it's like being able to learn

4173
02:59:29,261 --> 02:59:37,120
the information and put it into practice

4174
02:59:33,370 --> 02:59:39,011
is got to be much more effective and a

4175
02:59:37,120 --> 02:59:42,431
better use of your time than trying to

4176
02:59:39,011 --> 02:59:43,039
buy $48,000 machines that can clean your

4177
02:59:42,431 --> 02:59:46,520
20

4178
02:59:43,039 --> 02:59:48,498
and pounds of multi puppets thank you

4179
02:59:46,520 --> 02:59:51,649
Jeff and Mark for saying that that's so

4180
02:59:48,498 --> 02:59:54,349
true I was standing next to a arousing

4181
02:59:51,648 --> 02:59:57,558
tress talking to Lindsay there Eddie

4182
02:59:54,349 --> 03:00:01,849
well I think the rosin press and the guy

4183
02:59:57,558 --> 03:00:04,038
came up and said so does this get rid of

4184
03:00:01,849 --> 03:00:05,988
the pathogens when you press it when you

4185
03:00:04,039 --> 03:00:08,869
get the material at the end if you have

4186
03:00:05,988 --> 03:00:11,599
like some problem you know flowers will

4187
03:00:08,869 --> 03:00:14,270
will it get rid of it you say no it's

4188
03:00:11,599 --> 03:00:16,219
kind of like golden gold out or if it's

4189
03:00:14,270 --> 03:00:17,929
bad young and then it's bad coming out

4190
03:00:16,218 --> 03:00:19,878
and I think Jeff you're right it's true

4191
03:00:17,929 --> 03:00:21,828
it's very hard and I think that's why we

4192
03:00:19,879 --> 03:00:25,969
need to support each other so much in

4193
03:00:21,828 --> 03:00:28,038
this endeavor is to be able to support

4194
03:00:25,968 --> 03:00:29,838
each other to try and make the right

4195
03:00:28,039 --> 03:00:32,719
decisions and have faith and I want to

4196
03:00:29,838 --> 03:00:35,029
say that you know spring early on and

4197
03:00:32,718 --> 03:00:37,009
establishing a good vegetative health in

4198
03:00:35,029 --> 03:00:40,549
your plants and then utilizing predator

4199
03:00:37,009 --> 03:00:42,978
mites is a way of helping you maintain

4200
03:00:40,549 --> 03:00:44,659
the vitality within your plants and

4201
03:00:42,978 --> 03:00:46,698
maintain the immune system because there

4202
03:00:44,658 --> 03:00:49,189
is an immune system within plants just

4203
03:00:46,699 --> 03:00:51,139
like us and when we maintain the immune

4204
03:00:49,189 --> 03:00:54,259
systems through a proper soil through

4205
03:00:51,138 --> 03:00:56,988
proper testing then we have the plant

4206
03:00:54,259 --> 03:00:59,869
you know off-gassing pheromones and

4207
03:00:56,988 --> 03:01:02,599
stuff that repel the pests and the

4208
03:00:59,869 --> 03:01:04,789
pathogen tend then we have the the

4209
03:01:02,599 --> 03:01:07,219
predator mites that stay on the plant

4210
03:01:04,789 --> 03:01:08,869
during the flower cycle until towards

4211
03:01:07,218 --> 03:01:11,328
the end they come off and and we're not

4212
03:01:08,869 --> 03:01:13,879
seeing predator mites on the the flowers

4213
03:01:11,328 --> 03:01:17,359
at the very end but they help keep the

4214
03:01:13,879 --> 03:01:21,079
pathogens away and enable you to not

4215
03:01:17,359 --> 03:01:22,609
spray towards the end so it's and it's

4216
03:01:21,078 --> 03:01:25,009
also like you know the knee-jerk

4217
03:01:22,609 --> 03:01:26,809
reaction and in the way that allopathic

4218
03:01:25,009 --> 03:01:28,488
medicine you know I always go back to

4219
03:01:26,808 --> 03:01:30,618
health and well-being of humans just

4220
03:01:28,488 --> 03:01:32,088
because it's what makes sense to me you

4221
03:01:30,619 --> 03:01:34,399
know it's no different than you get a

4222
03:01:32,088 --> 03:01:35,929
tiny sniffle and you run out as fast as

4223
03:01:34,398 --> 03:01:38,058
you can to the doctor and you get a

4224
03:01:35,929 --> 03:01:40,638
whole round of 10-day antibiotics

4225
03:01:38,058 --> 03:01:42,618
because of a small sniffle you know it's

4226
03:01:40,638 --> 03:01:45,108
really important to look at that sniffle

4227
03:01:42,619 --> 03:01:47,088
or possibly bugs or a small outbreak

4228
03:01:45,109 --> 03:01:49,668
that you have and look at the whole

4229
03:01:47,088 --> 03:01:51,408
entire system like Scott was saying and

4230
03:01:49,668 --> 03:01:53,088
as well as Steve was saying because

4231
03:01:51,408 --> 03:01:55,248
they're dealing with indoor situations

4232
03:01:53,088 --> 03:01:56,819
you know outdoor you can deal with it a

4233
03:01:55,248 --> 03:01:59,340
lot better by utilizing

4234
03:01:56,819 --> 03:02:01,319
companion plants but you know not having

4235
03:01:59,340 --> 03:02:02,729
that genie jerk reaction if one thing

4236
03:02:01,319 --> 03:02:04,409
comes into your guard and that's a

4237
03:02:02,729 --> 03:02:07,261
pathogen you know how can we deal with

4238
03:02:04,409 --> 03:02:09,271
it more holistically to bring up the

4239
03:02:07,261 --> 03:02:12,319
immune response of both the microbes the

4240
03:02:09,271 --> 03:02:12,320
soil and the plant

4241
03:02:14,170 --> 03:02:20,750
and that is the future we believe

4242
03:02:17,898 --> 03:02:23,799
through the testing and through the

4243
03:02:20,750 --> 03:02:29,049
reality of everything that's happening

4244
03:02:23,799 --> 03:02:32,139
I mean all of the talk of soil brings us

4245
03:02:29,049 --> 03:02:34,269
you know to the trichomes and I don't

4246
03:02:32,139 --> 03:02:36,699
know if anyone has any more input they'd

4247
03:02:34,270 --> 03:02:38,739
like to put into the soil but it might

4248
03:02:36,700 --> 03:02:40,990
be worth talking about how to cure the

4249
03:02:38,739 --> 03:02:42,760
plant you know to preserve the trichome

4250
03:02:40,989 --> 03:02:45,068
and preserve the work if the soils done

4251
03:02:42,760 --> 03:02:47,109
I don't know what people think and and

4252
03:02:45,068 --> 03:02:50,379
also so microbial tests don't come up

4253
03:02:47,109 --> 03:02:52,840
just in your cure I was gonna mention

4254
03:02:50,379 --> 03:02:54,369
earlier when Jeff was talking about the

4255
03:02:52,840 --> 03:02:56,590
different organisms that need to be

4256
03:02:54,370 --> 03:02:58,510
present in the soil for the trichome for

4257
03:02:56,590 --> 03:03:00,460
the plant for the genetics to actually

4258
03:02:58,510 --> 03:03:02,739
be able to properly express itself to

4259
03:03:00,459 --> 03:03:04,478
its maximum potential and I thought you

4260
03:03:02,739 --> 03:03:06,059
know a way to be able to tell if these

4261
03:03:04,478 --> 03:03:08,289
particular microbes are really

4262
03:03:06,059 --> 03:03:11,289
influencing the terpene production etc

4263
03:03:08,290 --> 03:03:13,630
would be in the essential oil world like

4264
03:03:11,290 --> 03:03:16,120
lavender is considered the best in this

4265
03:03:13,629 --> 03:03:17,949
one region of France it's kind of like

4266
03:03:16,120 --> 03:03:20,020
the top quality lavender for whatever

4267
03:03:17,950 --> 03:03:21,880
reason it grows in the soil there and

4268
03:03:20,020 --> 03:03:24,579
the whole environment that just creates

4269
03:03:21,879 --> 03:03:26,199
this this beautiful terpene expression

4270
03:03:24,579 --> 03:03:27,909
of lavender I'm sure most people that

4271
03:03:26,200 --> 03:03:30,850
have experienced lavender know French

4272
03:03:27,909 --> 03:03:32,170
lavender versus German lavender and I

4273
03:03:30,850 --> 03:03:34,059
wonder if that would be a neat way to

4274
03:03:32,170 --> 03:03:36,700
kind of check that out and and if

4275
03:03:34,059 --> 03:03:40,148
cannabis will find itself in a place

4276
03:03:36,700 --> 03:03:43,149
where you know specific cultivars grown

4277
03:03:40,148 --> 03:03:45,909
in specific areas we'll just we'll just

4278
03:03:43,148 --> 03:03:48,369
express themselves in the way that it

4279
03:03:45,909 --> 03:03:52,299
won't anywhere else and I talked about

4280
03:03:48,370 --> 03:03:54,220
that a little bit it's that's exactly

4281
03:03:52,299 --> 03:03:56,619
what tewara is all about and you brought

4282
03:03:54,219 --> 03:03:58,809
up a wonderful beautiful example one of

4283
03:03:56,620 --> 03:04:01,500
the other examples about terroir is like

4284
03:03:58,809 --> 03:04:03,489
for example Roquefort cheese alright

4285
03:04:01,500 --> 03:04:05,260
special thing even if you're trying to

4286
03:04:03,489 --> 03:04:07,239
make blue cheese somewhere else it's not

4287
03:04:05,260 --> 03:04:09,450
going to be quite like Roquefort cheese

4288
03:04:07,239 --> 03:04:12,430
right there's also a thing about

4289
03:04:09,450 --> 03:04:14,920
consistency if we talk about wine for

4290
03:04:12,430 --> 03:04:16,689
example and there are regions they know

4291
03:04:14,920 --> 03:04:18,670
that certain grapes grow best in certain

4292
03:04:16,689 --> 03:04:21,090
areas because of the humidity how many

4293
03:04:18,670 --> 03:04:24,129
days above frost how many days of

4294
03:04:21,090 --> 03:04:25,870
humidity and so on but there's also the

4295
03:04:24,129 --> 03:04:28,809
question of what is what is the human

4296
03:04:25,870 --> 03:04:31,740
content there and so the idea that we

4297
03:04:28,809 --> 03:04:34,959
have a wine that every year is different

4298
03:04:31,739 --> 03:04:37,148
even though it's actually the same right

4299
03:04:34,959 --> 03:04:37,658
we change seeds every year but in the

4300
03:04:37,148 --> 03:04:40,628
wine

4301
03:04:37,658 --> 03:04:43,238
devine stays the same and actually the

4302
03:04:40,629 --> 03:04:46,119
the actual strain that they're rafting

4303
03:04:43,238 --> 03:04:47,918
on to the vine is the same and so the

4304
03:04:46,119 --> 03:04:50,379
only thing that really changes most

4305
03:04:47,918 --> 03:04:52,088
likely is first of all the weather and

4306
03:04:50,379 --> 03:04:53,890
that's the most important that's a

4307
03:04:52,088 --> 03:04:55,478
different every year but then of course

4308
03:04:53,889 --> 03:04:57,458
in the process they might blend it a

4309
03:04:55,478 --> 03:04:59,588
little differently as well but the key

4310
03:04:57,459 --> 03:05:02,890
difference would be the weather so the

4311
03:04:59,588 --> 03:05:04,959
tail in the reason is the character of

4312
03:05:02,889 --> 03:05:07,748
it that comes from the micro micro biome

4313
03:05:04,959 --> 03:05:09,939
and the human interaction right and then

4314
03:05:07,748 --> 03:05:14,109
there's there's this quarter of quality

4315
03:05:09,939 --> 03:05:15,998
which is funny of a particular thing and

4316
03:05:14,109 --> 03:05:18,279
that's what happens that year because of

4317
03:05:15,998 --> 03:05:20,289
the weather and we know canvas likewise

4318
03:05:18,279 --> 03:05:23,949
it has a huge difference from year to

4319
03:05:20,289 --> 03:05:25,959
year even that same that same strain

4320
03:05:23,949 --> 03:05:27,759
grown in the same place at the same time

4321
03:05:25,959 --> 03:05:29,529
in the same garden will be different

4322
03:05:27,759 --> 03:05:32,439
from year to year because of the weather

4323
03:05:29,529 --> 03:05:34,658
so we don't need to expect any kind of

4324
03:05:32,439 --> 03:05:37,119
consistency and celebrate the diversity

4325
03:05:34,658 --> 03:05:40,359
because the plant then is the expression

4326
03:05:37,119 --> 03:05:44,129
of its microclimate of its total soil

4327
03:05:40,359 --> 03:05:46,270
and human and climate interaction and

4328
03:05:44,129 --> 03:05:48,520
just to change this up a little bit I

4329
03:05:46,270 --> 03:05:50,439
think what Jeff said about ethics is one

4330
03:05:48,520 --> 03:05:53,319
of the key things that that we all have

4331
03:05:50,439 --> 03:05:55,389
to carry with us that we are claiming

4332
03:05:53,318 --> 03:05:59,408
we're making medicine or I like to call

4333
03:05:55,389 --> 03:06:01,568
it inspiration people and that that

4334
03:05:59,408 --> 03:06:04,689
carries the ethical responsibility to

4335
03:06:01,568 --> 03:06:06,189
deliver a clean pure product but not

4336
03:06:04,689 --> 03:06:08,979
just clean pure in terms of the

4337
03:06:06,189 --> 03:06:11,259
chemistry etc etc but in terms of your

4338
03:06:08,978 --> 03:06:13,509
intention and in terms of every other

4339
03:06:11,259 --> 03:06:16,238
way which you go about this in of

4340
03:06:13,509 --> 03:06:17,918
actually producing cannabis and all the

4341
03:06:16,238 --> 03:06:21,878
way through the drying process the

4342
03:06:17,918 --> 03:06:23,709
trimming process and all of that so so

4343
03:06:21,879 --> 03:06:25,929
picks up the vibe of everything along

4344
03:06:23,709 --> 03:06:28,209
the way the epigenetic change that

4345
03:06:25,929 --> 03:06:30,248
happens from the time of its sprouted

4346
03:06:28,209 --> 03:06:33,549
with your blessing until it's actually

4347
03:06:30,248 --> 03:06:36,279
consumed by the person partaking of this

4348
03:06:33,549 --> 03:06:39,279
have become sacrament if it's all done

4349
03:06:36,279 --> 03:06:41,020
ethically with with a high intent and

4350
03:06:39,279 --> 03:06:43,119
all of that has to do with the purity

4351
03:06:41,020 --> 03:06:45,869
and starting right right with the tiny

4352
03:06:43,119 --> 03:06:45,869
sprout the seeds

4353
03:06:47,440 --> 03:06:53,560
think I thank you for that that's really

4354
03:06:49,239 --> 03:06:55,630
beautiful there's two there's a couple

4355
03:06:53,560 --> 03:06:58,690
types of keyring there's people up in

4356
03:06:55,630 --> 03:07:00,850
places that will be like I can cure my

4357
03:06:58,690 --> 03:07:02,829
plant within seven days and get it to

4358
03:07:00,851 --> 03:07:04,091
the market it smells great it's super

4359
03:07:02,829 --> 03:07:05,950
good it's the way to do it there's

4360
03:07:04,091 --> 03:07:08,950
people to say you have to have your

4361
03:07:05,950 --> 03:07:11,561
plants totally sold on the market by two

4362
03:07:08,950 --> 03:07:13,271
weeks otherwise you're just you have old

4363
03:07:11,560 --> 03:07:14,681
weed and that's just no good anymore

4364
03:07:13,271 --> 03:07:17,320
also there's register there's

4365
03:07:14,681 --> 03:07:18,761
regulations in Oregon and also in

4366
03:07:17,319 --> 03:07:20,800
California I believe that they're

4367
03:07:18,761 --> 03:07:22,841
writing about how long you can keep your

4368
03:07:20,800 --> 03:07:24,699
plants hanging yeah and there's you know

4369
03:07:22,841 --> 03:07:27,521
you have to what you have to weigh your

4370
03:07:24,700 --> 03:07:29,381
ganja in a tote wet and then you have to

4371
03:07:27,521 --> 03:07:31,780
dry it and then put it back in a tote

4372
03:07:29,380 --> 03:07:34,689
and weigh it again there's people that

4373
03:07:31,780 --> 03:07:38,620
appreciate the Sloat here which is say a

4374
03:07:34,690 --> 03:07:41,319
60 degrees 60% humidity I'm hanging on a

4375
03:07:38,620 --> 03:07:43,540
line for maybe two to three weeks maybe

4376
03:07:41,319 --> 03:07:44,921
a month some might even say depending on

4377
03:07:43,540 --> 03:07:47,471
what kind of hash they like they might

4378
03:07:44,921 --> 03:07:50,470
let it sit for two months in a really

4379
03:07:47,470 --> 03:07:53,409
good environment some people Alf and

4380
03:07:50,470 --> 03:07:57,100
grill glow Craig keeps it in boxes and a

4381
03:07:53,409 --> 03:07:59,229
room and and in the whole room is his 50

4382
03:07:57,101 --> 03:08:00,489
degrees 50 percent humidity and he can

4383
03:07:59,229 --> 03:08:03,850
keep it in there and keep the integrity

4384
03:08:00,489 --> 03:08:06,729
of his flowers does anyone have anything

4385
03:08:03,851 --> 03:08:10,421
to input on their the way to cure

4386
03:08:06,729 --> 03:08:13,511
properly for the market and yes and for

4387
03:08:10,421 --> 03:08:16,511
microbial council yeah I'd like to know

4388
03:08:13,511 --> 03:08:17,560
that one current well everybody's kind

4389
03:08:16,511 --> 03:08:19,540
of saying though it's all kind of

4390
03:08:17,560 --> 03:08:21,579
connected from like having a healthy

4391
03:08:19,540 --> 03:08:23,230
soil will help you while the plants

4392
03:08:21,579 --> 03:08:25,209
plugged into it but then after that you

4393
03:08:23,229 --> 03:08:26,680
got to have a healthy chain of commands

4394
03:08:25,209 --> 03:08:28,779
and make sure that your facility is

4395
03:08:26,681 --> 03:08:31,181
clean and that your dry room is clean

4396
03:08:28,780 --> 03:08:33,521
and not only as they clean and able to

4397
03:08:31,181 --> 03:08:35,710
dry your cannabis slow and low but that

4398
03:08:33,521 --> 03:08:38,320
isn't the conditions to grow molding

4399
03:08:35,709 --> 03:08:40,720
yeast and it's not full of asteroid

4400
03:08:38,319 --> 03:08:43,329
Aeolus your areas cheer up here it's for

4401
03:08:40,720 --> 03:08:45,239
it's filtered and all and so on and so

4402
03:08:43,329 --> 03:08:48,729
forth that you don't have a humidifier

4403
03:08:45,239 --> 03:08:50,979
blowing water mold into your in all

4404
03:08:48,729 --> 03:08:53,171
kinds of things onto your plants and

4405
03:08:50,979 --> 03:08:54,729
then and then beyond that that it goes

4406
03:08:53,171 --> 03:08:57,411
into the trim room while your trimmers

4407
03:08:54,729 --> 03:08:58,790
wearing masks do they have clean

4408
03:08:57,411 --> 03:09:00,411
because again they are testing for

4409
03:08:58,790 --> 03:09:03,859
coliforms e.coli and things of that

4410
03:09:00,411 --> 03:09:06,171
nature so I the process starts when it's

4411
03:09:03,860 --> 03:09:08,931
plugged into the soil but it doesn't end

4412
03:09:06,171 --> 03:09:09,979
until it gets into the consumers hand so

4413
03:09:08,931 --> 03:09:12,261
that's what I got make sure your

4414
03:09:09,979 --> 03:09:15,140
packaging in a humidity controlled

4415
03:09:12,261 --> 03:09:16,911
environment and a temperature controlled

4416
03:09:15,140 --> 03:09:18,440
environment and that you actually are

4417
03:09:16,911 --> 03:09:20,271
working with the proper lab that will

4418
03:09:18,440 --> 03:09:22,190
give you the data that I'll show you

4419
03:09:20,271 --> 03:09:24,530
because that way you can take the data

4420
03:09:22,190 --> 03:09:26,060
and depending on what the data says you

4421
03:09:24,530 --> 03:09:27,831
can see where the problem originated

4422
03:09:26,060 --> 03:09:29,841
from I'm depending on what it is

4423
03:09:27,831 --> 03:09:31,700
specifically and how high your numbers

4424
03:09:29,841 --> 03:09:33,649
are so if you have a high mold and yeast

4425
03:09:31,700 --> 03:09:36,440
yes it became on the plant when the

4426
03:09:33,649 --> 03:09:38,899
plant was alive but the odds are it grew

4427
03:09:36,440 --> 03:09:41,001
in your drying room if you have an

4428
03:09:38,899 --> 03:09:43,100
e.coli or a coliform that things like

4429
03:09:41,001 --> 03:09:44,720
that you have the chance that yeah your

4430
03:09:43,101 --> 03:09:46,610
grower might touch the soil then touch

4431
03:09:44,720 --> 03:09:49,220
the plant without washing his hands or

4432
03:09:46,610 --> 03:09:50,440
you have a bad tremor that's not washing

4433
03:09:49,220 --> 03:09:54,050
his hands have to go into the bathroom

4434
03:09:50,440 --> 03:09:56,541
so being able to actually analyze the

4435
03:09:54,050 --> 03:09:59,060
test results to better do your job isn't

4436
03:09:56,540 --> 03:10:01,520
it be key going forward and that's what

4437
03:09:59,060 --> 03:10:04,601
the science and in the growing kind of

4438
03:10:01,521 --> 03:10:04,601
come together is pretty cool

4439
03:10:08,649 --> 03:10:14,870
Swami do you anything to say about that

4440
03:10:10,940 --> 03:10:17,121
since you're a judge yeah dry and curing

4441
03:10:14,870 --> 03:10:21,470
is sort of things that we really discuss

4442
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:25,640
a lot here at at what are we calling

4443
03:10:21,470 --> 03:10:28,640
specific and the reason is that that is

4444
03:10:25,640 --> 03:10:30,350
is the final process the final test of

4445
03:10:28,640 --> 03:10:34,161
you're paying attention to the whole

4446
03:10:30,351 --> 03:10:36,560
thing if you look up tabac go it takes

4447
03:10:34,161 --> 03:10:38,421
three years after tobacco's cut by the

4448
03:10:36,560 --> 03:10:40,399
time it's ready to roll into cigarettes

4449
03:10:38,421 --> 03:10:44,050
and they toasted and dried and cured

4450
03:10:40,399 --> 03:10:46,640
into all these things and thinking okay

4451
03:10:44,050 --> 03:10:48,470
anything after two weeks is no longer

4452
03:10:46,640 --> 03:10:50,751
any good well as a judge in the

4453
03:10:48,470 --> 03:10:53,210
emerald-cut Nikki and I we get to smoke

4454
03:10:50,751 --> 03:10:55,661
all everybody's brand-new can that's

4455
03:10:53,210 --> 03:10:58,010
right and we actually can't wait

4456
03:10:55,661 --> 03:11:02,390
actually three to four months after

4457
03:10:58,011 --> 03:11:04,461
harvest to grow to smoke our own in fact

4458
03:11:02,390 --> 03:11:08,859
right now we're still mostly smoking

4459
03:11:04,460 --> 03:11:08,859
from from 2016 harvest

4460
03:11:10,800 --> 03:11:15,510
of the the curing and the all of that to

4461
03:11:13,979 --> 03:11:18,479
make it until it gets to the actual

4462
03:11:15,511 --> 03:11:20,159
patient person and the thing that I'm

4463
03:11:18,479 --> 03:11:22,079
finding is really the most important is

4464
03:11:20,159 --> 03:11:26,190
to get away from plastic as much as we

4465
03:11:22,079 --> 03:11:27,720
can in our packaging and and as much as

4466
03:11:26,190 --> 03:11:29,521
possible even we're hoping to eventually

4467
03:11:27,720 --> 03:11:32,189
be just trimming directly into stainless

4468
03:11:29,521 --> 03:11:35,251
tubs and then from there it goes right

4469
03:11:32,190 --> 03:11:37,381
into the violet glass jars that are

4470
03:11:35,251 --> 03:11:39,149
ultra violet friendly and all and just

4471
03:11:37,380 --> 03:11:43,199
continue to cure we just find that to be

4472
03:11:39,149 --> 03:11:44,671
so important and and to really so many

4473
03:11:43,200 --> 03:11:46,860
people they'll spend months and months

4474
03:11:44,671 --> 03:11:49,800
you know growing a beautiful plant and

4475
03:11:46,860 --> 03:11:51,751
then forget in the end to treat it with

4476
03:11:49,800 --> 03:11:53,430
kid gloves you know just be so careful

4477
03:11:51,751 --> 03:11:55,200
you can't be careful enough I want to

4478
03:11:53,431 --> 03:11:57,211
talk more about the actual drawing thing

4479
03:11:55,200 --> 03:12:00,690
Nicky came in a little late to jump but

4480
03:11:57,210 --> 03:12:03,180
the drying is we have a barn that's a

4481
03:12:00,690 --> 03:12:05,671
wooden barn basically and we emptied it

4482
03:12:03,181 --> 03:12:07,409
totally out and sprayed it with Clorox

4483
03:12:05,671 --> 03:12:11,550
on the thing and let it air out for a

4484
03:12:07,409 --> 03:12:14,310
bunch of stuff a very mild cloris inside

4485
03:12:11,550 --> 03:12:16,649
that was on the advice of Chris Van Hook

4486
03:12:14,310 --> 03:12:19,380
from from clean green and then it was

4487
03:12:16,649 --> 03:12:21,210
open there and then we hung our plants

4488
03:12:19,380 --> 03:12:25,171
up with plenty of room around them and

4489
03:12:21,210 --> 03:12:26,789
we had dehumidifier which we didn't

4490
03:12:25,171 --> 03:12:31,319
really need this year we needed it last

4491
03:12:26,790 --> 03:12:33,381
year but we like to go sixty sixty

4492
03:12:31,319 --> 03:12:36,181
percent humidity in about sixty degree

4493
03:12:33,380 --> 03:12:38,460
temperature in total darkness

4494
03:12:36,181 --> 03:12:40,890
and to hang as much as the planner as

4495
03:12:38,460 --> 03:12:44,609
long as the stem as you can upside down

4496
03:12:40,890 --> 03:12:46,770
and ten days to two weeks but it all

4497
03:12:44,610 --> 03:12:49,560
really depends on the exterior humidity

4498
03:12:46,771 --> 03:12:51,780
that that you've got there and so you

4499
03:12:49,560 --> 03:12:55,229
constantly have to monitor your D

4500
03:12:51,780 --> 03:12:57,271
humidity through your machine and make

4501
03:12:55,229 --> 03:12:59,069
sure you're blowing in ways it isn't

4502
03:12:57,271 --> 03:13:02,341
hitting the plants and things like this

4503
03:12:59,069 --> 03:13:05,279
so that and then you have to check in

4504
03:13:02,341 --> 03:13:08,280
and when the when the smaller little

4505
03:13:05,280 --> 03:13:10,681
stems start to crack then you know it's

4506
03:13:08,280 --> 03:13:12,480
time to take it down and bucket and put

4507
03:13:10,681 --> 03:13:14,579
it in the toast but this is you know you

4508
03:13:12,479 --> 03:13:18,689
really have to keep monitoring this

4509
03:13:14,579 --> 03:13:22,050
process if I say 60 60 is what we like

4510
03:13:18,690 --> 03:13:24,030
to go for and sometimes if it's really

4511
03:13:22,050 --> 03:13:24,760
really damp and humid and more waste

4512
03:13:24,030 --> 03:13:26,350
outside and

4513
03:13:24,760 --> 03:13:28,630
another climate you'd want to you know

4514
03:13:26,350 --> 03:13:29,979
pop it at 40 for maybe a day or

4515
03:13:28,629 --> 03:13:32,829
something like that and bring it up

4516
03:13:29,978 --> 03:13:36,579
we're very lucky because our barn is in

4517
03:13:32,829 --> 03:13:39,129
the shade of a Douglas fir forests that

4518
03:13:36,579 --> 03:13:41,500
are you know 300 years old these cheese

4519
03:13:39,129 --> 03:13:45,278
and we have this cool fresh air that's

4520
03:13:41,500 --> 03:13:47,318
filtered through the Doug Fir and being

4521
03:13:45,279 --> 03:13:50,260
on the west coast we have the cleanest

4522
03:13:47,318 --> 03:13:53,260
air and so on so it's actually kind of

4523
03:13:50,260 --> 03:13:55,568
ideal curing conditions because there is

4524
03:13:53,260 --> 03:13:58,989
a difference between drying and curing

4525
03:13:55,568 --> 03:14:02,079
and then after it's buck down then it

4526
03:13:58,989 --> 03:14:06,699
goes into the into at this point plastic

4527
03:14:02,079 --> 03:14:10,478
no no first we take long rows of ground

4528
03:14:06,700 --> 03:14:12,670
craft paper and all the buck start stems

4529
03:14:10,478 --> 03:14:15,039
and stalks go they're wrapped into brown

4530
03:14:12,670 --> 03:14:17,500
craft paper which can be opened and

4531
03:14:15,040 --> 03:14:21,430
burped like like a dozen rows long-stem

4532
03:14:17,500 --> 03:14:25,898
roses will go into Rubbermaid tubs and

4533
03:14:21,430 --> 03:14:27,489
into into a wooden storage shed out in

4534
03:14:25,898 --> 03:14:31,599
the woods and the temperature there is

4535
03:14:27,489 --> 03:14:34,750
you know 40 to 30 to 50 and relative

4536
03:14:31,600 --> 03:14:38,260
humidity so that's our natural drying

4537
03:14:34,750 --> 03:14:40,389
process and we have a facility in the

4538
03:14:38,260 --> 03:14:42,489
space to do it one of the key things if

4539
03:14:40,389 --> 03:14:45,039
you're trying to grow you know expand

4540
03:14:42,489 --> 03:14:46,779
your your growth go from you know

4541
03:14:45,040 --> 03:14:49,210
classic grow or a backyard to a bigger

4542
03:14:46,779 --> 03:14:51,760
one most thing people forget is you need

4543
03:14:49,209 --> 03:14:54,818
now exponentially greater drying space

4544
03:14:51,760 --> 03:14:57,489
you need almost as much strong face as

4545
03:14:54,818 --> 03:14:59,260
you actually had garden space in order

4546
03:14:57,489 --> 03:15:02,500
to make sure that you're not you know

4547
03:14:59,260 --> 03:15:05,228
cross pollinating of fungal spores

4548
03:15:02,500 --> 03:15:07,809
across plants and so on you also have to

4549
03:15:05,228 --> 03:15:12,340
be clean going in you know your white

4550
03:15:07,809 --> 03:15:15,369
lab coats is good and and then neat but

4551
03:15:12,340 --> 03:15:17,049
then now Nikki wants to talk okay but so

4552
03:15:15,370 --> 03:15:19,779
after that Dennis the trimming process

4553
03:15:17,049 --> 03:15:23,108
but yes cleanliness is in this case

4554
03:15:19,779 --> 03:15:28,090
actually next to godliness and you know

4555
03:15:23,109 --> 03:15:29,950
I wanted really sorry I'm getting a

4556
03:15:28,090 --> 03:15:32,200
reverb here I wanted to come in really

4557
03:15:29,950 --> 03:15:34,779
quick you know Dan over at gnome grown

4558
03:15:32,200 --> 03:15:36,520
you're dealing with regulations of

4559
03:15:34,779 --> 03:15:38,110
Oregon and they're telling you basically

4560
03:15:36,520 --> 03:15:39,610
how to do

4561
03:15:38,110 --> 03:15:41,261
here in time and I'm wondering how

4562
03:15:39,610 --> 03:15:43,450
you're working around those regulations

4563
03:15:41,261 --> 03:15:44,801
so that you're still able to get a

4564
03:15:43,450 --> 03:15:47,790
really good cure with your beautiful

4565
03:15:44,800 --> 03:15:50,829
flowers and also some people talk about

4566
03:15:47,790 --> 03:15:53,410
drying the first day when they bring

4567
03:15:50,829 --> 03:15:56,860
things there their material and having

4568
03:15:53,409 --> 03:15:58,959
it a really high temperature first and

4569
03:15:56,860 --> 03:16:00,280
drying it and and and I was just

4570
03:15:58,959 --> 03:16:05,470
wondering what you know what what kind

4571
03:16:00,280 --> 03:16:08,920
of system do you use I've always been a

4572
03:16:05,470 --> 03:16:12,069
low in slow guy myself you know I'm

4573
03:16:08,920 --> 03:16:13,720
really allergic to the notion of letting

4574
03:16:12,069 --> 03:16:18,970
the flower feel crispy on the outside

4575
03:16:13,720 --> 03:16:25,000
while we still have you know stems that

4576
03:16:18,970 --> 03:16:27,369
are loaded with with water I have sort

4577
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:29,379
of built a reputation on the flower that

4578
03:16:27,370 --> 03:16:31,721
I've grown throughout my life has been

4579
03:16:29,379 --> 03:16:34,930
consistently some of the smoothest and

4580
03:16:31,720 --> 03:16:36,341
most flavorful of some of the other

4581
03:16:34,931 --> 03:16:41,649
compared to some of the others in my

4582
03:16:36,341 --> 03:16:45,101
grow community and really you know just

4583
03:16:41,649 --> 03:16:47,079
as a younger grower twenty five years

4584
03:16:45,101 --> 03:16:52,091
ago just kind of stumbled onto that

4585
03:16:47,079 --> 03:16:56,890
through happenstance as I you know would

4586
03:16:52,091 --> 03:16:59,620
would let my plants hang for a long

4587
03:16:56,890 --> 03:17:02,020
period of time when in that ideal

4588
03:16:59,620 --> 03:17:04,990
environment maintaining that sixty

4589
03:17:02,021 --> 03:17:09,521
percent sixty degree those have kind of

4590
03:17:04,989 --> 03:17:12,729
been my numbers all along and I'm not

4591
03:17:09,521 --> 03:17:16,931
afraid to let the plants hang in open

4592
03:17:12,729 --> 03:17:20,199
air as long as the environment is under

4593
03:17:16,931 --> 03:17:23,739
control I'll let it hang for several

4594
03:17:20,200 --> 03:17:28,181
months throughout my history yeah with

4595
03:17:23,739 --> 03:17:32,670
the new regulations for reproduction

4596
03:17:28,181 --> 03:17:37,601
here in Oregon we can't do that I

4597
03:17:32,670 --> 03:17:39,819
basically it's it's a set I'm forgetting

4598
03:17:37,601 --> 03:17:42,931
off the top of my head what the specific

4599
03:17:39,819 --> 03:17:47,319
number of days is I think it's 45 days

4600
03:17:42,931 --> 03:17:48,640
from the harvest date it needs to be

4601
03:17:47,319 --> 03:17:52,181
tested

4602
03:17:48,640 --> 03:17:55,120
and so the curing process doesn't

4603
03:17:52,181 --> 03:18:00,221
necessarily have to stop at that point

4604
03:17:55,120 --> 03:18:03,600
but 45 days it's pushing the boundaries

4605
03:18:00,220 --> 03:18:07,331
of where I'm comfortable with but I

4606
03:18:03,601 --> 03:18:10,801
pretty much come to the point here over

4607
03:18:07,331 --> 03:18:13,989
the last year of working within the the

4608
03:18:10,800 --> 03:18:17,350
rep reduction system here in Oregon that

4609
03:18:13,989 --> 03:18:21,521
I can live with that 45 days which

4610
03:18:17,351 --> 03:18:26,141
typically results in letting the plants

4611
03:18:21,521 --> 03:18:28,121
hang for three to four weeks typically

4612
03:18:26,140 --> 03:18:29,859
takes at least two weeks two to three

4613
03:18:28,120 --> 03:18:35,050
weeks to get to a point where the stems

4614
03:18:29,860 --> 03:18:39,511
are actually snapping and then turning

4615
03:18:35,050 --> 03:18:43,029
it over to trimmers and I've we've got a

4616
03:18:39,511 --> 03:18:45,751
flower storage vault that were required

4617
03:18:43,030 --> 03:18:49,351
to have that's a very highly secured

4618
03:18:45,751 --> 03:18:52,121
area we actually went with a

4619
03:18:49,351 --> 03:18:55,780
refrigerated storage container which is

4620
03:18:52,120 --> 03:19:00,819
super insulated and and very easy to

4621
03:18:55,780 --> 03:19:02,980
keep regulated and you know I I really

4622
03:19:00,819 --> 03:19:06,460
struggle with plastic as well especially

4623
03:19:02,979 --> 03:19:10,600
low-density plastic you know some of the

4624
03:19:06,460 --> 03:19:15,550
mylar bags and the commonly used turkey

4625
03:19:10,601 --> 03:19:20,041
bags the more high dense plastic doesn't

4626
03:19:15,550 --> 03:19:20,040
seem to have as much of a harmful effect

4627
03:19:21,030 --> 03:19:28,271
we are I've been told or we basically

4628
03:19:25,181 --> 03:19:32,021
see through the processors that we work

4629
03:19:28,271 --> 03:19:37,601
with both for ice water hash extraction

4630
03:19:32,021 --> 03:19:41,591
as well as we partner with evolved which

4631
03:19:37,601 --> 03:19:45,461
is a co2 extraction and for as good a

4632
03:19:41,591 --> 03:19:48,851
quality as our flour tends to be the

4633
03:19:45,460 --> 03:19:51,399
extractors have struggled to pull the

4634
03:19:48,851 --> 03:19:53,351
desirable yields out of our material

4635
03:19:51,399 --> 03:19:56,529
consistently and so we've been looking

4636
03:19:53,351 --> 03:20:01,360
at that real closely it seems like the

4637
03:19:56,530 --> 03:20:04,659
producers that are throwing better

4638
03:20:01,360 --> 03:20:08,079
extraction results are doing a faster

4639
03:20:04,659 --> 03:20:11,110
dry process in getting the material to

4640
03:20:08,079 --> 03:20:15,670
the Purdue to the processor in a more

4641
03:20:11,110 --> 03:20:21,310
timely manner and yeah Joshi referenced

4642
03:20:15,670 --> 03:20:23,979
the high-temperature blast and I've had

4643
03:20:21,310 --> 03:20:26,079
I've had folks tell me that they know

4644
03:20:23,979 --> 03:20:27,969
some growers that are I've got a good

4645
03:20:26,079 --> 03:20:30,399
solid reputation for producing high

4646
03:20:27,969 --> 03:20:33,819
quality flour that'll do like a 90

4647
03:20:30,399 --> 03:20:37,119
degree forty percent humidity blast for

4648
03:20:33,819 --> 03:20:40,180
like two days - like really radically

4649
03:20:37,120 --> 03:20:43,150
pull a lot of the water molecule out of

4650
03:20:40,180 --> 03:20:46,060
the plant material quickly and then

4651
03:20:43,149 --> 03:20:48,430
shift it into a more low and slow sort

4652
03:20:46,060 --> 03:20:51,239
of environment until it gets to the

4653
03:20:48,430 --> 03:20:54,579
point where it's dry all the way through

4654
03:20:51,239 --> 03:20:58,869
I'm tempted to kind of try this perhaps

4655
03:20:54,579 --> 03:21:03,879
on a small scale really producing high

4656
03:20:58,870 --> 03:21:06,940
quality smooth smoking flour is really

4657
03:21:03,879 --> 03:21:10,689
our jam here and so the extraction is

4658
03:21:06,940 --> 03:21:15,030
more of a byproduct in a lot of ways so

4659
03:21:10,690 --> 03:21:17,680
yeah I understand I'm really cautious of

4660
03:21:15,030 --> 03:21:19,210
you know turning things into any sort of

4661
03:21:17,680 --> 03:21:21,729
direction that may have a negative

4662
03:21:19,209 --> 03:21:24,909
impact on the overall smoothness of the

4663
03:21:21,729 --> 03:21:26,920
flour and and the flavor profiles are

4664
03:21:24,909 --> 03:21:28,569
just there and there's a lot of flour on

4665
03:21:26,920 --> 03:21:32,460
the market that is really on point with

4666
03:21:28,569 --> 03:21:37,239
flavor profiles but it's really is a

4667
03:21:32,459 --> 03:21:40,029
real mark of quality in my opinion as I

4668
03:21:37,239 --> 03:21:42,629
sample flour grown by other producers

4669
03:21:40,030 --> 03:21:46,480
with you know good organic sustainable

4670
03:21:42,629 --> 03:21:48,609
grow methodologies how does it leave my

4671
03:21:46,479 --> 03:21:50,859
throat feeling there's a lot of well

4672
03:21:48,610 --> 03:21:53,021
grown flour that really bites the back

4673
03:21:50,860 --> 03:21:54,579
of my throat and if I smoke through a

4674
03:21:53,021 --> 03:21:55,150
few grams a bit over the course of a

4675
03:21:54,579 --> 03:21:58,079
weekend

4676
03:21:55,149 --> 03:22:01,840
I'm really feeling that throat effect

4677
03:21:58,079 --> 03:22:04,959
whereas properly cured flour that has

4678
03:22:01,840 --> 03:22:07,600
that smoothness I will rarely ever

4679
03:22:04,959 --> 03:22:11,829
notice any sort of sore throat

4680
03:22:07,600 --> 03:22:15,130
irritation would even even under periods

4681
03:22:11,829 --> 03:22:16,930
of heavy consumption so

4682
03:22:15,129 --> 03:22:19,889
I think hey Jeff you know I think it

4683
03:22:16,930 --> 03:22:23,828
might be time for curing with microbes

4684
03:22:19,889 --> 03:22:26,049
because because you know it is a

4685
03:22:23,828 --> 03:22:29,318
microbial process there's a there's a

4686
03:22:26,049 --> 03:22:32,648
like fermentation happening within there

4687
03:22:29,318 --> 03:22:35,109
and you know it's just it's a great

4688
03:22:32,648 --> 03:22:37,629
conversation and as we are making soil

4689
03:22:35,109 --> 03:22:39,670
and curing you know it's just it's a

4690
03:22:37,629 --> 03:22:42,038
great conversation so Jeff what would

4691
03:22:39,670 --> 03:22:44,998
you have to add about you know this

4692
03:22:42,039 --> 03:22:47,979
curing process and possible microbial

4693
03:22:44,998 --> 03:22:49,809
interaction with with the cure process

4694
03:22:47,978 --> 03:22:53,408
well you know it's an interesting

4695
03:22:49,809 --> 03:22:55,028
problem because when you think about

4696
03:22:53,408 --> 03:22:55,930
whether the second book I wrote I'll get

4697
03:22:55,029 --> 03:22:57,399
you sit down here for a second the

4698
03:22:55,930 --> 03:22:59,738
second book I wrote teeming with

4699
03:22:57,398 --> 03:23:02,948
nutrients talks about the two different

4700
03:22:59,738 --> 03:23:04,629
pathways that things get into plants and

4701
03:23:02,949 --> 03:23:07,119
of course one of them is the simplest

4702
03:23:04,629 --> 03:23:08,368
which was the all the cytoplasm and it's

4703
03:23:07,119 --> 03:23:10,989
all connected it's where all the

4704
03:23:08,369 --> 03:23:12,760
activity basically occurs but you've

4705
03:23:10,988 --> 03:23:15,788
also got what's known as the Apple Plus

4706
03:23:12,760 --> 03:23:19,090
which is the cell walls so you can go

4707
03:23:15,789 --> 03:23:21,189
into a root cell wall and then run up

4708
03:23:19,090 --> 03:23:24,908
through the entire plant all the way out

4709
03:23:21,189 --> 03:23:27,818
to a leaf tip or flower through just

4710
03:23:24,908 --> 03:23:32,520
cell walls and those cell wall that

4711
03:23:27,818 --> 03:23:37,090
pathway contains all manner of bacteria

4712
03:23:32,520 --> 03:23:39,340
fungus you know all sorts of things that

4713
03:23:37,090 --> 03:23:42,850
impact the way the plant is going to

4714
03:23:39,340 --> 03:23:45,609
taste and it's always curious to me as

4715
03:23:42,850 --> 03:23:49,149
to how that's handle I think I think

4716
03:23:45,609 --> 03:23:52,328
that pathway gets cleared out somewhat

4717
03:23:49,148 --> 03:23:53,318
by time I think a lot of the bacterium

4718
03:23:52,328 --> 03:23:56,590
died off

4719
03:23:53,318 --> 03:23:59,139
I think humidity has an impact on it but

4720
03:23:56,590 --> 03:24:01,029
I'm not sure enough and maybe there is a

4721
03:23:59,139 --> 03:24:05,648
need for a book somewhere along the way

4722
03:24:01,029 --> 03:24:09,399
to know exactly how the activities in

4723
03:24:05,648 --> 03:24:11,379
that Apple plastic pathway impact the

4724
03:24:09,398 --> 03:24:13,510
curing process but there's something

4725
03:24:11,379 --> 03:24:16,049
going on in there there's an electrical

4726
03:24:13,510 --> 03:24:21,908
charge in there there's dust in there

4727
03:24:16,049 --> 03:24:23,408
it's an interesting area can I talk to

4728
03:24:21,908 --> 03:24:25,868
that because I think you just explain

4729
03:24:23,408 --> 03:24:27,699
something to me and scientifically which

4730
03:24:25,869 --> 03:24:30,610
is to say if you hang

4731
03:24:27,700 --> 03:24:33,521
whole plant upside down you're getting

4732
03:24:30,610 --> 03:24:35,409
all of that stuff that cellular stuff

4733
03:24:33,521 --> 03:24:38,980
that's communicating and it all goes

4734
03:24:35,409 --> 03:24:40,869
ends up in the flower right so the more

4735
03:24:38,979 --> 03:24:43,180
you hang a full plan and a longer branch

4736
03:24:40,870 --> 03:24:45,010
all that stuff now drains by gravity

4737
03:24:43,181 --> 03:24:49,409
into the flower in the drying process

4738
03:24:45,010 --> 03:24:52,271
right but there's also something process

4739
03:24:49,409 --> 03:24:53,799
yes what do you think about well first

4740
03:24:52,271 --> 03:24:56,050
of all it's not it's not I mean I think

4741
03:24:53,799 --> 03:24:57,369
you're right there's a great deal of

4742
03:24:56,049 --> 03:24:58,810
truth to the fact that you hang

4743
03:24:57,370 --> 03:25:00,579
something upside down you're gonna get

4744
03:24:58,810 --> 03:25:02,799
it you're gonna get drainage you know

4745
03:25:00,579 --> 03:25:04,209
going in but that's not through the

4746
03:25:02,799 --> 03:25:06,879
Apple plastic system that's through the

4747
03:25:04,209 --> 03:25:11,259
Simpson that's the simplistic system or

4748
03:25:06,879 --> 03:25:13,209
some plastic system but yes definitely

4749
03:25:11,260 --> 03:25:15,300
in the curing process hanging the plant

4750
03:25:13,209 --> 03:25:17,890
upside down is good you know it's good

4751
03:25:15,299 --> 03:25:20,409
everything you do to that plant impacts

4752
03:25:17,890 --> 03:25:23,799
all the aspects of things that we've

4753
03:25:20,409 --> 03:25:26,200
talked about so so hanging the plan

4754
03:25:23,799 --> 03:25:28,090
upside down you know of course the

4755
03:25:26,200 --> 03:25:30,340
microbiology doesn't know what's up or

4756
03:25:28,090 --> 03:25:33,159
down but but the the liquid in the plant

4757
03:25:30,340 --> 03:25:35,260
does you know there's a grab there's a

4758
03:25:33,159 --> 03:25:37,601
gravitational pull which which has got

4759
03:25:35,260 --> 03:25:41,050
an Avenue all of these things have an

4760
03:25:37,601 --> 03:25:43,150
impact and who only knows you know

4761
03:25:41,049 --> 03:25:44,560
exactly what these impacts are you're

4762
03:25:43,149 --> 03:25:45,909
right there's a need for a lot of these

4763
03:25:44,560 --> 03:25:47,739
books I've always said to myself geez

4764
03:25:45,909 --> 03:25:49,629
the last thing in the world ever needs

4765
03:25:47,739 --> 03:25:56,199
is another book what have you started

4766
03:25:49,629 --> 03:25:58,659
what have you started Jane you see once

4767
03:25:56,200 --> 03:26:00,851
once it's cut and bucked and even

4768
03:25:58,659 --> 03:26:02,920
trimmed the curing process really goes

4769
03:26:00,851 --> 03:26:05,351
on and in the old days I was talking to

4770
03:26:02,920 --> 03:26:07,329
and we're told in the old days we would

4771
03:26:05,351 --> 03:26:09,610
get cannabis from Mexico or Columbia and

4772
03:26:07,329 --> 03:26:12,819
it was always like six months old right

4773
03:26:09,610 --> 03:26:14,771
and it was never green and fresh and if

4774
03:26:12,819 --> 03:26:16,840
it was fresh right and you know one of

4775
03:26:14,771 --> 03:26:19,450
the reasons Panama red was so red is

4776
03:26:16,840 --> 03:26:20,710
that it was that old right the klore see

4777
03:26:19,450 --> 03:26:22,000
now here's the thing about science I've

4778
03:26:20,709 --> 03:26:25,209
always asked what happens with the

4779
03:26:22,000 --> 03:26:27,610
chlorophyll it doesn't break down it

4780
03:26:25,209 --> 03:26:29,770
actually oxidizes right so what does

4781
03:26:27,610 --> 03:26:31,450
that have to do in the production of CBN

4782
03:26:29,771 --> 03:26:33,489
and the production in the creation of

4783
03:26:31,450 --> 03:26:35,950
smoothness right the greener the weed

4784
03:26:33,489 --> 03:26:38,409
the more rough it is so if you cure dry

4785
03:26:35,950 --> 03:26:40,181
it properly and then cure it we don't

4786
03:26:38,409 --> 03:26:41,770
like to smoke our cannabis before like

4787
03:26:40,181 --> 03:26:43,810
April from the year before

4788
03:26:41,770 --> 03:26:46,360
and so it's like five to six months and

4789
03:26:43,809 --> 03:26:48,340
then I think it's reached its peak and

4790
03:26:46,360 --> 03:26:51,700
you can keep it that way storage

4791
03:26:48,340 --> 03:26:53,049
prophecy for almost another year yeah I

4792
03:26:51,700 --> 03:26:55,210
think you're probably right boy you're

4793
03:26:53,049 --> 03:26:57,309
sooo remind me as an old guy back in the

4794
03:26:55,209 --> 03:27:00,459
day when when there weren't really

4795
03:26:57,309 --> 03:27:03,219
flowers in our cannabis and it was all

4796
03:27:00,459 --> 03:27:05,228
sticks and stones and and we and that's

4797
03:27:03,219 --> 03:27:07,119
what we did smoke was chlorophyll I mean

4798
03:27:05,228 --> 03:27:08,500
now we're doing buds and one of the

4799
03:27:07,120 --> 03:27:10,810
beauties of the buzz is they don't have

4800
03:27:08,500 --> 03:27:12,790
that much chlorophyll in it you know so

4801
03:27:10,809 --> 03:27:16,719
you're absolutely right but this whole

4802
03:27:12,790 --> 03:27:18,280
idea of of curing you know we have to

4803
03:27:16,719 --> 03:27:20,139
start looking at it just like we look at

4804
03:27:18,280 --> 03:27:22,150
the soil there are clearly microbes

4805
03:27:20,139 --> 03:27:23,228
involved they are clearly impacted by

4806
03:27:22,149 --> 03:27:25,869
all of the things that we've talked

4807
03:27:23,228 --> 03:27:27,219
about that impact soil and I think you

4808
03:27:25,870 --> 03:27:28,930
know some of you guys are beginning to

4809
03:27:27,219 --> 03:27:30,728
do the research and getting the

4810
03:27:28,930 --> 03:27:33,010
information you know as soon as we get

4811
03:27:30,728 --> 03:27:35,559
rid of the little cheaply Keebler cookie

4812
03:27:33,010 --> 03:27:36,700
monster you know you know maybe we'll be

4813
03:27:35,559 --> 03:27:38,500
able to get you know I'm talking about

4814
03:27:36,700 --> 03:27:40,510
Jeff sessions we're gonna be able to get

4815
03:27:38,500 --> 03:27:42,129
you know universities in on this stuff

4816
03:27:40,510 --> 03:27:44,110
and people able to really do the kind of

4817
03:27:42,129 --> 03:27:45,609
testing that we need to do because

4818
03:27:44,110 --> 03:27:47,350
that's the only way we're going to ever

4819
03:27:45,610 --> 03:27:49,180
ultimately find out what the right

4820
03:27:47,350 --> 03:27:51,370
answers are but in the meantime it seems

4821
03:27:49,180 --> 03:27:53,590
to me everybody here on this panel other

4822
03:27:51,370 --> 03:27:55,840
than myself by doing a heck of a job

4823
03:27:53,590 --> 03:27:57,728
gathering data and making some pretty

4824
03:27:55,840 --> 03:27:59,829
interesting correlations with that data

4825
03:27:57,728 --> 03:28:00,489
and the more that we can put it all

4826
03:27:59,829 --> 03:28:02,559
together

4827
03:28:00,489 --> 03:28:05,409
the better all gonna be no question

4828
03:28:02,559 --> 03:28:08,109
about that I'd love to speak to that one

4829
03:28:05,409 --> 03:28:10,420
some yeah some of the data that we're

4830
03:28:08,110 --> 03:28:12,010
seeing is that percent moisture when you

4831
03:28:10,420 --> 03:28:14,409
put the flowers away has a lot to do

4832
03:28:12,010 --> 03:28:15,909
with the microbial population that

4833
03:28:14,409 --> 03:28:17,619
you're gonna see and that might just be

4834
03:28:15,909 --> 03:28:19,569
yeast and beneficials you don't know but

4835
03:28:17,620 --> 03:28:21,310
when you put it away a little bit wet

4836
03:28:19,569 --> 03:28:23,319
you you're you have an environment the

4837
03:28:21,309 --> 03:28:25,209
bacteria need some moisture you know

4838
03:28:23,319 --> 03:28:26,649
when we see ecoli outbreaks with like

4839
03:28:25,209 --> 03:28:27,969
sprouts or something it's because it's

4840
03:28:26,649 --> 03:28:30,100
something that's wet that has that

4841
03:28:27,969 --> 03:28:32,559
moisture where that those those bacteria

4842
03:28:30,100 --> 03:28:34,300
can grow so there is a correlation with

4843
03:28:32,559 --> 03:28:35,709
the percent moisture that goes away of

4844
03:28:34,299 --> 03:28:37,869
course this is we want to find an

4845
03:28:35,709 --> 03:28:40,389
optimization between this because maybe

4846
03:28:37,870 --> 03:28:42,640
we enjoy flowers at twelve thirteen

4847
03:28:40,389 --> 03:28:45,039
percent because moisture because we get

4848
03:28:42,639 --> 03:28:46,840
a little bit more flavor and trooping

4849
03:28:45,040 --> 03:28:48,610
but it might be a little bit safer to

4850
03:28:46,840 --> 03:28:52,180
put it away more around seven or eight

4851
03:28:48,610 --> 03:28:53,800
for a long term preservation and it's

4852
03:28:52,180 --> 03:28:55,658
actually the bacteria on it with that

4853
03:28:53,799 --> 03:29:00,099
moisture that's going to degrade

4854
03:28:55,658 --> 03:29:01,988
your your trim ducts a lot faster so I

4855
03:29:00,100 --> 03:29:03,219
think like you're figuring that out for

4856
03:29:01,988 --> 03:29:04,679
the type of strain and actually

4857
03:29:03,218 --> 03:29:06,759
different terpene contaminoid

4858
03:29:04,679 --> 03:29:08,799
combinations and different environments

4859
03:29:06,759 --> 03:29:10,689
I think we'll find we should fine-tune

4860
03:29:08,799 --> 03:29:11,079
the percent moisture that we are putting

4861
03:29:10,689 --> 03:29:13,838
it away

4862
03:29:11,078 --> 03:29:16,208
and paying attention to our labs one to

4863
03:29:13,838 --> 03:29:18,369
see what our full populations are and

4864
03:29:16,209 --> 03:29:21,569
actually culture out specific pathogens

4865
03:29:18,369 --> 03:29:21,569
and see if we're seeing those or not

4866
03:29:23,908 --> 03:29:32,048
another somewhat unfortunate element to

4867
03:29:27,850 --> 03:29:36,369
this whole conversation is we've got a

4868
03:29:32,049 --> 03:29:39,069
pretty immature consumer base in a lot

4869
03:29:36,369 --> 03:29:42,969
of respects and the recreational states

4870
03:29:39,068 --> 03:29:44,978
you know there's a lot of new smokers

4871
03:29:42,968 --> 03:29:46,328
coming onto the scene who you know lots

4872
03:29:44,978 --> 03:29:47,769
of people have just avoided it

4873
03:29:46,328 --> 03:29:49,298
throughout their lives simply because of

4874
03:29:47,770 --> 03:29:52,359
the fact it's illegal and they're good

4875
03:29:49,299 --> 03:29:55,839
law-abiding citizens there's some a lot

4876
03:29:52,359 --> 03:29:58,119
of misconceptions that exist in the

4877
03:29:55,838 --> 03:30:02,918
marketplace that some of us who have

4878
03:29:58,119 --> 03:30:04,899
been involved in this game for a lot of

4879
03:30:02,918 --> 03:30:08,020
years have sort of worked through on our

4880
03:30:04,898 --> 03:30:09,578
own and and come to the reality that I

4881
03:30:08,020 --> 03:30:15,759
think most of us here on this panel

4882
03:30:09,578 --> 03:30:20,228
likely share Swami made reference to the

4883
03:30:15,759 --> 03:30:24,209
the loss of chlorophyll and we have

4884
03:30:20,228 --> 03:30:29,158
really found that with the low-and-slow

4885
03:30:24,209 --> 03:30:31,779
longer term cure process it does tend to

4886
03:30:29,158 --> 03:30:35,020
the color of the flower tends to

4887
03:30:31,779 --> 03:30:38,039
gravitate away from green more towards

4888
03:30:35,020 --> 03:30:42,069
brown and the market does not like that

4889
03:30:38,039 --> 03:30:47,890
the market likes green bright colorful

4890
03:30:42,068 --> 03:30:51,338
flowers and and big THC scores and so

4891
03:30:47,889 --> 03:30:54,968
that's been an important part of our

4892
03:30:51,338 --> 03:30:57,699
evolution at Nome this year is just

4893
03:30:54,968 --> 03:30:59,738
coming to the realization as we've

4894
03:30:57,699 --> 03:31:01,689
really expanded our production to a

4895
03:30:59,738 --> 03:31:03,520
degree that were you know actually

4896
03:31:01,689 --> 03:31:06,710
represent a percentage of the flower on

4897
03:31:03,520 --> 03:31:13,819
the market here in the state

4898
03:31:06,709 --> 03:31:16,459
and my long-established drying and

4899
03:31:13,819 --> 03:31:20,690
curing practices that do result in such

4900
03:31:16,459 --> 03:31:24,289
a good smoking experience that most

4901
03:31:20,690 --> 03:31:25,790
would agree on we're finding that as the

4902
03:31:24,290 --> 03:31:31,690
market becomes more and more competitive

4903
03:31:25,790 --> 03:31:35,510
and there is the general oversupply

4904
03:31:31,690 --> 03:31:38,569
we're seeing a favor paid towards the

4905
03:31:35,510 --> 03:31:43,760
more colorful flower that oftentimes is

4906
03:31:38,569 --> 03:31:46,520
not the smooth smoke but we're really

4907
03:31:43,760 --> 03:31:49,159
having to kind of play to that and the

4908
03:31:46,520 --> 03:31:54,100
harvests that came down in early

4909
03:31:49,159 --> 03:31:56,930
December I'm actually fast tracking our

4910
03:31:54,100 --> 03:32:00,729
process of getting it to market not with

4911
03:31:56,930 --> 03:32:03,920
a complete compromise to my ideals but

4912
03:32:00,728 --> 03:32:05,389
trying to split the difference and find

4913
03:32:03,920 --> 03:32:09,049
a little middle ground so that by the

4914
03:32:05,389 --> 03:32:11,659
time we get to the end of this 100 pound

4915
03:32:09,049 --> 03:32:14,299
batch of flower

4916
03:32:11,659 --> 03:32:16,280
we're not seeing the last you know 10 to

4917
03:32:14,299 --> 03:32:18,709
20 pounds that are trickling out here

4918
03:32:16,280 --> 03:32:21,460
potentially two months down the road it

4919
03:32:18,709 --> 03:32:24,919
starts to lose color suddenly lose

4920
03:32:21,459 --> 03:32:28,899
financial value in the marketplace and

4921
03:32:24,920 --> 03:32:33,040
so you know it's kind of a downside of

4922
03:32:28,899 --> 03:32:36,590
staying competitive in the market as a

4923
03:32:33,040 --> 03:32:38,240
recreational producer that is definitely

4924
03:32:36,590 --> 03:32:40,899
you know we have got a lot of money and

4925
03:32:38,239 --> 03:32:43,100
a lot of employees and just a lot of

4926
03:32:40,899 --> 03:32:44,719
investment to get to where we're at and

4927
03:32:43,100 --> 03:32:47,210
it is a business at the end of the day

4928
03:32:44,719 --> 03:32:49,340
and we need to listen to the market and

4929
03:32:47,209 --> 03:32:52,549
if the market tells us that we need to

4930
03:32:49,340 --> 03:32:54,950
weed out you know low THC scoring

4931
03:32:52,549 --> 03:32:57,978
strains as much as I have a lot of value

4932
03:32:54,950 --> 03:33:00,110
and a lot of those genetics it does not

4933
03:32:57,978 --> 03:33:02,599
really pay off from a business

4934
03:33:00,110 --> 03:33:07,040
perspective and so like I said it is a

4935
03:33:02,600 --> 03:33:11,270
downside and it's all choices and so

4936
03:33:07,040 --> 03:33:12,890
we're sure you got to learn the rules

4937
03:33:11,270 --> 03:33:14,569
and then you know work with them the

4938
03:33:12,889 --> 03:33:16,760
best you can learn the rules so you know

4939
03:33:14,569 --> 03:33:18,709
how to break them Dalai Lama one of my

4940
03:33:16,760 --> 03:33:19,939
favorite quotes so you know we're

4941
03:33:18,709 --> 03:33:22,099
getting to the to the

4942
03:33:19,939 --> 03:33:24,170
and of this panel we just really want to

4943
03:33:22,100 --> 03:33:28,908
thank everyone for being here I think it

4944
03:33:24,170 --> 03:33:31,059
would make sense to just give a year you

4945
03:33:28,908 --> 03:33:34,010
want one more time set tell us your name

4946
03:33:31,059 --> 03:33:36,879
tell us how people get in touch with you

4947
03:33:34,010 --> 03:33:39,648
maybe where you're gonna be really soon

4948
03:33:36,879 --> 03:33:41,898
and then what will be the last ones to

4949
03:33:39,648 --> 03:33:43,219
do it and go ahead Jesse maybe if you

4950
03:33:41,898 --> 03:33:44,328
want to start and then just we'll go on

4951
03:33:43,219 --> 03:33:47,688
down the line

4952
03:33:44,328 --> 03:33:51,049
tell us where we can find you okay

4953
03:33:47,689 --> 03:33:53,059
yeah Jesse with fire vortex you can find

4954
03:33:51,049 --> 03:33:55,788
me on the Instagram bio vortex and also

4955
03:33:53,059 --> 03:33:58,908
regenerative cannabis farming we created

4956
03:33:55,789 --> 03:34:01,459
a website recently with Dan Mara of high

4957
03:33:58,908 --> 03:34:03,430
tide permaculture to help educate about

4958
03:34:01,459 --> 03:34:06,079
regenitive cannabis farming and showcase

4959
03:34:03,430 --> 03:34:08,180
some of the farms doing it right like

4960
03:34:06,078 --> 03:34:09,859
the the farms we've honored with the

4961
03:34:08,180 --> 03:34:12,498
regenitive cannabis farm award at the

4962
03:34:09,859 --> 03:34:16,399
Emerald cup events coming up would be

4963
03:34:12,498 --> 03:34:18,789
the living soil symposium which is the

4964
03:34:16,398 --> 03:34:25,189
second to last weekend of March at good

4965
03:34:18,789 --> 03:34:27,289
but is it the 23rd or yeah that weekend

4966
03:34:25,189 --> 03:34:31,930
and then also the cultivation classic

4967
03:34:27,289 --> 03:34:31,930
and they're both in Portland on May 12th

4968
03:34:37,568 --> 03:34:40,868
hey :

4969
03:34:44,228 --> 03:34:50,778
can you hear me yep alright :

4970
03:34:48,529 --> 03:34:52,670
with Malibu Campos easiest thing is

4971
03:34:50,779 --> 03:34:56,899
getting hold of me colum at Malibu

4972
03:34:52,670 --> 03:34:59,270
compost calm be in the farm in Oregon

4973
03:34:56,898 --> 03:35:00,889
for the next week or so farm in

4974
03:34:59,270 --> 03:35:05,238
California for a week after that

4975
03:35:00,889 --> 03:35:07,219
bouncing back and forth hopefully at the

4976
03:35:05,238 --> 03:35:12,760
living soil symposium will also be at

4977
03:35:07,219 --> 03:35:17,840
the the cultivation classic in Portland

4978
03:35:12,760 --> 03:35:20,090
we still recovering from the Emerald cup

4979
03:35:17,840 --> 03:35:22,309
hopefully a lot of you got a chance to

4980
03:35:20,090 --> 03:35:24,139
come through and see some of these

4981
03:35:22,309 --> 03:35:25,939
examples in action and the more

4982
03:35:24,139 --> 03:35:28,488

03:40:17,870 --> 03:40:22,220
you and I kind of write about it but I I

5084
03:40:20,780 --> 03:40:24,041
really appreciate the fact that none of

5085
03:40:22,220 --> 03:40:26,960
us have been using the word marijuana

5086
03:40:24,040 --> 03:40:29,149
which i think is a terrible racist term

5087
03:40:26,960 --> 03:40:31,520
and we need to get rid of it here in

5088
03:40:29,149 --> 03:40:33,591
Alaska we have the marijuana cannabis

5089
03:40:31,521 --> 03:40:35,480
you know the marijuana acts we need to

5090
03:40:33,591 --> 03:40:36,951
completely get rid of it out of all of

5091
03:40:35,479 --> 03:40:39,229
our bills everything else we're working

5092
03:40:36,950 --> 03:40:40,460
on it it's just I mean interesting that

5093
03:40:39,229 --> 03:40:42,411
this group is sensitive enough to

5094
03:40:40,460 --> 03:40:44,359
understand that doesn't doesn't use that

5095
03:40:42,411 --> 03:40:45,800
term but anyway it's been a pleasure if

03:42:56,501 --> 03:43:04,171
yeah there we go

5144
03:42:59,200 --> 03:43:09,610
come to this [ __ ] we're doing a breakout

5145
03:43:04,171 --> 03:43:12,970
communications and let me just start

5146
03:43:09,610 --> 03:43:16,150
over pause right the day is broken up

5147
03:43:12,970 --> 03:43:17,619
into different categories we're gonna

5148
03:43:16,149 --> 03:43:19,091
have speakers throughout the first half

5149
03:43:17,620 --> 03:43:21,251
of the day then we're going to do a Q&amp;A

5150
03:43:19,091 --> 03:43:23,229
in the evening session they're offering

5151
03:43:21,251 --> 03:43:24,851
separate lower price tickets to be able

5152
03:43:23,229 --> 03:43:26,921
to join into those evening discussions

5153
03:43:24,851 --> 03:43:28,739
for local people that can come they

5154
03:43:26,921 --> 03:43:31,091
might not be able to get the whole day

5155
03:43:28,739 --> 03:43:34,869
you definitely want to check in to Susan

5156
03:43:31,091 --> 03:43:37,899
Wainwright she does intense predator bug

5157
03:43:34,870 --> 03:43:40,061
work and she has some remarkable bits of

5158
03:43:37,899 --> 03:43:42,159
information dr. Robert Faust is going to

5159
03:43:40,060 --> 03:43:44,860
be there and then we're gonna just try

5160
03:43:42,159 --> 03:43:47,440
to commune and get to the nitty gritty

5161
03:43:44,860 --> 03:43:49,329
in the evening session so intense

5162
03:43:47,440 --> 03:43:51,370
gratitude to be able to even be

5163
03:43:49,329 --> 03:43:54,341
considered to speak with people that are

5164
03:43:51,370 --> 03:43:56,230
lined up on this bottom I just want to

5165
03:43:54,341 --> 03:43:58,091
keep continuing to be a communicator of

5166
03:43:56,229 --> 03:44:00,579
complicated data and if that's the world

5167
03:43:58,091 --> 03:44:02,229
that I can fulfill to the community to

5168
03:44:00,579 --> 03:44:04,271
help people better tune into their own

5169
03:44:02,229 --> 03:44:07,930
intuition so that they can make the

5170
03:44:04,271 --> 03:44:10,301
decisions direct a farm best absolutely

5171
03:44:07,931 --> 03:44:12,551
dream opportunity with my life so thank

5172
03:44:10,300 --> 03:44:15,399
you to everybody that's made a

5173
03:44:12,550 --> 03:44:17,501
contribution to that Scott we appreciate

5174
03:44:15,399 --> 03:44:21,040

5175
03:44:17,501 --> 03:44:23,440

5176
03:44:21,040 --> 03:44:25,000
invaluable we love and appreciate you

5177
03:44:23,440 --> 03:44:27,659
the journey it's all about the journey

5178
03:44:25,001 --> 03:44:30,488
it's not about the final destination

5179
03:44:27,659 --> 03:44:33,548
living soils really could

5180
03:44:30,488 --> 03:44:35,859
used to be tested after every cycle so

5181
03:44:33,549 --> 03:44:39,249
call up Scott or anyone in your local

5182
03:44:35,859 --> 03:44:41,529
area to get soil tested and um thank you

5183

5188
03:44:51,430 --> 03:44:57,189

5189

farm and what they've done to become to
