00:03:49,810 --> 00:04:00,490
from space walk and I really loved it as

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,490
well well it looks like the top of his

81
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:09,219
jars if you ever look at Nicias glass

82
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:11,379
his little his little cap is the top all

83
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:13,270
of his pipes have this mouthpiece on

84
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:16,358
them so it's a pretty cool little thing

85
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:21,250
I think that oh my net my egg is about

86
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:23,049
like just under 9 inches I think yeah it

87
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,069
is pretty short little fat little stout

88
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:30,250
little egg Monday I'll sell it one day

89
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:31,959
I'll sell it can you imagine I'll do it

90
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,670
I'm not connected to these things I love

91
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,919
the idea of sharing them and passing

92
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,569
them on letting him get to the next

93
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,240
place they're just clear they're

94
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:42,129
beautiful they're you know it's not like

95
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,480
it was given to me or that I have some

96
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:48,759
special connection to it you know what

97
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,980
Adam Sinclair that's a pretty good one

98
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,259
but I'm not going out of respect for my

99
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,590
wife I will not answer that I love to

100
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,939
make jokes but not with my wife at the

101
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:59,099
butt end of them

102
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:01,560
no pun intended

103
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,939
I would love to own a bubbleman

104
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,379
mothership well there you doing Nicholas

105
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,439
cross they come up for sale every once

106
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:10,170
in a while I sold my Taurus I sold my

107
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:13,199
straight fab and what do I have I have a

108
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:15,000
Klein I have a mini frosted mini and I

109
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,310
have this egg as well as another one

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,439
that I've been waiting for this deadbeat

111
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,060
to pay me back I've been so good and not

112
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,920
blasting this guy because I know how

113
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,480
many people follow me and it's not

114
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,080
really sometimes a good idea to make

115
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,210
your own personal gripes public so I

116
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,409
always sort of would say to people

117
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,549
listen if you have a problem with

118
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,800
someone and you feel like the best thing

119
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,569
to do is call them out in public it's

120
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,680
it's probably not the best thing to do

121
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,329
they might be going through some other

122
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,040
things in their life and it's best if

123
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:42,810
you just have some cash compassion and

124
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,370
some empathy for them even though you're

125
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,430
in the situation where you're feeling

126
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:50,100
wronged and not to do that not to call

127
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,470
those people out because I just don't

128
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,540
think it brings any positivity to anyone

129
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,460
I don't think we all need to what's the

130
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,830
purpose in waking up in the morning and

131
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,930
trying to build and get your followers

132
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:03,539
to be against someone or to feel

133
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,370
negative in any way so for me what I'm

134
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,020
trying to do with this thing is and I've

135
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,670
already failed miserably a bunch of

136
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,019
times I've gotten a little upset and

137
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:14,220
I've gotten pissed off here and there

138
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:16,889
and I am human no no no no one broke my

139
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,350
egg I broke my egg long time ago broke

140
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,969
the neck right here perfect snapped it

141
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,939
off sent it back they sent me back with

142
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,460
this now it's got a little R right on

143
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,560
the bottom it's not gonna affect the

144
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:29,729
sale of this pipe I assure you I think I

145
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,899
like it better with the new neck

146
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:35,490
actually well that's what it that's what

147
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,689
it's all about right I'm trying to what

148
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,030
a my thoughts on Frenchie cannoli

149
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:41,009
well Frenchie cannoli has very different

150
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:43,469
belief systems than me in regards to

151
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,449
hash but at the same time my thoughts on

152
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,240
Frenchy and cannoli are that he's like a

153
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:50,519
kindred soul a kindred brother a brother

154
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,280
in hashish and hashish aficionado he

155
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,319
loves hashish and so my thoughts are

156
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,000
good I think Frenchie cannoli is good

157
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,099
and he's good for hashish and he's good

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,240
for the people and if he says things

159
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,920
that are completely different and

160
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,150
sometimes even the opposite of what I

161
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:08,430
say Who am I to say otherwise I mean

162
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:10,079
someone's got to cover the opposite of

163
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,769
what I'm saying and I think that just

164
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,269
because it's the opposite of what I

165
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:15,519
saying it certainly doesn't mean that

166
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:17,740
it's wrong it's just different and as I

167
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:21,758
learn about the quiver I have an

168
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:25,180
appreciation for all things different

169
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,949
for all things unique so I think Fran

170
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,759
she's a good person and my thoughts are

171
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:33,520
that I like him he's a kind person and

172
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,020
all-around lover of hashish that's what

173
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,348
I could say about Frenchy cannoli

174
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:40,060
now 5-10 years ago I might have gone on

175
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:41,620
and on and on about how I thought he was

176
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,569
wrong about this and wrong about that

177
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,038
and he should this is how I do it and

178
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:47,860
this is what I would do and bla bla bla

179
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,579
bla bla but really you know get over

180
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,470
yourself

181
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:52,029
that's not what people need they just

182
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,009
need everything they don't need just

183
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:56,339
what you have they need everything so

184
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:59,500
please don't try to stunt or quiet or

185
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:01,869
muffle anyone else's voice because

186
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,468
exactly octave Tom we all have our own

187
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,629
way and we all have our own voice so it

188
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:10,779
does come with maturity you know it's uh

189
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:12,550
I was immature for a long time I have my

190
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:16,089
own insecurities about things in life

191
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:19,030
but as I am a humbled father of three

192
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:22,779
and the humble husband of a beautiful

193
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:24,429
wife for close to 30 years now I've

194
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:25,809
learned to be a little bit more patient

195
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,199
and look at things from a little bit

196
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,879
more of a wider perspective and so that

197
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,288
is the perspective that I'm looking at

198
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:38,229
things these days in the meantime when

199
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:41,559
can we hang out well we can hang out

200
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,839
September 9th and 10th in Toronto at the

201
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:46,719
Karma cup and although I was going to do

202
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:51,550
an unboxing video I kind of feel like I

203
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,920
still possibly could but I'm gonna do it

204
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:57,039
right here today Sarah sent me this box

205
00:08:53,919 --> 00:09:03,958
it's really heavy too and so we're gonna

206
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:07,659
open it up I already cut the tape this

207
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:12,479
looks like we got some t-shirts so let's

208
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:17,289
just pull some of these out yeah yes oh

209
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:21,699
yeah oh yeah I'd say that there are

210
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:24,309
probably six or seven karma Cup t-shirts

211
00:09:21,698 --> 00:09:28,389
here so that's good

212

213
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:32,649
couple of cannabis extracts I wouldn't

214
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:34,360
be able to give these away because I

215
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:37,028
don't want to be you know doing that

216
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,149
I'll keep those maybe pass them on I

217
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:47,350

222
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,580
an extremely capable person and so she's

223
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,950
going to make it happen even when

224
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,509

254
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:45,318
Sara from the karma cop I'm looking

255
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:48,470
forward to being there honestly last

256
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:50,870
year it was outside in a parking lot she

257
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,420
had all the booths set up it was sweet

258
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,159
the weather was a little bit cold but I

259
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:58,128
was a little bit later as well this year

260
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,990
it's it's quite a bit earlier so I'm

261
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:01,639
pretty stoked to be there if you're in

262
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,100
and around the neighborhood September

263
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:10,100
9th and 10th I think I'm speaking as

264
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:14,230
well so I'll be there why are you dying

265
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:16,790
natural alternatives I missed it

266
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,800
getting some pasties in the mouth and I

267
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:23,419
don't have my water you guys are gonna

268
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:25,309
have to listen to it ah sorry

269
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:26,958
Christopher Reece I just can't make them

270
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:29,119
all you know we're in Toronto I'm not

271
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,919
sure why don't I find out and it might

272
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,879
be a thing that they announce closer to

273
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:36,409
the time let's see September 9th and

274
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,470
10th competition live music speakers

275
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:41,419
downtown Toronto so I guess that's

276
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:44,269
that's about as close as you're getting

277
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:48,828
now this is sort of the what's going on

278
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:51,049
here at the karmak up we have but indica

279
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:53,179

280
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:55,068
cannabutter edibles concentrates so

281
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:57,229
shatter indica shatter hybrid shatter

282
00:12:55,068 --> 00:13:00,019
sativa butter wax butter crumbles sugar

283
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:02,680
Terp enhanced extracts all types

284

topicals bones lotion bath products and

289
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:18,230
more so I'm not sure if she's doing it

290
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:22,009
where they're all separate categories

291
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,659
and when you judge you apply to judge

292
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:26,180
for certain things I'm not sure if she

293
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:29,980
has crazy VIP judges that you can just

294
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:33,649
judge everything but it's pretty wild

295
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,808
awesome I pet meze that's good to hear

296
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:40,068

297
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:43,458
that oh there you go yes in the Karma

298
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:45,439

300
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,620
vikarma Capcom I guess they're also on

301
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:54,439
like Instagram and Twitter at the karma

302
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,139
cup so Sara's done a great job she's

303
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,950
passed us on this box and goodies and I

304
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:05,689
don't need any of it so I'm going to

305
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:08,140
pass it on to all of you now what was

306
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:10,790
that question do I know anything about

307
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,299
paralysis and psoriasis and topicals

308
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:13,639
well

309
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:15,469
I know cannabinoids work on almost

310
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:16,970
anything so without knowing much about

311
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,070
much you could easily start

312
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,560
experimenting through bioassay if you

313
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,330
have psoriasis with creating your own

314
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,009
bombs which is you know simply enough

315
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,050
find out what's not irritating to your

316
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:30,049
skin maybe some shade nut butter maybe

317
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:35,289
some coconut oil maybe even some nail be

318
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:35,289
coconut oil extract the the further

319
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:41,529
distill that if you will it's quite the

320
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:44,899
singing voice oh I don't know about that

321
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:46,789
uh hello from Bavaria here in Bavaria it

322
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:48,079
is partly impossible to get good oil I

323
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:50,599
pressed myself with a hair straightener

324
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,210

worth checking out and then I guess Tony

358
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:28,299
was entered a whole schwack at times I

359
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:31,479
think he entered one bubble man brand

360
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:37,689
into chalice but I know he entered like

361
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:40,000
three or four with gold drop brand PAH

362
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,350
Ketchum in Vancouver definitely you're

363
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,389
gonna want to go check out sunrise

364
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,550
wellness they probably have some fire

365
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:48,100
Ross and maybe some fire melts from West

366
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:49,539
Coast concentrate the best rosin I've

367
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,720
had has probably just been stuff that

368
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:53,620
I've made I love I love a whole bunch of

369
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,060
different stuff when you surround

370
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,500
yourself with exceptional quality and

371
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:58,958
people who really push themselves to

372
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,409
have exceptional quality I find that the

373
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:04,269
best is reappearing often and shows up

374
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:07,000
in different places and shows up in

375
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:11,139
different cultivars and even different

376
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,990
processes so I just love perfectly grown

377
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:18,160
cannabis resins that have expressed

378
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:20,980
themselves to full potential and I love

379
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:27,669
of course a whole host and variety of

380
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:29,789
terpenes and terpenoids well that makes

381
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:29,790
sense

382
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,808
what's that weed makes you lazy people

383
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,250
try to say weed makes you lazy want to

384
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:38,918
talk about it as a tool and how I lost

385
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:41,289
150 pound redeem pounds yeah I don't

386
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,640
find that it makes me lazy at all um I

387
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:44,829
feel that certain people who are

388
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,890
overworked and just in this mentality of

389
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:50,109
being a zombie there might be a level of

390
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,690
being baked and on a couch that they

391
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:55,149
need to go through to on brainwash

392
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,460
themselves from the current reality that

393
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,169
they've been in and I went through that

394
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,400
as a younger person I remember being

395
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:03,440
super not motivated and just hanging out

396
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,720
being baked and that was just as my

397
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,789
brain was adjusting to cannabis and my

398
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,620
body was adjusting to having it back and

399
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:12,649
I lost that very quickly and very early

400
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:14,629
on it became extremely active and in

401
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,490
fact when I used cannabis I want to go

402
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,200
do something that's active I don't want

403
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,960
to just sit around and be you know I'd

404
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,779
rather go for a hike or a bike ride or a

405
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,120
snowboard or you know a wake skate or

406
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:31,599
whatever yeah they're not puffing on 73

407
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:34,789
bubbles melt 73 knows he knows yep oh

408
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,859
yeah love me some 73 you know and then

409
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:39,349
there's the real 73 which is if you use

410
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:41,899
the 8 bag kit but you remove the 90

411
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:44,240
micron and let that all fall into the 73

412
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,610
we used to call that everyone needs the

413
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,069
Hayes Christopher Rees we used to call

414
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:51,079
that well I just called it the 73 but

415
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:54,759
once I got the 90 and we'd make batches

416
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:59,689
without the 90 we call it the real 73

417
00:18:54,759 --> 00:19:03,140
that's what we call it oh yeah that's

418
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:07,120
the real 73 or the true 73 that works

419
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:11,300
too yeah

420
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:13,309
Hayes gets you motivated oh you're most

421
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:14,329
welcome one time I love hanging out with

422
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:15,769
you guys you know we got a couple

423
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:18,019
hundred people in the room I think it's

424
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:21,230
a pretty good core group of people that

425
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:23,960
we've had probably for the last maybe

426
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:26,329
four or five or six weeks I'm not too

427
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,309
sure you know hard to say job blasts

428
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:30,049
once again the favorite thing you know

429
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:32,690
everything's a favorite I'm not sure

430
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:34,639
that my mind works that way anymore I

431
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,500
mean it might in certain aspects of

432
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,200
things when there's very when there's no

433
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,829
second place but with the motherships

434
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,690
what they all have is their place so

435
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:47,109
certain times I love the blasting chug

436
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:50,890
of a ball rig or

437
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:53,250
the Faberge egg they chug these are chug

438
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:56,800
motherships

439
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:59,920
then you have the more almost like a

440
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,829
silencer on your gun that would be the

441
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,710
klein and the Taurus both of those hit

442
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:08,889
in this real sorta they don't have this

443
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:11,110
long crazy chugging feeling they're more

444
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,300
relaxed and then you have your mini and

445
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,619
the mini or and the straight fab for

446
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:17,049
that matter as well which are much more

447
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:19,449
open and hit more like a swiss perk the

448
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:23,349
the straight fab hits more like a swiss

449
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:26,019
perk the mini it just hits really nice

450
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:28,179
it's open but it's a very short space

451
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:32,109
that it's traveling so it's still quite

452
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:34,630
tight and it's very small and I just

453
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:38,709
like them all I really do like them on

454
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:40,870
then there's the the FTK also the FK t I

455
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:45,700
never went with that I always called it

456
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:49,449
the FT K which is like a fab egg a

457
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:52,299
Taurus and decline all stacked on top of

458
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,430
one another that one to me felt you know

459
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:56,879
there was a hype because that was the

460
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,990
most expensive the most sought-after one

461
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,300
because it's all of them it's pretty

462
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:04,900
unique and it definitely hits really

463
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:07,240
cool but it hits very very like you're

464
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,430
really pulling on the ftk some of them

465
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,809
hit more open than others but generally

466
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,539
if you're used to hitting any of the

467
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:17,289
other single pieces you'll find that the

468
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:20,589
ftk hits a little a little tighter it's

469
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:23,619
going on FATA mike Chooch Zac Willie and

470
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:26,289
black Starliner talk about what it means

471
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:28,089
to only have resin in the 25u bag well

472
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:30,940
you don't see it very often if you're

473
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:33,429
talking about making bubble hash all

474
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,830
only having resin in the 25 micron bag

475
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,930
I'd almost right away think that your

476
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:39,730
bag kid if it wasn't bubble bags and

477
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,279
even if it was for that matter not that

478
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,500
we've ever seen it but I would wonder if

479
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:46,629
the screens were mistaken and maybe

480
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,910
bigger screens got put on for the other

481
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:52,210
seven bags accidentally or some screens

482
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,100
were mixed up but 25 microns very small

483
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,600
heads even in places like Australia

484
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:57,699
where the Sun is extremely hot and

485
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,579
really cooks those heads down into

486
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,558
little heads we're full full full melt

487
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:07,898
resin comes out of the 25 and the 45

488
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:12,579
micron I still see resin in the other

489
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:15,099
bags so I'm not too sure that's you

490
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:17,918
might have just cut it down like I don't

491
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:20,319
know that's even like so early to get

492
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,399
all premature like all small little

493
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,798
heads like that unless you're growing

494
00:22:21,398 --> 00:22:26,349
like in the extreme heat of like the

495
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:27,700
Australian Sun that's gonna produce

496
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:29,798
smaller heads otherwise if you're

497
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,679
growing indoor or almost anywhere in the

498
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:34,538
world that's not tropical outdoor then

499
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,769
it's likely that those heads were never

500
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:44,288
really fully allowed to mature possible

501
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:45,788
early early harvest yeah yeah fat on me

502
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:48,038
too man I like hanging out and talking

503
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:50,278
with you guys I always try to just make

504
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:52,569
it like a not too long but not too short

505
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:55,298
it's always nice when the information

506
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:57,189
flows naturally and we can just have

507
00:22:55,298 --> 00:23:00,158
great conversations without too much

508
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,840
awkwardness like I said I'm excited for

509
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,549
any of you that are gonna be in the

510
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,648
neighbourhood of the karma cup come see

511
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,970
me I'm gonna be speaking I'm gonna be

512
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:09,459
out of booth I'll have Blue River

513
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,929
terpenes and I'm sure I'll have dabs

514
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,929
that I'll be dabbing everyone out with

515
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:16,298
as always just won't be selling the dabs

516
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:18,370
but if you're a chalice you can go check

517
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:19,990
out the real green dragon I believe they

518
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:22,000
might be selling the dabs although

519
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,859
probably not it'll probably be one of

520
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,869
those things where they just keep it and

521
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:27,819
say no this is just personal head stash

522
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:29,798
for the crew but we'll see let me know

523
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:31,869
if you guys run into the real green

524
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:34,058
dragon say hello from the bubble man and

525

526
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:40,329
if you get a chance give this video a

527
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,460
like if you get a chance or don't

528
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:43,898
whatever I mean honestly I don't want to

529
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,480
ask you to do anything that you don't

530
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:48,518

much like that Congo rip was YUM oh yeah

572
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:26,210
that's delicious that's tasty and we

573
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:32,028
won't be producing any chassis bangers

574
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:34,929
here uh no actually quite the opposite

575
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:37,460
uh no Malaya when I switched to

576
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:41,479
concentrates I was at a point where I

577
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:44,749
was smoking so much cannabis that my I

578
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:47,359
had hit a ceiling there was no more

579
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:48,858
getting past where I constantly was and

580
00:26:47,358 --> 00:26:53,720
it was kind of a little bit of a bummer

581
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:55,579
and then I got into excuse me a little

582
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,608
bit of coffee err then I got into the

583
00:26:55,579 --> 00:27:01,220
concentrates and yeah it was basically

584
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:04,428
every time I hit the I do not get a lot

585
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,909
of phlegm no I do not I woke up a little

586
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:06,769
bit

587
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:08,659
feeling like a tiny bit of a cold today

588
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:10,308
from my little son but I think it's

589
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:12,349
already most almost blown out I might

590
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:15,710
sound a little more nasally than usual

591
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:18,168
hello effect Anatole welcome I don't

592
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,429
speak Russian but I'm gonna think that

593
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,799
you might have said something like hello

594
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:24,830
from Russia or how's it going hash

595
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:26,538
family and either way it's wicked to

596
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:28,368
have some people in here from Russia I

597
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:30,679
just think the world is such a cool

598
00:27:28,368 --> 00:27:34,339
place and we've been so tricked with

599
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:35,840
trying to be divided by our borders and

600
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:38,628
our languages and our cultural

601
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:41,148
differences and they are great dividers

602
00:27:38,628 --> 00:27:43,579
don't get me wrong when we can elevate

603
00:27:41,148 --> 00:27:46,548
ourselves beyond and above those things

604
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:50,028
we really start to respect those things

605
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:52,500
instead of resent them you know like for

606
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:55,349
me anytime I go to any country

607
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:58,769
I feel like honored to be in the

608
00:27:55,349 --> 00:28:00,449
presence of another cultural group to

609
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:03,658
eat their food to listen to their music

610
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:06,960
to dance to be with the people it's just

611
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:09,659
a good thing really right on we're happy

is the attitude to have while traveling

626
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:45,150
and that's usually when you're a

627
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,620
traveler you know you're probably

628
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,419
traveling because those are the things

629
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:50,369
you're seeking out you're seeking out

630
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:52,980
these cultural differences you want to

631
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:56,339
experience other human beings living on

632
00:28:52,980 --> 00:29:00,440

in the world these treasures ever leave

648
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:45,629
Russia to go and it's because of this

649
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:49,710
relationship with Amsterdam Holland the

650
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:52,049
Netherlands teaching the Russians about

651
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:56,460

706
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,680
Washington State well Jimmy I've heard

707
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:06,429
good things about hash

708
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:08,620
Washington State it's you know I was

709
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:10,990
actually just hanging out over at the

710
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:13,389
what is it the hub studio is it the hub

711
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:15,430
studio I'll have to link them on my

712
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,220
Instagram but you must have seen some of

713
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:20,860
the glass that I've posted recently I

714
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:24,850
was lucky enough to go and visit Team

715
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:26,649
Japan play busting out some absolutely

716
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:29,409
ridiculous glass they're all building a

717
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:32,140
cup right now and dosa is also up from

718
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:34,930
Washington State and he was just saying

719
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,490
that it's quite quite wonderful in

720
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:39,220
Washington State right now with the

721
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:41,650
quality and the access that they have so

722
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,210
good for Washington State share all

723
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,800
sorts of people have complaints about it

724
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,180
I'm sure it's not the best that I'm sure

725
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,549
it's overtaxed and I'm sure it's

726
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:51,130
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah but let's just

727
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:55,990
be happy with what we have not fight

728
00:32:51,130 --> 00:33:00,100
against it and fight instead instead

729
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:01,960
we're going to fight for more for what

730
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:03,549
you want you can get what you want

731
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,500
without fighting against what already

732
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:07,899
exists when we have our foot in the door

733
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,369
you know fighting against this foot in

734
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,080
the door mentality approach is a very

735
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:13,000
dangerous thing to fight against because

736
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:14,789
it's how the cannabis movement has moved

737
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,710
us forward to where we are today

738
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:19,420
nothing's ever happened major it's been

739
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,009
these tiny little foot in the doors and

740
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,240
all the way through you've had these

741
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:24,369
people saying no that's not good enough

742
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,960
we won't accept that we can't have it

743
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,369
like that if we can't have it the way we

744
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,200
want it we don't want it it's like who

745
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:32,559
the [ __ ] is that guy talking for because

746
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,509
I want whatever I can get and then I

747
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,679
want more and more and more and yeah of

748
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:38,349
course we'd love to have it

749
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:41,440
instantaneous but holy [ __ ] man like

750
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:46,359
people fighting against access that

751
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:49,000
already exists is completely insane we

752
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:51,219
need to get our foot in the door each

753
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,049
and every time and if we can get more

754
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,299
than our foot in the door great but

755
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:58,389
don't cut out one step at a time because

756
00:33:55,299 --> 00:34:01,149
you want to jump 20 steps you know the

757
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:04,890
movement itself is not an Olympic long

758
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:07,780
jumper it's just not so baby steps right

759
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:11,800
baby steps as Richard Dreyfuss says in

760
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:16,570
the classic Bill Murray movie they call

761

00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:48,430

769
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:57,090
BC bubbleman at icloud.com what is the

770
00:34:48,429 --> 00:35:07,210
pirate say on his 80th birthday I'm 80

771
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:09,940

772
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,440
terrible it's terrible it's one of those

773
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:17,440
ones that you're not really laughing

774
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:19,809
you're just kind of like not a good way

775
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,960
to finish it bubble man not a good way

776
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:24,159
to finish it but you know what someone

777
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,530
might have gotten some enjoyment out of

778
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:29,099
that and if one person got enjoyment out

779
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:34,300
of it maybe everyone else can you know

780
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:36,099
sit on their annoyance right I'll be

781
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,870
your rep for bubble man brand Michigan

782
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:42,009
wow that's not and it's easier said than

783
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:43,960
done you can't cross state lines so

784
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,870
anywhere we set that up we have to have

785
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:49,900
our lab processing everything has to be

786
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:53,349
done in that state so I think that'll be

787
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,910
the horse before the cart you can be the

788
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:56,949
cart but we got to get the horse in

789
00:35:54,909 --> 00:36:01,559
there first and I would love to do that

790
00:35:56,949 --> 00:36:04,719
I would love to get into more states

791
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:09,940
give people access that's what it's

792
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:11,500
about right there well it was it was

793
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,940
better than the firetruck I was thinking

794
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,099
of well I told another one a while ago

795
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,900
Peter S which was kind of like my

796
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:18,549
funniest pirate joke which is the

797
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:21,190
classic you know the guy walks into the

798
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:24,280
bar he's got a steering wheel coming out

799
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:27,269
of his nuts it's out of his crotch and

800
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,519
he and he's a pirate and he the

801
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:34,018
bartender says oh my god does that hurt

802
00:36:29,518 --> 00:36:36,148
and he says are it's driving me nuts so

803
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:40,578
like that's kind of a funny pirate joke

804
00:36:36,148 --> 00:36:43,259
but I've told it before it is what it is

805
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:47,039

809
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,088
about a few weeks ago and now there's a

810
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:59,728
little bit of a sensitive nerve in the

811
00:36:57,088 --> 00:37:02,998
outside part right here and I just kind

812
00:36:59,728 --> 00:37:05,278
of pinched it and it's whoo I think we

813
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:11,958
better fix that with a rib should I do

814
00:37:05,278 --> 00:37:15,358
the Swiss perk possibly well let's do

815
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:17,808
it's so nice I looked at my sapphire

816
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:20,518
just wasn't clean enough

817
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:21,659
yeah soil King brand don't know about

818
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:23,278
that but all right

819
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:24,929
favorite rig someone already asked me

820
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:27,838
that I like them all the one that I'm

821
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:30,019
using currently ie that can change the

822
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:32,400
one that I have

823
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:35,449
certain ones I prefer to travel with

824
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,450
more than other ones

825
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:43,098
if that makes any sense so there's

826
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,539
different times you know if I'm going

827
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:46,849
out on the boat there's certain time

828
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:50,750
there's certain ones that I like to have

829
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:53,028
with me oh that sucks chilling like a

830
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:54,559
villain I hope I didn't like do some

831
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:56,690
crazy nerve damage that'll never be

832
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,880
fixed it didn't even make a mark on my

833
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,798
pinkie but it's right in there and I

834
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:06,019
definitely pinched it between the boat

835
00:38:00,798 --> 00:38:08,179
and the dock was a good one right at the

836
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:10,219
start of boating I was like it's gonna

837
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:10,848
hurt all day but it didn't I was kind of

838
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:12,679
surprised

839
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:15,170
Cannabis actually is quite amazing for

840
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:17,058
pain management and it's almost more

841
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:20,180
like it just takes the attention from

842
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:22,160
the pain receptors away and puts them on

843
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:25,009
cannabinoid receptors and it's like hey

844
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:27,250
look over here it just feels better it's

845
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,250
weird

846
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:53,769
mm how big of a part is taste and smell

847
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:56,409
when it comes to your relationship with

848
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:58,239
cannabis and hashish I would love to

849
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:59,739
come to st. birders Petersburg and swim

850
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,119
on channel rivers and see beautiful

851
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:04,739
architecture are you kidding me

852
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,739
I was just talking about that FET I

853
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:24,610
would always stay in the krasnopolskiy

854
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:36,549
hotel in Amsterdam and it always made me

855
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:40,720
want to go to Russia little wheeze in

856
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:45,250
the in the COFF there little wheezy I've

857
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:46,809
got some reason going on all right taste

858
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,639
is everything smells not that important

859
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:51,849
to you though hey Brian literal I think

860
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:54,309
smell and taste are definitely important

861
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:55,869
they're not always the same ie sometimes

862
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:57,639
it won't smell as good as it tastes

863
00:39:55,869 --> 00:40:01,029
sometimes it doesn't taste as good as it

864
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:05,159
smells it's always nice when it tastes

865
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:10,870
as good as it smells like really nice I

866
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:15,159
have a sanger as well at the V 230 the

867
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:17,049
Saenger yes my boat is a singer you

868
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,579
can't taste without your nose well there

869
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,340
you go

870
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:23,139
smell dictates buzz to a degree Eliot

871
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,000
but it's yeah it's almost like if you

872
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:27,579
really like it and you get excited you

873
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,710
almost know your your consciousness

874
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:33,159
knows oh this is gonna be a good

875
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:36,039
collaboration you know because it's like

876
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:38,679
those those receptors are really

877
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:39,940
receiving some of those components when

878
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:43,690
they're smelling them into your

879
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:48,039
olfactory the Terps absolutely those

880
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:49,329
terpenes and terpenoids mine's a

881
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:57,608
[Music]

882
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:59,318
what is mine at 2007 I purchased weed

883
00:40:57,608 --> 00:41:00,909
last night that smells amazing but gives

884
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:03,568
almost nothing when squished that's a

885
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:05,920
bummer maybe you're not squishing

886
00:41:03,568 --> 00:41:07,778
properly or though maybe you know how to

887
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,338
squish properly and its really just

888
00:41:07,778 --> 00:41:11,528
maybe not enough moisture you could try

889
00:41:09,338 --> 00:41:15,568
Boveda packs get that moisture content

890
00:41:11,528 --> 00:41:17,739
back up there moisture is a huge huge

891
00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:19,298
helping factor in this in when you

892
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:22,028
squish as squishing really is a steam

893
00:41:19,298 --> 00:41:24,219
distillation process you're steaming the

894
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:26,289
moisture out of the bud and that's

895
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:28,450
melting the rezident and pushing and

896
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:31,299
carrying it outward as the moisture

897
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:33,068
evaporates and disappears you don't want

898
00:41:31,298 --> 00:41:35,139
too much in there otherwise it tends to

899
00:41:33,068 --> 00:41:40,538
stay in the rosin and then you get that

900
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:42,190
poppy crackling rosin oh don't feel that

901
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:44,259
way Tony D all those people are

902
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,670
incredible in their own right and why

903
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:48,940
would you want to cut yourself off from

904
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:51,579
good information if it's out there go

905
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:54,608
support it I urge everyone when we turn

906
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:57,190
this off to go support the show it's not

907
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:58,989
a bad thing I don't feel wronged you

908
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:00,639
know what I mean Todd and I had been

909
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:02,679
talking about doing another show for a

910
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:06,219
long time so it's natural that he would

911
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:07,808
want to do a show after making the

912
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:09,400
decision after kind of putting me in a

913
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:11,048
position where I had to choose him or

914
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,639
someone else and I just said look I'm

915
00:42:11,048 --> 00:42:15,159
not choosing anyone I'm just saying

916
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:18,818
anyone can come at any time and if the

917
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:20,409
conversation is is is proper and it's

918
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:22,358
like I need to invite this person in

919
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:24,848
right now I can't feel that someone's

920
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:27,308
gonna feel blindsided by that so I'm

921
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:32,318
gonna say don't feel bad in supporting

922
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:34,059
that show and it's all good it's yeah

923
