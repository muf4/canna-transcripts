please don't attack us if you are

87
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,200
slightly more obsessed about this than

88
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,158
us I don't know there are people very

89
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:47,318
obsessed what I'm saying like we we had

90
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,519
some what the first F kids right okay so

91

Scott called him an ftk I was at the

92
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
shop when he pulled him out I was one of

93
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:55,318
the first probably because it was the

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,799
order that they were all put in yeah and

95
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:01,000
now apparently they're called f

96
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,599
kts and some kid was going at me for a

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,039
little while about it saying like well

98
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:07,518
you know you should know the name man

99
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,359
like if you have one you should know man

100
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,920
you know what I got a little glimpse of

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,079
it when we were in Whistler and we had

102
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,399
everyone at the table and it was Aaron

103
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:20,519
and yourself and that that cool Mike

104
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:23,918
from pton and Christian well Christian

105
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,040
is into this like he had an indep like

106
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,758
he was just like you could tell that he

107
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,759
spends a good amount of time researching

108
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,199
it and focusing on it and it's it's

109
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,000
serious uh it's a serious way of

110
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,840
collecting people really has the love

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
for sure he's got I'd say he's got the

112
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,638
obsession and I don't say that as a

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,560
negative Christian keep up your

114
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,478
obsession it's uh it's it's contagious

115
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,120
and here I am buying a

116
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:51,639
Mothership egg so should we pull it out

117
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:55,319
or what sure pull up the

118
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,918
egg pretty exciting pretty exciting so

119
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,279
yeah you guys uh these as you know are

120
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,359
fairly difficult to find I've been

121
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,918
looking for one for probably 3 months

122
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,280
and I know these guys I know these guys

123
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:08,599
and I've been looking for one of these

124
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,478
for 3 months I wasn't looking very far I

125
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,960
was just looking for them to get me one

126
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,918
and and here it is here's one so I guess

127
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,120
we better open it up it's kind of

128
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:18,680
exciting isn't it oh it's very exciting

129
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,199
it's always nice when when more

130
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,519
Mothership joins and stay the family as

131
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,919
opposed to uh you know heading off to

132
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:29,560
other parts of BC or Alberta right yeah

133
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,519
no I feel that even though you know

134
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,079
probably end up hitting those ones too

135
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,359
eventually yeah well knowing you someone

136
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,198
will come by and actually bring it for

137
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,919
you to hit so it's possible I like the

138
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:45,199
idea that this particular piece will be

139
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:47,000
a very very very well-traveled

140
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,160
Mothership it'll be internationally

141
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,639
traveled it'll be internationally

142
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,600
traveled it'll probably be going to

143
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,360
Jamaica at the end of the month and if

144
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,199
it does it will be celebrating Bob

145
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,120
Marley's uh 70th birthday party down at

146
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,079
uh 56 Hope Road that's of course the

147
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,360
house that he purchased off of uh Chris

148
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,000
Blackwell when he kind of started making

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,800
it he really wanted to own that house

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,038
and that's actually the house that he he

151
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,720
ended his life in he he didn't pass in

152
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:13,680
that exact house but he lived there

153
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,479
right up until the time uh he passed

154
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,519
away amazing yeah so that's 56 hope Roo

155
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,560
and uh I was really excited to see

156
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:25,879
recently that my buddies the

157
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,319
nomads uh got um basically they are one

158
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:31,360
of three Bob Marley ambassadors for the

159
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,960
70th anniversary so you've got chronics

160
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,879
obviously chronics is one of the top

161
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,680
names in reggae music right now uh

162
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:40,038

like they were like do you use this I

226
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,879
was like yeah it's fully used but it's

227
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,078
cleaned and they were like it's cleaned

228
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,480
cuz you know what happens if it's not

229
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:19,719
clean right I was like oh yeah you guys

231

I'll never see it again blah blah blah

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,159
blah blah blah blah and they were like

233
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,200
yeah that's right and they were like so

234
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:28,838
still though it's used I was like yeah

235
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,079
it's cleaned it's used it's cleaned it's

236
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,640
all good but then after they took it

237
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:34,039
away and swabbed it and did all their

238
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,600
things they started talking to me about

239
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,879
it and like the value of these things

240
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,759
and like how they're made and all that

241
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,600
kind of stuff and they actually found

242
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,958
out quite fascinating wow yeah I had a

243
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,639
good hourong conversation with the

244
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,639
Border guards about the glass world I'm

245
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,480
glad that it came to that you were able

246
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,000
to get through get all your pipes back

247
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,039
into Canada and just have uh no real

248
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,360
experiences cuz that would have been

249
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,919
that must have been really hard for you

250
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,360
cuz he didn't have one piece or two or

251
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:03,679
three or four I'm pretty sure he had

252
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,680
like nine or something nine or 10

253
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,440
super super heady pieces that you take

254
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,880
over the Border not as heavy as the

255
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,279
sublimator roar though yeah apparently

256
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,799
that well you know what sorry

257
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:19,200
sorry it's true the real reason that the

258
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,719
sublimator rure will take first place

259
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,959
over uh pieces of this um Quality is the

260
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,639
simple fact that it's the only piece in

261
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,559
the entire competition that everyone's

262
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,078
hitting

263
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:36,039
the whole cup and this year the cup was

264
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:37,799
canell so it was it was even more so the

265
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:42,078
only place that people could go was to

266
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:45,599
the greenhouse and try it so it was and

267
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:48,078
and as the dampering gallery is a

268
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,440
little step back because it doesn't have

269
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:50,359
the exposure that a coffee shop would

270
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,720
cuz if you're going to the gallery

271
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,079
you're going to see art you know you're

272
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,320
going to buy something you're going to

273
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,759
go and look at the pipes you're going to

274
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,200
go and look at the t-shirts true they

275
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,838
don't have this the hang no yeah exactly

276
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,000
the like the Conant walk through you

277
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,880
know but other than that I mean we

278
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,559
actually did have quite a lot of

279
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,039
visitors this time around I think it was

280
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,319
great I think the dam cring was in a

281
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:09,399
position that they could have become

282
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,800
even more oh that they could you know

283
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:14,879
they will yeah building it I think the

284
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:18,879
Cup this year not to get off topic um

285
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,720
but it was almost like an old '90s cup

286
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,480
because of the way it was broken up and

287
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,959
because there was no main venue it was

288
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,959
like oh you could go to all these little

289
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:28,278
shops it would have been cool if all of

290
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:30,919
the people who had booths were able to

291
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:34,278
go and get and set up in a coffee shop

292
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:37,000
so if you had like Som and myself and a

293
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:38,039
couple others in Amnesia or you had do

294
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,600
you know what I'm saying and then you

295
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:41,838
just have a list you have your you have

296
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,519
your little because nowadays we know

297
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,240
that the herb itself isn't enough to

298
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,879
bring the people to each shop but if you

299
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,600
had like hit man at this place and you

300
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,838
had Som at this place and you had you

301
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,320
know what I mean like all of these over

302
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,680
here exactly you know emotech held it

303
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,839

304
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,838

cono sweet skun and Congo there you go

355
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,399
wonderful the uh the combination of

356
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,120
those two I think can only be a win-win

357
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,879
of course I was lucky enough to check

358
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,078
out uh Remo's sweet skunk the other day

359
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:26,039
in fact I

360
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:28,198
brought in that little pouch right there

361
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:30,120
um Remo's buds if you guys want to roll

362
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:31,439
yourself up joint or if you just want to

363
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,360
look through them and smell them those

364
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,320
were grown with Remo's nutrients cool

365
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,959
and uh a lot of people ask me if Remo's

366
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,600
nutrients are organic I would say

367
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:44,359
absolutely not um however I have to say

368
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,440
all the stuff that I've ever um used

369
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,399
from Remo whether it's been vaporized or

370
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,920
made dry sift or made wet washed it's

371
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:56,078
been on point so you know I of course

372
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm a bit of a purist I do prefer um

373
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:01,638
organic outdoor sungrown tropical IAL

374
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,360
Jamaican resin but that's not saying

375
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:07,839
that that's all I ever

376
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:12,480
hit I know that uh years ago there was a

377
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:15,399
sweet skunk outdoor crop done and it was

378
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,920
unfortunately not flashed and so it was

379
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,958
beautiful sweet skunk bud but when you

380
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,519
rolled it up and tried to burn it uh it

381
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:25,000
would burn with a very black ash so I

382
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,879
took the same um material almost a pound

383
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,639
of it and turned it into some really

384
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,439
lovely hash and the hash smoked with a

385
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,600
white ash

386
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,279
perfectly was only the flower material

387
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,720
right that was that was holding I guess

388
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,198
what I'm saying is that through my own

389
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,560
bioassay my own hyper awareness I'm very

390
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,479
sensitive like if someone lit a

391
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:46,399
cigarette I would feel ill speaking of

392
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,639
someone who smokes cigarettes I can I'm

393
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,278
trying to quit trying to quit but me and

394
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,278
Mark Travel often and when I smoke 20

395
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:56,078
minutes later all come into the room

396
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:57,360
it's been 20 minutes 20 minutes for sure

397
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:58,958
no one else can smell a thing and you've

398
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,278
been outside the whole time the whole

399
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,679
time totally and wearing a jacket with a

400
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,159
sweater and I'll take my jacket off I'll

401
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:06,958
sit down nextor he can still smell so I

402
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,719
will definitely attest to that I'm

403
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,879
telling you my old factory is has been

404
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,319
off the chain for a long long time yeah

405
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,639
it's pretty H hyper intensive I'm going

406
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:18,360
to get a little

407
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,839
congoo goodness that thing rips

408
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,199
wonderfully it really does I mean I'm uh

409
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,680
it really does I'm pretty excited about

410
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:29,519
this it's

411
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:32,120
uh lovely

412
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,759
just [ __ ] holding it

413
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,278
down and you know what it's good that

414
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,720
there's a company like high integrity

415
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,600
glass art who's bringing it to BC

416
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,040
because so many people want this trust

417
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,879
me on this guys there are enough people

418
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:49,240
down in the US that want this that if

419
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,559
Mothership and Scott deppy uh weren't

420
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,278
you know decided they didn't want to

421
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,359
send them up to Canada they could easily

422
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,399
get rid of them down in the US so I

423
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,120
think it's very generous that a I'm

424
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,399
stoked that these guys have created a

425
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,919
relationship with Mothership and done

426
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,119
good enough business and had a good

427
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,798
enough relationship that they continue

428
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,918
to send um these beautiful pieces up

429
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:12,439
here thank you it's very fair it is but

430
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,319
I mean also

431
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,400
like like we there's a love for the art

432
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:19,959
a love for the artist a true

433
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,559
appreciation for the art itself which is

434
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,679
why you know like prices

435
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:29,200
aren't hyper exaggerated or overextended

436
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,200
to the point you know where where where

437
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,000
some like online internet sales and

438
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,960
stuff like that some sometimes it can be

439
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,079
like that but you know so there's like a

440
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,720
love and appreciation both ways between

441
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:46,038
