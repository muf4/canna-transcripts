antiques

6
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,509
he's got the bubble mouth of up above

7
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,120
except it's a bubble bank it's this guy

8

is the master of the bowl all right

9
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:45,119

13
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,808
Denver Colorado

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,780
thanks everybody for showing up it's

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,000
been a bit of a chaotic Cup with the

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,829
with the government pushing us out here

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,659
and there and just trying to mess with

18
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:08,978
us but I'm happy to see that my time to

19
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,570
pulled it off and we still have a venue

20
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:13,390
thanks to the milkman I know we've been

21
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:17,439
coming here for Gee's years like maybe

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:19,719
20 years or more for myself I want to

23
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,700
introduce Tony here who I've got they

24
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,189
mentioned from River Rock he's also from

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:28,629
United cannabis and I guess it was gonna

26
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:29,799
kind of start this particular talk about

27
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:32,259
a little bit about what we've been doing

28
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,978
how Tony and I are connected were both

29
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:37,299
obvious resin aficionados

30
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,368
he's been while you've been making water

31
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:41,530
gosh and growing her and doing all these

32
00:01:39,368 --> 00:01:43,719
things for the last 15 plus years I

33
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,359
would say Tony oh yeah I'm started in 96

34
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:49,118
96 okay so you're about 18 years in so

35
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:51,879
that's great I started a similar amount

36
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:55,000
of time I was a 92 93 started growing

37
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:57,789
cannabis got into cannabis activism and

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,980
I need three 94-95 and that's what we

39
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,970
got we were applying for HAMP licenses

40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,370
in Manitoba

41
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:05,409
that got him growing there legally for

42
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,660
the first time in 73 years it's been

43
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,399
growing ever since I think my little

44
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:11,079
partner is Alex might be in the room for

45
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:15,159
Manitoba harvest and fresh mountain

46
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:19,510
foods and from there I you know got into

47
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:23,169
the hash game in the late 90s so I guess

48
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:25,269
where we're coming from is recently we

49
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:26,500
started a project I'm sure a lot of you

50
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,520
guys have heard there's all sorts of

51
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,520
different things happening in the world

52
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,180
Tony himself is a part of the very big

53
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,890
project called United cannabis and

54
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,890
United cannabis nested licenses all over

55
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:42,339
North America and in Canada have applied

56
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:44,769
for in Jamaica which is really what

57
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,969
brought Tony and I together working

58
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,000
together was a project that we started

59
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:51,099
in Jamaica a company that I started with

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,259
my Jamaican partners as well as Johnny B

61
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:54,699
John her fellow who may also be in the

62
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:58,269
room here somewhere I'm not sure if he

63
00:02:54,699 --> 00:03:00,909
is right I'm Johnny B so we started this

64
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,480
company in Jamaica and we partnered up

65
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:05,159
with United cannabis new Tony is

66
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,369
big part of they also have Bernie

67
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,680
Blackmun from the United cannabis and

68
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,270
River Rock Wellness Center in the room

69
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,540
today as well I'm not sure where exactly

70
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:19,050
he has been he's here as well and what

71
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:20,219
this project is is I mean I'll let them

72
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,510
tell that you tell a little bit about

73
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,359
your night of cannabis and then we'll

74
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:25,949
bring in to meet your maker

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,170
okay well I'm gonna bring it always back

76
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:32,488
to the resin because I think it's

77
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:34,679
important and as Clark explained even up

78
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,319
until a year ago your eyes open when you

79
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,860
start to explore the different varieties

80
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:43,048
of cannabis and its forms which also

81
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,930
will represent the variety of resident

82
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:48,689
and the type of profile that you're

83
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:52,620
gonna get from it so a lot of people I

84
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:53,849
think look at bubble bags they look at

85
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,680
different streams and different things

86
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,479
and think that's gonna make it that's

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,629
the that's the winning ticket that's the

88
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:03,929
magic of how to make the resin or the

89
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:06,568
been aesthetics exceptional and really

90
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,750
it's a it's a relationship with the

91
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:12,179
genetics the resin the cultivation the

92
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,739
extraction process and then ultimately

93
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,220
what are you doing with it

94
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,918
so as far as most societies and cultures

95
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,109
they think of the pot leaf and they

96
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,609
think of cannabis and they think of okay

97
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,620
that's for the stomach community we

98
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,650
can't we can't possibly have those

99
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,769
people in our town so that's kind of

100
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:33,949
where it always starts in

101
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:36,229
how that medical cannabis pushing part

102
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:37,550
of the states and countries there I

103
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,710
think the government's are slowly

104
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,290
starting to realize that while there is

105
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:44,689
made use of medical benefits here and so

106
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,270
those avenues are now being pushed open

107
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:49,730
but ultimately at the end of the day

108
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:53,209
it's free it's free the plan free the

109
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:55,730
resident so that we can explore it in

110
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:58,250
its full capacity so social acceptance

111
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:01,340
and responsibilities of cannabis to be

112
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,769
used probably should be legalized the

113
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:07,219
medical evidence of cannabis should be

114
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:09,979
explored to its fullest with all science

115
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,590
and research as well as the industrial

116
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,930
uses of hell that's could be restore

117
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:19,969
farming back in the United States and

118
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:21,860
provide limitless jobs and so the idea

119
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,630
of what we were trying to do which is

120
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,730
the simple starting up of River Rock

121
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:28,310
which is a Medical Center and also a

122
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:34,340
recreation center at Colorado was

123
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:36,790
finding a way to synergize the final

124
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:39,829
therapeutics of the plant and up and the

125
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:43,040
cannabinoid profiles into standardized

126
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:45,019
resin and so you have to figure out

127
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,060
where to start when you think about

128
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:48,849
standardizing resin for medicinal

129
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:55,220
purposes and what that actually means

130
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:57,230
it's tony was doing this with river rock

131
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,780
Tony and hurry while they were mastering

132
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,419
the growing aspect and the business

133
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,888
aspect

134
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:04,408
of dealing with all these different

135
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:06,689
people it's very difficult particularly

136
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:09,569
when running a dispensary to deal with

137
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:11,009
the patients they have difficulty in

138
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,810
their life they're in trials and

139
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:15,270
tribulations they've got health problems

140
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,978
so just dealing with them alone is a big

141
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:19,560
deal so while these guys were doing that

142
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:23,098
work I of course have been spending the

143
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,860
last 15 years learning about isolating

144
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:29,128
and decontaminating resin glands of a

145
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,169
particular variety of candidates stocked

146
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,180
and sets of stocks are the two that I

147
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:35,490
prefer all of us being a lower quality

148
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,348
gland that tends to make up a lot of the

149
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,329
extra weight and oil extractions but

150
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:44,158
doesn't have as much of an important

151
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:45,778
factor at least in the recreational and

152
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:47,699
what I would call the extreme medical

153
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:49,439
where as you know you know a serious

154
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,919
ailment you're in stage three or four

155
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:55,050
and you need serious saturation of and

156
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,810
of cannabinoids by the cannabinoids into

157
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,340
your endocannabinoids system I'm not to

158
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,439
say that there's no medicinal value in

159
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:04,348
Balthus trichomes I'm sure once we get

160
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,629
into the know the actual study of

161
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:10,528
specific types of glands and learning

162
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:12,300
where these cannabinoids exist in the

163
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:14,310
different glands that we'll be able to

164
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,300
do specific work breeding and whatnot

165
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:20,519
but basically I came in ask the sort of

166
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,338
decontaminate you know what the quality

167
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,930
that I've set has really led me into the

168
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:27,750
team that these guys are building which

169
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,490
is the United cannabis it's really a

170
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,129
beautiful thing to see unity in the

171
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,889
cannabis industry and to see a standard

172
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:37,080
set so it's not about who you are or

173
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:39,329
it's basically really all about what you

174
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,188
know and what standard you can set so

175
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,339
here a breeder of exceptional

176
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:45,100
exceptional town

177
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:46,719
with exceptional talent or a processor

178
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,390
then you're probably going to find

179
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,980
yourself you know with a position in

180
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,729
United cannabis one day because it

181
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:57,990
really is this incredibly large growing

182
00:07:53,730 --> 00:08:01,840
company that has a really incredible

183
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:04,120
route of foundation which is to produce

184
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,489
the utmost quality of medicine to

185
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,959
extract and process to the purest form

186
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:13,480
to give access to all of the different

187
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:17,289
people who have a necessity for cannabis

188
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,870
I I get talked to I get spoken to on a

189
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:22,540
daily basis with people who are sick and

190
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,430
I mean nothing compared to Tony I know

191
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:28,569
Riverrock sees over a hundred thousand

192
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:30,519
people annually so the that's a big part

193
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,080
of what River Rock brought to the table

194
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,569
and you know if cannabis is that they

195
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,670
brought this incredible empirical

196
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,030
evidence this sort of data that's coming

197
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:41,349
right from the patients and I like to

198
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:43,360
let me talk a little bit about that

199
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,759
because they created a program so that

200
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,590
information would not be lost but so

201
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,389
that information can be accessed in the

202
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:52,240
new and a new interesting type of way

203
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:56,889
that allows for more knowledge to be

204
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,110
gained yeah it started you know everyone

205
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:00,549
starts by saying hey try this drink this

206
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,930
will be really good for your Crohn's so

207
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:04,719
we're trying this hash this would be

208
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:06,099
really good for your back and then you

209
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,330
look at the research and you start to

210
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,610
study what's called cannabis

211
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,129
pharmacokinetics and you start to look

212
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,110
at how long this active THC and active

213
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:16,590
CBD stained your liver stay in your

214
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,310
brain how long does that take to process

215
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,019
and there's one

216
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:22,779
interesting books and literature that's

217
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:25,269
come about more publications of coming

218
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:27,610
out and so there's two there's two

219
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:29,860
fundamentals that we really focused on

220
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,930
which was Mike reducing its and the

221
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,310
stacking method and some of you know the

222
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:37,120
static method when you think of rare

223
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:40,419
exceptions well a lot of people have

224
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,259
been exposed to Gupta in his entourage

225
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:45,969
effect we like to call the full spectrum

226
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:48,939
effect so you think of whole planet full

227
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,070
spectrum full terpene restoration type

228
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,100
of medicine that could be delivered in

229
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:57,010
inactive and active micro dosing as well

230
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,019
as stacking method what makes our system

231
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:02,230
a little bit different and it's kind of

232
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:05,769
like the backs we separated cannabis

233
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,629
high ridge CBD strains and high THC with

234
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:10,419
high terpene profile strains into four

235
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:13,629
categories those categories are simple 1

236
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:15,610
2 3 4 breakfast lunch dinner at bedtime

237
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:19,720
and each one of those categories

238
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:23,019
represents different types whole plant

239
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:27,279
medicine in a sense that poppy once all

240
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:31,299
whole plan THC a with terpene profiles

241
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,769
that match those particular those

242
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:36,789
particular strengths so if you're

243
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:38,649
looking to breed high THC with something

244
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:41,649
that would that you found

245
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:44,860
creating pain relief anti planetory

246
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:46,740
energy increased appetite that you would

247
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,230
use those terpenes as Lodge of theirs

248
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:54,100
and so the extraction process of trying

249
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:56,050
to get where people were at probably two

250
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,709
years of the floor was simply just

251
00:10:56,049 --> 00:11:02,258
taking water - or taking their hassle

252
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:05,409
combined with coconut oil and trying to

253
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:08,490
create a simple delivery system because

254
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:11,350
most of us don't want to use alcohols or

255
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:14,980
solvents or chemicals in the medicines

256
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,509
process and so ideally what we're

257
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,178
talking about because it sounds

258
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:22,539
confusing I'm sure out there is allowed

259
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:25,749
to take a whole plant and its medicinal

260
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:28,269
properties and categorizing them so a

261
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:31,959
category one people would be high THC

262
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:35,919
with certain profiles a category to be

263
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:38,169
high CBD a low THC a would sir turkey

264
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,748
profiles a category 3 would be the close

265
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:44,438
ratios and a clock category 4 would be

266
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:46,990
fully activated CBD fully activated CBN

267
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:49,509
creating a wanna watch those four ratio

268
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,299
those four categories allows patients

269
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:54,039
and physicians to sequence full-spectrum

270
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:56,558
cannabinoid therapies

271
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:59,259
Fanny and I so the longer is in a strain

272
00:11:56,558 --> 00:12:01,749
you can dial 8 the type of

273
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:02,430
accommodations as an example autism

274
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:06,420
might

275
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:09,539
active p22 milligrams per mole for

276
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:12,419
breakfast and for lunch and an active p4

277
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,129
for dinner six milligrams changes a

278
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:17,429
person's life from a dollar thirty

279
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:21,480
instead of tried to concentrate 70

280
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:24,088
milligrams of a flower or it's 250

281
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,050
milligrams and to a piece of hash to

282
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:29,160
that smoker because it's one-dimensional

283
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:32,278
canal we didn't what type of delivery

284
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:35,299
system so between the micro dosing and

285
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:39,838
the capsules and the categories we've

286
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:41,849
basically created a way to to allow

287
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,080
physicians and patients to use

288
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,839
cannabinoids similar to music notes

289
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,580
absolutely you guys if Tony's confusing

290
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,709
a few of you guys I'll just give you a

291
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,560
really brief lowdown on waist talk about

292
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:58,919
keys he's talking pure clap profile he's

293
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,750
talking about the resin off of the plant

294
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,458
that produces the medicines so the

295
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:06,370
glandular trichomes whether they've been

296
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:07,929
extracted via water hash via

297
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,209
have the extracts that do a lot of the

298
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:11,859
work for them in Colorado or whether

299
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,899
it's been dry sifted or even whether

300
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,990
it's been hydrocarbon extracted by the

301
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:19,839
giddy from with emo tech they tweak

302
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,909
those resins and then they break them

303
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,920
down they know the exact amounts per

304
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:25,929
milligram per pill and the pill should

305
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:29,159
really be called capsules because all

306
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:31,870
they really are capsules filled with

307
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:34,179
coconut oil and energy be used all while

308
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,409
as well well so coconut oil causes

309
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,969
problems because there's actually

310
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:39,308
patients out there that are allergic to

311
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,778
coconut oil and so we start to see

312
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:42,850
thousands of patients and you start

313
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:45,009
having people come back with burning

314
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,769
sensations down their throat because

315
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:50,980
they took coconut oil inside at work so

316
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:54,459
we brought a medical adviser that

317
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,819
discovered stem cells in 1988 and is one

318
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,869
of the leading cancer and tumor research

319
00:13:56,818 --> 00:14:03,009
scientists on the planet he has 200

320
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:05,078
peer-reviewed articles and developed

321
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:07,240
what's called patient avatars so he's

322
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:11,289
actually created what's called cancer no

323
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,610
5 natural plant-based herbs that have

324
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:15,428
been put together to create a

325
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,438
synergistic effect if by cancer tumors

326
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:19,928
and children and so as a patient

327
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:21,759
advocate our work actually removes the

328
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:24,389
stem cells out of the patient while

329
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,970
being treated with chemo or radiation

330
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:32,589
and then using natural supplements and

331
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:34,569
specialized types of foods to bring back

332
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:36,850
that system get them through the chemo

333
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:38,828
radiation that reinstall all the stem

334
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:43,028
cells they have the technology to

335
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:45,068
recreate that in rodent studies and so

336
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:48,679
what we're able to do now is extrapolate

337
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:52,250
cancer patients autoimmune autism

338
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:54,889
epilepsy that vas fibromyalgia and

339
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,799
recreate those patient avatar simulators

340
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:59,960
and be able to dial it those particular

341
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:02,509
categories so instead of chasing the

342
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,360
Holy Grail we're chasing that straight

343
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:07,338
or chasing that one CBD well now this

344
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,289
has been put into a software that

345
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,450
physicians can understand it's simple

346
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:13,309
for patients to understand because once

347
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:17,060
you create the bridge between the two

348
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:19,039
and allow the two best delivery methods

349
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:21,259
for this type of medicine and they have

350
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,370
flexibility then you could dial it any

351
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:25,100
condition you could do it very

352
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,570
effectively and not cost yourself a lot

353
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,600
of money and that's really been a big

354
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,730
big thing with it yeah I guess also go

355
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,350
back to a little bit of an explanation

356
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:37,399
because I guess we're assuming a lot

357
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:39,528
here we all have a system in our bodies

358
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,690
called the endocannabinoids system and

359
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:43,399
this system regulates much of the

360
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,770
biological function that goes on in our

361
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,629
body including when we go to sleep and

362
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:50,149
when we wake up

363
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:53,720
get hungry and how well we remember and

364
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:55,370
so the how it does as it regulates our

365
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,800
immune system and our central nervous

366
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,600
system and it puts them into harmony so

367
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,149
when they are in disharmony with those

368
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,000
two systems it usually means that our

369
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:06,799
endocannabinoids system is deficient and

370
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,070
to give you an idea of the importance of

371
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:13,699
cannabinoids breast milk in women

372
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:15,200
produces essential amino acids which are

373
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,509
basically the building blocks of life

374
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,300
and when you ask your doctor why that is

375
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:22,129
they don't usually know but those amino

376
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:24,949
acids actually produce endocannabinoids

377
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:27,080
inside your body so the endo meaning and

378
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,629
dajin ously inside of you and then

379
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,759
cannabinoids cannabis produces what are

380
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:35,179
called fico cannabinoids and so we could

381
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,250
use those not necessarily as well as the

382
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:40,149
smoking and vaporizing aspects that's

383
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,289
great for tremors and it's great for

384
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:44,569
ocular pressure and it's great for

385
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:45,889
increasing appetite but what tony is

386
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,379
talking about for a lot of these

387
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:51,949
different elements the importance is to

388
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:53,419
eat and consume orally or use creams or

389
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:56,480
use these drops and get these

390
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:58,219
cannabinoids into your system so they

391
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,250
can do the work that they do which is

392
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,810
basically fine the cb1 and cb2 receptors

393
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,689
that are found in your brain and in your

394
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:08,299
peripheral organs and what you know by

395
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:09,980
basically I use the metaphor that a lot

396
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:11,159
of us are blown away we think it's

397
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,259
amazing when

398
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,420
we important a gave a young little baby

399
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:17,069
girl eight months old she had the brain

400
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,660
tumor in her head splitting the

401
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,849
hemispheres of her brain and he started

402
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,820
giving her the cannabis oil of photo

403
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:26,639
cannabinoids and of course her tumor

404
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:29,279
shrunk miraculously and toni has

405
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,840
literally dozens and dozens and maybe

406
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,430
hundreds and hundreds of these stories

407
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,470
of people with bone cancer and

408
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,299
metastatic breast cancer of people with

409
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,730
autism that have never led a normal life

410
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,319
and one time after another it's always

411
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,009
the same thing isn't it Tony it's a

412
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,439
miracle

413
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:45,569
yes so once you start databasing those

414
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,480
results that's what kind of drove us

415
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:49,829
that's literally with drugs to dni

416
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,470
cannabis and that it was kind of our

417
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:54,689
fiduciary duty if you will to bring that

418
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,039
information to light and it started with

419
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,480
Rob's that sort of the textures that

420
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:00,149
started with strains and now it's

421
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,440
literally sublingual drops capsules in

422
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:06,780
what I call bio nutrient so most people

423
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,299
that are terminal or people that are

424
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:11,849
having to rely on medicine also allow

425
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:14,190
their medicine as a food and so bile

426
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:16,019
nutrient medicinals and so we were

427
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,720
talking about coconut oil before and

428
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:21,269
coconut oils okay it's pretty good

429
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,819
we used a proprietary

430
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:26,279
between coconut palms as well as

431
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:29,759
polarizing that and then utilizing

432
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:33,960
natural turkey extractions to that be

433
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:36,109
able to pull whether it's live resin or

434
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,000
the different backs into that plant fat

435
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:40,919
so that's kind of the newer thing I like

436
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,049
the way you just held up the peer vial

437
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,240
of terpenes like it was nothing

438
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:47,970
this is pretty cutting edge stuff right

439
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,589
here it's been only in the last year

440
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,019
that we've been reading about K from

441
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:53,579
trichome technologies you can you could

442
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:55,139
smell it later too yeah we'll definitely

443
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:57,480
let you do a smell of this this is

444
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,000
Tony's own creation I was actually

445
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,529
speaking with K months ago and he was

446
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
telling me you gotta figure out terpene

447
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:04,349
extraction this is gonna be the big

448
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,390
thing you got to figure out how to get

449
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:08,789
it back out of the water you of course I

450
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,340
make a lot of water hash and that water

451
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:14,190
hash of course is using water soluble

452
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:16,649
terpenes it's losing terpenes and now I

453
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,930
remember Jim for air singing I have done

454
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,370
show recently and he must be a chemist

455
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,710
he's definitely a very intelligent man

456
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:25,799
but he was saying that the water can't

457
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,870
reach the wax membrane but I disagreed I

458
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:29,519
think that once the head breaks off and

459
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:31,709
it breaks away from the capitate stop

460
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:36,750
that that thin membrane underneath the

461
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:39,870
head is allowing terpenes to be released

462
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:42,490
into the water as well as water being

463
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:46,089
absorbed into the wax membrane

464
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,710
why we all know made water hash that

465
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:49,959
really the most difficult thing in

466
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,299
making water hash is actually drying the

467
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,910
final product the water in the ice gets

468
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:56,859
all the credit I'm sorry it's doing all

469
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:59,800
the work it's isolating the resin it's d

470
00:19:56,859 --> 00:20:02,229
contaminating everything for you at 99%

471
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,470
so please keep the water in the ice some

472
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:08,140
credit and after that it's really like

473
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,509
what what I think the extract artist is

474
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,450
is the guy who really knows how to

475
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:17,259
control his variables and to get that

476
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:20,170
hash properly dry so what Tony's done

477
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:22,210
with those water soluble terpenes is

478
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,519
he's figured out a way to extract them

479
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,230
in a pure form so a lot of people that

480
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:27,789
follow me and try to wonder like what am

481
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,339
i doing the terpene so the fun side of

482
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:33,940
that as I was a response so we

483
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:36,240
reintroduced that into a full belt or a

484
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,130
live resin or anything else like that

485
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,890
they act as modulators and we've done

486
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,980
that from people like Robert Clark they

487
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,900
want to be able that talked before us

488
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,870
they act as modulators and so these

489
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,000
things that we see is terpenes and look

490
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:54,428
at that as flavors and smells they

491
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,619
actually are catalyst for THC as well as

492
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:58,780
all the other cannabinoids so now

493
00:20:56,619 --> 00:21:00,789
there's The DaVinci Code goes a little

494
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:02,950
deeper or the root boost code it was a

495
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:06,089
little deeper when you start looking at

496
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:09,220
species across the world resin genetics

497
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:12,159
terpene profiles that then lock and key

498
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,650
with cannabinoids and then those get

499
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,630
delivered to the central nervous system

500
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,850
or the immune system those two

501
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,530
deliveries excellent

502
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:23,589
I guess leading into the water

503
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:25,629
extraction and losing of the water

504
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:27,569
soluble has also led me over the years

505
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,670
of course

506
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:32,549
mentored by guys like Rob Clark and the

507
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,470
stock man I have been led into the

508
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:37,019
wonderful world of dry scent as many of

509
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,450
you know I've been sharing techniques

510
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,160
that I'm available to that I'm able to

511
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:44,460
I've learned a few new tricks over the

512
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:48,000
years and have been just sharing with

513
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:51,210
people the simple aspects of having a

514
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,740
quiver as if you're a hash maker and you

515
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,539
think of each arrow that's in your

516
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,759
quiver as one of your techniques or one

517
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:59,670
of your methods to me the more arrows

518
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:01,589
the better and so dry sifting is tip

519
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,870
it's the holy grail in my opinion that

520
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:06,119
before you're making your oil before

521
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:09,479
you're making your wet wash it's never a

522
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:12,299
bad idea to look into a little dry

523
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,549
sifting it's different it's not based on

524
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,529
a prohibition based model in this day

525
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:18,659
and age the same way as cutting your

526
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:20,549
herb fresh drying and selling it how

527
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:23,070
much can I get and how fast can I get it

528
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:24,659
it's really more of an intimate

529
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:27,269
relationship with the plant that you can

530
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,769
grow the plant yourself you can hang it

531
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:30,299
you can practice hanging it for

532
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:32,609
different amounts of times and you'll

533
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,139
learn in this amazing way that oh well

534
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:38,219
the plant releases resin differently

535
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:40,590
depending on how I just cure it so dry

536
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,410
sifting is really not a misnomer the

537
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:46,059
word dry is very important the dry ice

538
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:50,769
is horses sort of confused that a lot

539
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:53,200
dry dry set using dry ice which i think

540
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:55,750
is it's definitely works it's doable but

541
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,200
you run into a couple of variables that

542
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:02,529
are going to be problematic which is a

543
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,509
cleaning the hash dry rest glands and I

544
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:05,920
wish I have photos you guys can maybe

545
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:09,549
you do already but you can check me out

546
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,990
on bc bubbleman on instagram and all the

547
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:12,940
photos are there on the rest of Latin

548
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,650
photos and you just if you see my resin

549
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,940
glands when they're living on the planet

550
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,130
they're very bulbous and they look like

551
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,840
a water balloon ready to burst as

552
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:23,440
opposed to when the plants been dried

553
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:26,230
probably the resin shrinks like a resin

554
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,720
raising sorry resin raising and it

555
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,910
really is much easier to work with

556
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,559
whether you're guarding whether you're

557
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,890
doing the to screen trick that I've been

558
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,210
sharing for the last maybe six months I

559
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,980
learned from a guy online but he he

560
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,360
became such an incredible douchebag I

561
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,559
can't even give him a shout out in my

562
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:43,479
mind so that's unfortunate

563
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:46,059
I do like to give credit where it is due

564
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,710
but I won't give him credit so this guy

565
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:49,389
came up with a really cool idea and I

566
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:53,200
will share it with you guys it's a dry

567
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:55,150
set concept and it's a it's two screens

568
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,700
that are much larger than your average

569
00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:01,660
sized rostov screens most of you that do

570
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:04,029
sift maybe you know 150 160 180 micron

571
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:06,040
is a pretty big screen I know there's a

572
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:07,730
company out there called eight-eight

573
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:09,920
extractors or something

574
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:12,019
they sell a tumbler with a 200 micron

575
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,470
screen I think that's incredibly large

576
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:19,670
for Dras 15 but most use it about a 150

577
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:21,529
so this trip uses a 250 micron and a 180

578
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,360
my friend and I figured while we're up

579
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:25,250
here talking about all this crazy stuff

580
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,349
I should at least give you a couple of

581
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,890
hash tears so here's one for you

582
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:32,869
the 250 and the 180 I saw them both you

583
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,030
can buy them both anywhere as a

584
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:37,489
silkscreen err but you won't be able to

585
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:39,740
order them at micron silk is measured in

586
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,390
lines per inch or mesh so if you want

587
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,170
those two screens you're gonna ask for a

588
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:47,090
90 mesh and a 60 mesh and you're going

589
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,180
to be a little confused because the 60

590
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:52,609
is gonna go on top of the 90 okay these

591
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,310
are counterintuitive numbers micron is

592
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:56,869
the size of the whole mesh and lines per

593
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:59,480
inch are just that they are how many

594
00:24:56,869 --> 00:25:01,729
lines of self you can get in one inch

595
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,430
and so it's not based on the diameter of

596
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:06,410
the hole coming into the numbers that

597
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,960
the bigger the number is four microns

598
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:11,990
the smaller the number is four lines per

599
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,120
inch so really remember that a 60 micron

600
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:17,210
or 60 lines per inch screen which is the

601
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:19,849
250 micron goes on top and it sits like

602
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:23,410
a dish so the size of the frame are

603
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:27,379
going up and you put that on top of your

604
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:29,000
90 LBI which is a 180 but instead of

605
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,490
keeping it the right way you flip it

606
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,650
upside down so now the screen is flush

607
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,359
and there's no there's no edges it's

608
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,160
just the screens that I sell or any

609
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,799
silkscreen you flip that one upside down

610
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:43,550
on the bottom put four spacers on the

611
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,980
corner and let and set the other 60

612
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:47,389
lines per inch stream the 250 micron

613
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,110
I'll keep repeating both numbers because

614
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:52,820
it's totally confusing you put it on top

615
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:53,569
now the way this process works is

616
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:56,929
there's a boat

617
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:59,179
an inch space between the two screens

618
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,640
and what happens is is when you throw

619
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:06,440
material down whether it be sift or plat

620
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:09,110
matter it the way the resin falls is the

621
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,910
gland heads fall like stones straight

622
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,409
through because the screens are so big

623
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,090
they don't really get caught up on

624
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:17,060
anything so they just fall straight

625
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:19,339
through now the capitate stops the

626
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:21,559
systole pairs and the stigmas and any

627
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:26,659
really other smaller components of

628
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:28,519
contaminant they fall like this and they

629
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,470
do this little thing when they hit the

630
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:33,170
second screen because they're doing this

631
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,910
they usually stick right into it it's

632
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,800
quite something to lift the first screen

633
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,980
and if you get down on the table and you

634
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,899
look even with it it's just trees of

635
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,390
contaminant it's it's unbelievable when

636
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,850
if you touch it like that you just

637
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,670
dropped 50% of that camp contaminant

638
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:51,589
through so it is super ultra delicate so

639
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,830
you're not working the material you're

640
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:58,189
literally throwing material down lifting

641
00:26:54,829 --> 00:27:00,589
both screens very gently and on the

642
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:03,529
bottom you're basically being left with

643
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:05,000
what I would call between you know the

644
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:07,309
first time you do it you'll do it wrong

645
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,250
till you get like 80% heads but if you

646
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:12,529
start learning that it's totally you

647
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,509
know counterintuitive to how much can I

648
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:16,759
get and how fast you

649
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:18,409
so you want to go slow and you don't

650
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:20,479
want to try to get a lot because the

651
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:21,849
whole process is to get you know what

652
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:24,889
we've been talking about that

653
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:26,808
standardization of medicine and for 50

654
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:29,569
years as a hash maker in a cannabis

655
00:27:26,808 --> 00:27:31,428
grower I've really been led you know it

656
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:33,528
offends some people I love the cannabis

657
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:36,139
plant I just don't look at the bud is

658
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:38,298
something that I use other than to make

659
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:40,398
hash that's what I do with it it's a

660
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:43,969
it's a carrier that brings me the

661
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:47,208
ability to produce a raw product that is

662
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:48,919
of extreme medicinal value and I can do

663
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:52,129
that with cannabis on a multitude of

664
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,979
levels I can extract the heavy amino

665
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:57,678
acid rich seed oil if I want to acquire

666
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:59,598
that from the seeds I can acquire the

667
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,028
fiber from the stop if I want to make

668
00:27:59,598 --> 00:28:04,428
clothing or textile products but can

669
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:06,199
even extract the cellulose from inside

670
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:08,269
the stalk and if you notice what all

671
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:10,849
those things have in common is you never

672
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:13,009
use them all you only take the one from

673
00:28:10,848 --> 00:28:15,198
the hole always with cannabis one from

674
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:17,899
the hole one from the hole I use my

675
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:19,849
pizza box analogy when I order a pizza I

676
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:22,698
generally like to open the box and take

677
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:23,538
the pizza out and eat it so I do respect

678
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:25,579
cannabis

679
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:27,318
I love the plant and we couldn't get the

680
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:29,778
resident or the fiber or the cellulose

681
00:28:27,318 --> 00:28:32,778
or the essential amino acids without it

682
00:28:29,778 --> 00:28:36,048
but I really do see it as a plant that

683
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:38,868
is particularly the medicinal components

684
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:41,778
are things that we can extract and the

685
00:28:38,868 --> 00:28:44,118
more we decontaminate them which is what

686
00:28:41,778 --> 00:28:47,028
this does all about the more we seem to

687
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:50,118
learn and it's why guys like us are

688
00:28:47,028 --> 00:28:52,128
really at this point in time on the edge

689
00:28:50,118 --> 00:28:54,069
of this information that we've been

690
00:28:52,128 --> 00:28:56,889
learning about for I mean 20

691
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:58,450
years these guys robbed and stuck math

692
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:01,570
and the variety of these guys that have

693
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:04,269
been doing this for 40 plus years keep

694
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:06,819
in mind like they really didn't know

695
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:08,349
most of what we know today really the

696
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:10,419
new information that we should be

697
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:13,929
sinking your teeth into who's learning

698
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:15,820
about as much about your endocannabinoid

699
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:18,490
system as you can learn because once you

700
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:20,559
learn about that you can then share with

701
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,299
all the people I can't even imagine how

702
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,279
many people all these people in this

703
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,500
room know combined that are dying of

704
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:28,240
cancer right now just one disease and

705
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,279
you know we all know more people that

706
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,019
are suffering from other things so if we

707
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:33,519
can learn about this if we can extract

708
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:35,410
these resins if we can learn about

709
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,170
terpene modulation if we can learn about

710
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:40,090
endocannabinoids saturation through

711
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:44,019
programs like the act now and through

712
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:46,299
these legal models this is we've been

713
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:48,609
stuck in a prohibition model for so long

714
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:51,129
and right now we're in a situation where

715
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:53,169
I see a lot of people I see the app the

716
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,060
activists that I grew up with and came

717
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:57,310
up in this some of them are sort of

718
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:59,200
looking into this new I don't know if

719
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:01,599
I'd call it corporate model but it's

720
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,509
it's a legal model it's a model that is

721
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:07,929
not based on a profit margin that's

722
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:10,480
based on you or me going to jail okay

723
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,400
the profit margin that we have been

724
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,980
making off of cannabis for the last

725
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,470
however many decades has been based on

726
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,190
prohibition it's been based on people

727
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,460
going to jail

728
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,860
that's a terrible dollar that's not a

729
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,259
good market so I think if we contain

730
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:28,449
these products and bring them into a new

731
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:30,609
model a mall that is not

732
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,340
prohibition law one that doesn't you

733
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:35,379
know I support dispensaries I support

734
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:37,359
every single person being able to grow

735
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:40,210
for themselves on the license being able

736
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:42,659
to even trade or potentially sell it

737
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:45,309
within their community I also support

738
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,320
you know company is doing in our large

739
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:50,589
level with standardizations that are

740
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:52,629
able to produce medicine for more than

741
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:54,519
just at one coffee shop or more than

742
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,260
just five dispensaries you know it's a

743
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,599
big world out there there's 7 billion

744
00:30:56,259 --> 00:31:01,150
people then we all have their dope

745
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:08,019
cannabinoid systems anything you want

746
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:10,330
ahead today that's ok there's a lot

747
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:12,639
there so I look at elegant cannabis

748
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:15,669
spent like bananas and it's like if you

749
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,160
if we took bananas off this planet what

750
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,720
would happen to the human on earth and

751
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,970
we've seen that even growing up as a kid

752
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,339
look I'll get bananas are we take

753
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,289
bananas out of society everybody loses

754
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:28,509
protein phosphorus the whole world

755
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:30,159
changes and we just die from bananas

756
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:32,980
well that's kind of what cannabis is to

757
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,259
me canvas is a food it's of the disorder

758
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:38,200
it's a medicinal food it's something

759
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:40,000
that your body has to have it's

760
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,309
preventative in its management and in

761
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,809
the future that the regenerative so when

762
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:45,309
people are coming up to you and you're

763
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:47,529
an old person that's saying ok your

764
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:50,259
insurance program shows that I can

765
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:52,299
replace your liver we're just gonna

766
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:54,519
print one out for you we're gonna slap

767
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:56,559
it in there you're about 75 so we'll

768
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,480
give you about 80 minutes to recover and

769
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,220
if you don't have a properly functioning

770
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,410
endocannabinoids system where the

771
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,660
servers in that working it may not take

772
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:07,360
there's gonna be all kinds of crazy in

773
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,080
the future things by the time I'm 80

774
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,558
years old

775
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:14,499
37 in January so I try to look at

776
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:16,028
in the future and say how can we lay out

777
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:18,069
about how could we lay out these things

778
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:19,089
and I think this is a good start like I

779
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,249
said I'm gonna bring it back to the

780
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:23,259
resident point of your time perfect and

781
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:25,230
the backs are a good start because it's

782
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:28,240
the first time we went from taking

783
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:30,009
granted but and putting it into a glass

784
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,638
of water with ice and watching the

785
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:36,308
little heads fall saudis Sam and then we

786
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:38,319
went to a couple screens we went to play

787
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:41,829
bowls we've had centuries of beating

788
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:44,439
beating dry-aged but down it res it down

789
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:46,118
and to Keith rockin all these different

790
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,129
patches of things and then you get hit

791
00:32:46,118 --> 00:32:50,019
to isolator bags and bubble bags and

792
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:52,719
then you say okay walking out from two

793
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:54,878
screens three screens for screens five

794
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,440
screens one of those screens really mean

795
00:32:54,878 --> 00:32:58,778
and I think that's really important to

796
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,298
understand that because a lot of haps

797
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:03,278
makers just get material and then they

798
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:04,868
go and then they have these results and

799
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:06,940
they go awesome is really turn me

800
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:09,069
this one's really greasy this one

801
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,340
happened this one feels really strong I

802
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:14,740
tested 70% with this one but if you were

803
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:18,428
growing through your bags or you were

804
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,690
growing your resident for the specific

805
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,460
purpose you pay a little bit more

806
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:25,509
attention before you even start process

807
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:27,220
different attention so you would start

808
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:29,048
from the very beginning you'd use the

809
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,028
little eyepiece and you'd watch the

810
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:33,759
little resin heads and you watch how

811
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:35,558
many gathered together and if there's

812
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,659
not a topside party with little resin

813
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:39,878
heads and they're not huge like you were

814
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:42,159
talking about there's probably a problem

815
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:43,408
and we went to Jamaica we looked at tons

816
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,940
of different

817
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:48,309
times a different but we watched I

818
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:51,369
watched bags with you and literally

819
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:52,928
looked at the 90 bag as if it was just

820
00:33:51,368 --> 00:33:55,058
pulled out of a brand-new step I

821
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:57,100
couldn't believe it actually

822
00:33:55,058 --> 00:33:59,319
I thought I looked at this at the bag

823
00:33:57,099 --> 00:34:01,359
with the scope because I thought who's

824
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:03,398
gonna serve pretty on it we don't print

825
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:05,109
the wrong bags on the wrong screens it's

826
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:06,849
like we've got that down I still just

827
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:10,210
couldn't believe it I thought this has

828
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:12,519
to be like a like a 160 bag or something

829
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,829
it was you knows three days of

830
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:17,710
harvesting ice first of all to get nice

831
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:19,750
in Jamaica so he was surprised that I

832
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,059
actually even was able to produce ice in

833
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,588
the middle of mouth know where I was

834
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:24,878
looking out of ice I've been working on

835
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:26,739
a nice situation

836
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:29,230
John was hoppin everybody was helping

837
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:31,209
than Eric had a five-gallon bucket we

838
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:33,490
had everything right except the resin

839
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,960
except the resin and resin itself wasn't

840
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,979
that good when you looked at it

841
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,659
you know you looked at it under the

842
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,608
scope first thing we said was bug did

843
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:42,730
you guys have a drama and was this a

844
00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:44,559
sativa that got dry so we look at a

845
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,539
sativa that's supposed to be a long

846
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,789
cycle it's supposed to be outside for a

847
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:50,858
long time and you watch how the trichome

848
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:54,039
have develops and you want to go clear

849
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:56,139
and you're looking at day 70 80 90 those

850
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:57,730
are really important if you drop halfway

851
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:59,230
through it and your heads never develop

852
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,650
well now also you got these little tiny

853
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:04,960
skinny skinny stalks struck it down

854
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,940
heads but never even developed into a

855
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,690
head it's your little stalks well we did

856
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,950
see that absolutely it was surprising

857
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:15,429
just to give you a little background

858
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:17,649
upon the history as we mentioned Saudi

859
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:19,759
Sun it was the first thing that I've

860
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,680
ever seen mentioned about water

861
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,100
traction was in 1988 and High Times

862
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:28,039
Magazine saw sound took up the ad and it

863
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:30,349
was stuck Sully Sam's water extraction

864
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:31,969
in secret and it was basically the jar

865
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:34,869
method so that was the first time we'd

866
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:37,039
really heard about water extraction in

867
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:40,099
1997 a gentleman by the name of

868
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,360
Reinhardt Dell came to Amsterdam and he

869
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:43,789
brought a machine with him called the

870
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:48,440
ice-cold extractor the ice ball

871
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:49,880
extractor was sold to milla milla the

872
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,579
pollinator lady had the ice-cold

873
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:56,000
extractor and sitting on her couch one

874
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:58,699
day Eldon r.i.p Eldon we miss you he's

875
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,760
been passed away a few years now old

876
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:03,469
school - car shishun and my manufacturer

877
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,110
mark Rose were sitting on the couch

878
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:08,719
looking at this machine and decided to

879
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:10,730
held in the shouted out two nylon bags

880
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:13,699
and screen bottoms and a five-gallon

881
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:16,909
bucket you got the same idea so this is

882
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:19,309
the birth of the isolator bags about a

883
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:21,920
year later I came out with the bubble

884
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:23,889
bags and that was 1999

885
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,079
so from 97 we had

886
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:28,179
well from 88 we had Saudis sound we had

887
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,650
a long lapse people didn't get it they

888
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:32,618
just didn't pick up what he was doing

889
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,450
Reinhardt's machine people kind of

890
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:35,980
lifted their eyebrows a little bit but

891
00:36:34,449 --> 00:36:37,419
the bags were brilliant

892
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,909
you know melody coming up with the bag

893
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,829
idea and Denmark Rose making them right

894
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:43,659
there and Mila being the pollinator lady

895
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:45,278
and bringing them to the world and

896
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:48,399
selling them it was really that team of

897
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:50,230
people that made the wallet that's how

898
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,930
when I saw that's how I came along to

899
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,998
make bottle bags and you know we came up

900
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:57,278
with the first three system three screen

901
00:36:54,998 --> 00:36:59,288
system we came up with the first four

902
00:36:57,278 --> 00:37:02,139
screen system the first five the first

903
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:03,789
six the first seven the first 8 and I

904
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:06,788
gotta give it up to my boy Jason from

905
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:08,980
payload bags cuz he has the only 9 bag

906
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:11,349
system he got the first one and the only

907
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,759
one so he's a part of it too this is the

908
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:14,798
history you can read about it on the

909
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:17,440
internet there's all sorts of different

910
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:20,170
water house companies now I only bring

911
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,389
up the history because recently after 8

912
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:24,548
years of being litigated by Reinhardt

913
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:27,578
who does indeed have a patent for water

914
00:37:24,548 --> 00:37:29,469
extraction I finally just you know

915
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:32,048
started talking doing like a human being

916
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:35,259
and we ended up making a deal and I've

917
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:36,219
now just paid for all 15 years that I've

918
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:38,528
slowed bubble bags

919
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:40,509
they've been leased under patents and

920
00:37:38,528 --> 00:37:43,000
our company is now selling

921
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:45,040
it's good to sort of give those you know

922
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,380
who have a position that it's good that

923
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:50,739
they earn what they should earn himself

924
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:53,349
bubble banks is now a patented least

925
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:54,579
product and it's just you know there's

926
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:58,000
there's a little bit of water hash

927
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:59,289
history for you so let's uh let's talk

928
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,250
about what we talked about because I

929
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:01,889
don't think everyone in the room

930
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:06,610
understands the different back

931
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:08,889
terminology and so let's say that let's

932
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:13,180
say somebody grew their their cannabis

933
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:17,650
plants correctly and they had a OG Kush

934
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:20,919
or the OG Kush Davi what bags would you

935
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:23,289
would you say you would see more

936
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,210
collection of the heads and why in those

937
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:27,159
variations I think it's important well

938
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:30,670
in a surprise with the oh jeez you're

939
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:32,980
gonna see resin that melts in the 160

940
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:35,260
bank if you've grown it properly you'll

941
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,389
have these big fat 160 heads that you

942
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,430
can catch and that's that's the red bag

943
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:41,500
that's three bags down that's really the

944
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:43,389
reason I have the 190 bag a lot of

945
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,969
people ask me why do I need 160 if I

946
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:48,460
have a 190 or vice-versa and I usually

947
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:49,989
say well because if you breed really

948
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,990
properly and you're growing these indica

949
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:54,039
dominant strains endure under HBS lights

950
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:56,079
that you're going to produce these

951
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:58,420
really really fat hats and then it's

952
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,829
it's nice to have 160 full amount

953
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,260
I wouldn't say by any means it's my

954
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:04,900
favorite but I certainly would never

955
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:07,480
throw away my 160 bag because the 120

956
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,460
bag for sure on the OG is gonna be

957
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,650
straight fire and it's gonna be all the

958
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:15,900
way down through 90 and 73 45 in the 20

959
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,490
we'll melt as well but on the oh jeez it

960
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,059
just won't be the same quality as

961
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:22,949
between like 120 and 73 and and that's

962
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:25,319
really based on the size of the head so

963
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:28,259
when I first released all these bags if

964
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:31,108
you can imagine many people thought that

965
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:33,180
I was just trying to sell banks that I

966
00:39:31,108 --> 00:39:34,710
was adding bags because it was adding

967
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:36,690
money and the more money that people

968
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,548
spent the more sales I made and it

969
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,909
really couldn't be further from the

970
00:39:38,548 --> 00:39:41,880
truth

971
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:43,528
we tested tomorrow's and I'm my

972
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,410
manufacturer he helped me out an

973
00:39:43,528 --> 00:39:49,349
enormous amount we tested so many of

974
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:52,230
these bags he lives in Kathmandu Nepal

975
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:54,210
so he has no shortage of landrace trains

976
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:56,818
to pull off the back mountain and run

977
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:58,318
through the bags I'm in BC if you've

978
00:39:56,818 --> 00:40:00,150
ever seen my youtube channel you

979
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:02,219
definitely know I have no shortage of

980
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:04,019
strains to run through the bags so

981
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:07,139
between you know that was really the

982
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:09,389
work that Mark and I did was finding the

983
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:11,190
right size bags it's not like we just

984
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:13,348
picked random numbers although I will

985
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:16,740
say that the yellow 73 bag could have

986
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:19,380
easily been a 70 but I was born in 1973

987
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:20,669
so I thought that I would throw my year

988
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,740
in there forever

989
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:25,108
a lot of people don't know that and that

990
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:27,779
was before the 90 bags so imagine if you

991
00:40:25,108 --> 00:40:30,210
understand water hatch the 1973 are

992
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,059
almost always the best regardless of

993
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:35,460
strain unless you're growing a tropical

994
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:37,980
exotic grown land race the teams on a

995
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:42,838
school in Australia somewhere under the

996
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:46,170
super hot Sun then we do the heads like

997
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:47,849
I'm telling you the 25 145 and where I

998
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,889
based that on is I used to have a good

999
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:54,000
friend named the mom didn't be mad mad

1000
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:56,068
he was from overgrow days and he was

1001
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,449
living in malm mama been be in Australia

1002
00:40:56,068 --> 00:40:59,489
and his father was part of the group

1003
00:40:57,449 --> 00:41:02,730
that bred I don't know if you could call

1004
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:05,368
it bred it's a it's a it's a mix mash of

1005
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:07,500
strains exotic sativas landrace Latinas

1006
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:10,140
the diesel guys saw in the 70s and the

1007
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,389
80s in Australia and they bred them all

1008
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:16,588
together and I'm telling you I seen

1009
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:20,098
pictures of 15 plus pound plants 18 feet

1010
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:23,099
sorry 15 feet tall and 18 to 20 feet

1011
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:27,150
wide and the crazy bastard used to send

1012
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:28,710
me his bud and his hash so it was in

1013
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,690
fact that breeder Steve's wedding

1014
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:33,119
one of the last joints i ever small it's

1015
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:34,889
going to be 14 years of them now I

1016
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,510
smoked a joint at the moment gonna be

1017
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:38,129
madness was steep right before I got

1018
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:41,490
married on the beach of the sava beach

1019
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:43,530
but the the water hash that he sent was

1020
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:45,029
completely unique and exotic and just

1021
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,220
looking at it right away he knew it was

1022
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:49,619
special it had tinges of red it had the

1023
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:53,699
spiciest most exotic flavors and it was

1024
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:56,490
25 micro now keep in mind 25 micron i

1025
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:59,669
came out without bag well-known hash

1026
00:41:56,489 --> 00:42:02,039
smokers laughed at me they said that is

1027
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,680
a ridiculous bag that is immature and

1028
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,869
broken heads and you are absolutely it

1029
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:07,659
is proof but you do not know what you're

1030
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:10,420
doing about

1031
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:13,210
I got a lot of flack for it and it was

1032
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:15,338
years before those same companies copied

1033
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:17,829
me and put a 25 micron bag in their in

1034
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:20,099
their kids so don't this on the 25

1035
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:23,079
particularly if you live in a tropical

1036
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:24,730
region and even if you don't

1037
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:27,039
I've heard people pulling out fire from

1038
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:30,190
their indoor crops I didn't when I was a

1039
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:33,579
25 at the 45 and if you don't know Jim's

1040
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:36,970
Hill especially like with the banner we

1041
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:39,579
talked about the 120 at 1973 and the

1042
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:42,578
banners just 45 belts just as good and

1043
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:44,798
it has my opinion it has a little bit

1044
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:48,460
more flavor has more flavor from the

1045
00:42:44,798 --> 00:42:50,349
plant and then our test is count up if

1046
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:52,480
you ever had a music studio that was my

1047
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:55,539
past career but we used to have this

1048
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,219
little Yamahas that would sit up so we

1049
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:59,020
had these badass huge speakers we had

1050
00:42:57,219 --> 00:43:00,489
all this really good gear and then we'd

1051
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:03,130
go to master you've got these little

1052
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:04,598
cheap doll house on and so you listen to

1053
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,568
the music and if you could hear every

1054
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:10,269
little thing and those flat sheet

1055
00:43:06,568 --> 00:43:11,119
speakers then you need the actual match

1056
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:14,809
really

1057
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:18,410
was correct so when you pull the 25 back

1058
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:19,910
if the 25 bag is flowing on that you

1059
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:22,190
know you got some I mean pretty much

1060
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:23,629
that's a guarantee if your 25 micron bag

1061
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:25,639
is lousy you're gonna have nice hash

1062
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:30,289
throughout the throughout the banks for

1063
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:32,118
sure so I don't know I think we're going

1064
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:33,380
to talk about the future on the future

1065
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:33,950
well the future is what's in your hand

1066
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,640
right there

1067
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:39,288
the futures the future is it's

1068
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:41,509
interesting because I think every year

1069
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:44,630
that I think it's important that you

1070
00:43:41,509 --> 00:43:48,880
guys also look at the Cannabis Cup is

1071
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:51,680
not a competition of who's got the best

1072
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,269
situation right now I think it's good

1073
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,460
and healthy to have the competitions

1074
00:43:53,268 --> 00:43:56,988
about that of all the people that I know

1075
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,420
all the friends that I know the industry

1076
00:43:56,989 --> 00:44:01,728
every single person in this competition

1077
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,200
and high times on the flowers that

1078
00:44:01,728 --> 00:44:04,968
concentrates in the full-mouth

1079
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,710
everybody's bringing fire these days

1080
00:44:04,969 --> 00:44:09,259
yeah everybody who has step their game

1081
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,449
up to an ultimate level and now it's

1082
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:13,759
like okay if I was a judge I'd have to

1083
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:16,489
be going off my preferences and I start

1084
00:44:13,759 --> 00:44:19,909
nitpicking well the tip of my throat

1085
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:22,460
just a little bit to make it it's like

1086
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:24,409
clearly witzy nitpicking down so steps a

1087
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,329
little bit and I think people put so

1088
00:44:24,409 --> 00:44:28,190
much emphasis on like who's gonna be the

1089
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:29,010
first second or third place it really

1090
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,670
when it comes down

1091
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:34,650
this so this is like a snow so it didn't

1092
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,539
happen in Amsterdam there wasn't an expo

1093
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,280
but there's still community they're

1094
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:40,769
still they're still gathering they're

1095
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,119
still this this is this is the reason

1096
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:44,130
why we come together to be able to

1097
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:46,019
network with everybody to be able to see

1098
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:48,210
those faces that we see on Instagram or

1099
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,920
Facebook and say oh I wanted to try the

1100
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:53,070
turtle and I want to try this dry step

1101
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,019
and so it's about inspiring each other

1102
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:57,480
and inspiration and that's what's gonna

1103
00:44:55,019 --> 00:45:00,179
lead to the future so if somebody puts

1104
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,880
something out and they say okay we've

1105
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:04,529
got turkeys now well it's important to

1106
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,570
understand with any information that's

1107
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:08,940
out there you have to be responsible

1108
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:12,119
with that information so now it's the

1109
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,920
next chapter well just like we had we

1110
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:16,470
had a library helping each other we had

1111
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,990
shot who's making it what machine this

1112
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:20,819
process again you know is it closed loop

1113
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:22,349
where did the trim come from everybody's

1114
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,510
got those questions now you should have

1115
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:26,579
a safe for the next with the turkeys

1116
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:29,640
where the turkey is coming from are they

1117
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:29,960
coming from canvas Mattoon are they

1118
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:32,000
coming

1119
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,269
other fruits and vegetables are they

1120
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,260
coming so technically so you have to be

1121
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:39,769
educating yourselves again I think

1122
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:41,510
that's what this is about the future is

1123
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:44,119
inspiring each other coming together

1124
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:45,770
time to time and time again not just in

1125
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:48,769
Amsterdam but across the world and

1126
00:45:45,769 --> 00:45:51,739
really see what climate genetics culture

1127
00:45:48,769 --> 00:45:54,139
that people can actually do in the forms

1128
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:57,858
of information that inspire the in those

1129
00:45:54,139 --> 00:45:59,719
pockets push it up to the new envelope

1130
00:45:57,858 --> 00:46:03,199
and I'll tell you you know it was wet

1131
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:05,750
wash for me why I mean I started also 16

1132
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:08,809
17 years ago with oils my first

1133
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:10,760
concentrates got into water - went hard

1134
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:13,699
on that coating - dry sift and now

1135
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,920
literally Tony taking terpenes and

1136
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:19,159
adding them back into both the dry sift

1137
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,619
and the wet wash the modulating effects

1138
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:24,559
the zestiness that comes with the hit

1139
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:26,030
it's really definitely it's going to be

1140
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,519
in the quicker there's no doubt about it

1141
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:30,200
there may be people that dislike it and

1142
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,880
fight it but there's I'll tell you when

1143
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:32,358
we walk around right after we're done

1144
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,920
here

1145
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:35,239
don't leave because we're gonna walk

1146
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,619
around with these terpenes and we're

1147
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:39,529
going to make sure that you smell what a

1148
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:42,140
pure extract the turkeys and hitches we

1149
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:43,940
sums of use - it's such a great great

1150
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:46,338
flavors I wish we could give them all

1151
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:48,630
dabs of it but yeah usually when you see

1152
00:46:46,338 --> 00:46:50,489
us we're smoking so this is kind of new

1153
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,660

1154
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:53,339

coughing until I almost threw up for 15
