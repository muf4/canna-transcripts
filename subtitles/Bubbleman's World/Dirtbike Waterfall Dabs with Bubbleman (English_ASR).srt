been mine so this is a little waterfall

120
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,879
that I like to visit it's just in behind

121
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:21,278
my house took us about 15 minutes to get

122
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,360
up here but I did go to see if I could

123
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,919
get up to the to the higher Lookout

124
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,440
Point for you guys which is really

125
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:29,919
spectacular unfortunately you saw that

126
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,079

127
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:35,120
other River there's like four of them um

128
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:36,078
it had taken out the trail so I don't

129
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,560
know what we're going to do about that

130
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,000
that's pretty major I'm going to have to

131
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,359
figure it out but uh I thought maybe

132
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,879
we'd go up there for a little dab

133
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,879
session so let's head up there

134
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,399

137
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:19,000
way to put the

138
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:19,000
tripod to capture such

139
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,240

141
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,639

do in regards to setting this up so you

143
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,560

proper without me breaking my

145
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,639

146
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,000

00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:38,000
perfect amount of water in the baby

171
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,000
cake take out a tiny

172
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,120
bit that's pretty perfect got my little

173
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:48,159
10 mil

177
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:58,198
Educated who doesn't want to stay Highly

178
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,039
Educated right it's kind of what we're

179
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:01,039
all about

180
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,160
and then we're going to hit some Van

181
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:07,958
City

182
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,719
extracts I

183
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:13,879
believe

184
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,759
mu yes

185
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:21,078
mu oo cushy is

186
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:21,079
[ __ ] almost like a real strong

187
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,759
OG rightow it's nice powder they've left

188
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,480
it in the in the powder right up until

189
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,039
the the time that they puff it which uh

190
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,039
I of course have a huge respect

191
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:44,120
for no reason

192
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:47,719
to take your nice dry SI out of powder

193
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,759
form unless you're really about to Puff

194
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:55,320
it all right well that's a huge

195
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,320
dab to break that in half and do it in a

196
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,519
couple waterfall dabin I hope you guys

197
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,000
are joining me by by the

198
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,440
way just booted up here on the dirt bike

199
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,440
I haven't been on the dirt bike for a

200
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,680
while felt a little bit loose uh coming

201
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,040
up but I'll get used to it I'll start

202
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:16,000
going out more now that I've uh taken

203
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,439
the the plunge and jumped into the first

204
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,720
ride of the

205
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,360
Season keep in mind I can ride this

206
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,160
thing pretty much all season long it

207
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:29,480
doesn't really

208
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,480
uh it doesn't really get all snowed out

209
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,480
so yeah pretty much everywhere in BC has

210
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,519
these epic anywhere you go into the bush

211
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,680
I mean it just doesn't even matter where

212
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,679
you end up eventually in some sort of

213
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:47,039
Epic little nature scene like this with

214
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,318
a a waterfall beautiful clean water

215
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,278
that's going all the way down to the

216
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:53,240
ocean and the trail that I'm on goes

217
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,360
it's about a 9h hour hike and it it'll

218
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,879
take you right over into the lions and

219
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,240
then over top of the Lions into Cypress

220
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,838
Bowl which is one of the local mountains

221
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,399
that you can ride here uh on the other

222
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,360
side in uh West

223
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,318
Vancouver so I think we got a nice

224
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,240
little glow Happening

225
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:14,958
Here we cool down fast in the waterfall

226
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,959
but waterfall puffing on Bubble man's

227
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,958
world

228
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,039
woo that was real

229
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,318
fine I'm guessing they call it mu for a

230
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,000
good

231
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:50,000
reason the [ __ ] is a

232
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,759
killer didn't even take half of that dab

233
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,759
that was real nice

234
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,240
then it's always the challenge is to

235
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:08,838
find a nice little

236
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,078
shelf to sit the pipe it's a pretty good

237
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:11,078
one

238
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,160
actually there we

239
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:18,519
go

240
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,839
so I was really wishing that I could

241
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:21,879
have taken you to the other Trail

242
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,958
because the lookout is phenomenal the

243
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,120
mountain climb is about another 15 to 20

244
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,400
minutes going a solid 50 to 60 km an

245
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,319
hour and uh

246
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,200
it's pretty cool but this is pretty cool

247
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,279
you guys did get to come on the ride up

248
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,960
here with me we're going to go for a

249
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,240
ride in a little bit once I've chilled

250
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,279
out and relaxed we'll get back up on the

251
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,720
bike this Trail has not for for a long

252
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,720
time it has not been dirt bike friendly

253
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,720
much past here but we'll see how far we

254
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:55,038
can take it and uh until then enjoy some

255
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,038
of this waterfall

256
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:51,678
so I think there used to be some little

257
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,319
type of cabin that someone had built way

258
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,759
up there and one time in a big storm it

259
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,359
blew down and that's what all these

260
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,919
little pieces of wood are

261
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:04,519
from we got here a little butterfly guy

262
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,520
little nature action

263
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,489
[Music]

264
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,919
well that was pretty cool little

265
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,839
butterfly I can tell you from a macro

266
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,960
photographer standpoint they don't

267
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,480
usually hang out for that long I've had

268
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,919
a very hard time in my life getting

269
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,400
macro photographs of butterflies and

270
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,320
hopefully you guys got a nice spot there

271
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,320
he seems to like that rock cuz he's back

272
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,319
again

273
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,200
well he definitely likes that rock

274
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,759
there's no doubt about it I'm going to

275
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,360
leave him be and let him hang out on his

276
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:51,919
little spot for all I know he's filming

277
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:55,439
butterfly man's world and I keep [ __ ]

278
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,840
interrupting him so back to Bubble man's

279
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,240
world this is uh the rest of the trail

280
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:03,759
right here so if you guys want to jump

281
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,038
back on the bike and head down

282
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:09,038
there I think that's the plan let's do

283
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:09,038
it

284
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,240
I don't think so

285
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
for for

286
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:27,919
well I uh finally got the bike loaded

287
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,038
had a little bit of trouble with it

288
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,200
getting up there at this angle but uh

289
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:34,079
she's all loaded up and that's it for

290
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,159
today for dirt bike riding with bubble

291
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,398
man next time I go out I'll try to do

292
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,440
something a little bit more exciting

293
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:41,599
trail-wise maybe a summit to a lake or

294
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,120
the peak of a mountain and I'll try to

295
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,439
bring some familiar faces with me as

296
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:50,759
well so thanks for watching Bubble man's

297
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,759
world and we'll see you next time

298
00:27:52,490 --> 00:28:00,710
