uh photographing the plants and I'm

157
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,399
going to be stuck under the sun

158
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:44,399
definitely going to be taking breaks in

159
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,799
the shade oh we got the 50 sun block me

160
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,559
and Ashley yeah up to 50 yeah but you

161
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,079
know what all that does is potentially

162
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,039
protect your skin from burning that's it

163
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,519
won't protect you from sunstroke it

164
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,919
won't protect you from no it really

165
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,200
won't I know got water to me to me

166
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,679
that's the staying out of the Sun is key

167
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,959
if you stay if you get in there too much

168
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,838

cannabis for up to 2 ounces you do not

394

get um any jail or any court it's a

395

00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:53,558
farming is not the work for the lazy

470
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,839
this is extremely difficult and hard

471

work and if you could feel the sun

472

can improve the quality of life and the

510
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:20,798
rasta Community the Jamaican Community

511
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,399
has known this for decades exactly and

512
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,599
uh the they've been singing about it in

513
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:27,719
their music I mean most of the the

514
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:30,759
people here that farm ganja they have a

515
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,000
in depth knowledge about yeah yeah and

516
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:35,759
it's not like the knowledge comes from

517
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,679
experience and from inhaling the resins

518
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,919
it's not learned in a book and you don't

519
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,440
go to school for it yeah this is real

520
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,600
experience exactly nice the catas are

521
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,200
joining us yeah I was going to ask when

522
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:48,038
harvesting do you cut or you just pull

523
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,720
the whole thing right out normally we

524
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:51,798
just pull it right out pull it right out

525
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,480
right out that's what I was wondering I

526
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:55,119
don't see anything I was looking cuz we

527
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,759
have other ones over here and you got

528
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:57,839
the starter fields and I'm like they

529
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,599
just rip these things right out the

530
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:02,918
ground listen that's normally when you

531
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:06,119
pull it out it's it's normally stay

532
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:08,480
alive for us I don't really know it's a

533
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,359
different but for us to to the

534
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,919
impression of seeing it right when you

535
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:14,719
put it out alive it's like it stay alive

536
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,759
compared to if you cut compar with you

537
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,839
cut the life so cut the life it's like

538
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:20,398
you cut him like that so when you put

539
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:22,720
you put him with the main rout and the

540
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,678
lat road so it come when you hang it now

541
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,079
it automatically just dry slowly fall

542
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,880
slowly but when it when when it is cut

543
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,519
groups before you get there yeah and it

544
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,320
start getting interesting this is this

545
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,240
is farmer knowledge he's laying on you

546
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:37,678

547
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,440
it's very hot so hot it's hot and so

548
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,480
easy it's just like wow that's why the

549
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,840
plants pull out so nicely so nicely I

550
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,720

00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,160
I'm going to put all the buckets all the

662
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,559
bags sorry inside of one another I've

663
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:05,279
got them hanging right here with the

664
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,078
beautiful ganja field in the

665
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,079
background love

666
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:12,560
Jamaica all right so we know the order

667
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,119
of the bags we go purple number 25

668
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:19,759
micron this is the smallest of the

669
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:19,760
screens tightest of the

670
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,920
scre so this is a seeve stack for those

671
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,559
of you that want to understand what's

672
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,599
going on here these screens are all

673
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:33,078
different

674
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:36,400
sizes and the the purple bag is the

675
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:38,839
smallest screen it's 25 microns okay

676
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,400
it's very very small much smaller than

677
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:42,759
even those little heads that I was

678
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,358
showing you on the plant those are

679
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,640
between 160 and like 45 microns the

680
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:51,880
majority of them so microns is just a

681
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:55,078
measurement uh a method of measurement

682
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:58,280
so we start with 25 we go next with the

683
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:59,560
white bag is the 45

684
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,160
after the

685
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:06,519
45 and gone it's the gold we love the

686
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:10,358
gold it's one of my favorite bags right

687
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:11,519
here and you guys will see why when uh

688
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:13,920
when we

689
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:17,000
release the the bags from the water

690
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:21,639
after mixing and we show you what we've

691
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,639
caught so to give you an idea of the

692
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,399
process give you an idea of the process

693
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,439
what we're doing is we're

694
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,880
we're freezing those little triome

695
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,240
glands those little microscopic glands

696
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,240
we're freezing

697
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:39,799
them because they're brittle they're

698
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:39,799
encased in

699
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,480
wax right basically we freeze the little

700
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,318
Micron uh the wax membranes of the

701
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,480
tricomes by freezing them they become

702
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:54,239
brittle and once we put the water in the

703
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,318
ice in and we start mixing it all up

704
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,078
what's going to happen is those little

705
00:36:55,318 --> 00:36:59,920
resin glands are going to break free

706
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:02,119
from the triome body and they will sink

707
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,079
in the water due to their gravity uh due

708
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,920
to their density they're they're still

709
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,240
affected by gravity every most things

710
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,280
float in the water all this plant matter

711
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:13,159
will float in the water the resin heads

712
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,519
will drop off break and sink and they'll

713
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:18,559
fall through these series of screens and

714
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:22,800
simply put we will pull the screens

715
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:24,719
up and collect the resin so one of the

716
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,240
things we're going to need I'll get one

717
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:32,078
of our audience members to possibly grab

718
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:33,919
is a nice straight kind of clean stick

719
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,359
that I can mix

720
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,358
with it's coming it's

721
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:45,240
coming got machete there CAU way that's

722
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:45,239
how you do it man yeah all right

723
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:56,838
so happening okay 60 bag I'm hold

724
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,639
this nice I like it I like it we going

725
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:00,159
to have to do the thing

726
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,440
first

727
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,118
um and then we'll put them we we'll let

728
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,240
this sit for a little bit and get

729
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:10,000
cold cuz I think that uh right now it's

730
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:13,959
probably pretty warm

731
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,960
resin I'm going to have to show you guys

732
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,759
this there you go that's so nice isn't

733
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:22,000
it that beautiful can't you see that I

734
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,880
mean I know I can cuz it's

735
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,880
like just want to give you a little

736
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,880
closeup

737
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,358
all right here we go CH it's always a

738
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,720
good idea too to look at your bags when

739
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,719
you're about to use them and make sure

740
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:39,399
they're clean if you have a bunch of

741
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:40,799
dirt on the outside of the screen it's

742
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,000
going to go to the top of the next

743
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,240
screen and and all the way down so

744
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,679
always make sure the outsides of the

745
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:49,118
bags are clean you can also see there's

746
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:51,799
a band of fabric that goes around the

747
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,119
bottom when they're inside out that band

748
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,839
of fabric isn't there so this is how we

749
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,720
know what the right side is for the bags

750
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:02,039
also the label on the inside so when you

751
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:05,838
fold them over you can read it

752
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:07,440
properly and these bags are from Nepal

753
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,599
Catman do

754
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,760
Nepal home of some of the original

755
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,440
dreads in fact the holy man of India

756
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,119
sados really cool guys go figure they

757
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,119
smoke a lot of

758
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,078
hash okay so we'll just get these fit

759
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,160
tight usually they fit a little tighter

760
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,519
in the bucket but I don't think we're

761
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:34,799
going to have too much of a problem

762
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:37,239
these bags are stiff enough I think so

763
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,760
there we've got our seeve I'm going to

764
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:41,159
pull the blue one

765
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,160
out just a little bit and I'm going to

766
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:45,279
wrap the rest of the bags good job

767
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,679
around the

768
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,319
top and what this is going to do for us

769
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:52,480
is it's going to ensure that when we're

770
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:54,358
mixing and when we mix this whole thing

771
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,719
is going to spin I can tell you right

772
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:59,639
now hold it the resin or the leaf matter

773
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:03,439
I should say won't go in between the

774
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:06,799
bags and contaminate our hash

775
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,800
so that's

776
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:13,400
proper we got some

777
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:17,639
water we'll top this

778
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:20,000
up and then I want to get a bunch of

779
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:22,078
ice which is directly behind you in a

780
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,960
big bag I'm just U being so quiet here

781
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,880
because I'm I'm I'm hypnotized by the

782
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,519
smell of this resin smells great

783
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:34,200
amazing all right so

784
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:38,280
ice we go

785
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:38,279
hey's the stick coming

786
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,480
in ice picks work

787
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:54,799
well when you know how to use them they

788
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,800
do otherwise they go right through your

789
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,800
hand

790
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:03,039
hence I'm not doing this because there's

791
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,039
no first a station

792
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,679
CL and once again here we are our second

793
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:15,399
run of fresh actually this is fresh

794
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:18,159
frozen first one was uh some bubble has

795
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,318
and if well you can't see but there's

796
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:21,719
like you know 15 people behind us all

797
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,000
got the cell phones out they're filming

798
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:26,159
and we're educating them at the same

799
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,838
time we're educating you again it's

800
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:31,199
awesome isn't it h love

801
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,199
start cutting in here I'm going to cut

802
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:39,240
here can I start cutting you got the H

803
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:39,239
bu

804
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,679
um nice for some big chunks to fall in

805
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:53,920
there don't need to break them all down

806
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:53,919
to nothing

807
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:14,399
perfect I'm smacking it with some R

808
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,160
whack that was nice I like that it's

809
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,559
like a whole good

810
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:21,598
stick all sticked up all right so this

811
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:23,800
is cold now John this is real cold we

812
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,000
got a nice temperature here so you can

813
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,960
start pushing uh cutting those nuggets

814
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,599
down on there

815
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,599
I will join

816
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:37,359
you man we do this everywhere hey it's

817
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,400
pretty much we just fly all around the

818
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:43,519
world and hang out with cool ganja

819
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:47,838
oriented people and

820
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:49,920
uh make the good hash make the good

821
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:53,000
hash yeah I'm being a little rough with

822
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:57,519
it just getting it in there it's

823
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,519
okay want to get her done

824
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,559
it's the whole purpose you can feel the

825
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,920
cool air coming off of this bucket

826
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:05,240
incredibly it's already creating a

827
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,720
thermal clim it feels like air

828
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:09,118
conditioning we're in air conditioning

829
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:13,039
right now it's

830
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,400
nice this is some nice fresh herbs man

831
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:17,880
I'm just don't want to get all the stock

832
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,880
off of here they're just such nice

833
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:23,318
buns now we do see a few seeds in here

834
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:25,279
not much not many at all but um is

835
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:27,920
always a good sign you know a plant can

836
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,280
still produce melty bubble with seed but

837
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,480
generally we know this about the

838
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,240
cannabis plant um once it starts

839
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,760
producing seeds that it puts an enormous

840
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:37,838
amount of its energy into the production

841
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,520
of those seeds and I think that uh it's

842
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:43,119
pretty much factual that the THC

843
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:43,119
production goes

844
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,119
down so what he said so what he said

845
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:55,598
that's what he said oh what he said oh

846
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,079
yes

847
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,280
so yeah I'm um I'm not cutting anymore

848
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:01,680
all right we'll dump that bucket in

849
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,040
there so as you can see it's a hinin

850
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,679
bucket we were going to fill not full of

851
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,199
beer full of resin that was a whole idea

852
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:10,118
there's only actually a few more buds on

853
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:13,399
here but uh it's got to go in maybe

854
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:15,880
we'll bring a few buds home dry for for

855
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,838
Mr rare dankness Scott actually asked me

856
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:22,280
to pull aside four to six of the nicest

857
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:24,039
buds we found and uh well obviously the

858
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,800
nicest buds we found are in this bucket

859
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:28,838
right now but the next nicest buds we've

860
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,039
put aside for you Scott so I hope that I

861
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:32,679
hope that's okay and for me by the way

862
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,880
I'll be smoking those nice all right

863
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:36,960
let's get some ice on top of that yeah

864
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,880
please so what I'm doing here is I'm

865
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,679
just kind of stripping it off of the the

866
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,680
stock here I'm pulling some stock on so

867
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:46,399
Bud like that and get this in here you

868
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,440
expose more resin we don't really want

869
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,200
to cut it up it doesn't hurt to pull a

870
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,920
littleit all the stock out of there you

871
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:56,960
know don't need it in there anyways it

872
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,960
doesn't have any resin on it

873
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,200
oh I want it to sit right on

874
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:05,000
top and that way we'll get it into the

875
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,000
water uh this is something that's

876
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,318
important too when you're using the

877
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,559
fresh material it'll float up it won't

878
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:13,000
want to go down so you can put a layer

879
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,240
of ice and a layer of herb and then put

880
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,119
more ice on top and then another layer

881
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:19,719
of herb and you just layer it and uh

882
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:22,480
what it's going to do is right now those

883
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:26,439
crystals those tiny little resin glands

884
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:30,240
are freezing solid right now and so this

885
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,240
is uh this is the magic of the

886
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,759
process the magic comes from out there

887
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,679
we finish it off in

888
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,200
here that's real magic Magic's right

889
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:44,358
there growing out in that beautiful sun

890
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:46,000
good stuff I mean I don't think I've

891
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:48,960
ever made bub I don't think anybody's

892
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,719
made bubble house with a field of uh

893
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,720
fresh weed in the background I have

894
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:02,159
nice I've done it in Switzerland next to

895
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:04,358
five football fields of outdoor cannabis

896
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,318
in the north of Switzerland in volosen

897
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:09,318
near Zurich um literally whatever the

898
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:10,679
size of a football field is picture six

899
00:46:09,318 --> 00:46:12,440
of them right next to each other and it

900
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:16,239
was just cannabis as far as the eye

901
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:18,400
could see I've also done it in gra Hill

902
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:20,719
West Morland uh Orange

903
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,760
Hill where was the other place I did

904
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,679
that was a ganja

905
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,280
field I'll remember there's three places

906
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,719
in Jamaica this is my fourth one I've

907
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,079
done it in a field and it's always in

908
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,078
this Hut with uh well you guys have seen

909
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,599
the photos on uh on my Instagram and

910
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:36,039
Facebook all right Johnny that's

911
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:37,680
probably pretty good I'm just freezing

912
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:39,639
the resin off my hands cuz it's just so

913
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,199
sticky right now it's

914
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:43,960
like awesome yeah I've got that going on

915
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:46,719
too I know so I fig the ice might do a

916
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,358
good job but no apparently not app I'm

917
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:50,558
high no come on of course you're high

918
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:53,440
actually why don't we have a

919
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,040
bowl yeah there's a a bowl sitting over

920
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,240
there I'm going to grab the pipe and

921
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:58,039
have some hash or what I'm going to go

922
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:59,919
grab it um we're going to let this sit

923
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:02,519
for a few minutes generally one of the

924
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,838
things about water has although you guys

925
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,759
probably won't have this problem but in

926
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:09,159
the rest of the world the Turing content

927
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,000
is sometimes well almost always never as

928
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,960
strong as the tropical grown Sun that

929
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,239
you can get in environments like

930
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,960
Jamaica so this

931
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:22,199
resin generally in water can leech out

932
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,760
some of those smells and tastes so we

933
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:25,719
don't want to leave it in water for a

934
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,400
long time so that's something always to

935
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:29,000
keep in mind that

936
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,280
it's unnecessary to leave the resin in

937
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,318
the water too long right now we're

938
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,440
cooling it so that's important we're

939
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:35,639
kind of trading in one for the other but

940
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,240
you wouldn't want to forget about this

941
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:38,598
for a long period of time and go do a

942
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:40,039
bunch of stuff and then come back and

943
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:42,599
mix it and then leave it for a much

944
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:44,719
longer period and come back the water is

945
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,838
going to start acting like a solvent CU

946
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,399
of course water is a solvent it breaks

947
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:50,358
things down however this is a

948
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,160
solventless process which my good friend

949
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:55,239
Nic I don't know if you guys know about

950
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:57,440
selecta Nic he's a Colorado DJ pretty

951
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:58,838
good guy does the uh he call calls his

952
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,639
he does water hatch like this but he

953
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:03,159
calls it solventless and he gets into it

954
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:05,400
with people cuz they say actually water

955
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:06,519
is a solvent and then he has has to

956
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,800
explain to them that this is a

957
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:12,639
mechanical separation we're not actually

958
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,000
using water as a solvent however because

959
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,519
the water is going to be a different

960
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,079
color every single time you run um water

961
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:22,318
hash there is a process being done that

962
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,559
is like a solvent the water is leeching

963
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,880
things out so with that said what do you

964
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:28,359
think Johnny should I start mixing up

965
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,760
the medicine start mixing up some

966
00:48:28,358 --> 00:48:32,519
medicine I get the to on and uh someone

967
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:37,599
want to maybe just check the

968
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:39,639
clock and mark down the time and we'll

969
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:44,720
uh

970
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:47,429
start 128 130 128 CL 130 okay perfect so

971
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:49,439
we're going to do this for about 10

972
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:51,558
[Music]

973
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,460
minutes and that's doing that I'm going

974
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:57,530
get a half ready and

975
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,530
[Music]

976
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:06,519
oop

977
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:11,318
see put a little bit more water in it's

978
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:16,119
a bit thick bring up that level a

979
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:19,679
bit Yeah thin it out a bit Ah you feel

980
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:21,920
that now yeah now it's moving better it

981
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:25,279
was too

982
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:27,200
thick more ice though when it's too

983
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,640
thick like it was you need to put a

984
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:31,639
little bit more water in that'll melt

985
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:32,960
the ice so then it gets too thin then

986
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:35,838
you got to put a little bit more ice in

987
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,519
you'll find it's a fine line on sort of

988
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:40,078
learning these subtle nuances of of

989
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:41,159
these variables that will change the

990
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,640
game for you depending on the

991
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:46,798
temperature your environment the

992
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:46,798
humidity the

993
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:54,078
herb all right well we're going to mix

994
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,480
this up for another 15 minutes I'm going

995
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,480
to turn the camera off so some of my

996
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,719
friends can help me but we'll catch up

997
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,920
with you in a few minutes once we've got

998
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:04,199
this batch mixed

999
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,920
up all right so bong break we got to hit

1000
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:07,919
some hash we've been working hard here

1001
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,159
we've got the materials all sitting it's

1002
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,200
ready to pull we' got our small clean

1003
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:13,960
bag this is something that you might not

1004
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:15,919
be aware of but when you're making uh

1005
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,920
bubble hash out in the middle of the

1006
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,159
hills you're going to be required to

1007
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,559
clean your bags so what we've got is a

1008
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:26,838
bucket and the bucket has

1009
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:28,160
um ice in it and clean water so once we

1010
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:30,440
pull the bags immediately we're going to

1011
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:31,598
rinse them really well washing them

1012
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,960
almost with our hand and we're going to

1013
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,039
keep the ice mixture in here high so it

1014
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,000
doesn't melt away that's going to ensure

1015
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:39,960
the resin stays cold and breaks off the

1016
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,798
screen easily and goes into the bag we

1017
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,159
don't want that resin dehydrating and

1018
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:47,440
melting to the screen thank you Johnny

1019
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:49,199
oh no problem oh I I did it you got the

1020
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,119
the lighter wet I got the Flint wet I'll

1021
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,679
let you light the next lighter got one

1022
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:58,640
too right here every

1023
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:58,639
agent thank you oh yeah

1024
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:04,159
so this is a little bit of a bubble hash

1025
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:07,039
we made the first day we were

1026
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:09,039
here third day here now and uh we're on

1027
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:13,920
our second

1028
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:16,679
run all right so let's do this let's so

1029
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:20,880
we start with the 220 bag this is how we

1030
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:23,318
separate the Chafe from the

1031
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,039
resin and I'm just going to reinsure by

1032
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:27,599
holding here that nothing gets pulled

1033
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:30,079
apart

1034
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,000
wow there's that color that we talk

1035
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:35,079
about it's

1036
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,639
creamy yeah it's creamy golden it's a

1037
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:40,640
beautiful gold and you can tell we

1038
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:42,838
definitely ran about a half PB yeah

1039
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,400
that's awesome um that's what fits in

1040
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:47,119
these bags generally when you've got a

1041
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,838
big most of this is ice nice I got res

1042
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:53,240
dripping perfect oh excellent you want

1043
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:55,519
some more oh please that Cool

1044
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:59,838
Breeze it is the

1045
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:02,318
73 so how often do you get washed with

1046
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:03,318
resin and I take a bath in this stuff

1047
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:05,880
that's

1048
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:09,519
beautiful M and I can definitely smell

1049
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:12,000
it okay so can you hand that off to one

1050
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,920
of our friends and we'll get that either

1051
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,079
poured into a plastic bag or wherever

1052
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,760
you want to it has to get cleaned out of

1053
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,039
the bag right away that's the that's the

1054
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,599
key so we need what it could be thrown

1055
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:24,358
away literally we could throw that right

1056
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,200
into the bush or if you want to save it

1057
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:28,679
and try to make coconut oil use the

1058
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:32,598
resin you can save it as well but if you

1059
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:34,480
don't want to I understand all right so

1060
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:36,599
that's the bag that bag will need to be

1061
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,000
flipped inside out and then rinsed maybe

1062
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:41,400
with a bottle of water to get all the

1063
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,760
herb off and then it can just be

1064
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,920
hung all right so

1065
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:50,599
160 this water's clean John very little

1066
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,599
contaminant got through that's

1067
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,880
beautiful all right so first bag

1068
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:02,319
red color on that that's pretty cool

1069
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,318
it's 190 I

1070
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:07,838
know all

1071
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,160
right

1072
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:12,920
so generally this bag is what we call

1073
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:16,118
the contaminant catch it's not what

1074
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:19,318
we're looking for but at the same

1075
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:22,400
time have to spoon it's important to use

1076
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:24,679
the bag in order to get this out of the

1077
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,760
hash that we're going to collect

1078
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:30,558
later John I think you need to wash this

1079
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,400
in the pool water here we go so cleaning

1080
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,920
the first bag right now oh no don't wash

1081
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,039
that in here it's dirty it'll stick to

1082
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,039
all the we have to rinse that with a

1083
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:41,599
small bottle of water someone can rinse

1084
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:45,960
this with a small bottle of water just

1085
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:49,640
regular water all right this is cleaning

1086
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,639
great want to hang that one

1087
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:52,880
Johnny just go right there and we go

1088
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:58,639
right

1089
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,640
across all right so 160 next next

1090
00:53:58,838 --> 00:54:04,199
up not expecting much in this bag either

1091
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:06,318
this is a very large size Micron I

1092
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:08,239
suspect due to the sungrown nature of

1093
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:10,759
this resin we're going to find smaller

1094
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:13,039
heads and uh that doesn't surprise me

1095
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,839
too much once again this is really more

1096
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:19,039
of a contaminant bag than anything so

1097
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:19,039
when you see hash that looks pretty

1098
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,000
decent you're happy about it I already

1099
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,640
going to be very happy to see I already

1100
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
know what we got on the first day and

1101
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:30,519
this is definitely

1102
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,440
substantially nicer

1103
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:36,798
herb substantially nicer herb however of

1104
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,838
course the herb always looks the best

1105
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:41,880
when it's

1106
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:45,039
fresh growing in the sunlight oh my God

1107
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:47,599
those plants were so

1108
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:49,960
nice so listen if you're thinking of

1109
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,798
going on a vacation anytime soon I

1110
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,559
suggest you get yourself a set of Bubble

1111
00:54:51,798 --> 00:54:55,599
Bags a

1112
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:58,400
medtainer and get yourself a ticket to

1113
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,680
Jamaica this place is growing the fire

1114
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,240
and all you people that come here and

1115
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:05,598
say you can't find good resin that's on

1116
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:05,598
you don't blame

1117
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:12,909
Jamaica so is that cold enough you like

1118
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:16,340
more ice

1119
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:16,339
[Music]

1120
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:26,119
that still lots of ice which we always

1121
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:27,960
say keep it cold the colder it breaks it

1122
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:30,160
off so that's how we're cleaning the bag

1123
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:32,159
leing that at the at the last little

1124
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:34,318
place we visited there uh the other day

1125
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,399
that's uh rubbing the ice on the bottom

1126
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:39,358
of the bag actually well oh

1127
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,599
yeah like

1128
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:44,119
that know it's

1129
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,559
G perfect perfect that made my hand so

1130
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:48,358
cool look at the color of that water

1131
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:51,720
John look at

1132
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:57,159
this it's got a tiny little green in it

1133
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:59,399
too from the Fresh that we ran you know

1134
00:55:57,159 --> 00:56:01,960
so you got some gold we got another

1135
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,960
little pile of

1136
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:09,119
120 after this bag is the bag we expect

1137
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:12,559
to start seeing some resin in now keep

1138
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:15,240
in mind we ran fresh herb the other day

1139
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:18,519
we ran dry herb and we ran a lot of it

1140
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:20,118
so that dry herb I suspect was more than

1141
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:24,119
what we ran this time but we'll see when

1142
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:24,119
we get the next few bags

1143
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:44,160
no did more

1144
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:44,159
weed

1145
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:50,240
more

1146
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,240
okay it's

1147
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:58,199
a maybe we'll see when we pull it all

1148
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:01,720
out did you see the herb

1149
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:04,919
herb was K yeah but you know what it

1150
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:06,318
like we have a lot five plants lives

1151
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,639
like that is

1152
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:12,279
probably even by what I would say about

1153
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:15,719
was in the bag is probably about i'

1154
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,880
say really you

1155
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:20,759
say all

1156
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:23,119
right try andang that

1157
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,880
one getting into 90 the 90 didn't really

1158
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,160
pull much the other day though the 73

1159
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:30,720
was amazing this one's pull look at that

1160
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:33,519
there's this this 90 has nothing in it

1161
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:35,000
no joke pulled right out makes me want

1162
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:37,639
to pull the microscope out and make sure

1163
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,280
the bag itself is accurately 90 however

1164
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:41,960
the 73 is going to be epic it should be

1165
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:44,000
cuz it's we did the same thing the other

1166
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:50,400
day this is way less 90 than the other

1167
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,400
day well half weight PL that's in

1168
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:56,280
there

1169
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,920
see one two three four

1170
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,920
wash that in

1171
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,480
there in there can you wash that one my

1172
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:05,879
hand is cold it is cold in here guys and

1173
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,798
I'm going to step over here instead of

1174
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:11,240
not being in front of the camera and uh

1175
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:11,239
yes that always is good for

1176
00:58:13,798 --> 00:58:19,400
sure all right so this one's feeling

1177
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:22,318
heavy we already know it is so this is

1178
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:27,200
what we're looking for now the other

1179
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:29,519
ones I pulled them out immediately right

1180
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:32,879
so remember yesterday and the last time

1181
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:35,599
how much resin we got on the 73 well we

1182
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:39,280
already know it's here I'm always happy

1183
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:41,079
with 73 hey I'm wearing 73 you know

1184
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,480
that's going to be the best bet

1185
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:47,200
right definitely going to be one of the

1186
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:50,159
best must have a puck of bubble has in

1187
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:53,598
there too because this is slow draining

1188
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,598
I can see it

1189
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:03,960
smell it

1190
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:08,240
too we want try to stretch that over

1191
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,240
this maybe try and collect a little bit

1192
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:19,838
better pull out a little leaf

1193
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,839
I just a little

1194
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:29,280
one all right so in here

1195
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,280
as the wind kicks

1196
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,960
in so we're going to show you this

1197
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:46,159
bag see how much resin there look at the

1198
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:48,079
quality of this resin and now the 45 and

1199
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:51,118
the 25 what we're seeing with the these

1200
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:52,720
tropical sativas is just so much more

1201
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:56,119
that's what we're popping on is the 45

1202
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:58,199
and it's killer so and and and like

1203
00:59:56,119 --> 01:00:00,280
killer and the 25 because we haven't

1204
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:02,919
microplan it yet even looks better than

1205
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:05,039
the 45 and we' been talking about can't

1206
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,240
wait to smoke on that 25 and when we're

1207
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:10,240
back at home with the indas the 25 isn't

1208
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:11,959
anything that's that great but um that's

1209
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:15,239
what we're looking for right there

1210
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,240
that's beautiful

1211
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,599
we can get another drawing screen and

1212
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:38,598
close that one up if you

1213
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:52,879
like I'm put top

1214
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:03,250
[Music]

1215
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,249
[Music]

1216
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:29,280
all right a little bit of resin on that

1217
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:29,279
73 but not too

1218
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:37,358
much yeah

1219
01:01:35,239 --> 01:01:39,439
but put the last one on the hook and

1220
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:40,838
I'll tie each bag if they're touching

1221
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,480
they're not drying if they're not

1222
01:01:40,838 --> 01:01:44,519
touching they're drying so this right

1223
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,039
here don't do this so why you call

1224
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:49,239
Yellow 7 Tre what do I call them why you

1225
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:53,000
call it the 7 Tre why did I call it the

1226
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:57,159
73 yeah born in

1227
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:00,239
1973 it's my year okay

1228
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:02,118
I not and it just happened to be the

1229
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,118
best I don't know how it happened but

1230
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:06,400
truly for the longest time the 73 was

1231
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:09,358
the one we all wanted I personally at

1232
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:12,160
home love the 73 and the 90 the black

1233
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:12,159
bag is one of my

1234
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:21,519
favorites all right so the 45's coming

1235
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:23,639
down it actually pained out pretty fast

1236
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:27,038
John well I know there's a lot of hash

1237
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:27,038
in there but

1238
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:38,598
so as you can hear everybody in the

1239
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,599
background is really enjoying

1240
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:47,960
this here's our next poll

1241
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:47,960
guys it's

1242
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:52,479
breing once again

1243
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:15,960
all right this little pile of

1244
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,159
45 now we could have stayed here all day

1245
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,838
and ran literally I didn't realize how

1246
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:21,719
little or how much the plants would be

1247
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,038
weighing but I bet you this was less

1248
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:27,199
than a half pound that we ran just from

1249
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:27,200
the resin

1250
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:56,519
[Music]

1251
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,440
really important that you clean your

1252
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:00,960
bags good when you're in the hot humid

1253
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:02,639
tropical environment the resin can stay

1254
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,278
on the screen and each time it'll build

1255
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:06,239
up that resin will start acting as a

1256
01:04:04,278 --> 01:04:08,400
solvent potentially break down your uh

1257
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:09,919
screen and make it a little more brittle

1258
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,760
what I've seen in Jamaica when people

1259
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,318
have given bags to haven't taken care of

1260
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,240
them uh they let them get wet they dry

1261
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:18,038
them in piles like this so the water

1262
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:20,118
never really dries out the wind needs to

1263
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:21,839
go all around and dry it out if they're

1264
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:23,278
stuck together like this you'll get a

1265
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,440
little bit of moisture stay in there

1266
01:04:23,278 --> 01:04:27,119
what happens over time is it degrades

1267
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,079
the qu quality of the material and the

1268
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:31,358
bags become uh you know less effective

1269
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:34,160
in their use you know you had them it's

1270
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:38,558
hard to keep keep care of them here keep

1271
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:38,558
clean yeah hold them

1272
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:48,038
black got to what we got to hurry up

1273
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:48,038
okay any we're hurrying

1274
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:54,159
up well we only have one bag left so

1275
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,240
it's easy to hurry up now I was like

1276
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:57,519
this is the one I watch your

1277
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:58,919
this one's big so you know there's some

1278
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:02,289
resin in this

1279
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:05,400
one a lot more

1280
01:05:02,289 --> 01:05:08,440
[Music]

1281
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:13,318
than ganja

1282
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:15,278
class ganja class yeah well the reason

1283
01:05:13,318 --> 01:05:18,199
why this bag is having such a hard time

1284
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:20,480
is whoa how's that for a little

1285
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:24,118
explosion sometimes you got a massage at

1286
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,119
the bottom of the screen

1287
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,159
there we go that should be enough to

1288
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:38,838
start now that was actually a really

1289
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:40,798
good example if this just has resin in

1290
01:05:38,838 --> 01:05:43,318
it but if you let your screens get dirty

1291
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:45,440
this is what they'll do they won't un

1292
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:47,920
they won't release the

1293
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,440
waterly so this is releasing now which

1294
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:53,519
just means it was a lot of

1295
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:57,639
water and hopefully a lot of

1296
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:57,639
resin right if

1297
01:05:58,309 --> 01:06:01,420
[Music]

1298
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:13,520
any it'll go right

1299
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:15,000
into the other ones are in nice and cool

1300
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:17,038
yeah

1301
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,639
awesome so yeah we've taken I don't know

1302
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,039
if John mentioned it but we took the one

1303
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:22,400
pressing screen full of most of the

1304
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:25,799
bubble we pulled already and we put it

1305
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:29,798
inside the cooler box our cooler that we

1306
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:33,920
have uh the ice packs in so that'll

1307
01:06:29,798 --> 01:06:37,838
ensure that this doesn't get too warm

1308
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:39,838
also this stuff would stink so bad

1309
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:42,000
they'd smell it like 20 ft before you

1310
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:45,759
got to the

1311
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:49,519
roadblock so good to put it in there and

1312
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:52,160
make it cold so they can't smell

1313
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:56,239
it freeze cuz let's be honest we don't

1314
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:56,239
need to be buying them breakfast

1315
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:19,480
nice little pile 25 nice and

1316
01:07:14,838 --> 01:07:19,480
dark you open it right now

1317
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:31,719
e

1318
01:07:48,679 --> 01:07:55,639
CLE right you can put that in the

1319
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,639
uh in the styrofoam

1320
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,880
anything really nice actually yeah

1321
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:15,000
perfect last but not

1322
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:17,480
least all right so that was great little

1323
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,039
fresh frozen field run the first of many

1324
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:20,519
this is just our first little example we

1325
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:21,798
just did a five gallon batch we weren't

1326
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:23,199
sure if we were pulling a pound we

1327
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:25,278
weren't sure if we were pulling a half

1328
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,719
pound I suspect it was just a half pound

1329
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,960
or a little less but we'll really be

1330
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,960
able to figure it out by the amounts of

1331
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:34,158
resin and uh oh we can show you that

1332
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:37,359
right now what we got there you

1333
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:41,198
go so of course what we just pulled on

1334
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:43,480
top give it a little little show here's

1335
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:46,678
the 45 and

1336
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:48,959
25 nice little pile it's about 3 G of

1337
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:51,079
resin there lift that let me do this for

1338
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,039
you

1339
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:55,759
perfect there you go all right and then

1340
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:57,838
our other two piles

1341
01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:00,759
which uh you can see the 73 is that

1342
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:03,119
monster pile right there and uh that's

1343
01:09:00,759 --> 01:09:05,439
really what this is all about this 45

1344
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:09,158
and this 73 is really what we came here

1345
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:11,039
to get today so I think maybe put this

1346
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:13,119
underneath of that there do whatever you

1347
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:16,600
like brother there we go so anything you

1348
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:19,198
like set this up for you all right

1349
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:21,400
so I guess now all there is really to do

1350
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:23,838
is to dump the water that we've that

1351
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:26,838
we've already used clean up the pales in

1352
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:29,519
the environment and we'll take this

1353
01:09:26,838 --> 01:09:31,479
basically now the unfortunate part of

1354
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,199
this process is it's really hard to do

1355
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:35,079
anything with this now in the

1356
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:37,399
environment that we're in we need to get

1357
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:38,600
it into a colder air conditioned room

1358
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:40,679
and what we'll be doing is we'll be

1359
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:42,159
microplaning it with this tool right

1360
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:43,560
here there you go and so this is a

1361
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:46,439
microplane right here it's just like a

1362
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:48,719
little grater type tool most of you in

1363
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:50,439
the audience probably know and we just

1364
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:53,039
grate that down the same way you would

1365
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:54,960
grate Ginger or cheese you're going to

1366
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:57,279
grate that hash and that hash is going

1367
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,158
to fall all in a powder and rain down on

1368
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:01,960
top of your cardboard we use parchment

1369
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:03,198
paper upon the cardboard so it doesn't

1370
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,439
stick to the cardboard and you don't

1371
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:06,198
lose any resin and it's just a matter of

1372
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:09,439
kind

1373
01:10:06,198 --> 01:10:11,519
of you see it fall like a dust and you

1374
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:12,919
just allow it to collect and spread out

1375
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,480
everywhere like you're painting on the

1376
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:17,679
parchment paper so you cover everything

1377
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:19,718
uh that from that point here in Jamaica

1378
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:23,119
it doesn't take very long before the

1379
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:25,039
heat of the day um just evaporates any

1380
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:27,119
moisture that's left in that resin and

1381
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:29,000
it really uh dries the hash pretty fast

1382
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:30,439
so I won't be surprised if we're smoking

1383
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,079
quite a bit of it later tonight but

1384
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:34,839
definitely by tomorrow and the next

1385
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:37,359
night when Tony uh and Scott arrive uh

1386
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:39,199
they'll be puffing some nicely dried um

1387
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:41,759
full Mount bubble hash that's fresh

1388
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:43,719

1392
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:59,319
on our way out we saw another field on

1393
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,760
the right side of the original field we

1394
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:05,000
were in so we thought we'd just sort of

1395
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:07,960
do our final goodbye here at this

1396
