2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,439
welcome to Bubble man's world uh I'm

3
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:25,799
here with Brett from West Coast

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,920
concentrate and we are going to be doing

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,118
a review

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,559
today of The Vape exhale they got a

7
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,079
great little uh little pamphlet nice

8
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:36,399
little brochure tells you how to use

9
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,280
unit yeah I was pretty impressed with it

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,520
I'll photograph it and inlay it into the

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,558
video so you can see the Simplicity of

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,559
you know step one turning on the unit I

13
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,519
guess we can do that yep little red

14
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:50,280
light goes on on the on the top you can

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,960
wait for uh if you turn it up to a

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,960
certain temperature you can wait for it

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,600
to turn green and then that indicates

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,160
that temperature apparently it's pretty

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,160
sensitive yeah I've never used the unit

20
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,479
before so it is quite funny that today

21
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,039
both Brett and I who have never used

22
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,640
this unit are going to review it so I

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,600
guess the title should really be the

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,280
review from the total Noob perspective

25
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,280
exactly this isn't the accurate review

26
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,960
of someone that's used the unit for for

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,960
a couple of months learned all about the

28
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,759
little intricacies and sort of subtle

29
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,519
nuances and mastered The Sweet Spot of

30
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,920
tweaking it to the point where yes this

31
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,319
is how the unit Works we're total noobs

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,240
today we're total noobs and and and we

33
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,158
thought we would also nail it with a

34
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,519
tarpine gauntlet so we weren't sure if

35
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,320
we should do

36
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,118
just pure Tarpin which could still

37
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,679
happen or if we're going to do dabbing

38
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,239
bubble hash with Tarpin uh we're going

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,399
to see what happens as we come along

40
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,239
here so the pamphlets great it's

41
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,359
definitely nice and clear and precise

42
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,239
explains the whole unit the unit comes

43
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,718
with a really like Dude tell me that's

44
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,078
not a fat that's a fatty little piece of

45
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:52,798
glass like it feels like it's like 7 ml

46
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:55,519
thick it's definitely it's definitely

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,159
probably 8 mmce nice pipe that just fits

48
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,840
right on the top um the unit itself

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,439
takes uh these little nails

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,560
and I believe we should have one laying

51
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:06,879
around right here absolutely they they

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,000
give you this cool little wooden piece

53
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,159
that fits five of these and I guess you

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,520
got one that can be in the unit as well

55
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,120
they sell them in five packs like that

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,480
which they sent us a nice little five

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,959
pack yeah super nice yeah not too shabby

58
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,079
and so this little guy here uh you fill

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,400
up with your concentrate or your your TP

60
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,599
dab or whatever it is you're going to be

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,480
hitting you drop it into there you put

62
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,518
the pipe on top and uh because we're

63
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,079
thinking of doing pure turp rips here

64
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,360
for the beginning I think that's what we

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,959
should do now that I'm getting it

66
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,959
feeling it you know um that we should

67
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,719
definitely keep this from getting hot

68
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,598
before we put the turps in cuz just from

69
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,479
dropping that in for a few seconds it's

70
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,719
warm look like quarts are out as well

71
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,238
yep exactly so it dissipates its heat

72
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,400
very well meaning that if you left it in

73
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,158
there for a pretty long time you're

74
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,519
still going to be able to pull it out by

75
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:59,959
the top it also has a little ring on the

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,719
top that you could possibly I guess grab

77
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,680
let's see yeah that's totally totally

78
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,719
doable and this piece just doesn't get

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,640
warm at all uh it's still on the red so

80
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,239
we're still uh heting up still heating

81
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,559
up I've heard that it takes a while the

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,959
initial time to heat up it's it's a

83
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,920
fairly accurate unit in its temperatures

84
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,920
from what I've heard so um I guess what

85
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:21,399
are we starting with I think we're going

86
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,719
to do this let's do it I think we're

87
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,158
going to do pure turps bro let's do it

88
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:28,680
let's do pure turp so let's just start

89
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,359
off with uh with this guy right here

90
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,438
triple OG

91
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,280
okay maybe I'll leave that one for

92
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:38,239
dabbing and we'll go in fresh uhoh for

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,680
the TP dip uh oh the big jar you afraid

94
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,560
yeah little bit should be you should be

95
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,480
yeah just a little bit and we're green

96
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,519
too green so I guess what he said was as

97
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,679
we drop it in we'll turn it down yeah so

98
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,120
that will lower the temperature of the

99
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,840
heat that the unit's putting out and

100
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,719
allow us to get you know all the

101
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,158
flavor did that go in or did that go out

102
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,560
it's hard to tell I think it went it

103
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,719
went in wow that's incredible so let's

104
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,598
start with

105
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:08,959
that nice uh here hold that yes sir I

106
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:12,518
don't want the TPS a never leave your

107
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:17,040
turp jar undone and then again when you

108
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,720
have a nice uh vial a a sorry Dabber

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,000
that you have TPS in it's best to try

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,400
and keep it from from dripping down so

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,399
let's see what we've got we've got our

112
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,599
green so why don't

113
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,519
you let's see what we can do here we're

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,840
going to give you the first one okay

115
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,918
this cord is going to be absolutely

116
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,399
ridiculous for me yeah do we want to

117
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,519
turn down at all or just yeah we're

118
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,560
going to turn it down as we drop that in

119
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,680
so you can just turn it right down now

120
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,079
to 1/3 Y and give yourself the freshest

121
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,240
fullest straightest TP rip I can see the

122
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,839
tiniest little bit I have heard that the

123
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,280
units are whistlers when you don't put

124
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,799
the water in definitely a Whistler how's

125
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:59,359
that for Taste it's crazy tasting

126
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,478
crazy well I it's not too much of a

127
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,600
punchy in the face damn

128
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,680
yeah nice that's phenomenal is it done I

129
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,879
don't think so really yeah should I just

130
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,519
share yours I would try it you may want

131
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:15,918
one of your own as

132
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:17,318
well yeah it's dissipated dissipated

133
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:22,399
which is

134
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,400
okay let's pull cool down like

135
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,280
incredible Jesus enjoy

136
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,918
that all right I said Jesus because

137
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,918
uh well that was extreme extreme

138
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:36,198
dropping right there so uh we're at

139
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,478
temperature here I'm going to go up a

140
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,038
little higher cuz what Tony was

141
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:42,000
suggesting was we go up to about the

142
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:43,519
halfway point on the temperature gauge

143
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,600
there's no markings the temperature

144
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,560
starts at what I would say is about 7:00

145
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,720
and it goes down to the other side to

146
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,000
about 5:00 so half would probably be you

147
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,840
know between 1 and uh 12 and two

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,160
somewhere so I've got it up to half it's

149
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:00,519
going red right now and I guess what

150
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,520
Tony said said is get it up to that

151
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,680
little bit hotter and then just drop it

152
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,159
uh as you drop the the nail in so the

153
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,639
temperatures uh which makes sense the

154
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,599
heat the heat in the unit is getting

155
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,000
lower as you're nailing I would have

156
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:14,680
thought to start at a much lower

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,759
temperature and then lift it up a little

158
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,319
bit but hey Tony's been the one tweaking

159
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,639
this and playing with it so I trust his

160
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,120
judgment turn that down I'm excited to

161
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,240
see what he

162
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,478
thinks so yeah as you see a little

163
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,560
slight Vapor

164
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,560
build that's a good one

165
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,759
oh that's the air flow down

166
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:42,839
there orangey or

167
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:45,359
what incredible I know it's total triple

168
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,000
OG in the back end on my tongue and

169
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,840
whatnot but at the beginning it was when

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,800
you said orangey it was like rhind yeah

171
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:55,439
and then it just shifted even as I'm

172
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,439
talking now my entire

173
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,919
mouth is just completely satiated yeah

174
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,000
tast it on the lips as well very

175
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,719
different from dabbing it off of a nail

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,959
by itself I found that that was very

177
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,639
like almost abrasive yes it it is the

178
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,560
direct heat like you were saying earlier

179
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,800
definitely is a little bit more harsher

180
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,959
on the lungs let's say you get more at

181
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,000
out of once um but it's almost too much

182
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,239
to

183
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,639
enjoy that's just a nice little tur

184
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,240
machine right there it is definitely a

185
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,079
beautiful little tur machine all right

186
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,240
so we'll go for a new nail as we are

187
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,918
doing a new flavor we're going to hit

188
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,000
the purple Hindu I got a total buzz off

189
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:34,240
that man I have not smoked any hash all

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,038
day and like I was telling you they

191
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,000
defin no doubt that they definitely

192
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:41,680
bring you up Elevate you and I think the

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,240
different varieties um really really do

194
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,038
different things coughed into the thing

195
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:51,478
there I'll I'll edit that as well a all

196
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:55,120
right Lucho editing to be

197
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:57,120
done we'll try to make it as smooth as

198
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,280
possible for you I know how that

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,680
goes you're probably pretty good at it

200
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,598
though

201
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,800
just want to get you a nice like not

202
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:07,800
huge dab but like a partial appreciate

203
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:20,680
it all right there you go sir turp a lot

204
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,839
ready to drop in and go sir turps a lot

205
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,400
purple Hindu I can't believe the feeling

206
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:29,000
I have from that single I got you thank

207
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,799
you a different flavor than I'm used to

208
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,038
yeah well this this is really a unique

209
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,599
unit in the sense that it's going to be

210
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:40,718
a lot less abrasive than those nail hits

211
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,640
for doing um straight pure turp rips Y

212
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,360
and you can see it's pretty uh is there

213
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:49,439
turp still in there I so so pretty

214
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,560
efficient in terms of uh

215
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,200
clean the flavor that you get

216
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:56,159
overwhelming your mouth and your palette

217
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,879
is crazy nice well I'm definitely going

218
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,639
to go for one of those once this cools

219
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:04,200
down I'm excited all

220
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,879
right so little purple punch I like the

221
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,399
way we did the cord that's that's a

222
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,958
that's a that's a winning situation

223
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,320
right there it is actually I'm going to

224
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,119
turn it back up a little bit get that

225
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,399
temperature up to par cuz remember we're

226
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,320
turning it

227
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,159
down getting it up and then we're

228
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,120
turning it down so I guess next time

229
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,600
when we do it

230
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,679
um when I'm cooling this mhm just turn

231
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,519
it back up to its halfway point yeah

232
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,919
learning prepared yeah we're learning

233
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,839
we're getting it done you know what so

234
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,319
far is so good we're on our you've had

235
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,920
your second dab I'm going on my second

236
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,720
now I feel completely Spacey yeah like

237
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:46,240
it's definitely a heady Spacey almost

238
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,720
likeo that's trippy I know and then when

239
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,639
you we've only had one and then when you

240
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,360
dab hash after you made it through 12 of

241
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:56,759
these the modulation is like oh my God

242
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,759
it's real all right green we

243
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,320
go fits nice too

244
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:09,199
I you can put water in the unit of

245
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:12,120
course that looks like it

246
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,959
yeah that looks like it tasted

247
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,799
amazing I can't even describe it yeah I

248
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,799
know it's completely surreal

249
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,200
yeah you can tell the canabo are really

250
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,240
just these like nice friendly little

251
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,278
things that just in you know they

252
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,519
they're companions to the tpin they're

253
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,799
just yeah one without the other is not

254
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,839
as special by no means it's different

255
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,639
for sure though man it's definitely

256
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:45,440
trippy different I don't know your

257
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,440
opinion but for myself I almost almost

258
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,000
rather the Turpin alone than the canabo

259
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,440
alone oh yeah for me anyways yeah you

260
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,839
know by no means do I need them

261
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,000
medically I use them more so

262
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,880
recreationally and medically for my

263
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,200
separated joint um but the tping seem to

264
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,600
just help me out they don't leave me in

265
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,680
pain that just smelling them will you

266
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,519
know help me out more than dabbing A

267
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,519
little dab of pord

268
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,360
right jeez it's like the Medicine Cherry

269
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,959
AK-47 time yeah it became really

270
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,278
apparent to me uh as soon as you know we

271
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:25,799
had access to the tpin that the THC and

272
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,360
well the the canono were less of

273
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,078
a less of a big deal than I thought they

274
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,600
were you know know everybody wanting

275
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:35,239
high THC strains I'm impressed for with

276
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,399
how buzzed I am off two little turp rips

277
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,959
that's what I was trying to say yeah

278
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,519
it's unbelievable I know and it's nice

279
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,439
too when you haven't smoked hash in the

280
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,240
morning you're able to really tell yeah

281
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,760
well I I smoked a lot of hash this

282
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,560
morning so it could be that I'm

283
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,000
modulating all that uh I had a Skype

284
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,039
call that went for like an hour and a

285
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,278
half with skunkman Sam so I can't even

286
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:59,439
count how many bowls we get but it was

287
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:01,399
real for certain myself I uh I didn't

288
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,680
smoke any this morning so it's nice to

289
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,399
see the effects for sure I'm just

290
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,120
waiting for this to get green here yep

291
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,958
no problem no problem we got uh Cherry

292
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,959
AK we're on number three and we have

293
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:15,638
three more clean nails so we'll go

294
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:19,838
through the next three um which is the

295
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,879
red kongal The Long Valley Royal Kush

296
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,279
and the

297
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,838
ACDC and then we'll do a quick cleaning

298
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,360
of the nails we'll just torch them to

299
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,639
make sure they're totally clean and

300
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:33,159
yummy so we don't get any aftertastes

301
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,159
from the past previous

302
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,600
rips yeah you're hitting the Cherry

303
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,120
AK-47 yeah like I was saying earlier the

304
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,000
Cherry is definitely like a nighttime uh

305
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,519
tpine for me you want to go for a nap

306
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,078
after this one I definitely don't want

307
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,078
to go for a nap after this one but it's

308
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,239
a turpion that I use to uh to D my

309
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:55,198

phenomenal that's another one that's

312
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,680
just super hard to explain and because

313
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,959
they're a variety it makes sense out

314
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,039
they're hard to explain yeah that one's

315
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,000

just turned it up cuz you had it at 1/3

327
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:52,000
yeah and we start at 1/2 okay and then

328
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:54,240
go down to 13 yeah so and it went right

329
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,480
away

330
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,519
beautiful kind of fun little way to load

331
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,519
it yeah it's not bad at all

332
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:05,439
just the lightest Vapor as

333
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,519
well oh man though

334
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:20,278
yep that just taste completely and

335
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:22,959
exactly like AK-47 like the bud the

336
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,240
sift yeah that's just

337
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,198
insane that might be the one that tasted

338
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,240
the most like the FL I mean they they

339
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,559
all have that very strong Gorilla Glue

340
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,039
is very much Gorilla Glue some of those

341
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:37,599
kushes but this is

342
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,599
just yeah it's bang

343
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,720
on it's definitely one of those units

344
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,639
that leaves you just kind of wanting to

345
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,320
keep hitting it until you're done and

346
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,198
then more even after that it's

347
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,800
definitely a little bit counterintuitive

348
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:52,198
in that sense that even as I'm hitting

349
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:55,078
it like I could see hear someone typing

350
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,039
no no bubble man suck slow like inhale

351
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,359
less and and go slower because you don't

352
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,838
want to cool the chamber down and I'm

353
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,360
not sure what kind of a chamber they've

354
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,880
got in here and how efficient it is it

355
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,800
seems like it stayed exactly at

356
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:09,078
temperature so

357
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:11,000
yep are you ready for the red

358
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:12,958
congales I'm definitely ready for the

359
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,679

360
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,719
too most excited for the red

Congo dude happy that you're you're like

362
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,040
hitting these first I'm excited and then

363
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:26,198
passing it down to me and I get to see

364
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:29,318

367
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:35,919
much thanks to uh Tony for hooking up

368
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,039
the relationship with the vapex Hal

369
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,919

00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,639
hail folks and yeah great unit

372
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,439
especially for tping we haven't dabbed

373
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,480
even hashing it yet but for tpping it

374
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,959
seems to be a little bit more Superior

375
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,879
than say just dabbing it on your hot

376
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:58,638
nail thank you that is a thank you sir

377
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:00,480
full drop of the red congales and what

378
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,079
we're going to try and do this time I'm

379
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,959
going to try and inhale slow so I don't

380
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:06,958
yeah I'm going to try I'll be conscious

381
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,799
of it do it do it like I said we're

382
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,000
total noobs hitting this thing for the

383
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,639
first time so in two months from now we

384
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,679
may very well be hitting it differently

385
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,919
I would have had water in it Tony uh

386
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,039
urged me to leave the water out it would

387
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,919
be much more flavor yet you're milking

388
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:28,399
it up real nice and

389
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:28,399
tasty oh my God that's phenomenal

390
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,920
that looked so good I think that was it

391
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:38,159
dude I think you you took it

392
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:42,439
out wow good job wow we me smell the

393
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:44,639
bone oh my God it's just that spice it's

394
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,319
yeah I'm excited to see how you explain

395
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,879
that that's almost celery esque to me

396
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:51,879
really like it's but not celery but it's

397
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:54,198
definitely got that undertone in it that

398
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:56,399
vegetation yeah that vegetation taste

399
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:58,198
and then that red cono is oh oh I'm

400
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,879
stoked to give it a shot look at that

401
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:03,679
you just clean there's no residuals

402
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:06,318
there's nothing at all I have to get one

403
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:09,399
of these bro I think I have TPS well we

404
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:12,199
got a code we got a code for the people

405
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:16,759
that want to give it a shot um the good

406
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:19,160
Folks at vapix hail created a code I

407
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:22,119
want to say that it stay

408
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,519
melty but I should check just to make

409
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:29,119
sure because uh oh it's Stay turpy Stay

410
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:30,359
turpy makes sense s t a y t e r p y I'm

411
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,439
going to put it across the screen

412
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,678
capital S capital T um you use that and

413
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,440
you're going to get 50 bucks free vape

414
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,320
nails when entering the code that's

415
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,360
obviously when you buy a unit uh such as

416
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,678
this they're going to send you one free

417
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:46,319
box of nails so that's a $50 value

418
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,240
that's pretty good yeah and it gives you

419
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,439
the access to to be able if you are

420
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,679
dabbing T beans or different hashes to

421
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,000
you know use five different varieties

422
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,400
exactly without having to clean up

423
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,200
exactly so here I go for red kongal just

424
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,519
like you hit it slow and easy he slow

425
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,519
and steady I can see it milking up

426
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,960
jeez it's a great

427
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,559
experience gentle I would say gentle is

428
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,279
a is a nice word to describe getting

429
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:20,879
your celery

430
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:24,319
yeah but then as you exhale it it turns

431
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,960
from a vegetation to a spice exactly yep

432
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:29,240
it's definitely peppery it's got that

433
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,000
beta carara offene in there

434
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,279
but some other unique things that I just

435
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,599
don't recogn I just don't see enough of

436
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:39,200
but it's it's probably that mercing

437
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:41,918
pining delimine combination sativa Haze

438
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,400
sort of uh tarpine profile yeah our

439
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,440
pallets would be a lot more used to it

440
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,880
if you know we weren't in a Prohibition

441
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,400
based age where everybody's growing

442
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,679
cushies exactly well I left a little bit

443
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,600
of a oh a little bit of a ring in there

444
00:18:51,679 --> 00:19:00,480
two drops hey little Golden Ring

445
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:03,079
nice all right so that was the

446
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,519
longal oh we have the Long Valley Royal

447
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:07,279
Kush next well I'm not going to cry

448
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,240
about that I'm definitely not crying

449
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,918
about it had the most

450
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,599
intense cush smell that I've smelled in

451
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,600
a long time coming off a turp actually

452
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:18,480
yeah that might be the strongest cush

453
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:21,879
yeah I've ever smelted in the turps and

454
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,880
and he's made some great

455
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,319

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,600
we can get rid of that so it's R

459
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,599
away turn this up a little bit

460
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,400
little really enjoying this turp

461
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,159
Gauntlet it's quite different from The

462
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,559
turp Gauntlet that uh D 420k and I did

463
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:57,039
with the bubble hash that one really

464
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:59,079
felt like a pretty we got to do this we

465
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,720
got to you know we were like but this

466
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:02,359
just feels like man I could do like a

467
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,839
hundred of these exactly it's not so

468
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:06,359
much of a of a stone ey but it CH yeah

469

it doesn't get You Higher and Higher and

470
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,639
Higher it just goes like z z z you're

471
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,440
you're you're changing the direction of

472
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,759
the of the effects and

473
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:20,320
it's it is a damn beautiful thing let me

474
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:20,319
tell you really

475
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,400
enjoyable yeah you definitely feel like

476
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,640
you can do it all day wow and I've been

477
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,960
waiting for this unit basically to do

478
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,600
this sort of experience because I

479
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,120
haven't heard of another unit that

480
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:35,759
exists that I could really pull this off

481
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:38,479
no I have I love the quartz Nails

482
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,679
sliding into the glass and that is just

483
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,880
uh yeah it cools down nice and quick too

484
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,480
so we can put our dab back into it and

485
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,440
you know oh man can have a hit exactly

486
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,400
rather than waiting 10 minutes totally

487
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,400
oh my god do

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,279
it I will I will do it

489
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,839
Long Valley Royal

490
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,399
Kush

491
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:12,199
wow that's definitely the way to hit it

492
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,600
is nice and slow so you don't cool the

493
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,640
element you're getting consistent heat

494
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:18,079
the whole

495
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,240
time which is allowing you to vaporize

496
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,240
those uh Turin

497
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:28,600
efficiently God yeah that's one that

498
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,000
makes you come back for more that's that

499
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:34,119
cushy cushy

500
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,480
gas it's gas on the SO gas yeah on the

501
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:37,479
exhale mad

502
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:47,119
gas it's the Mad

503
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,440
gas yeah definitely no turbs left in

504
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:52,558
there give that a smell no it's uh it's

505
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,440
draining them good with the uh

506
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,918
temperature and I think I feel the

507
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,840
temperature is really a good

508
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,440
temperature I'm not feeling that I'm

509
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:03,558
getting any sort of distasteful burnt

510
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,679
popcorn any of that stuff it's just this

511
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:08,558
beautiful it's almost if anything some

512
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:11,960
of them are just extremely

513
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:15,158
subtle that you could see in a normal

514
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,440
session people would miss it yeah yeah

515
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,840
some people wouldn't have the palette

516
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,519
for it they'd say well it's not strong

517
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,839
enough it doesn't give me enough of an

518
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,000
effect I definitely see that happening

519
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,038
yeah but for a connoisseur who's you

520
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,480
know super into different varieties they

521
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,919
would definitely appreciate this

522
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,519
experience um my God yeah and not not

523
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,240
saying that anybody else wouldn't they

524
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,639
just may not have the you know pette to

525
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,440
understand why why the taste is so

526
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:44,240
subtle and so complex just like food

527
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,240
there you go sir thank

528
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,679
you smell the tiniest little tiny little

529
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:56,360
drop I didn't think it was tpps

530
00:22:52,679 --> 00:23:00,200
but might have to just uh wear those

531
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:02,038
turs that was red congales for

532
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,000
sure it's definitely a little bit

533
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:05,440
nerve-wracking with the value of the TPS

534
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,038
and the drops and this that and the

535
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,679
other thing but we're doing about what I

536
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,200
would call quarter drops these aren't

537
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:13,278
$10 uh US dollar drops if you're

538
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,319
watching and you're freaking out um

539
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,679
they're more like $250 cents and I would

540
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:20,240
definitely say that is so well worth the

541
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,278
ab like I would pay five 10 bucks to hit

542
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,400
a dab of it let alone yeah oh nice and

543
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:30,839
clean yeah that one was phenomenal this

544
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:33,840
is the what again uh that was the um

545
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:36,199
ACDC oh wow yeah those CBD strains they

546
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,399
have the real strong flavors and taste

547
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,759
that's for sure yeah I I think you'll

548
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,759
like that

549
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:45,759
one make sure we're we're clean as a

550
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,960
whistle I know you can smell it too

551
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,558
there's no there's like no residual turb

552
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,840
smell on it just it smells like warm

553
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:56,359
quartz ex yeah I was just going to say

554
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:58,839
that just smells like warc like it's

555
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:59,879
trippy didn't realize they were quartz

556
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,759
at first but then when you see how

557
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,080
they're cut yeah you understand and you

558
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,879
you see that it's like that's hard

559
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:06,879
quartz is hard to to work with for

560
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:16,158
sure all right squeeze that little tiny

561
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,159
mini almost nothing Dropout

562
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,159
beautifully I like putting this unit on

563
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,798
here it's pretty yeah it's mesmerizing

564
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,919
just seeing the little bit of vapor that

565
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:30,119
you are creating knowing how much flavor

566
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,679
that little little bit of vapor is is

567
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,678
pulling him

568
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,558
through it's a pretty phenomenal

569
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,120
experience yeah that was really nice

570
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:50,639
yeah different too it's kind of

571
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:53,719
unexplainable that's the ACDC by the way

572
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,360
true enough it's got this like Flavor of

573
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,960
herb I used to get way way back in the

574
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:02,678
day that just reminds me of like herb I

575
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,759
puffed in high school that wasn't wasn't

576
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:07,720
the kindest wasn't the best flavor but

577
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:10,720
had a particular flavor that I just

578
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:14,278
would get time and time and time

579
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:19,038

00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:25,038
oranges for

601
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,798
sure yeah that's uh that makes

602
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,919
sense yeah and just like again that's a

603
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:33,000
pretty long smelling turb but there's no

604
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,159
really residual smell

605
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,919
Beautiful I'm not waiting very long

606
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,320
either you're noticing edits each time I

607
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:40,600
grab these I wait about a minute but

608
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:42,678
it's just long enough that I wouldn't

609
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:45,158
want you to sit here and watch me you

610
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:47,720
know blowing on it or whatever so yeah a

611
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:48,799
minute between each one all right I

612
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,759
think we're

613
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,720
good the reason for us cooling them down

614
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,398
in between uh tur pits as well is

615
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,919
obviously to avoid it from just

616
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:59,599
evaporating as soon as you put it on a

617
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:03,000
hot surface

618
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,398

622
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:10,679
hit is

623
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,720

624
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:24,600

00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,798
something

629

else

630
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:42,240
lemon well that zest is lemon to me it's

631
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,000

632
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,960

that of that Jack herrer of that like

634
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,640
strong spicy haziness and it's super

635
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,000
subtle but it's right in the undertones

636
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:00,120
of the end of the Rip but I can still

637
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,119
taste the first yeah the first

638
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,640

00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:41,278
some CLL cavella is really nice oo

652
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,278
yeah

653
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,759
Co that was a big

654
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,440
drop it was a good one thank you sir not

655
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,679
going to lie was a good one I mean hey

656
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,480
when you're doing a turp gauntlet with

657
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:04,080
your buddy who's driven in from the city

658
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,240
with 12 flavors of

659
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,199
tpin and you this is the first time

660
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,159
you've ever used The Vaping tail God is

661
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,200
that nice coming out of those two little

662
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,679
slits on top I never even really looked

663
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,679
at it looks

664
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,278
tight anyway $2.50 dabs those those

665
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,798
quarter dabs are are more than enough

666
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:26,960
but I have to say when you do an

667
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,639
accidental half drop or a full drop I

668
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,159
don't think you'll be upset said it's

669
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,600
quite a really nice enjoyable way to

670
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:36,159
enjoy you know not every dab yeah no but

671
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:38,079
one it's once in a blue moon which I

672
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,320
think you've gotten like three now yeah

673
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:43,599
they're pretty yeah they're pretty good

674
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:46,158
I'm definitely not complaining awesome

675
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:48,158
this just nice it's definitely a great

676
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,960
experience y you know an experience that

677
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,159
I've not had before I've never done

678
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,558
anything like this either and I've done

679
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:54,559
all sorts of things with the turs

680
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:04,038
yeah definitely nice hit coming in I'm

681
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:07,039
sure you'll see the reaction as being a

682
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:07,038
super

683
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:13,519
tasty my God yeah what I really loved

684
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,559
about that was it was so smooth the

685
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,880
whole way flavor is really coming out

686
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:19,759
now like really coming out now when you

687
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,760
say complex it's complex in the sense

688
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:24,158
that most palletes don't recognize it at

689
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,558
all I could imagine my palette barely

690
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:30,240
recognized it and now as I'm talking I'm

691
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,759
getting the full Taste of Sour Diesel

692
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,679
coming out in my tongue and around my

693
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:37,319
lips it's down my throat you get such

694
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,120
satiated turp rips there's no way from

695
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:41,480
running from that taste it makes sense

696
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:44,000
that the code for the discount would be

697
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,640
stay melt Stay turpy Stay turpy yeah I

698
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,519
like that you know for the longest while

699
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,840
I was about to melt melt melt and now

700
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,519
it's seems to switched over a little bit

701
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:55,240
and now because we've achieved the Melt

702
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:59,919
it's very nice uh compliment to add some

703
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,919
pure cannabis to turbines 100%

704
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,240
all right so we are going for the AF

705
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,479
gooey AF gooey I'm happy about that I'm

706
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,440
definitely happy about

707
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,120
that I'm excited to taste it alone is

708
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,759
what I'm excited for because I haven't

709
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,599
had that yet I've just had it oh you got

710
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:19,960
a beautiful Drop there okay

711
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,439
beautiful as you guys know he just keeps

712
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,360
giving me bigger and bigger drops and

713
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,759
myself as well included it just seems

714
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,079
like we're we're kind of rounding the

715
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,119
bend here we've got only four flavors

716
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,079
left including this one so he's on his

717
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:36,079
fourth he's got three left after this

718
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:37,720
he's got the C orange og creamsicle

719
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,558
coming down the line he's got the Swiss

720
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,240
tsunami are we going to finish it with

721
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:43,519
the Gorilla Glue wow how was that

722
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,798
different than I thought it was going to

723
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,319
be I only had it with ha wow factor I

724
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:50,558
like AF goey yeah I just wanted to pull

725
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,398
that guy out exactly we're pretty much

726
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:55,119
finding that 90% of the time when you go

727
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:56,719
back for the second rip this thing is so

728
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,319
efficient that you might be tasting the

729
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,960
rip from being

730
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:03,439
but because the water's not in there the

731
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,278
turs aren't holding the flavor I bet you

732
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,720
if we put a tiny bit of water in there

733
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,720
it would taste like the Jack yeah the

734
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,079
turps would hold that they would be held

735
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,960
in the water so good good hint on that

736
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:15,720
one Tony for uh letting us know not to

737
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,798
put the water in however as we've gotten

738
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,679
through this super quick it's we'll see

739
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:20,879
what happens we'll see what happens we

740
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,399
know what's going to happen we know

741
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,600
what's going to happen it's nice yeah it

742
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:29,599
is nice yeah exactly oh my bad look at

743
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:30,879
these idiots [ __ ]

744
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,398
that's awesome all right so we're going

745
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,519
to hit this uh AF

746
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:38,359
gooey super stoked getting kind of used

747
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:39,919
to the feel of this machine too thought

748
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:41,918
it was a bit Tippy at first I'm not

749
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,759
feeling that anymore making room for the

750
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,759
extension cord changed everything yes it

751
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:49,759
defin I'm not knocking the turps

752
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:49,759
over

753
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:01,959
uhoh half gooey that W grab me by the

754
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,558
nuts let me tell you little warm or or

755
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,038
just a flavor no it was like the

756
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:07,038
different way of hitting it I talked for

757
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,960
a few seconds while it was in there so

758
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,558
when I started hitting it it was already

759
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,720
like evaporated in the tube and it just

760
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:17,000
it was a little more like less oxygen

761
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,079
more turps probably but yeah exactly and

762
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,398
definitely uh I might do the next one

763
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:22,398
like that too

764
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,879
yeah it definitely does say in the

765
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:29,278
pamphlet down turn it up definitely does

766
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,278
say in the pamphlet as

767
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:34,398
well um wait till the The Vapor starts

768
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,519
emitting out of the tube right so there

769
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:38,518
you go and that's all also not for Pure

770
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:40,359
turps though so no that's for cannabis

771
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,159
yeah pure turps might be just uh

772
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:44,079
whatever you like they're your turps

773
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,639
they're your uh you know it's this is a

774
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,158
learning experience um hitting turps

775
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:49,278
like this and you know of course there's

776
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,000
going to be people that are out there

777
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:54,359
saying what's the safety precautions is

778
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,759
it safe to be inhaling these we're not

779
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,000
promising you that it is this is

780
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,079
something we're doing on our own and you

781
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,880
feel the urge to try a bioassay with it

782
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,480
as well by no means are we saying we you

783
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,559
should go out and huff tpin 24/7 and and

784
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,119
you'll be fine but I do have confidence

785
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:12,398
that we have been inhaling these tpin in

786
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,639
profiles in cannabis and hashish for

787
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:17,358
thousands of years and it hasn't caused

788
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,760
us any problems as of yet so um we'll

789
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,319
see what happens uh in the next 10 years

790
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,359
in the science of learning about these

791
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,480
tpin uh there might be certain ones we

792
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,719
want to Omit there might be ones we want

793
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,639
to breed for that are that are you know

794
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,559
you know the strongest of the modulators

795
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,000
but uh what better way to learn when you

796
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:36,639
don't have a a chemistry lab than to use

797
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,398
your bioassay and uh and test it out for

798
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,119
yourself yeah you definitely hit the

799
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:43,039
nail on the head there there's no really

800
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,240
better person to tell you how you feel

801
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,398
from something than yourself yeah you

802
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:50,000
know and I mean it's true the science

803
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:53,358
will come out and uh I mean I don't see

804
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,679
any any bad effects coming from this um

805
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,159
just in terms of myself and I've been

806
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,160
using them every day for for a while now

807
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:59,838
and I'm sure

808
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,440
B man would agree I just like the way

809
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:04,400
they make me really feel nice and not

810
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,358
nice in a way that's never again

811
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,720

I'm sure Blue River could figure out a

830
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,439
way to uh make quarter drops available

831
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,440
to just make it real easy to put them in

strain you know one of these ones that

874
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,119
are considered high CB Street CBD why

875
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,159
why I would say that I am definitely

876
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,440
more on lines with what Chimera said on

877
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:18,559
hash Church a few weeks ago which is I

878
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,119
look forward to the day that we call

879
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,920
these things what the constituents are

880
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,480
that make them up the turpine profile

881
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,200
and the cannaboid profile that's what

882
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,199
the name much so much more than a name

883
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:32,199
yeah of course you

884
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:34,639
know it means a lot more to the end end

885
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:37,239
user than hey this orange creamsicle is

886

887
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:43,239
I just hit was phenomenal I'd say almost

888
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,440
the longer you let it emit out the the

889
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:47,159
the more

890
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,440
flavor

891
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:52,559
yeah kind of what I noticed on that one

892
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,559
as well that I did like

893
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,400

898
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:27,199
uh I mean almost hard to describe

899
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:30,359
definitely fruity it's Jack froses but

900
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,919
not not as zingy yep doesn't linger as

901

long doesn't linger as long but it's

902
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,800
definitely got or maybe it does but it's

903
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,359
a more subtle less like yeah yeah you

904

know cuz it's still there yeah it's

905
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:41,920
overpowering at first and then just

906
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,800
dissipates nicely where some of them

907

$50 value of these nails I think it's

nice to have extra Nails it's definitely

950
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:27,879
a necessity if you're using uh it's like

951
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:29,639
having droppers for tpin yeah exactly

952
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,880
you could mix them all up but it's not

953
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:33,400
as enjoyable of an experience in the end

954
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,039
plus you're paying you know for them so

955
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,440
you want to be able to use them as

956
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:37,719
efficiently as possible I'll tell you

957
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,440
something that I've never had the

958
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:41,118
experience of that Darren and I didn't

959
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,480
even have in our turfing Gauntlet and I

960
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,318
guarantee you it has a lot to do with

961
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,800
the water in the pipe each one of these

962
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:50,279
I got to taste it unadulterated I did

963
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,079
not taste a single rip of one of these

964
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,200
where like particularly where we went

965
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,000
from say uh the Long Valley Kush from

966
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,759
the red congales they're very different

967
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,480
tast tast they have very different

968
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,680
profiles I never tasted one after the

969
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,480
other like you said too less of a

970
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,598
lingerer in the water I believe so it

971
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,119
just yeah it just delivers that profile

972
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:13,079
that you put in and the quartz every

973
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:15,358
time has no smell to it other than you

974
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:17,640
know warm quartz so that leads us to

975
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,799
believe there's no Turpin left in there

976
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:21,318
yeah pretty cool aspect of the unit for

977
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,839
sure if you're looking to do yourself a

978
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:24,239
little uh if you're looking to have a

979
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:25,679
little tarpine party with your friends

980
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,838
and you've got half a dozen to 12

981
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:30,039
flavors this is defin defitely a nice

982
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:31,358
option I still for sure the minute we're

983
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:35,239
done this I'm going to want to do some

984
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:38,279
TP dipping yeah yeah but that being

985
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:39,399
said nothing wrong with taking a freshy

986
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,559
oh that was a

987
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,680
big last one so it's got to be went for

988
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:48,079
like a damn near full drop actually look

989
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:50,440
at that there you go there you go here

990
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,039
we go let that adid for a rocking that

991
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,679
full drop of the Gorilla Glue oh yeah

992
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,599
let it Adit he says let it Let Her Go

993
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,879
Let Her Go interesting the other one

994
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,880
pushed up

995
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,880
harder

996
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,240
o phenomenal hit that's definitely one

997
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:10,919
of the bigger

998
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:10,919
ones if you'll let us

999
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:15,359
know wow

1000
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,318
yeah that was really nice the the doll

1001
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:22,880
was turned down substantially so it was

1002
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:25,000
actually at a much lower temp than I

1003
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,960
normally have hit the other

1004
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,039
ones that was tasty

1005
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:34,920
good so there we go we've got 12

1006

dud so we just thought we would throw in

1028
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:26,519
uh at the end of this Gauntlet um a

1029
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,200
couple of dabs to show you what it's

1030
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:30,559
like to actually do a turp dip so we're

1031
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,279
going to hit a little of the West Coast

1032
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,920
concentrates we've got some beautiful

1033
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:38,240
Green Crack God 73 and some green crack

1034
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,119
God 120 let's go 120 let's do it it's

1035
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:42,000
got such a nice profile and we're trying

1036
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:43,480
it out of the vapex S and we're going to

1037
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,800
try it out of the vapex S so I'll turn

1038
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,800
it up a little bit we not going to go

1039
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,960
big yeah a little I definitely get that

1040
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,440
um that impression that it you know it's

1041
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,800
super efficient machine so you don't

1042
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,200
need to go and drop a big glob on it by

1043
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,200
no means I think I want to dip into the

1044
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,118
red congales I don't think that's a a

1045
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,639
bad

1046
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,280
idea so a nice little TP dip as you've

1047
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:07,759
seen what I've done is I've made a clear

1048
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,480
bottle vial with one drop next to all my

1049
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,640
10 drop vials and those are the vials

1050
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,318
that I prefer to dip in I wouldn't want

1051
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:17,199
to dip uh

1052
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:20,119
into a full 10 drops yeah I just don't

1053
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:22,318
think it's a good idea yeah it

1054
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:24,318
definitely it depends if you're smoke if

1055
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,880
you're down to the last couple drops you

1056
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:28,079
know we understand that you don't want

1057
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,318
to to take it out so there it is just a

1058
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,240
tiny little dab in

1059
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:33,838
there I think we're going to have to go

1060
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:36,598
much higher on our temperatures than

1061
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:39,239
just turs yeah just waiting for it to

1062
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:39,240
get green

1063
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,199
here and then we'll have a couple of

1064
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:44,838
dabs we'll see what's going on here do

1065
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,879
you want to tr try putting some water in

1066
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:48,799
the bom I definitely can all right well

1067
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,920
we'll see if we did this correctly we've

1068
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,039
got this little guy loaded with a bit of

1069
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,480
water I think it's just the top piece

1070
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:58,199
and then the bottom doesn't chug at all

1071
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,960
you wouldn't want the water to go in and

1072
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:04,919
and leak into here

1073
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,920
so I think I'm going to give it a

1074
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:11,159
shot little bubble dab kind of excited

1075
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,160
about

1076
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:14,159
this

1077
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:20,719
wow I'm sure that's going to be quite an

1078
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:20,720
enjoyable

1079
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:29,440
experience doesn't look like it wouldn't

1080
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,440
be getting a lot out of that little Dad

1081
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,440
too are you kidding

1082
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,599
me that was

1083
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:45,480
crazy tiny little bit hot definitely a

1084
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,480
little too hot but

1085
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,280
efficient

1086
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,119
wow that's my first dab all day too for

1087
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,559
me

1088
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:58,599
so interesting

1089
00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:00,079
too to loaded into a nail and hit it

1090
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:02,000
through a pipe it's just diff it's

1091
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,760
taking away the it's definitely taking

1092
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,838
away the scooping out and then dropping

1093
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,359
at glob and seeing it all bubble you're

1094
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:09,558
really just kind of naive to what's

1095
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:11,279
going on in the in the unit obviously we

1096
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:15,359
know what's going

1097
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,280
on damn that was pretty sweet it was

1098
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,480
pretty

1099
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:22,240
sweet I'm excited to try it at low

1100
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,639
Temp and let's try it at a lower temp

1101
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,239
you know it seemed like it gave off a

1102
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:28,440
little bit more than say like a nail

1103
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:31,399
would you know like a little bit more

1104
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,280
efficienc put tiny pie in too man I know

1105
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,200
I've seen

1106
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,880
that it would have been something that

1107
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:38,879
you and I would have dabbed yeah exactly

1108
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,680
no problem and we had to split that one

1109
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,760
and it was still strong what would you

1110
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:46,799
like to TP dip into for this one um we

1111
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,240
do

1112
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:53,079
let's you pick you

1113
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,679
pick I'm grateful either way oh go for

1114
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:58,599
the Kush cleaner that's a great pick I

1115
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,519
that's why I let him pick

1116
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:03,079
I figured if I'm going to pick for you

1117
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:07,039
yeah and for me I might as well pick

1118
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:07,039
something that we're going to fiend over

1119
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:11,359
yeah and you know it's looking like we

1120
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,639
thought that we were hitting the turps

1121
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:15,279
on uh such a low temp but it's almost

1122
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:16,719
like I think we should we should try

1123
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,440
hitting the hash on that low temp as

1124
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,039
well and it would little bit lower

1125
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,880
anyway I think we you we had it turned

1126
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:26,159
up substantially more although it gave a

1127
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,559
cloudy Rippy super cloudy you know what

1128
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,440
I'm saying definitely know what you're

1129
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:30,880
saying all right so here we go let's put

1130
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:36,200
this

1131
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:39,838
in turn that down a little bit than you

1132
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:43,719
sir just going to wait see a little bit

1133
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:46,279
let it heat up yeah dude tasty super
