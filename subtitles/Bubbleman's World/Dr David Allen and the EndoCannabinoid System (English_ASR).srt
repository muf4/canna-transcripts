00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,768
welcome yeah today were sitting with

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,840
mark cloaking the weed guy and a special

6
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,089
guest dr. David Allen who's in the house

7
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:36,479
today and I actually met you the first

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,940
time at the cush cop - Health Expo last

9
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,039
year okay he's a 30-year heart surgeon

10
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,659
yeah yeah I was gonna say actually if

11
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,850
you could tell everyone a little bit

12
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,828
about yourself just a quick couple of

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,410
minutes that's a good start and how you

14
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,250
kind of got into this I mean I'm excited

15
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:52,078
today

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,850
the reason I'm excited today is the dr.

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,549
David Allen is to me he's like an

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,719
endocannabinoid specialist you know a

19
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,878
lot of what I've learned about the

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,920
endocannabinoid system and shared on my

21
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,750
channel I've learned through dr. David

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,269
Allen so he's a professor of kendo

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,819
Catholic system yeah so let you tell me

24
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:15,539
about that well I'm a retired heart

25
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:17,368
surgeon and I have been using cannabis

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,600
since I was 17 years old

27
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:26,219
and and used it virtually every day only

28
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:28,399
you know after work and I knew that

29
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,929
there was something special about the

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:37,320
about cannabis that had worked better

31
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:39,780
than other medicines and as I finally

32
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,029
decided I wanted to go into just

33
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,040
cannabis research and quit doing heart

34
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,159
surgery so that's what I've done

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,420
and we're finding out to dis new

36
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,310
Sciences it's gonna change medicine so

37
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,409
that's what we're talkin about

38
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,969
absolutely and change the way we look at

39
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:00,640
cannabis as a medicine because it was

40
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:04,150
actually you that mentioned to me at the

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,480
Health Expo last year in regards to why

42
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,099
we don't need prescriptions for it and

43
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,240
I'm not sure if you remember saying this

44
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:13,299
but you said it's a preventative

45
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,010
medicine there's no need to prescribe it

46
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,960
we should be allowed to use it as a

47
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:19,719
preventative and then you mentioned well

48
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,300
it's actually diabetes and you know we

49
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,430
conservative nutraceutical and what that

50
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,340
means is it's a nutritional thing that

51
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:30,819
your body uses kind of like broccoli or

52
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:34,330
something that improves your nutritional

53
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:37,539
health and the animal can monoi system

54
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,490
is a mechanism that controls whether you

55
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:42,340
could diabetes or not it controls

56
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:45,040
whether you get cancer or not and a

57
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,950
bunch of other things and we're finding

58
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:51,609
out that really when we eat cannabis we

59
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:55,569
augment our own body's natural ability

60
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,940
to heal itself and so smoking cannabis

61
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:00,359
helps you as well but we're actually

62
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:03,939
finding out that eating cannabis

63
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,360
especially if you eat it raw it has a

64
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:10,300
much more potent medical effect that's

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,130
crazy so it's not looking at liking raw

66
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,040
cannabis so this is actually like a

67
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:17,469
nutritional supplements like a food so

68
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:21,310
the healthy food when the war is over

69
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:24,669
and cannabis is finally legal and this

70
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:28,300
will happen you'll be able to go to

71
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:30,639
Walmart and buy cannabis that's going to

72
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,560
be in your cereal and and other food

73
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,598
stuff and you

74
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,449
get your children it won't get them high

75
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:39,488
I like the juice bar idea to or people

76
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:41,289
be growing large amounts of play clones

77
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:43,090
kind of like they do with the the we

78
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:45,310
prize just juice and you got the fresh

79
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,530
you know you all of you if they blended

80
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,989
also get more the fiber these like an

81
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,330
Orange Julius I really wanted to do that

82
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:53,650
I mean but Julius but you ain't be

83
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,610
getting high of it but wouldn't be cool

84
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,110
to have a whole bunch of clones

85
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,680
continually you don't again

86
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,050
oh no absolutely and you just basically

87
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,980
juice and i'm like 'i do wheatgrass

88
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,519
that's pretty unique it's pretty

89
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:08,169
incredible time that we can find out

90
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,920
another chapter and how incredibly

91
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:17,680
beneficial cannabis is to mankind can

92
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:19,329
even dogkind know it affects everybody a

93
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,228
little differently and infects some

94
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:25,509
animals differently and this dog it is

95
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:30,360
extremely strong on it lasts for a long

96
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:33,099
time and we gave it a little piece of

97
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,370
cannabis cookie one time and it lasted

98
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:40,030
almost three days and so what that means

99
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:43,899
is that some animals have enzyme systems

100
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:46,959
that degrade cannabis that are different

101
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:51,969
from other animals and so it's not

102
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:56,288
really delineate which breeds tolerate

103
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:59,200
cannabis better or what what size animal

104
00:04:56,288 --> 00:05:01,240
this research is still needs to be done

105
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,740
I love when you ask a question or make a

106
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,259
call like the doctor just goes right

107
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,060
into its site mm well that's lovely

108
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:08,409
doctor color knowledge and and that's

109
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,269
what really needs to happen I think it's

110
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,550
a message to other doctors that are as

111
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:14,918
intelligent as you who are kind of blind

112
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,319
to the real facts of the benefits of

113
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,359
cannabis and one day they're gonna have

114
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,430
to be held accountable I think of dr.

115
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,250
Gupta who wrote that time magazine

116
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,259
article and has since retracted in and

117
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:30,389
actually did a couple of specials on CNN

118
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,389
so he's doubling down on marijuana

119
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:34,810
I say well I thought that it's almost

120
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,780
like they're being up to Soho you know

121
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,819
like as doctors they welded a girl stuff

122
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:43,019
did they even study the endocannabinoid

123
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:46,959
system well funny you should ask

124
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:49,000
last summer I did a study where we

125
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,519
called all the medical schools in the

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,639
United States were called 157 medical

127
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:58,620
schools and we asked the directors of

128
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,329
the curriculum if they talked key

129
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,600
endocannabinoid science to the students

130
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:05,560
they if they had a director of

131
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,160
endocannabinoid science if they had a

132
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,500
department if they talked the EECS as an

133
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,900
organized course or if they even

134
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,649
mentioned the EECS in any ancillary

135
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:19,719
courses like pathophysiology

136
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:23,469
pharmacology or neuroanatomy and the

137
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,140
answer was only 13% even mention it and

138
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:30,700
nobody has an organized course or a

139
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:34,209
department with a director and so this

140
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:36,430
shows that the doctors that graduate

141
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:39,310
this year are not going to be

142
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:42,939
knowledgeable in the ECS which is a

143
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:45,990
control system that controls everything

144
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:49,329
we're finding out that that even

145
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:52,720
conception if you if you block the

146
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:57,129
endocannabinoid system you can prevent

147
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:03,400
sperm from entering the ovum so you can

148
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:05,560
prevent impregnation if you block the

149
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,079
endocannabinoid system so it's a real

150
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,970
important system

151
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,228
so you need to tell me they've left out

152
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,720
a piece of the anatomy of the body

153
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:15,568
teaching medical doctors and all these

154
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,400
school it's kind of like your doctor not

155
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:20,039
knowing that there's a circulatory

156
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,198
system or a nerve receives at least that

157
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,389
important so what you said about it

158
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,098
earlier and how it regulates your body

159
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,780
into the deciding factor on whether

160
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:30,180
you're going to get diabetes or cancer

161
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:34,228
is or you would want to know about that

162
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,840
system yeah the importance of this is is

163
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:40,469
really we're just kind of coming to

164
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:44,029
understand the full meaning of what what

165
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:50,400
really the importance of the ECS is and

166
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:54,138
it's virtually the key of life it is the

167
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,848
Fountain of Youth and because it stops

168
00:07:54,139 --> 00:08:01,500
antioxidant stops oxidation from

169
00:07:56,848 --> 00:08:04,908
happening to the cells and many diseases

170
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:08,339
that we now currently have names for

171
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:11,279
will no doubt in the near future be

172
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:14,038
found to be defects in the either

173
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,859
production or degradation of the

174
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:21,990
endocannabinoid molecules that your body

175
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,340
produces I love hearing this I love that

176
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,528
you're sharing this with our audience

177
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,329
and that you've been sharing this you

178
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:29,250
know with many audiences throughout your

179
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:31,978
Facebook and through the loot guys

180
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,269
YouTube page and any speaks that many of

181
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:36,449
them alberta's and stuff because it has

182
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:39,629
to be absolutely I saw him speak so the

183
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,110
importance of all of this is is this if

184
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:45,019
we're going to be preventing diabetes

185
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,100
then we're going to be preventing

186
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:49,309
everything that's associated with

187
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,519
diabetes so we'll be preventing

188
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:55,500
amputations

189
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:59,449
we'll be preventing kidney dialysis and

190
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,039
we'll be preventing dock blindness and

191
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,800
there are studies that prove that if you

192
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:07,789
use canvas for 20 years or more just

193
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:11,419
even smoking it then it decreases

194
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:13,459
so diabetes by 66% so what is like a

195
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:16,699
miracle it is a miracle when you think

196
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,680
of both the suffering and the emotional

197
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,870
state of mind that you would also be

198
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:23,329
decreasing and all of that people that

199
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,060
didn't have to get dialysis is terrible

200
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,830
for people to have to go through that

201
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:29,929
really they wouldn't have to go through

202
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,840
that there's all these politicians that

203
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:35,379
think they're doing right by passing

204
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,600
laws that make marijuana illegal and

205
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:40,159
arresting people they really don't

206
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,450
understand that they're trying to pass a

207
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:46,539
law that would prevent her own family

208
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:49,370
from having a stroke or heart attack

209
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:54,559
they'll understand that they're

210
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:57,919
preventing science from advancing so

211
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,839
we're just killing people causing

212
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,429
suffering but that can't be accidental

213
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,470
though unfortunately I'm not trying to

214
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:06,859
get into a big conspiracy rant here or

215
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,389
anything but they do sell sugar well

216
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,200
that's what I mean like it seems more

217
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:14,299
like an agenda than it does an accident

218
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,890
how do you accidentally spend you know

219
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:19,370
hundreds of billions of dollars on

220
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:21,439
propaganda and lies and somehow like

221
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,610
even guys like Sanjay Gupta I believe

222
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,550
there's more of him out there I don't

223
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,470
believe doctors are bad people but I

224
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:29,419
believe somehow a system has been built

225
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,019
to specifically it prevents them from

226
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:36,469
talking yeah if you're actually he's

227
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:39,679
famous enough to do so if your income

228
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,139
stream comes from that realm then it's

229
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,120
hard to challenge that realm because you

230
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:46,610
know channels your income stream

231
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,620
absolutely brutal so he literally got

232
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,330
you by the bank accountant to me it

233
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,789
seems like some of the most important

234
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,520
information going right now to share

235
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:58,669
with a family member or loved one or

236
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,649
friend that you know is in any type of

237
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:01,669
element right now there's so many

238
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,069
different elements

239
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:05,779
that can be fixed by simply feeding your

240
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,090
endocannabinoid system just from these

241
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:14,919
deficiencies people don't even know they

242
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:18,920
have them and it really it seems that

243
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:23,000
these endocannabinoid deficiencies make

244
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:25,939
you think different and and really the

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,480
people that are making the laws you for

246
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:32,870
the most part aren't using cannabis and

247
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,950
they passed laws that they think sound

248
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:39,049
reasonable but on further examination

249
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,300
especially if you smoke pot you can see

250
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:44,750
the folly in the laws that they passed

251
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:48,429
and they think they're reasonable but

252
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:51,440
people that smoke pot kind of understand

253
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:54,799
they can't be reasonable yeah and I

254
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,210
think that folly is a real danger to

255
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,909
make something look bad you know that

256
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,410
that that mistake that they're making it

257
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:03,740
doesn't make them look bad it's it's

258
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:06,500
just so easy they don't think properly

259
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:10,279
if you smoke cannabis you actually think

260
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:13,879
better than if you don't smoke cannabis

261
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:16,730
and so you're kind of inhibited if you

262
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,230
don't use cannabis sure not to mention

263
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,810
they're putting out something that's

264
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,420
such a lie that when they put out

265
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:25,519
something that's the truth how our young

266
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:27,620
people supposed to acknowledge the

267
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,629
difference when they see one thing

268
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,149
that's clearly folly to them because

269
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:33,590
they also perhaps smoke cannabis or know

270
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:36,860
someone that's using it in a distantly

271
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:38,240
or recreationally and they know that

272
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,399
those things are not true

273
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,049
and then there's stuff like alcohol

274
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,120
which kills people and they can see

275
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:46,009
that's it's a direct contradiction well

276
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,259
alcohol is potentially one of the most

277
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:50,299
dangerous drugs we have speaking of

278
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:53,149
which Prime Minister Harper a huge party

279
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:55,279
this is not an eighteen-year-old girl my

280
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:56,870
boy somebody see alcohol poisoning is

281
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,029
really dangerous you can die from that

282
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,470
yeah people do die from that it's

283
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,600
definitely you should have thrown a

284
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,850
party what about

285
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,000
much press I'm telling you we would have

286
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:11,019
been there when the government is caught

287
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,198
in lies it makes the population mistrust

288
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:16,389
and that is well and and so what it

289
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:19,299
really does is in the creates a an

290
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:22,240
animosity between the people and the

291
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:24,549
government which affects the government

292
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,990
on other levels that's how the

293
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:31,359
government needs to be truthful for the

294
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,440
people to really you know trust the

295
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,839
government well if they want their

296
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,899
foundation to be made out of like stone

297
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:40,959
instead of sand they should be truthful

298
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:43,000
and be honest and have a highly wrongful

299
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,458
board I'm easily or at least you know

300
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,169
what you get with that guy you do know

301
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,758
what you get with another shirt and if

302
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:51,219
only we could get someone that you don't

303
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:54,278
wanna get if we could get someone who

304
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,829
you know the same way but isn't actually

305
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:58,149
like that like a good just like this

306
00:13:56,828 --> 00:14:00,039
goes back to people that aren't using

307
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:02,500
cannabis people that aren't using

308
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:05,500
cannabis these generally this type of

309
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,958
person they the people that want a rule

310
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,120
and control are generally not the same

311
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:12,489
people who want to grow cannabis and use

312
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,629
cannabis that's that's the real people

313
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,799
that want to control other people become

314
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:20,919
presidents and become directors and

315
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:22,778
become the head of the whatever they're

316
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:24,938
generally in their own right on a

317
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,470
different path it's also the industries

318
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:28,688
that they control that they're trying to

319
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,910
keep it away maybe they don't agree or

320
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:32,860
don't care about pot but they sure do

321
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:35,110
care about the forest industry or the

322
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,709
pharmaceutical industry and what it will

323
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,370
do to that yeah well I'll tell you 25

324
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,129
years ago

325
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,139
it was such a different world in Canada

326
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:48,549
and literally I'm not sure how long it's

327
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:50,528
been now about 94 it's over 20 20 years

328
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:52,599
since we got our first Hempfield growing

329
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:55,198
in Canada and I'll never forget my

330
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,939
ex-partner from back then martin saying

331
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,500
this will change the way people see it

332
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,299
when they start seeing this stuff

333
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,470
growing on the side of the road it's

334
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:04,299
just going to it's kind of

335
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,980
and you know in Manitoba it would have

336
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:07,389
been like this I'm surprised too many

337
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,789
people don't know it

338
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:11,500
marijuana and hemp are the same things

339
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:13,360
the main element female that was another

340
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,120
little fib we had to tell our government

341
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,190
you know that hemp was a distant

342
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,110
relative of cannabis we used that very

343
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,120
wording with the Minister of Finance and

344
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,180
agriculture and we felt like it was a

345
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,560
viable it was okay to tell that fit of

346
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:31,989
course and the THC limits were so low

347
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,239
that sure you could probably raise the

348
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,680
THC limits even in that strain if you've

349
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,259
read it over the course of the amount of

350
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,500
time 30 years probably 40 or 50 or

351
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:44,769
whatever but still it's it's there it's

352
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,570
genetics is there it's in the literature

353
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:48,639
it's got to be in there exactly point

354
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,740
zero one you can never get rid of it why

355
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,100
would you want to well for us we wanted

356
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:56,889
that at that time just to get hemp in

357
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,330
the ground like it was also an okay

358
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:01,029
thing because we got slack for people

359
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:04,090
TMC's been a rune pot it's just crazy

360
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:07,120
people were freaking out the bar these

361
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,379
were I suppose its supporters they're

362
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,899
jealous you're good

363
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:14,799
we're all doing it for the people

364
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:16,750
absolutely cool well what about the

365
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,149
ritualistic use of cannabis for

366
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:23,080
thousands of years and what do you think

367
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:25,240
about it's only been in the last hundred

368
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,030
years that they really bastardized it

369
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,980
and it's before then it's been used you

370
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:32,559
know in tradition from all sorts of

371
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,629
different cultures and races from like

372
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,639
the sit-ins the Egyptians I mean that's

373
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:38,289
it's only real it's very bad in terms of

374
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,710
math in terms of mankind it's only

375
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:43,750
really been a very small blinking time

376
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,910
that it's been illegal and persecuted

377
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:48,639
like it is so I guess someone trying to

378
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:50,370
say is do you think that it's gonna get

379
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,470
reversed or do you think it's just

380
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:57,519
complementation of well I'm trying to

381
00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:00,810
control plan it's crazy how a government

382
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,289
has spent all this money and energy

383
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:06,990
and built up all these weapon systems

384
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:12,049
and information systems to fight a plant

385
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:18,259
and the plant seems like it's women and

386
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:18,259
it's win because the the war is based on

387
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:25,679
false information lies as one lies right

388
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:27,869
and the plant you can't they these

389
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,840
people think they're passing just laws

390
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:33,750
but they're passing laws against

391
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:37,079
something that will stop diabetes so how

392
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:41,220
do you and what bizarre world does that

393
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:44,159
make sense where you can pass a law

394
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:47,279
against something that sure's disease

395
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,060
what about the lack of hard evidence of

396
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:53,009
physical side effects from cannabis

397
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:55,619
that's never been presented I find not

398
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:56,700
just a travesty now well no dead bodies

399
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:59,789
is what I'm trying to say you know

400
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,410
slowly how can this be when there's

401
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:04,200
millions of people being killed by

402
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:05,940
alcohol and cigarettes or do you

403
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,720
understand I'm saying there's a reason

404
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,759
we don't know more information about

405
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,400
cannabis and it's ill facts is because

406
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:17,759
they don't allow scientists to study it

407
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,060
because of its classification si si si

408
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:25,890
si one control substance act

409
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:29,279
si si one class schedule one and the

410
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:32,210
only reason this the CSA has five

411
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:37,980
schedules and they're all all illegal

412
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:40,319
and canvases schedule one and the only

413
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,309
difference in schedule 1 and the other

414
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,990
schedules is in a Schedule one

415
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:48,779
scientists can study it without special

416
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:52,200
permission that they don't give so

417
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:54,769
essentially anything in schedule one the

418
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,690
scientist or doctor can't study and

419
00:18:54,769 --> 00:19:00,660
sulfur was made schedule 2 it would

420
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:05,340
still be illegal for people to own but

421
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,110
doctors could study it and they they

422
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:09,199
seemed

423
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:11,990
to use the excuse that if doctors were

424
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,569
studying that they would have stashes of

425
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:19,190
it that could be diverted to the public

426
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:22,129
for non-medical use and that doesn't

427
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:25,509
hold water but the truth is the whole

428
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:29,530
scheduling was made to prevent

429
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:35,420
scientific study so we made knowledge

430
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:37,759
illegal by this method yeah that's a

431
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:43,700
pretty impressive thing God's fingers in

432
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:45,259
your dog yes that's a terrible blow

433
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,630
right there when they did that and that

434
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:48,410
was I believe from 1937 from the

435
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,130
narcotics

436
00:19:48,410 --> 00:20:01,640
well the Controlled Substances Act was

437
00:19:52,130 --> 00:20:04,280
it came into effect in 1970 okay but it

438
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:08,750
really they had to make what happened

439
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:12,700
was in 1937 they passed the marihuana

440
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:15,980
Tax Act and that made marijuana illegal

441
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:20,029
except for medicinal use it was illegal

442
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:22,519
and to have marijuana you could have it

443
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:26,048
legally if he had this it's a tax stamp

444
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:28,639
which they didn't give out so basically

445
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:34,369
and you had to have the marijuana in

446
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:37,640
hand to get the stamp and so what

447
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:40,189
happened was Timothy Leary was busted at

448
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,500
the Mexican border his daughter was

449
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:46,009
carrying some marijuana and he was

450
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,910
busted and he went to jail for a very

451
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:49,519
area

452
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:55,910
I heard him tell that story and what

453
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:59,269
happened was his he was sent to jail for

454
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:02,990
a long time and he found on appeal his

455
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:06,109
lawyers argued that if you had to have

456
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,259
the marijuana to get the tax stamp that

457
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:10,459
that was self-incrimination and

458
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:13,430
therefore it was

459
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:16,880
constitutionally illegal and the court

460
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:20,140
agreed with Timothy Leary's so for a

461
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,120
short time after that that Court ruling

462
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,950
marijuana was technically legal in the

463
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:29,449
United States but people didn't know

464
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:32,990
about it and what it for it forced her

465
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:36,620
hand because they they had a legal

466
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:39,079
loophole that people were not using and

467
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:42,289
so what they did daddy calls that a

468
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:46,669
legal loophole and so they designed this

469
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:50,599
control substance act in a fashion that

470
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:53,060
that they thought whoa now how could we

471
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:55,969
make marijuana illegal so no one can

472
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:58,399
ever make it legal again and so they

473
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:03,259
came up with this crazy classification

474
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:06,950
the CSA one is three three points that

475
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:09,619
has high potential for abuse and since

476
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:13,370
there's no criteria for what that is

477
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:17,089
that that makes it an undefinable thing

478
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:20,359
and then not currently used for

479
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:23,809
medicinal use and as we all know that

480
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:26,899
prior to thirty seven that it was one of

481
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:29,569
the most prescribed medicines but they

482
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:33,830
get around that by saying currently and

483
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:38,240
then the third thing was not safe under

484
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:40,149
physician guidance and so and since

485
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,809
can't physicians can't prescribe

486
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:47,390
schedule 1 substances that held true so

487
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:52,519
they use this triple threat of a

488
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:55,700
criteria to make marijuana illegally in

489
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:58,970
a really unconstitutional

490
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,880
it was definitely a prief near fatal

491
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,819
blow to cannabis for a long time because

492
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,040
I do remember Andrew Weil did a study in

493
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:08,720
1965 one understands if they're sorry in

494
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,819
Turkey what if they're it was being

495
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,350
prescribed you said the most previous in

496
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:13,939
1937 it wasn't there any doctors

497
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:17,539
protesting like hey now I can't

498
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,490
prescribe it was useful I'm saying there

499
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:23,599
was and there was only information too

500
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:25,460
though how information was passed well

501
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,199
there was a large amount of doctors that

502
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,019
were being arrested and thrown in jail

503
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,539
for still using cannabis tinctures

504
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:34,970
because every major pharmaceutical

505
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:37,309
company was prescribed ad

506
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:40,009
they had preparations using cannabis

507
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:43,250
tinctures and other things and so the

508
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:46,160
doctors were still using them and and

509
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,490
what happened was the AMA kind of made

510
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,080
an amends with the government and

511
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:56,180
allowed it to be taken off the

512
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:58,609
pharmacopoeia and so the year prior to

513
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,279
that they were had arrested ten thousand

514
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:03,859
dollars a year after that they arrested

515
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,319
like seven doctors or something so

516
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:10,189
taking the most medicinal plant ever off

517
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:12,710
of the pharmacopoeia right and so it's

518
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:16,480
like a bizarro world and that's what it

519
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:20,600
was where where these people for

520
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:23,660
ulterior motives make something that's

521
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:28,480
healthy for you in legal something they

522
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:31,660
could save your grandmother's life so

523
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,309
it's it's crazy how this law developed

524
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,050
it's so multi useful you can see here I

525
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:38,869
was like but I thought of it or your

526
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:41,440
child's seizures yeah we were like again

527
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:45,679
where you're only like saved my life so

528
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,620
yeah it's really a big heist an amazing

529
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,630
thanks it is I mean I feel blessed on

530
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:51,919
one point in the sense that even though

531
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,600
we're still fighting for our rights

532
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,220
we're able to have our little gardens

533
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,109
and we're able to grow our own medicine

534
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,329
but it's still under the threat of being

535
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:00,889
taken away and I just think wow well

536
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:02,720
they've made it criminally more illegal

537
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,770
to girl marijuana I know we have one

538
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,140
side of the barrel

539
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:08,660
here medical use with on the other side

540
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,790
ever has been making it along mandatory

541
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,500
minimums

542
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:14,180
which even some judges have already been

543
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,829
like we're not doing that

544
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,360
the other goal enforcing it you know and

545
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:20,569
it makes sense because he wants to fill

546
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,609
his private prisons yeah so so how do

547
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:24,679
you make it illegal if you if you had a

548
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:27,049
substance that you could eat and it

549
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,690
would didn't get you high and with

550
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:32,269
decreased incidence of diabetes by sixty

551
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,250
six percent and your doctor can't give

552
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:36,379
you any other medicine there's no other

553
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:40,160
medicine that decreases incidence of

554
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:42,530
diabetes by two percent so if your

555
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,650
doctor could give you this stuff that it

556
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:49,460
would do this and they would make them

557
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:51,800
law against that that makes the lawyers

558
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,730
and the politicians of passed these laws

559
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:57,710
were pretty ignorant when you jamón

560
00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:00,559
examine their laws under the truth of

561
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:03,470
what they're really doing absolutely but

562
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,990
well if you examine the actual true

563
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:08,299
agenda they're they're reads they're

564
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:11,059
brilliant because they're their evil

565
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:12,680
agenda means evil and they're really

566
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:14,359
good at their evil and that's how they

567
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,940
can pass those laws they're not doing it

568
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:18,709
accidentally you don't Amin it's for

569
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,090
such big money and why are they doing it

570
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,910
well it's because these companies that

571
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:24,769
certain companies 90 percent of their

572
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,720
payment management medications alone

573
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:29,450
just pain management I think it was a

574
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,769
double threat - I mean that him was the

575
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,910
the tree in the streets one of the

576
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:35,599
largest industries in North America

577
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:37,220
50,000 commercial products exactly and

578
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:41,179
then on top of the pharmaceuticals they

579
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:43,519
had two really powerful industries that

580
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,750
were logging for it and owned by only a

581
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,980
handful of people I think people need to

582
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,079
realize that the pharmaceutical industry

583
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,450
was family-owned basically back then and

584
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,189
even with the hemp the way we've been

585
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,809
allowed to grow it here in Canada

586
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,850
we were young activists when we fought

587
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:57,769
for that right and when we got it we

588
00:26:55,849 --> 00:27:00,169
were so happy to get it so happy to

589
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:02,660
change the law from experimental to

590
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:04,670
commercial but then what then we're

591
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,980
growing it for seed and the seed oil is

592
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,420
too expensive to run engines on so we

593
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,650
can only sell it at high-end grocery

594
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,350
stores where you can put it on your

595
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:15,019
salad like that is a failed hemp

596
00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:17,149
industry in Canada the fact that all we

597
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:19,639
have is hemp food that's all we got out

598
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,380
of it from 15 to 20 years ago there's

599
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,820
still no fibre being produced there's

600
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,770
still no creek there's still don't have

601
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:27,889
metal there's still no all of these

602
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:30,529
products that we should be producing out

603
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:32,810
of hand yeah you know so I still feel

604
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:34,549
there's a long way to go for that as

605
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:36,529
well you know the same way we're

606
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:38,779
fighting even still forever and even if

607
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:41,089
you don't use marijuana these marijuana

608
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:45,259
laws are used against you to restrict

609
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:48,470
your freedoms so really just this

610
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:51,529
marijuana the issue it affects everybody

611
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:54,110
even if you don't use the cannabis well

612
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:57,319
I mean in Canada it costs you money to

613
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:59,539
be able to enforce these archaic laws it

614
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:01,549
costs you to get the police and the

615
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:02,899
judge and the sheriff's and the jails

616
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:04,519
and they don't even follow their rules

617
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,800
like they make rules and then don't

618
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:08,720
follow them like sovereignty wrote rules

619
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,069
that say police from other countries

620
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,900
aren't allowed to come into other

621
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:14,359
countries and police well then how did

622
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:17,090
the DEA come up into BC and take Marc

623
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,500
Emery away and how did I saw them you

624
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:21,259
know strong because I saw them arrest

625
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:25,210
him when Michelle and and Greg and like

626
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:27,980
take them away they were nuts insane

627
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,710
yeah and they also used our own police

628
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,120
services to execute it with them oh yeah

629
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,250
absolutely they were puppets

630
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:36,979
yeah and I always think to like there's

631
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,319
a lot of countries that never happen no

632
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:43,069
mind you imagine like Japan going into

633
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:43,740
China and police in the Army just came

634
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:45,808
into the

635
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,399
BC or whatever Mars also anybody here

636
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:49,740
always when I make this point it said

637
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:52,019
Mark had no charges in Canada so I like

638
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,669
he got some crazy charges like even get

639
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:55,109
five years for in Canada

640
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:57,390
well that was clearly a personal

641
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:59,069
vendetta with the US government had

642
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,500
against mark not only because of his

643
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:05,700
outspoken activism but what's more

644
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,619
threatening than a an activist is the

645
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,750
wealthy activists who will put all his

646
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:11,819
money into his activism like sending

647
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,859
Americans bail money and helping

648
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:16,019
Americans move out of the US and the

649
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:17,908
Canada and just like he just he's been

650
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:21,000
spreading the word to overgrow

651
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:23,520
okay never use any plants you just hand

652
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,259
it all back as it was coming people like

653
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,599
mark charges too much for seeds it's

654
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:30,929
like he gives it all the way that that

655
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:33,298
listen when you go to a silent auction

656
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:35,370
and it's for some cool event that you

657
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:37,259
want to support do you think the intent

658
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:40,139
is to pay less for the auction item

659
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:43,919
you're going to pay more that's I'm

660
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,028
actually a little somebody exactly and

661
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,380
that's what Mark was doing with the

662
00:29:45,028 --> 00:29:47,819
seeds and he didn't want to have to

663
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,528
explain it to everyone listen you're

664
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,418
paying more because of what I'm doing

665
00:29:49,528 --> 00:29:53,099
with the money so aren't you stoked to

666
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,380
be watching what I know about what you

667
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:57,359
got with mark is what you going I got

668
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,130
twenty thirty different streams and

669
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,859
different scenes for mark and they

670
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,210
always were bang on I don't think people

671
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:08,759
realize you actually gonna you know

672
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:10,620
import those just go buy on them and

673
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:12,390
ship five thousand different seeds into

674
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:14,609
Canada I for one I'm looking very

675
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,620
forward to getting mark back to DC he's

676
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:19,589
gonna be a star they will wait and

677
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:24,418
hopefully be giant with this and yeah

678
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:28,829
this is good you know drug wars failing

679
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:30,990
cuz this is his last gasp and what we

680
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:33,599
need to do is make sure people get

681
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:38,429
involved and make sure that the new laws

682
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:40,389
that come out make sense and don't

683
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:43,560
punish people for using them

684
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:46,830
that helps their diabetes it helps her

685
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:50,289
anxiety it helps her sleep knows me I

686
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:52,720
mean either way from back in the day

687
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:55,089
when they pull the teeth out of the

688
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,519
hashish leaders in Cairo in like the

689
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:59,289
14th century they were trying to that

690
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,970
was their version of like the controlled

691
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:03,339
substance act or any of these other

692
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:04,960
preventive to getting us not to use this

693
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:07,269
magical plant like spending billions of

694
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,090
dollars and like David said I think

695
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:12,670
Canada's might be winning this war you

696
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:14,919
know pulling their teeth out in the

697
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:18,370
square didn't stop these guys from

698
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:20,650
eating hash I think at that point they

699
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:22,899
could have figured it out listen these

700
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,820
people really like this they are willing

701
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,220
to have pulling their teeth out with

702
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:32,079
like brutal probably not even well-made

703
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:36,279
pliers like the fact that they probably

704
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:37,869
use cannabis afterwards for they still

705
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:39,519
use it they still kept using it they

706
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:41,199
still gathered they still use it to this

707
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,019
day people aren't going to stop using

708
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:49,000
this plant and the fact that you know

709
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:49,900
that's why we're going to kashgar it's

710
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,549
in the west of China

711
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:56,050
I mean to the north to Japan where that

712
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:57,579
old money wasn't the 789 grams of

713
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,319
procured cannabis it's the oldest

714
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:03,309
pharmaceutical you know I found some of

715
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:06,490
those seeds from that ya know they gave

716
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:08,950
some to curses for stuff man Sam yeah

717
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,599
yeah so when I was in his house one day

718
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:15,100
and he just he was like he's like check

719
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:16,899
this out and I was just like I was like

720
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,189
what is that I think it might I can't

721
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,019
remember if it was some of the weed or

722
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,970
it was just the seeds I think and he was

723
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:24,250
like those are the oldest seeds like

724
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,140
ever found or something yeah the oldest

725
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:31,900
house beautiful yeah because in the

726
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:34,180
desert he also has the world's smallest

727
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,430
seeds from my belief net Paul and the

728
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:41,170
largest scenes from China which look

729
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:44,230
like small walnuts okay yeah small what

730
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:46,000
like small like maybe that big way

731
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,569
bigger than any seed you've ever seen

732
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,179
like

733
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:51,129
or five times bigger I heard in Kashgar

734
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:54,429
they have the world's largest outdoor

735
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:57,250
market every Sunday and people not be

736
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:59,230
the Nepali market and you know that hash

737
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,940
kind of feeling the Muslims seeming out

738
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,159
in that little area so I fear and I know

739
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,860
they like nothing amazing just putting

740
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:06,909
cash bearing your stuff okay yeah well I

741
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,798
think it would be cool is to go

742
00:33:06,909 --> 00:33:11,200
experience that sort of feel of this

743
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:13,599
crazy market that everyone from all over

744
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,090
comes into China that area and has a

745
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,589
crazy people working and then yeah and

746
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:20,230
you know what the world's changing to

747
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:21,459
all these places are getting cooler some

748
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,220
friends of mine that own a seed company

749
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:26,500
we're still we're telling me that people

750
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:28,980

751
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,980
of seeds

752
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,929
yeah I think so but it must be getting

753
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,429
cooler there's all the books that they

754
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,409
haven't done it in a while I don't know

755
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:40,690
like just the fact that people are

756
00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:43,059
quartering seeds and going back to my

757

it's just crazy I was the unique thing

773
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,519
that so small goes usually when I have

774
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:23,980
an experience like that I feel like I'm

775
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:26,800
exactly where I'm supposed to be me - I

776
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,809
feel like yes I gave a $20 tip when we

777
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,579
left which is nice he was very happy

778
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:31,989
that's that's what I call charity is

779
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:33,669
when you like really need somebody you

780
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:35,408
know the money's going like directly to

781
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:37,868
their family it means so much to me

782
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:39,338
I'm absolutely good people don't eat

783
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:41,639
like I don't mind sharing news but like

784
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:43,989
a lot of time it's like it's not very

785
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,550
one-to-one you don't see really needs

786
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:47,138
going this is going into charity they

787
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,909
probably got a great infrastructure and

788
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:50,370
some of them were good out there and

789
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,039
have a low low low overhead

790
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:55,049
I'm sure it's the opposite but you just

791
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,099
like actually go person to person and do

792
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,440
something nice for him

793
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:00,420
absolutely so it's nice little traveling

794
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,190
it's easy to do nice things for people

795
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,680
yeah one Allstate like start by being

796
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,269
nice in Canada it's pretty blessed here

797
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:07,679
I mean I know we have poor people here

798
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:10,170
but in reality we have great social

799
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,759
programs welfare check the food bank

800
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,130
there's lots of ways to live a better

801
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,080
life and even even disabled people are

802
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,400
incredible ability or your Medicare is

803
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,619
all cover and all that stuff so when I

804
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:24,329
travel it's like exactly so I'm you know

805
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,980
it's not a perfect system obviously but

806
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:27,809
health care alone a bone marrow

807
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,420
transplant I heard that's a quarter of a

808
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:32,400
million in the state our government

809
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,440
scheme is licenses to grow meat that's

810
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,930
true that well they gave to us we had a

811
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,019
Supreme Court ruling forcing them to

812
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:43,319
give us access before that before that

813
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:46,170
well I mean just applying Terri Parker I

814
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,580
could take it to Supreme Court force

815
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,579
them to allow us to be able to have

816
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:53,009
access no we never did for for hemp we

817
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:54,690
just were like we wrote in and that

818
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,070
minute I tried you're the licensing we

819
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,019
like can we get an application he said

820
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,720
there is no application so we created it

821
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:02,400
by sending in our kind of this is what

822
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,659
we want to do and then they sent it back

823
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,490
and they said no I got to do this this

824
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:07,739
and that we do all that and that went on

825
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:09,419
for like nine months just back and forth

826
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:09,899
and that's sort of how and they did it

827
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,309
with us

828
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,590
they did it with Jeff Kahn and Jill

829
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:15,420
Strobel in Ontario and they did it with

830
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:18,269
I believe they were also some guy in

831
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,950
Alberta he's not the first year nothing

832
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:21,989
for all the no sorry Saskatchewan

833
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:25,069
Manitoba and Ontario I believe with the

834
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:27,929
three provinces that did it and was

835
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:30,510
awesome well that's an amazing thing now

836
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:34,319
to hold in your life dear to your heart

837
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:35,750
absolutely hemp is only in its miniscule

838
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,010
stages in Canada

839
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:39,440
you're saying the products it's not

840
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:41,320
producing it so that's true I open

841
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,059
liberal government and some hungry

842
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:47,600
Alberta and Saskatchewan farmers the

843
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:49,159
site is like thousands of bankers never

844
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,500
your salmon running the biodiesel and

845
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:53,119
all that stuff even the oils or because

846
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,420
no like I said if I mentioned it earlier

847
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:59,719
right the the way they've got it set up

848
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:05,720
is not it's it's that the oils are too

849
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:08,299
valuable 2008 still that's okay oh yeah

850
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:08,809
we were hitting 2008 I forgot about your

851
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,019
children

852
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:16,099
we were hitting the bubble from 2008

853
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:19,099
this is 6 6 plus years old actually

854
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:21,559
smooth it's good it's really nice and

855
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:54,409
it's uh not quite shattered consistency

856
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:58,940
of time machine it would be so what

857
00:37:54,409 --> 00:38:00,799
would make it more viable because using

858
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,539
for fuel because the process once

859
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,370
because the value they put on it go to

860
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:07,639
the supermarket and seeing how much that

861
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:10,609
oil is valued reducing it's like

862
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:16,069
everyone's going it's because of the

863
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:18,740
cost as well to produce it there's no

864
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:23,090
good infrastructure set up for that to

865
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:25,369
be on a huge level with a continent type

866
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:28,430
level yeah and then America is a beast

867
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:30,920
how many people and consumers are in

868
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:33,739
that country like Canada can be growing

869
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,599
head full-time just to the fuel America

870
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:36,269
even though America themselves could

871
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,940
grow I think

872
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:41,550
it's about 6% of their marginal land not

873
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:44,730
even their good land could grow all the

874
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:46,769
BTUs at least it could back in 2000 for

875
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,159
the entire country and that was a jack

876
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:49,469
herer

877
00:38:47,159 --> 00:39:03,539
hamper Emperor wears no clothes off

878
00:38:49,469 --> 00:39:06,569
halation mm-hmm all right be nice I'm

879
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:08,969
baked spend a couple of hours here you

880
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:12,870

881
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:14,250
gonna happen it's gonna happen there's

882
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:17,130
no doubt such things I love that you

883
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:20,070

884
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:22,980
deserve it don't we we do deserve it we

885
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:26,700
deserve it and when I say we did I mean

886
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,349
everyone kind of my whole trip on my I'm

shirt growing and grade is super

896
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,170
important I'm less impressed with trying

897
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,539
to grow it greater those days I'm trying

898
00:39:55,170 --> 00:40:01,920
to isolate it greater I like the

899
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:03,000
isolation factor it's nice all right

900
