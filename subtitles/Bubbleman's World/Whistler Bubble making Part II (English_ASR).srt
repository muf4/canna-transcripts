00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,158
Checker Miss river which is extremely

50
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,239
cold I can assure you we brought up a

51
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:26,560
cooler of our own ice and John was kind

52
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,480
enough to cut My Little Pony down My

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,360
Little Pony yeah My Little Pony Here

54

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,519
upo all right so we're making bubble

56
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,719
Oreo's helping we're on this all right

57
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,480
so we're going to start with the 25

58
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,479
micron bag let's get it in

59
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,000
there you know what I'm not even going

60
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,438
to worry about flipping the bags over

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,639
the edge right now we'll leave them open

62
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:57,280
like that 25 45 they're always in a row

63
00:03:51,639 --> 00:04:03,359
number white number white 45 yes once

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,360
again number white color 45 Micron

65
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,158
73 it's uh nice to have

66
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:13,639
both all

67
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:15,438
right my hook of Jack is so thick that

68
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,000
when I put my arms in the bucket I push

69
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,759
all the bags into the bucket so we'll

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,478
see what kind of success rate I actually

71
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,560
have doing this might have to do a

72
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,560
little outside bucket

73
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,599
trick nice I like that

74
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:42,000
little way to speed up putting your

75
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,879
bags into one another uh let's get the

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,478
orange one first let's do the order

77
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:50,360
proper you want your 120 you don't want

78
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:54,879
to mess that hash up 120 is a nice

79
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,840
grade we have the 160 bag the orange bag

80
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,560
specifically to secure the quality well

81
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,159
the

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,639
purity

83
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,639
of that bag the

84
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,600
120 all right green bag getting these

85
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,000
bags in here

86
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,680
nice know a lot of you are looking at me

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,120
like I'm an alien right now cuz you've

88
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,879
fiddled with your bubble bags for half

89
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,680
an hour at a time trying to get them all

90
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,600
fit inside one another

91
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,600
nicely oh this way is a little

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,919
quicker which is uh we're going to run

93
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,479
out of time again as always light so not

94
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:38,198
like we're in a huge rush but we wanted

95
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:40,399
to make sure we did some bubble making

96
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,600
today somewhere cool like we mentioned

97
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,599
we

98
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,638
would and we

99
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,000
go yes there we go and if you really

100
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:56,120
want to you can one by one them down do

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,879
your yeah you know you really want to

102
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,000
get

103
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,680
those all down and tight does secure

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,319
them

105
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,319
nicely it's never a terrible idea to

106
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,959
do we have all the tools here for doing

107
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,759
our extraction and stuff like that got

108
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,918
our spoon for uh mixing everything

109
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,319
up we got our trusty little

110
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:25,359
uh bag over

111
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:27,360
here in this bag you got some bigger

112
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,598
spoons yeah I figured we could all give

113
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,120
it a shot hand stirring it we're

114
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:35,319
obviously not going to be bubble knowing

115
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,879
up here in the electrical free zone yeah

116
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,439
electrical free

117
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:43,759
zone no Outlet we got our spoons pull in

118
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,759
our bags fingger

119
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:50,159
spoon just going to make sure the P by

120
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:53,000
here all right so I'm going to pour a

121
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,000
bucket of water in

122
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:04,638
here

123
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,960
that is some nice cold water Wow Let's

124
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,079
get some ice in there good ice great ice

125
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:13,399
let's use about half that bag actually

126
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,598
let's put some fresh frozen down

127
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,598
first here I'll hold that for you here

128
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,839
we

129
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:22,478
go hold that for a second got our whis

130
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,000
in there too but uh yeah show them

131
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,719
that

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,680
oh fresh frozen fresh frozen look at

133
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,599
that guys what do we have about 400 R

134
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,598
there done

135
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,800
roughly all right so normally I would uh

136
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,000
actually use a medtainer to grind all

137
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,680
this stuff up in here but because it's

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,038
so fresh we're just going to freeze it

139
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,720
directly in that ice yes then we going

140
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,719
put half in up we

141
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,478
go not going to break just a little

142
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:05,680
there you go yeah there half of it f

143
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,598
away a little early but that's okay ear

144
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,560
get all that niess off of there look

145
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,719
that actually let's go for this one oh

146
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,199
we brought the good

147
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,199
ice yes we

148
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:21,519
did there we go all right hold that go

149
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,520
the

150
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,240
rest

151
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,240
right it

152
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
nice

153
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,000
I think this one's pretty low to the

154
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,519
cost and this is how we wash our

155
00:08:53,919 --> 00:09:00,719
butts yes we're getting it all nice and

156
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:03,399
filled up use a ton of ice

157
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,240
and a wooden spoon the old school method

158
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,519
I haven't done this way in quite a while

159
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,639
uh I usually use the bubble now I think

160
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,759
we use the paddle we did use the paddle

161
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:16,078
on we use the paddle now we don't want

162
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,200
to leave this in the water for too long

163
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:20,319
so I'm just trying to reconstitued get

164
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,800
the buds like really worked in there so

165
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,399
they're not all floating up to the top

166
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,439
we have tons of ice in so what we'll do

167
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,720
is we'll probably work with two or three

168
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,399
spoons for there approximately 10

169
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,278
minutes 5 to 10 minutes and uh we'll

170
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,720
eventually once it gets a little more

171
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:41,480
mixed we'll be able to do a nice mix and

172
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,759
once again the ice is doing two jobs

173
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,519
keeping the water cold and knocking off

174
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,679
the glandular Tricom heads from their

175
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,000
citate

176
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:52,199
stocks so you can smell it it's just

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,200
absolutely aromatherapy yeah

178
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,200
aromatherapy is Right nice and

179
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,720
strong let's see what we got here the

180
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:05,000
best part about this is actually

181
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,240
uh watching my resin being stirred in

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,399
ice and water and knowing that great

183
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240
medicine that I'm going to get from the

184
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,799
end of the prodct is quite amazing which

185
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,159
of course you'll be seeing pictures with

186
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,159
Mar

187
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:20,519
do but uh we're getting that color

188
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,759
change in the ice already starting to

189
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,919
see the color change in the

190
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,278
water getting a little excit we got some

191
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,399
ice falling all over the flge as long as

192
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:32,039
it's not fun

193
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,879
oh the butts will be falling up and

194
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:36,759
ground get thrown back in at the blink

195
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:39,240
of an eye so if you blink you might miss

196
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,240
something

197
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,559
here all right we get a little bit more

198
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,799
melty so now there's more room to

199
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,239
actually

200
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:52,199
mix the material out we really want to

201
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,159
hear that ice bashing back and forth cuz

202
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,680
it's going to

203
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:58,360
be working those triom heads off there

204
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:00,319
and that River in the background is

205
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,440
actually giving us that incentive to

206
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,160
keep working wow is that it yeah let

207
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,160
bring it all

208
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:13,200
back what do you think H lovely lovely

209
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,959
out here on the side of a river and

210
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,480
Whistler perfect trying some lovely uh

211
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,479
give one of

212
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,159
those yeah so really beautiful Zone to

213
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,519
be making bubble in once again keep this

214
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,399
River coming

215
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,600
down I guess from Black

216
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,600
Tusk is that where

217
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,600
it's

218
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,000
tus really sweet it's a little bit

219
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,240
different from the bubble now of course

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,759
with the bubble now we get a better mix

221
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,919
I always noticed that with some of the

222
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,360
other runs that I've ran in the past and

223
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,240
stuff like that but uh I mean this is

224
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,360
old school method and uh this is the way

225
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,519
it all started right yeah absolutely the

226
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,079
old hand stirring you know first first

227
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,360
time I ever made it was with an actual

228
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:01,879
cake mixer and we used the use a little

229
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,560
cake mixer and then halfway down the way

230
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:05,439
we just sort of figured out you know

231
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,919
maybe gentler is better we took a

232
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,160
dashing it up too much and then we got

233
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,759
the spoon and I found the spoon was like

234
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,919
if you mixed it too little you didn't do

235
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,639
a good enough job if you mixed it too

236
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:16,919
hard you did too much of the job and it

237
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,480
was actually a little bit of a trick to

238
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,000
get the spoon mix perfect and that's

239
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,600
when I came out with the bubble now

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,360
where a friend of mine called me and

241
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,320
said you know to check these units out I

242
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,440
looked into them I used it a couple

243
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,680
times and I found that it basically made

244
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,079
like a perfect

245
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:36,000
hster batch every time a perfect hamster

246
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,879
batch every time but we got a perfect

247
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,839
hamster batch going on right here my

248
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,720
friend I'll take over whenever you're

249
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,320
ready

250
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,360
go best to uh just do like a minute or

251
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,360
two you know when you stay nice and

252
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,838
fresh of course the material after I

253
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,240
want to keep and I'm going to do the

254
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,360
second run with it we got a great amount

255
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,440
of ice in here I'll tell you that much

256
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,480
and me being at 0° right now it's almost

257
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,639
s in between guarantee everything's

258
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,000
staying nice and cold here which is

259
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,799
great we don't get that opportunity

260
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
to but actually you did uh up in uh

261
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,479
Delon there yeah I did a little bit of

262
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,759
this out in the snow this is obviously

263
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,480
more like my own backyard so it feels

264
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:23,120
pretty good I've I've played around in

265
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,680
here for 20 plus years on my dirt bike

266
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,000
you know just up the mountain on my

267
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:30,319
snowboard and sled just across these

268
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,720
streets so it's pretty neat to be off BL

269
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,800
whipping up a batch in the

270
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,800
playground are we still on record there

271
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:44,879
little flon in the top right cool good

272
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,879
to make sure good to make

273
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,239
sure it it's a little oh wow the smell

274
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,480
from na right now is just amazing I just

275
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,519
got the nicest whip give it a little

276
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,079
whip time

277
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:07,759
man himself he grew the resin he

278
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:07,758
isolated the heads and he loaded the

279
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:15,078
bowl nice

280
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,600
wow pass it over when you've got a good

281
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:20,519
amount I've got this R going minute or

282
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,159
two is good it's medicinal making your

283
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,639
own he who makes his own hash heals

284
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,639
himself

285
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:32,638
twice

286
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,639
take Dr that

287
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:39,319
res oh yeah that's the best part about

288
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:41,799
it love the golden color you got in

289
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,440
there okay I'm going to pass off the

290
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:45,439
steing stick here yeah

291
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,000
perfect why I like to use the bubble M

292
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:51,479
machine because my back and stuff like

293
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,839
that so it's actually a little bit more

294
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,440
convenient for me personally takes uh

295
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,839
takes the heavy work out of it because

296
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,199
this is really the only work that you're

297
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,680
doing is just mixing with the ice so if

298
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,000
you're having problems mixing get

299
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:06,319
yourself a bubble now and uh really

300
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,720
that's all the work that's needed in

301
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,320
making the fres fros than actually

302
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,040
growing the res but yeah and then of

303
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,079
course the drawing is really the tricky

304
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,360
part that's the part you want to watch

305
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:20,879
the videos over and over

306
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,839
again we talk about that a lot on the

307
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,000
water extraction and team dry shift on

308
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,680
Facebook yeah both of

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,759
those team dry shft obviously more for

310
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:35,399
Dr but uh drawing uh techniques water

311
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,919
extraction drawing techniques page on

312
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,720
Facebook we definitely talk a lot about

313
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:44,240
that so yeah water extractions and

314
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,160
drying techniques on Facebook is uh a

315
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,839
great place to learn and um also uh

316
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,958
understand your

317
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,959
medicine well I'm really glad we stopped

318
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:57,239
and did the batch oh yeah we we've been

319
00:15:53,958 --> 00:16:00,599
trying to do this let me

320
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,600
see good

321
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,360
I'm going to have a seat here and

322
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,959
uh to stir the medicine up when you're

323
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,919
doing a hand stir generally I'll always

324
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:16,958
do it for more than 2 or 3 minutes you

325
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,198
know I'll do like 5 to 8 even 10 minutes

326
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,359
because you notice when we're hand

327
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:24,198
stirring the stirring happens for a bit

328
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,879
and we stop and pass the spoon that that

329
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:27,159
that time doesn't count the way it does

330
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,519
in a washing machine when it's

331
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,519
constantly mixing it back and forth

332
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:38,759
looks great break his butt up here sof

446
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,000
won't be the end of the world I'm going

447
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,278
to pull the 120 and possibly uh pass it

448
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,079
over to John do we have another bucket

449
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:14,880
that has to be hung that b and that

450
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,639
bucket has to be taken out cuz we need

451
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,640
it ideally for future references we

452
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,679
don't want to put the bucket on the

453
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,640
dirty

454
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:26,640
ground because it may

455
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,559
contaminate the bag bag could you open

456
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,520
the box wait be to do with passing it

457
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:36,119
that here get it on the

458
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,720
spoon perfect pass it over to John I get

459
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:41,119
you to hang that one over by the blue

460
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,640
bag that's good yeah that's

461
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,959
great that one I'll take this

462
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,320
one oh yeah we're working together we've

463
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,360
never actually the three of us made

464
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,720
bubble together but it's not a super

465
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,879
overly complex process the important

466
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,360
part is that you rinse a bag in water

467
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,559
after you've made bubble with it and

468
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:00,839
then you hang it so each of these bags

469
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,240
will be cleaned in water there's a

470
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:04,079
little water right here we might be able

471
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,278
to pour some of that on there you might

472
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,558
be able to dip it right there in the

473
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:10,679
puddle this one yeah right on the top of

474
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:12,158
that puddle kind of give it a little dip

475
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:14,320
it's very important to clean the bags

476
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,840
immediately after using them we are in a

477
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,000
colder environment so we've got that

478
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,918
working in our favor there's not going

479
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,919
to be uh if it was really warm the

480
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,360
bubble would melt fast on the bags when

481
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,880
you took it out this 120 looks amazing

482
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,879
like unbelievable

483

00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:20,319
90 you should be it's slow

498
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,678
draining I just want to keep it open

499
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,678
there we

500
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:32,879
go

501
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:36,120
all right all right 90 coming up nice

502
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,640
and slow draining looks white like the

503
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,639
color of the

504
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,079
screen look at

505
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,200
that always nice to have a little bucket

506
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,759
like this to be able to flip your

507
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:01,120
product Inside Out

508
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,119
wow the color look at the color on

509
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,240

510
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,240
off hean it up like this scoop

513
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,640
hes we still

514
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:27,960
recording man I'll tell you bubble hash

515
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,759
making is inspiring it's so something

516
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,558
that you don't have to do inside a

517
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,158
shitty basement or or down in inside

518
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,200
your house anywhere you can get out and

519
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,720
actually do this in nature you know this

520
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,960
is something that's kind of nature

521
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,440
friendly I'm sure if people drove by

522
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,079
right now not that there's really many

523
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,640
places to drive by they might be

524
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,960
concerned as to what we were doing but

525
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,600
upon quick examination of the situation

526
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,960
and the safety of of it all

527
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:58,398
youin we're going to rinse this one in

528
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,960
the 73 just a little bit quick collect

529
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:02,839
any of those lost resin heads and then

530
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,960
we'll get them to rinse it in the we're

531
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:07,359
actually using Glacier puddle water just

532
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,759
here on the side of the uh on the side

533
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,759
of the mountain 73

534
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:21,038
time you know how to make that

535
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,600
water yes many many hundreds of

536
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,599
batches we'll do

537
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,399
that wow I love the size of these

538
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,640
buckets these these are real great

539
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:33,398
buckets I'm going to going to start

540
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,038
promoting these for sure these are

541
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:37,678
working great how's ice cream and

542
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:41,158
Whistler yeah perfect Cow's Ice Cream

543
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,159
little bit of foam no problem there we

544
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,519
go

545
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,399
there nice I'll tell you quality resin

546
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,798
cleans up like you can still get the

547
00:26:51,398 --> 00:27:00,398
last little bits guaranteed and one

548
00:26:54,798 --> 00:27:00,398
more perfect and it's already hard on

549
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,679
the two more bags we got the 45 and the

550
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:10,038
25 these are slow draining bags unless

551
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,679
you know the technique then they're

552
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:12,679
quick draining

553
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:30,199
bags always inspired to make some lovely

554
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:34,880
bubble oh s right as always the 45 has

555
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:39,000
painted the entire screen covered

556
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,000
it how's that for a

557
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,740
yield All Right Scoop It Up From The

558
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:47,689
Bottom yeah

559
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,690
[Music]

560
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:56,179
exactly lastes

561
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,180
[Music]

562
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,480
here wow beautiful smelling raspber for

563
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,839
sir one more bag the 25 micron over

564
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,480
we're not going to be drying it here

565
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,639
we're going to take it freeze Our

566
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,960
Patties that we get and we'll be taking

567
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:15,720
them back uh either to John's or to

568
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Phils and uh powderize them into boxes

569
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,558
and getting them ready for the dry the

570
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,480
desicant wicking out the hash uh the

571
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,440
moisture from the outside of the hash

572
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,200
allowing the glandular triome head to be

573
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,440
dry in which case now you can cure the

574
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,000
head let it shrivel up like a raisin and

575
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,558
let that wax membrane dehydrate all

576
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,558
right keep that in

577
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,038
there those go perfect that'll be a

578
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:43,200
quick rinse 25

579
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,558
micron and I'll tell you make a bubble

580
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,798
with three guys is nice and quick whip

581
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,798
this batch off and no time

582
00:28:53,759 --> 00:29:00,000
flat quick technique with the 25 micron

583
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,519
I lift it up real quick lifting the

584
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,839
resin off the screen and allowing the

585
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,880
water to rush

586
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:08,079
through that uh makes for a much quicker

587
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,679
drain than what some of you guys have

588
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,798
done in the past I've heard some funny

589
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,278
stories of people telling me how long

590
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:18,038
their 25 micron bag took to dry or drain

591
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:20,440
yeah I heard 36 hours

592
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:22,200
yeah yeah that'll happen with quality

593
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,120
resin like

594
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,759
this 25 micron still a little bit of

595
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:30,839
water but with this technique of lifting

596
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,879
the bucket seems to suck the water out

597
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:35,158
as

598
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,159
well we

599
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,240
go got another screen to put that on

600
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,480
baby screen

601
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,278
here and that's pass me a

602
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,519
spoon just a stainless steel spoon and

603
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:56,798
once again if you could get

604
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:58,798
out John's having a hard time getting

605
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,398
that one today today we're wearing these

606
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,440
big jackets and if we turn our backs to

607
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,278
the camera the whole screen already

608
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,640
taken there's really no that right now

609
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,159
just working it it'll be fine I know

610
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,720
look at that that's a that's a dirty

611
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:14,559
little looking see your chest oh no

612
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,120
problem we'll get a spot for no I don't

613
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,480
want that contaminating all that Beau

614
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:19,558
this isn't contaminating and it won't

615
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,120
touch any of that if you have trust in

616
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:23,119
the guy that showed you how to do this

617
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,000
it's guide knows how to do it I'm going

618
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,678
to do it right now I'm just working the

619
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,839
resin over top of the screen and getting

620
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:31,080
it a little thi ther because right now

621
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:33,359
it's quite quite a bit of it as foam

622
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,798
it's not actual bubble it's taking up

623
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:39,918
more space than it needs

624
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:42,759
to so hands running into my perfect

625
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,240
7390 we won't have it it's not going to

626
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,480
happen we will not have it and we're

627
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,440
actually getting a natural rain spray

628
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,558
that's falling down on top of this a

629
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:55,960
little bit of snow got a little bit of

630
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:59,038
snow very nice very nice okay here we go

00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:01,960
putting it anywhere over

633
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:06,199
there I have a second pressing screen

634
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:09,398
we're going to push down on top of this

635
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,919
stren therefore there will be zero

636
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:15,798
contamination see this is why we got to

637
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,799
listen to the guy all right no

638
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
