I'm doing good man long time no see yeah

22
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,199
so how long was the asur Hiatus I didn't

23
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,359
uh you know it was just under a year a

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,600
all right it was just under a year you

25
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,399
know it's been uh it's it's hash church

26
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:02,879
when it started it was this unque sort

27
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,399
of timeline where we were all so excited

28
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,839
to to Really share everything we were

29
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,239
doing and then all of a sudden this

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,759
legal system came into play and people

31
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,520
became more protective of their IPs and

32
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,878
of the things they were sharing and it

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,400
just seemed like everyone was kind of

34
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,639
going their own separate ways it seemed

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,400
like a very natural Hiatus I kind of

36
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,639
thought someone would pick it up and

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,439
take it over and there would be still

38
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,318
places for people to gather and Kyle

39
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,239
kushman has has done a good job and

40
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:30,759
there's a few others that have that are

41
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,080
that are pretty impressive but I just

42
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,479
kind of felt like you know what I think

43
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,640
uh we need to be we need to be doing

44
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:40,878
this again time to get back together

45
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:45,039
yeah exactly so I think right now what's

46
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:47,959
happened is the zoom link changed and

47
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:51,079
now I've got to send it out again to

48
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,519
everyone I just sent an email ah there's

49
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,360

00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,840
the Senate and doing all this wild stuff

53
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,080
I've seen you've been doing oh yeah we

54
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,920
we've been active on the haven't taken

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,280
our eye off the Cannabis front but I've

56
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,518
just been a little less vocal lately so

57
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,239
uh it's good to get on here we'll share

58
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,239
you you know share everything we're

59
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:21,719
doing the co stuff was a was a you know

60
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,080
a big deep dive but had to be done I

61
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,519
appreciated it personally you know I um

62
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,879
I particularly appreciate it I had a

63
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,200
really good conversation with my mother

64
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,639
about it the other day in regards to I

65
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,079
just like the conversation to be open on

66
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:36,359
both ends that's all just a dialogue not

67
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,959
kind of stunting one side of the

68
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,439
conversation just let people have the

69
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:44,280
dialogue they're very good at polarizing

70
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:46,519
people so that is their art and uh it

71
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,560
unfortunately certainly hit our

72
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,158
field yeah I was goingon to say You must

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,479

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,640
Puerto Rico huh yeah yeah yeah how crazy

77
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,839
that that's going to intersect right

78
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,759
yeah I didn't know you're down there so

79
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,400
you you're doing some work down in uh in

80
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:14,078
the Ireland yeah I I I uh I consult with

81
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,560
uh with prit biotech they're the largest

82
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:19,759
producer down there and you know it's

83
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,319
it's you know it's a limited market it's

84
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,120
only medical you know yeah a limited

85
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:28,079
market but

86
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,759
um uh you know I

87
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,240
it's you know what the say they you go

88
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,120
down there and say oh you guys want to

89
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,879
become a state and they're like no no no

90
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,759
no we like being a US Territory because

91
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,759
there's all kinds of tax incentive to do

92
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,800
manufacturing down there and the

93
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:49,759
pharmaceutical companies have been down

94
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:53,720
there uh for you know 60 or 80 years so

95
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,240
like you know there's huge manufacturing

96
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,360
facilities for everything from over to

97
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,519
counter to injectables to everything and

98
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,400
uh so there's these huge facilities

99
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,240
there and the facility that they're in

100
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:10,239
right there they used to make a leave or

101
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,478
something it was old J&amp;J facility but uh

102
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,639
it's it's huge it's the largest indoor

103
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:20,318
uh facility that I've I've ever seen um

104
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,600
but um yeah I mean all the challenges of

105
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,160
just being down there just like supply

106
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,400
chain issues and you know like they get

107
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,439
hit when the hurricane comes in it

108
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:32,918
basically knocks out like power to half

109
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:35,000
the island so they have their own

110
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:38,839
substation like right there because they

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,240
have so much power online and everything

112
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,198
but yeah our guy John car Yan Carlos

113
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,960
bile is down there as their Chief

114
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,759
Operating Officer and um we connected

115
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:53,478
Kevin with a guy named Sam

116
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,280
hinar okay is that his name oh Sam from

117
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,279
from

118
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:59,719
MDC yeah so he's gonna we're gonna

119
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,478
connect and make sure that there's you

120
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,280
know facility tours and maybe you know I

121
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,719
don't know it's all it's medical down

122
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,638
there and they do reciprocate so if you

123
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,880
have like a a patient license from a

124
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,720
state you can get stuff into Puerto Rico

125
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:19,560
uh dispensaries but

126
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,120
uh or what's there is there a w timeline

127
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,720
on the island or they uh I think there

128
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,240
is but there's kind of like wanting to I

129
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,919
you know I my buddy was telling me

130
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,000
before I went down to Puerto Rico goes

131
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,758
yeah it's just all Wise Guys and Pirates

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,759
down there it's man it's crazy I mean

133
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,800
there's kind of been kind of like a I

134
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,598
would say a legacy Market there for any

135
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,560
drug you could possibly imagine it's the

136
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:48,240
Caribbean man I mean it's like it's all

137
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,478
tourism dollars and San Juan is

138
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,079
beautiful and Old San Juan is just

139
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,639
absolutely just like you know just

140
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:58,359
beautiful I mean cobblestone streets

141
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,000
just Empanada stands on the corner I

142
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,879
mean just it rich with with that type of

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,598
Mediterranean history and you guys are

144
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:07,879
having your gig so what we're talking

145
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,639
about here is canmed

146
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,560
20125 Right am I right 2025 [ __ ] holy

147
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,759
[ __ ] we're a quarter of the way through

148
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,478
the century caned 2025 is going to be

149
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,598
down in Puerto Rico what's the name of

150
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,000
the resort it's the Windam Resort right

151
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:24,959
it is yeah yes it's Windam it's kind of

152
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,519
out on the Eastern end Northeastern end

153
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:31,038
of the Island right right so it's Mark I

154
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,560
think p is probably one of the best

155
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,639
events that no one in our industry

156
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,879
really focuses on and they should

157
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,038
because of the impact it can make in

158
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,520
terms of innovation and who's doing the

159
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:44,478
real work and I think that's one of the

160
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,959
biggest takeaways that I've I've learned

161
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,839
from what Kevin and his team's put

162
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,839
together and you know I I really need to

163
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,478
get down there Kevin to to participate

164
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:55,959
with you Rico's time baby come on down

165
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,038
you know I missed my opportunity to

166
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,120
create an abstract for you guys but I I

167
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:03,439
think I'd like to do that in the future

168
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,759
to to Really to par send one in for 25

169
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sure there's I'm sure the windows

170
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,680
still open it's just you know life is is

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,918
happening around me so only so much I

172
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,158
can only so many hours in a day but uh

173
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:16,959
but yeah I I I'd love to see Mark you

174
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:18,319
put together in abstract to be honest

175
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,158
and and speak on the work that you've

176
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,879
been doing um well I mean there's just

177
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:25,319
there's there's so much to talk about I

178
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,280
mean it's like and that audience I mean

179
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,800
Kevin you remember like I came and

180
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:32,439
talked there and you were at the first

181
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,440
one wen't you I think he walked

182
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,838
into it was 2017 right because you guys

183
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,158
did

184
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:44,839
2016 and Mulan came to that one right

185
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:46,720
was it yes rafy so rafy just phoned in

186
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,640
for mine because I don't think he was

187
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,519
feeling well or he wasn't traveling or

188
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,278
but you guys have had this connection

189
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,000
with rfie you should talk about that

190
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:59,799
Kevin because as you know I mean he

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,958
inspired me and everything that I I've

192
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:05,879
done since I've been doing chemistry in

193
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,399
cannabis is all just because being

194
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,879
acquainted with everything that Rafi and

195
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,759
all the researchers that came before

196
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,879
Rafi you know like Adams and and I just

197
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,399
everyone was fascinated in the chemistry

198
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,958
of this plan it just didn't happen when

199
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,559
Rafi came in but you know to have that

200
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:28,199
connection and for him to inspire new

201
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:30,639
generations of scientists to get in like

202
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,800
now when you go to the icr s it's mostly

203
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:37,439
not phyto canabo it's all Endo more

204
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:39,319
endoc canabo than phyto canabo but I

205
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,399
think the great thing about canmat is it

206
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:45,120
kind of brings the phyto and the Endo

207
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,600
communities together and looks for the

208
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,519
obvious intersection which is is there

209
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:55,040
therapeutic use and having people like

210
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,639
Bonnie and um all those other doctors

211
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,879
that you guys have signed up actually

212
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:03,559
show real world results I mean here is

213
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,639
the tumor before here's the tumor after

214
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:09,479
any questions I mean holy [ __ ] you guys

215
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,159
have had it at canmed and so I came

216
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,200
there in 2017 that's when you guys were

217
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:18,799
still doing this at um at Harvard

218
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,079
Medical School right and uh held up a

219
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,039
vial of

220
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:26,078
hhc and told a group of medical doctors

221
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,958
that I dabbed it oh my God this won't

222
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,159
trigger a piss test what the [ __ ] and

223
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:34,559
this was years before so this was

224
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:36,838
basically a year before the farm bill

225
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:41,199
right and a year before the whole Delta

226
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:43,959
8 yeah hhc alphabet soup of canono sort

227
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,120
of exploded onto the scene so man just

228
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:49,559
in a short period of time we've seen a

229
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,078
real big transition in the industry and

230
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,319
Canad you guys have been covering it all

231
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,000
along it's great man it's great venue

232
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,079
yeah rafie was if there's one word to

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,600
sum him up it's generous I mean he just

234
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:03,159
gave everyone time and uh he was not a

235
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,159
divisive individual you know he'd listen

236
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:08,519
to anybody and and and welcome anybody

237
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:10,159
so he was just very um unifying voice

238
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,480
that will be sorely

239
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:16,439
missed so very uh yeah we're saddened by

240
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,959
his uh his departure but um yeah those

241
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,440
were that was interesting times I mean I

242
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,359
I remember your your your talk

243
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,480
specifically because it was uh you

244
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,000
brought in that vial of hhc and showed

245
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,278
it to everyone in the

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,039
audience yes yeah and um only at Harvard

247
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:33,240
Med school with that fly

248
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,319
well I but I I think it it was kind of

249
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,919
like the writing on the wall and then

250
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:43,920
the the the uh you know this hemp thing

251
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:47,078
now is is taking over the regulated

252
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,919
cannabis markets right I mean I I don't

253
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:51,679
know do do you guys not see that I mean

254
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:56,078
it seems like all these big Multistate

255
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:58,799
operators now like even Moana now has a

256
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:01,638
has a has a has a hemp Drive play so I

257
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,559
mean I don't know I mean what you yeah

258
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,560
it's great I saved you something from a

259
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:09,119
uh a CBD dispensary let me see if you

260
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,399
can see it I thought you'd get a kick

261
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,399
out of

262
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:17,359
that yeah well I mean and is that stuff

263
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:20,838
safe to eat I don't know who the [ __ ]

264
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,360
knows right yeah don't know um I'm sure

265
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,120
it didn't come from the flower as Mark

266
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,600
will tell you but um someone's been

267
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,399
someone's been spraying it on but you

268
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,480
know so how do you compete with an $8

269
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,360
vape pen at the gas station when the

270
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,920
dispensary wants 40 or 50 bucks right

271
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:43,759
you just there's no I right I mean what

272
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:46,240
the [ __ ] how do we fix this yeah I think

273
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,958
it Mark I think it goes back to policy

274
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,560
and the lack of understanding as to what

275
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,399
these constituents and chemical

276
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,838
compounds are actually doing to you know

277
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,559
any single consumer at any given time

278
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,000
and based on the extraction method as

279
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:02,479
you've kind of BL blatantly and simply

280
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,278
pointed out we don't really have a

281
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,759
clean Fair way to to show transparency

282
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:09,879
through the whole process and if it is

283
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,759
transparency you're showing all the dirt

284
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,000
and you're showing all the bad that you

285
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,559
know in Disguise of good right people

286
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,839
are going in for wellness and coming out

287
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:21,919
with different problems based off of

288
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,920
chemistry that is bad chemistry you know

289
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,958
and is it clean and how are those

290
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,319
constituents going to affect a human in

291
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:30,078
10 years yeah let the plant do the

292
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,000
chemistry and harvest the heads I mean

293
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:35,599
my God if everybody could have Cubans

294
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,759
white sift hash we wouldn't need all

295
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,000
these other right I mean what the [ __ ]

296
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,000
right and it's kind of like you know

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,759
again I've said this a bunch of times

298
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,240
booting on hash church as long as

299
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:51,439
there's prohibition anywhere there'll be

300
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,839
a black market everywhere and so you

301
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:59,120
even look at just just I I I I don't

302
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,759
know I mean the compression of margins

303
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,000
along the supply chain has basically

304
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:09,480
weeded out like a lot of people who

305
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,559
cannot compete with uh THC that's made

306
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,159
an order of magnitude cheaper than you

307
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:16,838
can grow it for I mean you just there

308
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,039
there's no competition you cannot

309
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:21,759
compete it it's a race to the bottom and

310
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,639
in a commoditized market price will

311
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,720
always win so it's [ __ ] up I don't

312
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,399
know how we can get this changed it's an

313
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,160
interesting there's there's some

314
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,600
interesting studies in California about

315
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,319
you know pesticides that are that

316
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,079
they're finding right so I think the LA

317
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,000
Times study came out showing this I

318
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:42,239
spoke to the journalist there I think um

319
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,759
paig St John is her name uh and uh it's

320
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,120
interesting that there like they did

321
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:49,519
this study in Canada where they looked

322
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,919
at 327 pesticides that um which is a

323
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,600
large panel for pesticides they're

324
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,000
trying to capture pesticides that are

325
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,399
outside of the the demanded testing

326
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,078
regimen um and they found like 92% of

327
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,039
the black market Market Flower up there

328
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:04,319
was uh was Laden with pesticide

329
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,360
sometimes a thousand times over the

330
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,519
limits and then only like 6% positivity

331
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,639
in the tested Market prior to Canada

332
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,078
going legal that number was more like

333
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:17,639
30% um so it looks like what's happening

334
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,919
up there is the the the the actual legal

335
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,680
Market's going down because they're

336
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,838
testing in terms of pesticides but the

337
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,399
black Market's going up so it's like The

338
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,399
Dumping Ground for everything that fails

339
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,278
but when Paige was doing this work in in

340
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,480
California

341
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,679
um it was a it's a bit different outcome

342
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,959
they're finding pens that are in the

343
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,679
Black Market that don't have any

344
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,518
pesticides probably because they're

345
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:41,879
chemically

346
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,679
synthesized uh and so um it's it brings

347
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,278
in a whole another you know or they're

348
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,278
synthetic cannabinoids right so it

349
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,000
brings in a whole another set of tests

350
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,639
they got to look for on the black market

351
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,399
pens um to assess safety they're they're

352
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,000
sometimes finding thcp in them they're

353
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,318
finding all of these bizarre canabo and

354
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,600
of course since they're synthetic

355
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:00,879
they're not they're not necessarily

356
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,040
coming along with a a high a high

357
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,439
pesticide content I I have to agree um

358
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,559
I've just seen so much stuff in the

359
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,360
legal market and transitioning from the

360
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,719
black market and like stuff that I think

361
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,079
a lot of people even aware of it that

362
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,800
they even have it in there because it's

363
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,638
systemically in their plant when their

364
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:21,958
or clones when the Clones that they got

365
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,159
and it's a big problem I agree yeah

366
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,359
sometimes it'll rich in the extraction

367
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:28,078
too I think Ethan Russo um showed that

368
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,039
that some of these pesticides really um

369
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,719
you know you might go from 20 to 80% on

370
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:33,480
the cannabinoids but the pesticides can

371
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,959
go from parts per million to parts per

372
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,680
thousand uh so the the extraction

373
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,879
process from flow is is different you

374
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,879
know I was under the impression most of

375
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,879
the Delta eight out there was made from

376
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:47,919
almost Crystal at CBD which should be

377
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:50,639
fairly pure yeah but yeah that's right

378
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,078
so those those pens ironically uh some

379
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,519
of them are going to be cleaner than um

380
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,838
I shouldn't say cleaner they're they're

381
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,440
less pesticide Laden than what you might

382
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,160
find in the in the legal Market but God

383
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,680
knows what hell's in them they may not

384
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,798
be Delta may may not even be Delta eight

385
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:07,879
they could be you know some of these

386
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,720
well yeah chrisal was like laughing at

387
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,559
me he was like saying he goes yeah you

388
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,279
look at like all this stuff that's being

389
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:16,519
tested for pesticides and it came out of

390
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,078
a chemical reaction vessel where there

391
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:22,078
AR pesticides and hopefully you're using

392
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:25,119
yeah cheap CBD isolate that's pretty

393
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:28,000
pure and if there are any Trace Amounts

394
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,839
of pesticides in there you hope that in

395
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,079
the process of distillation or whatever

396
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,439
purification process they're using

397
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:38,558
they're able to to get rid of those

398
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,240
things well but I I I think that the the

399
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:44,359
the the problem I think is is bigger

400
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:48,640
which is that all this regulation that's

401
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:51,359
required you do licensed production of

402
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,000
cannabis so you have to have your your

403
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,479
in some cases even your business pro for

404
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,119
of vetted by all these Regulators in the

405
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,319
state who want to make sure that you

406
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,798
know how to run a profitable business

407
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,798
right you have to do all kinds of

408
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:08,000
community outreach you have to make sure

409
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:10,400
that your [ __ ] is Zone correctly you

410
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,480
have to do FBI background checks the

411
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,519
hemp industry doesn't have to do any of

412
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,319
this right they don't have to do any all

413
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:20,480
they have to do is basically take bulk

414
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:22,918
biomass produce ingredients or just have

415
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,679
like a warehouse that buys those

416
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,280
ingredients until you can pull in you

417
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,000
know all the the miners are all

418
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:34,960
available isolate form some of those are

419
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,558
chemical synthesized but Kevin the uh um

420
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,519
the high CBG a varieties that are out

421
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:44,960
there right now have basically cratered

422
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:47,440
the price of cbga isolate CBG isolates

423
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,600
you see a lot of you know just products

424
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,558
with CVG in it like seltzers sodas

425
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:56,199
gummies all kinds of stuff so the the

426
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:57,158
hemp Bill remember that they didn't they

427
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,480
didn't

428
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:01,760
contemplate what was going to happened

429
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,880
after the hemp was Harvest because that

430
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,640
should be regulated by the Food and Drug

431
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,039
Administration right and you can't just

432
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,159
put CBD into a

433
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:14,919
food because that's in violation of the

434
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,039
food drug and cosmetic act right so they

435
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:20,440
never contemplated the whole CBD

436
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:23,440
business let alone CBN CBG all the other

437
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,000
alphabet soup and now you all these

438
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,000
crazy molecules which don't come from

439
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,480
CBD or hemp at all that are just being

440
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,119
synthesized right like hhcp and all that

441
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,679
of [ __ ] and now they're finding that THC

442
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:41,079
acetate generates Keen when you heat it

443
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,919
up on the mail so just all kinds of

444
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,119
crazy I think all of this regulatory

445
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,240
overhead is theater at the moment

446
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,399
because they're not policing it right

447
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,839
right yeah yep not at all if they don't

448
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,320
police it then they're just putting

449
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,959
they're raising the price of the legal

450
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,319
Market next to the black market and um

451
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,038
and then and all the business that are

452
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:00,480
in the legal Arena have like two hands

453
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,079
tied behind their back they they can't

454
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,558
write off their business expenses due to

455
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,960
28e they have to build facilities in

456
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,599
every state because they can't move

457
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,720
product across state lines I mean it's

458
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,639
it's just a they can't get banking right

459
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,600
like it's just a disaster for them

460
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,120
economically but they're collecting all

461
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:19,158
of this tax stuff to to float that side

462
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:20,239
of the image of of the regulatory Market

463
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,320
um but they're not running around

464
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,839
policing any of the lab testing so like

465
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,240
if they the lab testing is what's

466
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,678
supposed to detect the stuff and

467
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,279
differentiate it um I think we all as a

468
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,440
community have to pound on them to to

469
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,399
get that data public and and let the

470
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,440
policing happen uh real time because

471
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,720
having the right now what's happening um

472
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,759
I so I've been diving into this a little

473
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,440
bit with lab shopping and and uh this is

474
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,960
because of a talk at canmet this year

475
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,720
from Yasha Khan he showed some data

476
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,600
showing all the THC lab shopping and

477
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,240
some data on on like Houston mold lab

478
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,839
shopping that's going on uh and it's

479
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,120
clear that a lot of states have this

480
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,720
data showing that there are labs and

481
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,519
states that like pass everything and

482
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,558
they've been doing it for years and they

483
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:02,158
don't they don't act

484
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:04,038
um and so all the grows get painted into

485
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,120
an economic corner and end up having to

486
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:08,200
test with the labs that pass everything

487
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:09,719
and give them higher THC numbers and

488
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,558
then all the legitimate Labs like

489
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,839
Chris's lab and others you know

490
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:17,440
financially struggle uh and get squeezed

491
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,359
out of the marketplace so it's h yeah

492
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,840
Alex has a taste on this I'm

493
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:28,798
sure speaking of lab morning everybody

494
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:30,480
um see yeah likewise likewise well thank

495
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,278
you yeah I just wanted to jump in you

496
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,240
know we were part of the LA Times Expose

497
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:37,119
and it's incredibly uh revealing

498
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,359
obviously and you know there's a bunch

499
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,719
of things to kind of hit on there I

500
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:43,439
won't uh kind of go deep on it but um

501
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,600
you know one thing I wanted to hit on

502
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,200
kind of part of this conversation is you

503
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,000
know when when a state

504
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,798
puts uh testing regulations in place

505
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,319
that kind of essentially makes testing

506
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:55,839
the final check in the Integrity of the

507
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:57,639
supply chain and if there's no Integrity

508
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,240
in that because the state's not overly

509
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:03,200
regulating and Audi Labs then yeah it

510
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,400
creates these holes where everything

511
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,440
goes through you know whether that's you

512
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,720
know I mean it's it's been really sad

513
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,080
like uh up until you know I mean

514
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,600
California sitting on their hand

515
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,599
effectively and not doing anything The

516
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:17,079
Regulators to actually enforce and

517
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,480
ensure integrity and testing over

518
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:21,599
fiveyear period of legalization it's all

519
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,558
but destroyed the entire market and led

520
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,639
to the extinction level event that a lot

521
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:29,119
of uh small craft farmers and people

522
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,759
have gone through you know um because at

523
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,239
a certain point you know there becomes

524
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,759
an economic disincentive for people to

525
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,519
want to work with a good lab that's

526
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:38,440
going to give them accurate quality

527
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:41,158
repeatable data because they can just

528
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,440
chase the 50% flower literally we see

529
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,799
that it's been a huge thing whenever

530
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,919
we're publishing something at 26 and

531
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:51,440
it's 48% from this other lab why work

532
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:53,360
with us right whenever you that same lab

533
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,600
can p will pass you and never fail a

534
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:58,558
test for ASP Gillis pesticides whatever

535
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,759
it is you know why chance it with us

536
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:01,240
right so there's there becomes this

537
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,519
disincentive to even want to work with a

538
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,480
good lab you know but you know thank Jah

539
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:08,558
um you know by the beginning of this

540
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,640
year you know the state you know there

541
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,720
was a big shift you know the state lab

542
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,159
came online they have one down SoCal

543
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,798
that we're working with the University

544
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,600
of San Diego one up in Hayward or in the

545
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,480
Bay

546
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,158
Area um and if you've been tracking the

547
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,880
news you know there's been more recalls

548
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,799
this year than there's been in the last

549
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,520
five years combined you know and if if

550
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:29,839
you've kind of tracked you know it's

551
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,359
really been around po labeling inflated

552
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,639
potency as well as for asper Gillis

553
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:34,519
right it hasn't been about pesticides

554
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,200
because they haven't had those

555
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:40,038
capabilities internally um but but you

556
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,278
know essentially now that this is kind

557
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:44,480
of you know because and I think that's

558
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:46,159
one of the big things that you know the

559
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,720
hope of California regulation was going

560
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,720
to help button up you know learning

561
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,240
lessons from previous States mistakes

562
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,558
you know to have a comprehensive lab

563
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,000
program to test the testers to do the

564
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,639
secret shopping pulling the products off

565
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,119
shelves testing the product you you know

566
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,480
and kind of making sure that there's

567
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,439
Integrity to the testing side of things

568
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,960
and so that wasn't a thing for you know

569
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,759
the last four years this year it's been

570
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,919
a thing you know and then when the LA

571
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,759
Times expose they dropped you know kind

572
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:12,320
of that was after California you know

573
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:15,400
Department of cannabis control kind of

574
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:17,839
had a $5 million campaign to you know

575
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,919
kind of propaganda around why the legal

576
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,639
Market's so great and everything's you

577
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,840
know clean compared to the black market

578
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,480
but then boom the LA Times expose

579
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,879
dropped and really kind of showed you

580
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,558
know because when Paige St John reached

581
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,200
out to us in February early year you

582
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:34,839
know she was kind of writing the story

583
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,440
about how um it was an expose on how uh

584
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:39,079
California Regulators failing to do

585
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,720
their job and enact what's in the what

586
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:44,000
was in the regulations to kind of create

587
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,519
a state run lab that's secret shopping

588
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,839
testing the testers uh but the fact that

589
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:51,000
they hadn't done that let um basically

590
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,240
LED um the point of the article was

591
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,798
around how failed Regulators not doing

592
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,480
their job um to enact this has led to a

593
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,558
compromise public health and consumer

594
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,240
safety at the retail level and so they

595
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,480
went and bought 70 something Products

596
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,399
off shelves they fully anonymized all

597
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,558
the products um you know took flower out

598
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:11,038
of packaging gummies out of packaging

599
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:13,359
cartridges out of packaging they

600
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,960
anonymized whatever logos on the

601
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,759
cartridges and then they split the

602
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,079
samples sent half to us half in Resco

603
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,038
and San Francisco on Resco and is is

604
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:24,720
often the lab that we get compared to

605
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,879
whenever people have questions to

606
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,839
confirm pesticide data we have very

607
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,240
comparable tests

608
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:32,720
um and so the only thing that they

609
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,079
published in the LA Times expose is what

610
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,319
was double blind confirmed between us

611
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:41,199
and en Resco and so you know it was

612
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:44,519
really in really fascinating because you

613
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,880
know flower had 30% fail rate or so you

614
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:50,278
know kind of it was really for you know

615
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,080
you saw chlorop fenip Pyon butoxide pyin

616
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:55,440
bifenthrin those are all bug bomb

617
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:56,960
aerosol pesticides insecticides yeah

618
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,640
yeah well and they're insecticides but

619
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,558
more so they're these total least

620
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,720
Foggers you know and there's been this

621
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,240
thing like because I used to be in the

622
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,360
Hydroponics industry before we opened

623
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,839
scabs 15 years

624
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:13,359
ago and um and whenever we whenever um

625
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,879
whenever uh I was in the hydro store

626
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,599
there was this very common practice in

627
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,520
cultivation where in between harvests

628
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,359
and indoor Farms people used to

629
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,839
basically sterilize their rooms you know

630
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:26,359
by they'd spray their walls scrub their

631
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:28,359
tables do whatever with service

632
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:31,199
sanitation agents but then they would

633
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:33,079
take these 10,000 ft Greenhouse Foggers

634
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,120
they would light them off in 500 to

635
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:38,599
th000 Ft rooms um that are made out of

636
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:40,798
sheetrock and drywall and they would

637
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:43,199
basically total release fog these bug

638
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:45,000
bombs that permeates every surface area

639
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,240
of that space and it sucks into and

640
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,679
absorbs into the drywall and sheetrock

641
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,000
and then it sits around and then the

642
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,120
next Harvest they do it and the next

643
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,480
Harvest they do it and essentially there

644
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:57,000
becomes this like contamination um hyper

645
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,919
contamination factor that builds into

646
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,319
the sheetrock and drywall you can test

647
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,480
the drywall in like huge part per

648
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,798
million levels and what happens is every

649
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,640
time that you know temperature humidity

650
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:11,200
differentials you know hit Peak you know

651
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,799
whatever levels there's this off gasing

652
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,240
that happens years after its original

653
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,398
use so whenever anytime we see like

654
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,798
because we do a lot of root cause

655
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:21,918
analysis forensic investigations when

656
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,960
people fail and you know um it's there's

657
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,759
a huge kind of correlation to you see

658
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,480
you see if you see like chlorop py oxide

659
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:30,519
pyin

660
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,200
banthine you know there there's are

661
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:34,558
three different bug bombs and there's a

662
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,919
you know when we see that you know you

663
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,759
could guarantee it's an indoor

664
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,480
cultivation where these bombs were

665
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,798
dropped and people might not even have

666
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,278
used them for the last year or so um but

667
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:45,720
it's still showing up you know so that

668
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,798
was one thing and then you know but the

669
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,519
more damning kind of I think realization

670
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:52,639
from it was around cartridges right and

671
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,919
uh and in some of the worst example the

672
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,399
cartridges had like a 65% fail rate and

673
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:58,799
in some of the cartridges there was 10

674
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:02,119
to 20 pesticides detectable

675
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:05,079
um quantifiable and 10 of those were in

676
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:08,798
failing levels a lot of them were 100 to

677
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:10,960
thousand time levels you know like uh

678
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,639
you know so was and and you don't see

679
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,038
that no Farmers spraying that many

680
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,840
pesticides those types of concentrations

681
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:20,038
you know that's 100% indicative of

682
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,319
closed loop extraction processes you

683
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:24,119
know whether it's butane extraction

684
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,960
whether it's CO2 whether it's

685
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,798
distillation you know like the people

686
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,519
that are most on it what we've learned

687
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:32,319
people that can kind of you know there's

688
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,038
a lot of uh clients that we work with in

689
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,000
state of California that have a non-

690
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:38,000
detect level uh standard across the

691
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,640
board and they screen material they

692
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,798
micro extract it before they even commit

693
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,120
to purchasing material so that they know

694
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:45,839
what's coming into their extraction

695
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:48,119
closed loop system you know so and and

696
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,519
if there is ever anything they they know

697
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:51,518
what's there so that they can very

698
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:55,240
effectively thoroughly flush their

699
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:57,679
systems compartmentalize the gas etc etc

700
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,558
but what that what happens is when

701
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,759
nobody cleaning their instruments in

702
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:02,359
between and they're just running

703
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:04,119
material from this farm and this farm

704
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,398
and this Farm you know one dude's herpes

705
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:08,119
comes in the next dude's syis the next

706
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,599
dud is garia the next dud you know so

707
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:12,839
next thing you know there's herp syphil

708
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,639
you know in the extraction machine and

709
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:18,119
even if you then run hundreds of pounds

710
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,278
of clean material you know all of that

711
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,000
load carries over and concentrates into

712
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:24,038
the material and it just keeps carrying

713
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,519
over concentrating and so whenever

714
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:27,640
people that are on the manfacturing side

715
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:30,000
of things are just getting clean non

716
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,200
detect results from some fraudulent lab

717
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,880
they you know they operate and move

718
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,038
forward with this false sense of

719
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,760
security that everything's good there's

720
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,919
no issues but little do they know

721
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:41,200
there's this super concentration

722
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:43,120
magnification factors happening you know

723
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,919
that then next thing you know there's 10

724
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:48,518
to 20 pesticides at Super concentrations

725
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,840
and so it's a really big thing but you

726
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,880
know for what it's worth it just like

727
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:54,439
smeared [ __ ] all over the spacee of the

728
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,600
DCC and it really showed kind of how big

729
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,399
of an issue this is you know not just um

730
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:02,398
around kind of loud fraudulence but just

731
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:04,239
about how hyper uh contaminated things

732
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,479
like cartridges and other things that

733
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,880
come from clothed loop extraction can be

734
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,640
and so you know I just so thankful

735
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,399
basically tossing we're tossing a big

736
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,360
fat softball to people like Alex Baron

737
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:17,359
uh who I love Twitter um but his you

738
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:19,079
know he's running around saying this

739
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,439
shit's all causing schizophrenia and

740
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:23,079
violence everything else and as everyone

741
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,120
in this audience knows those studies are

742
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:28,000
all done with like marijuana that no one

743
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:30,879
ever tests so we've got no idea what's

744
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,240
in that stuff and yet this pesticide

745
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,440
issue if you look up a lot of these

746
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,399
insecticides and pesticides they have

747
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,519
like psychosis listed right they there's

748
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:42,278
neurological artifacts that can occur so

749
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,919
yeah War nerve agents shifted to

750
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:47,000
pesticides of the future you neurology

751
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:48,960
is a major aspect of this you know I'm

752
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,159
living with a family member who has

753
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,880
Parkinson so I deeply understand the

754
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:56,639
neurology aspect of of what happens to a

755
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,679
human when when things start to go

756
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:01,599
sideways and you know it's it's really

757
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,519
you know it's concerning on multiple

758
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,439
levels and a couple things that you said

759
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,679
Alec really came to mind in my

760
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,399
experience in California with working

761
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,559
with several Farms across the state is

762
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:15,759
keeping everybody honest it's really

763
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:17,918
difficult you know um I I you know and

764
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,519
then here here's another side of your

765
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,320
story is the marketing aspect of product

766
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,399
you know I've been mandated as a product

767
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,678
developer to make a certain percentage

768
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,678
point before and that's troubling

769
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:32,600
because that's not how this work works

770
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:35,360
you don't just design a a you know a you

771
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:37,079
know 99 proof product that's going to be

772
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,439
amazing on all all the touch points that

773
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,720
we all love you're not going to just

774
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,720
create a

775
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,759
95% uh THC product and have it resonate

776
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,159
across every single you know segment and

777
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,000
everyone's going to love it there's

778
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,240
inherently something wrong with that

779
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,480
mentality I think that good product come

780
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,919
from comes from good genetics good

781
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,960
growing practices and good you know good

782
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,840
marketing of that particular product to

783
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,079
that person but it's not about a

784
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,759
percentage point it's not about you know

785
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,638
how it's going to make you feel because

786
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:10,240
again it goes back to the basics of what

787
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:12,278
we all understand is that it's all

788
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,120
individual and we're we all have to

789
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:17,079
learn about these products and how they

790
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:19,199
bind with us as as people um and how our

791
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:21,480
receptors you know bind with those those

792
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,759
constituents there but I think it's it's

793
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,360
a big problem because on two sides of

794
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,038
the coin you have people marketing and

795
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,959
then you have people shopping that idea

796
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,480
of marketing to create a narrative that

797
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,360
really is a false narrative because

798
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,038
that's not actually how the plant works

799
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:38,599
it's not how well you know so I think

800
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,000
that's another aspect of the

801
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:42,398
conversation I wanted to bring a bit

802
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,558
little bit of light because that's been

803
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,638
my experience with this is I've been

804
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,480
asked to lab shop and then I call these

805
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:51,158
Labs out being like guys this is not

806
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,480
what's in this this is way too high like

807
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:55,840
where are you getting 98% from this is

808
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,278
not the constituents of this were these

809
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,959
varietals that we made this formulation

810
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:02,638
and these percentage points and amounted

811
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,399
of this and sure from these these

812
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:09,199
initial COA points you can amount to a

813
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:13,798
general you know area of of high 80s but

814
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:17,798
to see like 96% 97 kind of made me

815
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:20,079
question everything and I IC Crystal

816
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:21,839
yeah I spent my life dealing with all

817
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,960
this in in developing high level

818
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:26,918
products for several several markets at

819
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,759
once and it was it just ripped open the

820
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:33,480
doors of of deception on me and I just I

821
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,038
was the one being saying no guys

822
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,839
actually this is what the constituents

823
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,519
were it should be here or generally

824
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:41,199
around here and then they went and

825
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:44,759
retest like oh yeah you're kind of right

826
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,759
it is this it is that but you do have a

827
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:48,798
dichotomy here so I wanted to kind of

828
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,839
bring that up because it's there's two

829
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,720
drivers you have Agriculture and then

830
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:54,278
you have marketing and sales or really

831
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,798
three because you have you have to mark

832
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:59,079
it and then sell it right so I think

833
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,558
those together make a really really

834
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:02,079
interesting cocktail that needs to be

835
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:04,720
addressed

836
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,638
AC I think that's I mean ultimately what

837
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,079
everyone's talking about here is

838
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:09,480
California because we're talking about

839
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:12,519
California and California is a big model

840
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,960
hyper model for cannabis globally really

841
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:16,759
um is California dropped the ball in all

842
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,119
in a lot of different ways right

843
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,679
California the fifth largest economy in

844
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,200
the world agriculture it's a big imp you

845
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,398
know it's they just didn't have the

846
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:28,239
foresight to really roll this out and

847
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,319
actually maybe

848
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,000
not just lacking foresight but lacking

849
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,440
desire lacking Integrity not treating it

850
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,239
like other crops I mean even today you

851
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,398
know the the California the the cdfa

852
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:43,479
puts out an annual crop statistics

853
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:45,358
report you know on all different crops

854
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,039
it's very comprehensive it's about it

855
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,039
talks about inputs it talks about

856
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:52,480
pesticide costs each County what each

857
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:54,398
County spends and everything California

858
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,079
is not even I mean cannabis isn't even

859
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,719
in that report it's not even there's not

860
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,400
even an honor mention that say hey we

861
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:03,559
can't talk about it because of federal

862
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,559
federal regulations it's not there so

863
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:08,199
like the it's the largest cash CR in the

864
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:10,838
state and it's not treated like a a crop

865
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:13,679
so the the the Divide between

866
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:16,159
Agriculture and the C the community the

867
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,000
culture the marketing everything was

868
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:21,279
just a a complete dropping of the ball

869
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,280
and the pesticide thing example I

870
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,280
remember like 2015 me and Rob were kind

871
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,839
of in a circle of people talking about

872
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,640
like hey what would you guys do if you

873
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,679
rolling out legal cannabis in California

874
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:36,719
and Alec the first thing I thought of

875
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:38,598
was my experience at hydro shops right

876
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,399
it's a dirty dirty world and everyone

877
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:42,000
thinks everyone in cannabis is all cool

878
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,838
and hey now we're all brothers and we're

879
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,358
all here and we're it's all about the

880
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:48,559
plant let's be honest in California

881
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:50,440
Cannabis was about money and people

882
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,199
flocked to this state from all over the

883
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,639
world to grow cannabis to make a bunch

884
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:58,199
of money it's a cool way to make money

885
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:00,838
but anyway the hydro shops were feeding

886
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:04,679
the industry with a lot of either

887
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:06,880
outlawed or non-accessible pesticides

888
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:10,239
and when and and to me I'm like wow you

889
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,559
can't let that happen you can't let that

890
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,838
be unregulated and then have agriculture

891
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,480
exist over here it just doesn't work

892
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:18,960
that way and anyway so when we got a

893
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,358
license down in LA and I have a friend

894
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,240
who had the local Hydro shop and I'd go

895
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:25,519
and walk in and say hey buddy and buy

896
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:28,318
some stuff I'd sit there and listen to

897
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:32,159
him time and time again say to people

898
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:33,800
are you licensed or not and the are not

899
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,799
part they walk them in the back and

900
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,079
they'd pull out they'd open up the door

901
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,000
the trapo you know the deal and they'd

902
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,240
pull out countless over and over again

903
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,719
pesticides that and with and then they'd

904
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:48,000
give it to him in a

905
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:49,519
unlabeled bottle with no instructions at

906
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,719
all on how to use it with maybe a

907
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:54,119
Sharpie on the side that says like 2.5

908
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:55,559
mil per gallon or something and I'm just

909
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,720
like and the people that they were

910
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,838
selling it to honestly let's be honest

911
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:04,078
were fairly large commercial Growers

912
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:05,838
growing throughout the state and they

913
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,280
they basically right at that transition

914
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:09,719
Point said no you don't have to worry

915
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,519
about that and to me the big thing the

916
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,078
the pesticide issue that was like

917
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,199
obvious like why do people do that but

918
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:19,560
the fact that there's still pack

919
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:22,559
utol that's testing hot showed that this

920
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:26,199
this whole mentality and this whole

921
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:29,078
Market hasn't stopped it only blew up it

922
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:30,919
only got bigger you know what I mean and

923
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:33,599
and and to me that's the state not

924
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,039
looking at cannabis like a crop not

925
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,720
thinking about I mean the way they

926
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,679
regulated the the the canopy the way

927
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,919
they regulated who got licenses all of

928
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:42,358
it they're not thinking about it the

929
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,880
same way they think about all the other

930
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,318
crops which is it's a commodity you have

931
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,160
to protect the farmer you have to

932
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:52,000
maintain a certain you know status quo

933
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:55,399
in terms of yield and what the price per

934
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,159
whatever is and anyway that that to me

935
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,160
is a big part of this and California now

936
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:03,358
is trying to kind of like backpedal and

937
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:06,039
figure out well but so it's over

938
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,838
regulated we know that it's it's not

939
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:10,440
regulated like another crop we know that

940
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:13,639
it's not regulated like tobacco or

941
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:17,000
alcohol right so to me it's just a big

942
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:21,480
dropping of the ball like no one really

943
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,440
would scary if it was regulated like um

944
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,559
tobacco like don't they grow tobacco

945
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,000
with radium

946
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:30,039
226 isn't that like r

947
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,119
but my point but real quick the point

948
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:33,960
there is that that I make is that if we

949
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:35,280
imagine prohibition never happened what

950
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,440
would it be what would the market look

951
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,920
like we all want to be a cleaner safer

952
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,559
better world but we also want TR

953
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,318
cannabis to be treated like other plants

954
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:46,920
so there's that to me is a big part of

955
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:49,039
this intersection with how do we

956
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,599
transition it it applies to hemp it

957
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:56,318
applies to the thca market it applies to

958
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,880
how we apply pesticides it applies to so

959
00:38:56,318 --> 00:39:02,440
many different aspects that shop the the

960
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,559
the way we test and sell by THC

961
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,159
percentage it's like we need to get to

962
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,239
the point where from a higher level we

963
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:10,960
understand that this is a cash commodity

964
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:13,799
it's huge we need to protect the farmer

965
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,199
we need to protect all of those things

966
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,480
and at the same time it's nuanced

967
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,759
because cannabis is incredibly

968
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,079
complicated and there's a lot of weird

969
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,560
there and you know well and it's it's a

970
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:26,440
it's a it's become a cash commodity but

971
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:28,759
it's also a sacred plant Sacrament right

972
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,760
and and I don't think about stooping to

973
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,760
the low of Agriculture which is captured

974
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,760
and all but poisoned and led to all the

975
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,839
long-term chronic illness and cancer

976
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,839
that now we're faced with I think it's

977
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:41,358
cannabis is here one of the big great

978
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:44,480
gifts it's here to offer Beyond The

979
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:46,480
phytochemical Complex of what it brings

980
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,599
is through the testing that we've never

981
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,838
applied to any other crop on this level

982
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,720
and it being this great bio accumulator

983
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,039
of the century it's helping to uproot

984
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,118
the story and the legacy of the Green

985
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,400
Revolution and what we've done the land

986
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,880
what we've done to the neighborhoods

987
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,720
what we've done to the school districts

988
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,920
downwind of the drifting [ __ ] avocado

989
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,439
Farms you know and so for what it's

990
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,960
worth like you know I think kind of when

991
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,838
there is integrity testing I think that

992
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,480
creates the barrier of Entry that keeps

993
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:14,639
out big egg big tobacco big Pharma right

994
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,880
because you can't just flip a Thousand

995
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:18,598
Acre monocrop Mega Farm that's sprayed

996
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,240
glyphosate and all the Organo phosphates

997
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,400
from World War II that you know you you

998
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,799
could grow grow rope for 10 years maybe

999
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,920
clean up your land one day you could

1000
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,000
grow some type one type two type three

1001
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,000
drug cultivars but but until then go

1002
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,480
grow rope you know because the thing is

1003
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,519
is like you know cannabis I mean because

1004
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,800
there's the potency thing and then

1005
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:36,358
there's the public health and safety

1006
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,200
thing right the pocy thing is a

1007
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,279
marketing [ __ ] thing it doesn't

1008
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:42,358
matter you blow out 80% of the the

1009
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,359
canabo and turbs in the smoke you know

1010
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:46,318
whenever you exhale nobody holds it in

1011
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,960
their lungs like they used to when we

1012
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,880
were growing up you know because it was

1013
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,679
so cherished and you know rare or uh you

1014
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,960
know scarce you know people are sipping

1015
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:55,480
and ripping just taking a little puff

1016
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,440
blowing it out right most of everything

1017
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,159
goes out in the smoke so I think it's

1018
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,000
labeling pure labeling right and or pure

1019
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:05,318
pure marketing right and and deducing it

1020
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,480
down to THC is kind of really blurred

1021
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:12,358
the lines between the the most monocrop

1022
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,880
uh biomass and the most craft champagne

1023
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:17,480
qu T quality cannabis there is um and

1024
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,200
then Labs just passing everything as

1025
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,159
clean it's blurred lines between the

1026
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:25,279
dirtiest most adjacent herb and the

1027
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:27,759
cleanest most like you know kind of um

1028
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,599
complete you know non-com compromised

1029
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,000
herb right and so I think the testing

1030
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,599
has a huge role you know to kind of help

1031
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,039
to kind of create that division between

1032
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,318
what we're talking about but you know

1033
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,279
when it comes to you know the the whole

1034
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:42,559
reality of the pesticides you know I

1035
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,599
think it's you know because there's a

1036
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,679
lot of national efforts on the hemp

1037
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:49,000
lobby with a lot of big money people

1038
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:51,118
trying to you know further turn this

1039
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,239
into a commodity right and again because

1040
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,880
you know this I think it's this plants a

1041
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:57,358
lot of things right but but the thing is

1042
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,280
is I think we have to be eternally

1043
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,719
Vigilant to prevent this from ever

1044
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,079
happening right because if we allow the

1045
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:07,078
stripping of the regulations and

1046
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,800
reduction of to be more like food then

1047
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,318
you know everybody lost nobody ever had

1048
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,359
a chance right everybody that's been

1049
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:13,719
doing this all their life right um but

1050
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:15,559
but the thing is is where cannabis is

1051
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:17,239
planted it's kind of like a transparency

1052
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:19,000
Beacon you know so in Santa Barbara

1053
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:23,318
County where all the avocados all in

1054
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,960
camill all the I mean rotational egg you

1055
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:26,279
rotational crops planted throughout the

1056
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,039
year different times sprayed with

1057
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,599
different pesticides punch sides and

1058
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:31,358
things right it's a constant moving

1059
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,280
Target and so when a cannabis farm is

1060
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:36,558
planted there boom bing you failed right

1061
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,000
now that there's recourse because like

1062
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:39,720
Farmers carrying crop insurance crop

1063
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,358
insurance claims are skyrocketing in

1064
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:44,078
California right now you know farmers

1065
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,440
are getting sued because they're their

1066
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,359
drift is affecting a neighboring

1067
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,119
cannabis farm that's a high value crop

1068
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:53,719
and now their crop insurance skyrockets

1069
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,200
now kind of liability is there you know

1070
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:57,519
there's all these PES use report

1071
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:58,838
requests investigations leading to crop

1072
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,199
insurance claims and so what is

1073
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:03,440
happening is it's forcing reform in

1074
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,919
agriculture aerial sprang out of

1075
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,039
helicopters and and planes in Center

1076
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:12,200
Barb county has decreased by like 80% in

1077
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:14,719
the last few years because cannabis is

1078
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:16,480
now in the neighborhood right and so

1079
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:18,399
then not only does that clean up and

1080
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,039
prevent kind of cannabis Farms from kind

1081
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,760
of just having this constant failing

1082
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:24,279
situation that they can't do anything

1083
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,480
about but it's also pre it's lowering

1084
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,839
the overall exposure of school districts

1085
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,159
and the water sheds and streams and you

1086
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:32,279
know because people spraying in the

1087
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,399
middle of the day without without any

1088
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,040
like consideration of fif R wind

1089
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,639
conditions and like time of day right

1090
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:40,558
people are just spraying out of you know

1091
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,318
economic convenience right out of

1092
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,000
helicopters and just dive bombing where

1093
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:46,159
people are just driving down the freeway

1094
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,280
next to it right and so I think kind of

1095
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,838
Dr really incredible to see what's

1096
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,440
happening in this way of the forced

1097
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,159
reform that's happening in

1098
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,720
agriculture I want to pull on that

1099
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:57,078
thread a little bit Alec and that I I

1100
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,639
think what would really help the

1101
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:02,079
industry and put it above this whole a

1102
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:04,440
market which is fairly non-transparent

1103
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:08,000
um is if we can get the states to put

1104
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,559
their testing data from metric public um

1105
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
right now we have to foyet this stuff

1106
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:12,760
from a lot of the states which is a big

1107
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,719
pain in the ass and and hats off to

1108
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,200
Yasha con and Jeff Roston a lot of

1109
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,639
people have gone and done that um Jim

1110
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:20,118
mcgrey also did a lot of this early on

1111
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:22,078
in Washington um I don't can you guys

1112
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:24,760
see this screen that I put up all right

1113
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:28,240
so what what we've done is we've gotten

1114
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,280
data foa data Supply by Yasha and others

1115
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,799
Whoever has it and put it into a SQL

1116
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,960
database so that we can look at in this

1117
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,760
case we're not doing THC although we

1118
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,519
have that data uh we can do that next

1119
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,400
we've been looking at just microbial

1120
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:44,280
failure rates right and so we can chart

1121
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,559
the fail rate per lab uh and this gives

1122
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,200
us all types of information in regards

1123
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:52,440
to like which labs are you know over or

1124
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,919
under failing things um but more

1125
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,079
importantly you can also see some

1126
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,440
strange Behavior Uh in certain Labs okay

1127
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:03,559
okay so we can actually chart let's say

1128
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,720
let's take this lab I happen to know um

1129
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:08,240
very very well respected lab in Mass um

1130
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,439
so this is their total yeast and mold

1131
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,959
levels across time for every test in

1132
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,318
Mass this has been going on for several

1133
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:16,599
years uh as many know the action limit

1134
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:18,279
mass is 10,000 cfus per gram and this is

1135
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:20,519
red line here so they have an even

1136
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,119
distribution of past fails you know

1137
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:24,639
samples Above and Beyond in terms of

1138
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:27,880
cfus per gram their data is thinning out

1139
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:30,159
over time because they're honest uh uh

1140
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,599
people are leaving this lab because this

1141
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:33,358
lab is in the

1142
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,920
state

1143
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:38,119
and that's

1144
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,599
shocking this has been going on since

1145
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:44,358
2022 and the CCC has done nothing except

1146
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,359
when Labs raised this the labs that rais

1147
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:49,480
the fact that this is fake data or at

1148
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:51,480
least you know severely conflicted data

1149
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,079
um they got visited by they got they

1150
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:57,920
call it raided inspected by the CCC so

1151
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,599
the whistleblowers got attacked

1152
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,358
uh and uh and this particular lab we

1153
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,960
know is operating like in 10 states at

1154
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:05,880
least and they're vacuuming up the

1155
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,000
volume in all the

1156
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,640
states uh so for those who not familiar

1157
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,559
with this somehow the yeast and mold

1158
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:13,679
know to stop growing at 10,000 in

1159
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:16,559
Massachusetts and if you go to other

1160
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:19,719
states where it's at 100,000 the same

1161
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:22,480
thing got they got the memo yes the the

1162
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:24,439
yeast and mole got the memo um so the

1163
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,960
other benefit of this is that this is

1164
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,960
Massachusetts data but um what could be

1165
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,960
really helpful uh in in this arena for a

1166
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,358
lot of these Regulators because they

1167
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,838
have their own you they have their own

1168
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:35,679
tranches of data which they're drowning

1169
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,440
in but they don't know how they compare

1170
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:40,598
to other states um like this would have

1171
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,559
like really helped Oregon because Oregon

1172
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:45,640
um blew out Astro jillis testing um

1173
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:48,519
because a few Labs there this is this

1174
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:51,039
was not Apparent at the time so um you

1175
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:52,639
know not not not anyone's fault but

1176
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,719
Growers were getting screwed and that

1177
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:59,799
some Labs had 100% fail rate yeah but a

1178
00:46:55,719 --> 00:47:00,838
couple labs had the same fail rate as uh

1179
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,880
sorry this is taking a little bit time

1180
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:07,920
to load um take it off log scale uh some

1181
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,800
other labs had a fail rate that was

1182
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,559
um I can find the right Labs here that

1183
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,960
was in line with Michigan and Nevada why

1184
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:19,000
nilous oh sorry it might need to

1185
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:22,599
be fooled

1186
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,599
uh and

1187
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:28,679
um gotta find the right oh sorry I'm in

1188
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,880
the wrong graph uh that's why

1189
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,879
my

1190
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:37,879
bad sorry so if you look at this there

1191
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,960
there's some Labs here that are giving

1192
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,800
like a 4% fail rate that's that's what

1193
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,838
we see in Michigan in in Nevada so that

1194
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,000
would have been there shouldn't have

1195
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:47,480
been any alarm Bells however if you look

1196
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,480
at some of the lower volume Labs you

1197
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,559
move this minimum test down more Labs

1198
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,838
should show up some of these Labs were

1199
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:55,640
failing

1200
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:58,199
everything and they had very few very

1201
00:47:55,639 --> 00:48:00,838
few sample B volume to do this most of

1202
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:03,879
them were under 100 tests um so this

1203
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:06,838
created a panic and the grower sued and

1204
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:09,079
got the the regs removed uh so now

1205
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:11,599
there's no ASP jillis testing in in in

1206
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:14,079
Michigan now uh obviously I'm conflicted

1207
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,280
we so you know CRI a river or sorry

1208
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,400
Oregon yeah um but if the if the states

1209
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,040
had the capacity to measure state to

1210
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,599
state The Regulators would known oh wait

1211
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:23,880
a minute we're dealing with an anomaly

1212
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,480
here there's a couple Labs that are out

1213
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,440
of spec but the largest volume lab in

1214
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,519
the state was in line with Michigan and

1215
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,519
Nevada all right we know where to focus

1216
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,318
um uh but instead they kind of folded

1217
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:36,838
not being able to handle the onslaught

1218
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:38,318
that was uh was occurring and The

1219
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:40,039
Growers rightfully would like [ __ ] we're

1220
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:41,519
going to all go out of business if if

1221
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:43,719
they were testing at any of these Labs

1222
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:48,079
that had 100 you know really high fail

1223
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:49,558
rates um well do this with pesticides as

1224
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,680
well there's a host of ways to kind of

1225
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,880
parse the data but I think getting this

1226
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:56,279
public so that um a lot of people in the

1227
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,680
field um Can attack the data help the

1228
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,079
regulator The Regulators don't have

1229
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,879
anyone on staff to do this type of data

1230
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,400
analysis not

1231
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,119
that and it's always better to have more

1232
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,680
eyes and of course there are you know

1233
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:09,838
Labs that are vested in understanding

1234
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:12,358
this data there are um consumers that

1235
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:15,000
are vested but very rarely do the labs

1236
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:17,078
or the consumers have the lobbying power

1237
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,079
to go and change the regulations uh the

1238
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:22,920
grows have a lot of money and a lot of

1239
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:24,880
tax uh um receipts and and you know so

1240
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,720
be it there you know I think the market

1241
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,480
if you look at the lab markets like for

1242
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:31,159
400 million a year is what it's been

1243
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,679
estimated at um whereas the the grow

1244
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:34,920
Market is you know the whole cannabis

1245
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:36,399
industry is north of 20 billion so uh

1246
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,519
the regulations are going to get written

1247
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,798
by the people with the most tax money

1248
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:43,440
going into the state coffers and so um

1249
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:45,039
they'll they'll continue to to probably

1250
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,200
do what tobacco did which is to rip out

1251
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,558
all the regulations possible uh if uh

1252
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:50,879
and while the consumers and the labs

1253
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,920
kind of sit on this different economic

1254
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,440
chess for um now the same thing can

1255
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,318
probably be done with pesticides we have

1256
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,119
some pesticide data in here Oregon you

1257
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:01,199
can see the pesticide data in Oregon

1258
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,440
didn't radically change during the the

1259
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:06,159
time frame of um uh of putting in any of

1260
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,559
that asil

1261
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:12,199
Tes anyway I think that's my that's my

1262
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:14,359
soapbox is is that um I think if we get

1263
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:16,798
this data public we can help The

1264
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:18,318
Regulators police the market kind of

1265
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:20,079
like what happened in Washington yeah

1266
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:21,759
like because whenever whenever the

1267
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,880
public kind of was able to do the free

1268
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,880
moov Information Act request and look at

1269
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,160
the data it was kind of pretty

1270
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,440
transparent which Labs were never

1271
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,679
failing any body and and deviating from

1272
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,318
actually the average but but I Kevin and

1273
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:34,159
this is a huge thing I I'd love to talk

1274
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:36,400
with you at like length about this I'm

1275
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:39,759
and I'm actively in like

1276
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,639
multiple um pretty large aspir Gillis

1277
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,319
contamination rout cause analyses which

1278
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:46,000
I've uh you know because really early on

1279
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:47,960
when legalization happen you know um

1280
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,318
fails started popping up a fail is

1281
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,119
consequential you have to remediate or

1282
00:50:49,318 --> 00:50:52,639
destroy product thousands tens of

1283
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,720
thousands potentially hundreds of

1284
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:56,719
thousand dollars product really early at

1285
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,078
SC Labs we learned like you can't just

1286
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:01,639
Auto email somebody a fail that's the

1287
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:03,680
end of the relationship you know um and

1288
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:06,279
so so and that and you know and a lot of

1289
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,759
labs that opened kind of within a year

1290
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,079
of legalization that thought it was just

1291
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,640
a get-rich quick guaranteed testing kind

1292
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,440
of thing because it's mandat mandatory

1293
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:16,199
you know they like were compromised from

1294
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,760
the very beginning because it's like a

1295
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,279
fail means the loss of the business you

1296
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,920
know and so a lot of labs that had no

1297
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,160
understanding of the plant no kind of

1298
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,760
experience no ability to even engage

1299
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:30,199
with clients to help them figure figure

1300
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,599
it out you know just it's easier to pass

1301
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:33,039
people so they people would just pass

1302
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,000
people and and that's again where this

1303
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:36,119
disincentive occurred with us so you

1304
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,280
know we almost went out of business

1305
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:38,599
towards the end of last year because

1306
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,160
nobody even wanted to work with us

1307
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:42,599
because of how fraudulent the testing

1308
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:44,358
space was but on the topic of as Gillis

1309
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,680
you know it's it's really fascinating

1310
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:48,558
because you know what we see it's about

1311
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:50,318
about two and a half 3% fail rate across

1312
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,480
all testing so most people don't fail

1313
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:54,838
most of the time but whenever somebody

1314
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,960
has legitimate spores detected and

1315
00:51:54,838 --> 00:51:58,679
present that's an indication that spores

1316
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,318
are present somewhere in your facility

1317
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:02,838
and unless they're attended to

1318
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:06,119
methodically to like eradicate them from

1319
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:08,960
the facility then what you can see is

1320
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,960
like this overtime you know intermittent

1321
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,519
fail rate from like one out of 40

1322
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,159
batches to one out of 20 batches to one

1323
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:17,838
out of 10 batches so you start seeing

1324
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:19,920
this like exponential increase in fail

1325
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:22,639
rates to where like worst case scenario

1326
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,960
examples you know we've had groups have

1327
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:28,358
a 50 to 60% fail rate for fuma Godus or

1328
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,159
flavis on any sample they sent in right

1329
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:32,480
and that's what happens whenever an

1330
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,679
issue arises with aspergillis that is

1331
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,559
not even addressed right or like

1332
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:38,279
somebody works with a lab to just give

1333
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,880
them clean results and brush it under

1334
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,519
the rug but that doesn't mean it goes

1335
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,960
away and this kind of really I think in

1336
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:44,480
a big way kind of correlates to that

1337
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,000
Oregon conversation as well because

1338
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,719
Oregon didn't do any micr testing for

1339
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,239
six seven plus years of legalization so

1340
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:53,159
all of a sudden now like aspir Gillis

1341
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:54,919
kicks in all of a sudden fail rates are

1342
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:57,000
kind of way higher than people think

1343
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,720
sure there's probably a bunch on

1344
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,159
Labs not having their [ __ ] together not

1345
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,598
having the you know positive day

1346
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:03,519
controls all the things in place to

1347
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,760
ensure that they're producing quality

1348
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:08,159
data but I'm not I wouldn't be surprised

1349
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,880
if certain groups actually legitimately

1350
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,519
had a really high fail rate right

1351
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,599
because what happens what we've seen is

1352
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:15,318
you know Prat like so so these species

1353
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,720
of asilas they're not native to Canabis

1354
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:18,159
microbiome they're placed there through

1355
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:20,159
some type of a vector Source those

1356
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:22,318
Vector sources could be something like

1357
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:24,279
like contaminated trichoderma who would

1358
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:27,119
have ever thought that right people are

1359
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,160
buying from arbore Organics prodcts I

1360
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,640
won't name where they're inoculate you

1361
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:34,039
got like beneficial fungus trma

1362
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:35,679
inoculated on like a green clay that

1363
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:38,000
turns out the green Clay is contaminated

1364
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:39,558
with aspila fum Godus right so you're

1365
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,559
buying thousands of dollars of

1366
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:43,519
beneficial fungus inadvertently

1367
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:45,119
inoculating human pathogenic fungus all

1368
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:47,159
over your entire crop watering it into

1369
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,838
the root zones right people are taking

1370
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:51,920
predatory bug sources right that are on

1371
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,679
a media right vermiculite mix a

1372
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,920
vermiculite brand mix right and they're

1373
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:57,919
spreading it over the root balls of

1374
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,720
their plants to deploy the bugs well

1375
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,280
guess what that's a vector like we've

1376
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:03,719
seen like a couple of the biggest cases

1377
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,640
like an ongoing one we're working with

1378
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:07,239
right now we just kind of you know and

1379
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:08,440
because that's what's crazy it's like we

1380
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:09,798
were never the lab that was going to

1381
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,960
just stroke somebody's ego like tell

1382
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:14,000
them everything is okay and just

1383
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,838
fraudulently like let them get passes we

1384
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,960
fail if it fails a real fail we fail

1385
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:21,199
them and then somebody like myself and

1386
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,079
now we have a technical services team to

1387
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:24,199
engage immediately as a fail happens to

1388
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:25,920
both demonstrate the quality and

1389
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:28,318
reproducibility of our work and how

1390
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,838
seriously take a fail and and all the

1391
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:31,079
lqc checks that we have in place to

1392
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:33,599
ensure the quality of the batch and the

1393
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:34,680
data and then from there disarming

1394
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,280
because everybody was want to put it on

1395
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:39,358
the lab like the lab screwed up right um

1396
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,798
but then after we do this process of

1397
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:42,039
demonstrating quality and precision of

1398
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:44,079
our work then we shift it into a root

1399
00:54:42,039 --> 00:54:45,880
cause analysis and over hundreds of

1400
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,920
these root cause analyses we've gotten

1401
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:51,760
to the exact who who what were why when

1402
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:53,880
how and uh a contaminant might have

1403
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,599
entered a supply chain and and we've

1404
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,119
been able to you know turn because

1405
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,359
originally it was like total [ __ ]

1406
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,880
sandwiches you know just engaging with

1407
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:04,480
groups worst conversation I've ever had

1408
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:07,039
with an owner screaming at me you know

1409
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,440
kind of but but now it's like you know

1410
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:10,119
we've developed a pallet for these [ __ ]

1411
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:13,039
sandwiches because we've have we have so

1412
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:14,720
many example use cases root cause cases

1413
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,358
where we' figured this out and so now

1414
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:17,838
it's like within a few questions we can

1415
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:19,239
actually help somebody genuinely figure

1416
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:21,038
out where's coming from because what

1417
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:24,358
happens is there's a vector that

1418
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:26,559
introduces it once it's introduced then

1419
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:27,880
if you you know say say you introdu it

1420
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,680
through predatory bug Source or

1421
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:33,838
introduce it through inoculating

1422
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:36,000
green yeah exactly we've seen it certain

1423
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:38,400
instances of like like there's pinu like

1424
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
that's like a cocoa fiber Pete Moss

1425
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,680
peite right we've seen like instances

1426
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,519
you know so they can be batched to batch

1427
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:47,480
like media issues but um but whenever we

1428
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:49,318
see the widespread outbreaks in

1429
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,599
contamination it's usually we're seeing

1430
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:53,679
it from like something like taking

1431
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,680
trichoderma putting it in your Reservoir

1432
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:57,879
watering it into every single plant in

1433
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,519
your room right into the root Zone and

1434
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,760
then it like proliferates and then

1435
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:03,599
spores will like linger but then you har

1436
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,799
what happens is you harvest the room you

1437
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,559
go bring it into a dry room you hang all

1438
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:10,838
the material in this big dense kind of

1439
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,880
smashed together area you know where

1440
00:56:10,838 --> 00:56:14,920
humidity spikes you got DFI is working

1441
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,240
to pull out the humidity you have tons

1442
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,559
of air flow circulating the air around

1443
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:20,318
and so what happens is you have the

1444
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,798
proliferation of the spores that then

1445
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:25,239
spread in the air systems and so so the

1446
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:27,119
the the amplification multiplication

1447
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:29,439
factor for the fail rate happen in the

1448
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,880
air systems you know the HVAC lines the

1449
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,000
air ducts the air handlers the

1450
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,039
dehumidifier filters right and so when

1451
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,159
we go out and do swabbing you know it's

1452
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:39,440
like those spaces specifically that

1453
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:42,000
yield the most positive results of

1454
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,079
detection right and so so whenever we do

1455
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,838
these types of uh analyses root cause

1456
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,318
analyses it's about engaging to help

1457
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:50,798
identify the root Chase it out of the

1458
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:52,440
facility like remove that Source from

1459
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:54,920
ever being introduced and then

1460
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,599
simultaneously leveling up uh microbial

1461
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,798
reduction strategies for how somebody's

1462
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:01,200
approaching air system decontamination

1463
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,400
because most Farmers they that don't

1464
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:06,199
fail most of the time you know they they

1465
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:08,318
have some semi you know solid process of

1466
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:11,199
surface sanitation and spraying walls

1467
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:15,358
and cleaning trays but very few Farmers

1468
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:19,558
ever use some type of chlorine dioxide

1469
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:21,719
or other type of gas um type of solution

1470
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:23,480
where they actually intentionally Target

1471
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:25,798
air systems because air systems are the

1472
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:28,159
biggest place where we see the Spore

1473
00:57:25,798 --> 00:57:29,519
counts kind of grow rise and then carry

1474
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:30,798
over to the next batch and the next

1475
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,079
batch and then all of a sudden it's it's

1476
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:35,079
an amplification issue that that's where

1477
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:38,599
we see the fail rates go from like you

1478
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:40,599
know 2% up to 15 30 40 plus percent

1479
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:42,720
within a facility but whenever but it's

1480
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:44,760
a very contained with in a specific

1481
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,558
facility issue most people don't fail

1482
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,240
most of the time but again once it's

1483
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,559
present if you don't like very

1484
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,318
methodically like address the issue it

1485
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,359
can become like you got to like burn

1486
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:57,480
your facility down kind of

1487
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:59,279
situation Che packets Garden clean you

1488
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,960
know compared to or a lot cheaper than

1489
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:05,319
the radsource machine that you use to

1490
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:07,280
Nuke all your weed yeah 100% so Al you

1491
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:10,279
know last week we we kind of brushed

1492
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:12,760
over like for maybe two minutes

1493
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,640
remediation and you know we're talking

1494
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:18,200
about ASO jalis a little bit and you

1495
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:20,159
know we've talked a lot about the data

1496
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:22,879
we've talked a lot about what we see

1497
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,440
wrong you know what we see a lot in a

1498
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,880
lot of new markets is just it goes

1499
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:30,400
straight to remediation and then that

1500
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,880
goes to a jar some reason right and then

1501
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,280
someone's like someone's buying that

1502
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,079
being like yeah I just bought a black

1503
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,960
cherry or just bought powdered donuts

1504
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,400
and they go home and they're smoking

1505
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:44,159
remediated herb that is just Laden with

1506
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,559
dead cells now how healthy is that you

1507
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:49,279
know and what what are we doing in the

1508
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,760
in in the industry or the community to

1509
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,200
to bring awareness has has a good paper

1510
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,720
on this looking at bio aerosols like so

1511
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:57,598
if you zap your way out of this problem

1512
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:59,879
you end up with high Moto toxins and

1513
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,880
high endotoxins and a variety of other

1514
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:04,599
stuff that are just not well studied

1515
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,920
unfortunately so um the the paper I

1516
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:07,640
threw up here speaking of powdered

1517
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,599
Donuts this is a really good paper from

1518
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:11,480
zamir puner where he's noticed that the

1519
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,880
total yeast and mold levels in his

1520
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:17,318
plants are very genotype specific he's

1521
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:19,798
got some that are 50-fold less tym than

1522
00:59:17,318 --> 00:59:21,759
others consistently powder Donuts being

1523
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:23,440
one of the worst ones uh because uh

1524
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:27,079
maybe that powder isn't the powder you

1525
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,920
want it's it's exactly I think that's

1526
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:31,079
the what I you know the thing I think

1527
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,639
about a lot is you know we all talk

1528
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:34,640
about this we're coming in for wellness

1529
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:38,920
and we're leaving with what you know

1530
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:41,239
another problem um and then we are doing

1531
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:45,639
our best as as community members and

1532
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:47,959
constituents and and you know just good

1533
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:49,318
good practices all the way through and

1534
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,358
then at the end you're getting tested

1535
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:54,719
for this and it's not calling out the

1536
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:57,078
specific strain of of what this is and

1537
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:59,318
there's really no it's just a blanket

1538
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:03,318
past fail and is that the right way

1539
00:59:59,318 --> 01:00:05,480
Kevin um Mark you know do you feel you

1540
01:00:03,318 --> 01:00:07,318
know Alec I guess you know even going

1541
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:10,000
deeper is there a way for us to call out

1542
01:00:07,318 --> 01:00:12,079
these specific constituents that are

1543
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,159
problematic versus the ones that are are

1544
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:16,798
perhaps

1545
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:18,879
benign if if I real quick go ahead Al

1546
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:23,480
you first cool yeah just real quick you

1547
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:25,559
know like as so although California's

1548
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,960
triple [ __ ] up in all kinds of ways

1549
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:29,559
you know um around kind of how this

1550
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,480
whole system is rolled out you know one

1551
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:34,119
thing I think that they did really well

1552
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:36,199
and um and you know we actually were a

1553
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:39,000
big Lobby part with a lot of the organic

1554
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:40,838
farmers in California to kind of block

1555
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,280
the implementation of total East mold

1556
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:46,558
total Rob bacteria levels right because

1557
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:48,240
you know what we've seen from states

1558
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,680
that have implemented these incredibly

1559
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:53,078
restrictive Easter mold count levels and

1560
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:55,199
and bacteria levels you know is that's

1561
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:56,640
the biggest fail rate there's 30 40 50%

1562
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:58,960
fail rate it forces people into having

1563
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:01,558
to kill step to having to you know

1564
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,519
ozonate or pasteurize or gamma radiate

1565
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:05,640
everything before it's even sold at

1566
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:07,079
retail and that in a big way in my

1567
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:09,358
opinion that kind of Dooms the legal

1568
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:12,240
Market because then everything is TP

1569
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:14,038
zaps prior to being sold so then you're

1570
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,439
guaranteed to be able to find any

1571
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:19,200
everything terier and fresher and more

1572
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,760
aromatic and terpenic from the black

1573
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:22,558
market or traditional Market than you

1574
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,960
are from anything on a dispensary shelf

1575
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,319
you know and and and in those States

1576
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:31,079
people are full hix like like clean suit

1577
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:33,000
like it's snarly you know obviously

1578
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:34,720
anybody that's operating those spaces no

1579
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,079
and it's like and you know the thing is

1580
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:37,838
is canab is an agriculture crop if

1581
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:41,240
you're going to regulate so strictly on

1582
01:01:37,838 --> 01:01:43,159
EPA regulated like anti-life chemicals

1583
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:45,558
from Bayer and Dupont senta and all

1584
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:48,719
these chemical companies you know it's

1585
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:51,039
like the way is like organic IPM

1586
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:53,879
practices using benficial microorganisms

1587
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:57,000
compost te's kind of like other

1588
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:59,039
ways TM in place yeah that stuff

1589
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,960
basically is a deao ban on all on all

1590
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:05,599
biocontrol agents right right right

1591
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:09,278
there are no EPA approved pdes tot for

1592
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:11,519
use on cannabis and and all all the

1593
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:14,880
state regulatory bodies that have tried

1594
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:17,519
to make select lists you'll see like

1595
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:21,358
most of the bio pesticides on there you

1596
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:25,000
know low you know efficacy High use rate

1597
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:27,759
kind of materials but the onus is on so

1598
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,798
what what is a p pesticide pesticides a

1599
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,599
active ingredient that kills bugs it's

1600
01:02:29,798 --> 01:02:35,679
sold in different product formulations

1601
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:39,000
and places like Lowe's and own Depot and

1602
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:40,879
yeah the onus is on the company that

1603
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,960
registers so those products are

1604
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,358
regulated under the Environmental

1605
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,880
Protection Agency not the US Department

1606
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:53,239
of Agriculture the EPA grants licenses

1607
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:56,519
for use on pesticides and nothing is

1608
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:59,639
registered for use on cannabis now they

1609
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:01,519
do have some stuff registered on on hemp

1610
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:03,440
which I thought is interesting right

1611
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:04,880
again I think they're caught in that

1612
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,318
whole

1613
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:12,559
differentiation based on canono profile

1614
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:14,400
but until the company shows that owns

1615
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,760
the registration for the active

1616
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:20,039
ingredient shows that at commercial

1617
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:23,319
application use rates that there's no

1618
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:26,640
effect to the environment no effect to

1619
01:03:23,318 --> 01:03:29,358
the crop in terms of toxic and you know

1620
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:32,000
for that they'd have to basically enroll

1621
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:34,480
human subjects which is going to take

1622
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,119
years and millions of dollars to show

1623
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:40,639
that we could apply this pesticide to

1624
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:43,079
cannabis during this stage of production

1625
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:45,400
at this use rate and here are the

1626
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:47,920
metabolites and we've done safety

1627
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:50,278
assessments on the levels of metabolites

1628
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,278
that are in the final cannabis products

1629
01:03:50,278 --> 01:03:56,639
and guess what they're they're safe but

1630
01:03:53,278 --> 01:04:00,480
we've done Clinic basically clinical

1631
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:03,879
studies in humans to show that you know

1632
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:07,199
when they apply a typical insecticide or

1633
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:09,160
fungicide to a crop first of all a lot

1634
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:10,759
of those crops oh most of those crops

1635
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:13,118
aren't smoked right and a lot of those

1636
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,278
crops are washed and a lot of those

1637
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:18,519
crops and I I really love your comment

1638
01:04:15,278 --> 01:04:20,760
here Alec because growing indoors you

1639
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:23,400
know a lot of these pesticides are

1640
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:25,839
basically photolytically leile so

1641
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,680
they're meant to basically elicit their

1642
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:30,920
mode of action and then the

1643
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:33,558
photolytically degrade within days with

1644
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:35,720
u UV andc Spectrum which isn't there in

1645
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:37,559
indoor either right somehow right and

1646
01:04:35,719 --> 01:04:39,719
you may not be getting that light in

1647
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:42,400
your indoor grow but the other thing you

1648
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:44,879
said which is really you know again

1649
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,798
disturbing to hear is that these things

1650
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,838
are environmentally persistent in indoor

1651
01:04:47,798 --> 01:04:52,400
cavities and especially when you have

1652
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:54,519
things like drywall which you know is

1653
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:58,119
great for hanging pictures on your wall

1654
01:04:54,519 --> 01:05:00,679
but not the you want to clad the inside

1655
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:02,960
of your cannabis production facility

1656
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:06,000
with right there's certainly better

1657
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:08,199
cladding options but maybe Kevin I guess

1658
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,159
the interesting aspect I saw in your

1659
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:13,480
data is yeah again that bifurcation

1660
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:15,480
where it's like okay now everything's

1661
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,838
all of a sudden below and those labs are

1662
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,519
getting the business and you know that

1663
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:23,318
again in in testing

1664
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:26,358
Labs it's all about the numbers right

1665
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:28,759
Alec it's all about how many

1666
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:31,078
how many test samples can you get out

1667
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:33,079
how many customers can you keep so the

1668
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:35,079
samples that you're testing this week

1669
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:36,480
are people going to get those results

1670
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:38,318
and be like oh [ __ ] we're not going to

1671
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,159
go to SC anymore we're going to go to

1672
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:42,798
some other place that's going to give us

1673
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:45,679
better results so maintaining customers

1674
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:47,759
I mean it's an incredible Challenge and

1675
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:50,038
I remember when looking at profor as the

1676
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,400
testing Labs you think oh yeah these

1677
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:55,480
companies probably worth hundreds of

1678
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:58,119
millions of dollars like [ __ ] no it's

1679
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:01,278
like they're operating at a razor thin

1680
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:03,119
margin where basically you're trying to

1681
01:06:01,278 --> 01:06:05,679
you're trying to beat the other 10

1682
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:08,920
testing labs in your neighborhood so I

1683
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:12,838
mean there's incredible pressures on

1684
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:15,880
these labs to produce and to try to you

1685
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:18,599
know create bottom line impacts so it's

1686
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:19,798
a it's a tough place to be man like I I

1687
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:22,039
don't know what Mar that's why the

1688
01:06:19,798 --> 01:06:24,559
marketing is a problem man it's like

1689
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:26,799
it's just there's no there's

1690
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:28,680
nearly there's no factual evidence

1691
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:31,798
behind a lot of the marketing it's just

1692
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:34,159
all it's all the highest point and then

1693
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:36,159
they go out and shop that right so it

1694
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:37,679
creates that competition because they

1695
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:40,558
have a mandate as a business if you're

1696
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:43,239
trying to hit a product at 92% every

1697
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:45,400
single time with eight% turps so it

1698
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:48,318
tastes good and hits the the high

1699
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:50,599
90s I mean you'll shop that all day long

1700
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:53,000
if you can make make one printed design

1701
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:56,400
and send it around to 200 shops like it

1702
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,798
just saves you money across the board so

1703
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,200
sorry

1704
01:06:57,798 --> 01:07:01,440
I I just wanted to finish the point I

1705
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:03,038
was trying to make real quick you know

1706
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,240
just about kind of like what Kevin was

1707
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,799
talking about with the Oregon stuff you

1708
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:08,399
know because and in California and how

1709
01:07:05,798 --> 01:07:10,480
California did testing you know like

1710
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,079
very happy that they didn't they focus

1711
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,639
specifically on the human pathogenic

1712
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:16,400
organisms yes I think this is actually

1713
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:19,199
really important point that and I think

1714
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,480
this yeah and I think this could evolve

1715
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,159
right because it's like I think they

1716
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,639
took a more sophisticated approach not

1717
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,639
regulating just the benign arbitrary

1718
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:28,118
colonies total yeast of mold total

1719
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:29,920
aerobic bacteria this focus more on the

1720
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:32,960
human pathogens I think there's a lot

1721
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,400
more microtox producing type of compound

1722
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,559
right the type of

1723
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,960
fungi those so I think I think that's

1724
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:41,720
the evolution of it but but the fact is

1725
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,519
I think it was a great success that

1726
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:45,318
specific asperilla species that are

1727
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:48,199
human pathogenic organisms were what are

1728
01:07:45,318 --> 01:07:51,480
targeted right it's only a presence or

1729
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:53,919
absence right any any DNA detected in

1730
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,559
you know one gram of material right um

1731
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,039
so it's not like a quantification how

1732
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:59,000
much is there it's just presence or

1733
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,839
absence right we haven't really ever

1734
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,960
failed anybody for microt toxins right

1735
01:08:00,838 --> 01:08:04,679
so it's not like peanuts or coffee beans

1736
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,920
where it's like widespread outbreak

1737
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:09,318
producing micro toxins but it's more

1738
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:11,119
intermittently spread right particularly

1739
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:12,278
compounded through air systems but

1740
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:15,079
that's one of the big things that I want

1741
01:08:12,278 --> 01:08:18,039
to make point of is like um you know

1742
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:19,838
like focusing specifically on public

1743
01:08:18,039 --> 01:08:21,838
health and safety and what can Farm

1744
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:24,920
people right is what I think the way

1745
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:26,640
forward is right and with it's gonna end

1746
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,279
up in court right eventually it's gonna

1747
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,798
end up in court and and the clinical

1748
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:32,839
lature is not written in the language of

1749
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:34,560
11,000 total yeast and mold colonies

1750
01:08:32,838 --> 01:08:36,318
hurt somebody they just don't write

1751
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:39,239
papers that way because they're forced

1752
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:41,199
to to basically satisfy C's postulates

1753
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:44,399
which is you you isolate the pathogenic

1754
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:46,358
organism and you reintroduce it to to a

1755
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:48,039
model organism and see that it creates

1756
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:49,960
harm and if you haven't created that

1757
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:51,000
Loop you can't publish like the clinical

1758
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:54,039
literature is not going to let you

1759
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,838
publish something saying I had 56,000

1760
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:57,119
total aerobic count and maybe that hurt

1761
01:08:55,838 --> 01:08:58,759
somebody they're going to say no go back

1762
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,719
and tell us if it was Eola if it was

1763
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:03,920
salmon if it was staff if it was pomonis

1764
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:05,560
like you have to isolate the organism so

1765
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:08,039
all the clinical literature is written

1766
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:10,120
in species specific language so let's

1767
01:09:08,039 --> 01:09:11,399
say it grows like happens in Oregon and

1768
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:13,640
they were to go to court they would

1769
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:15,039
probably lose against ASP regillus

1770
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,039
because there's in fact clinical

1771
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:18,920
literature you know tying harm to real

1772
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:21,359
patients if they applied that case

1773
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,960
against total ye and mold they would win

1774
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:26,600
uh because the reality cannot defend uh

1775
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:28,560
you do not know which level harmful uh

1776
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,159
and it's meant to be just a bioburden

1777
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,679
check it's not meant to actually predict

1778
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:34,599
clinical outcomes right but the reality

1779
01:09:32,679 --> 01:09:36,679
of aspergillis though in Oregon right

1780
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,400
because all the because in Oregon you

1781
01:09:36,679 --> 01:09:40,798
got all the headyy organic people you

1782
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,719
know deploying organic IPM practices

1783
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:45,399
spreading predatory bugs deploying

1784
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:47,480
trichoderma it wouldn't surprise me if a

1785
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:50,000
pretty high fail rate existed

1786
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:52,000
individually within certain facilities

1787
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,319
because of how much we've seen the

1788
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,279
introduction of it lead to you know

1789
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:58,359
because most people again fail most of

1790
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:00,079
the time for aspir Gillis but once

1791
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:01,519
you've introduced it and sports are

1792
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:03,800
genuinely present in your facility and

1793
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,760
you're in a closed loop system and it

1794
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,679
compounds and Carries over and like you

1795
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,280
know kind of replicates in the air

1796
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:13,039
systems you start compounding the issue

1797
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:14,639
to where you have no idea how big and

1798
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:15,840
how gnarly of an issue it can become and

1799
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,079
so that's one of the things where I

1800
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,119
think like you know Oregon you know

1801
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:22,079
didn't have any microbiology testing in

1802
01:10:20,119 --> 01:10:23,119
place they started like by leading the

1803
01:10:22,079 --> 01:10:26,039
way

1804
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:27,359
because test but didn't do this thing

1805
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:29,479
with aspir Gillis and then they fought

1806
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:31,479
it and you know prevented it from coming

1807
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:32,919
in that doesn't mean the problem doesn't

1808
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:35,559
exist you know and so I think the

1809
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:37,199
reality is is you know kind of a more

1810
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,880
sophisticated approach in how kind of

1811
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:40,079
it's dealt with and how it's understood

1812
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,239
because you know a lot of

1813
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:44,640
well-intentioned organic farmers that

1814
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,319
are using organic IPM products

1815
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,360
inadvertently unknowingly are

1816
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:50,359
introducing it and then kind of Might

1817
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:52,359
very well have 3040 plus percent fail

1818
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:54,158
rates internally because they've never

1819
01:10:52,359 --> 01:10:55,880
because until somebody genuinely starts

1820
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:58,319
failing for ASP Gillis

1821
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:00,000
nobody is even paying attention to

1822
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:03,319
cleaning out their air systems in some

1823
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,279
semi-routine way nobody's like gassing

1824
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:07,759
chlorine dioxide to kind of Ensure like

1825
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:08,840
they're chasing out any remaining spores

1826
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,920
right and so I think it's a it's

1827
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,279
definitely a big issue you know and uh

1828
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:15,079
and I think kind of too A lot of the

1829
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:17,399
work you've done Kevin it's like it's

1830
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:19,158
you know there there are things besides

1831
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:21,879
you know kind of asulis right like there

1832
01:11:19,158 --> 01:11:23,519
are ferium producing microt toxin

1833
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:24,880
there's certain other types of things

1834
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,760
that could be producing things that are

1835
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,119
gnarly

1836
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,119
so I think instead of kind of just test

1837
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:30,519
you know that's why I appreciated

1838
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:31,920
California they didn't it's it wasn't

1839
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,719
just testing all microbes for the sake

1840
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,399
of testing microbes it was focusing on

1841
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:37,239
the human pathogens and I think as long

1842
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:39,079
as we do that you know we can kind of

1843
01:11:37,238 --> 01:11:41,479
actually as a whole community help kind

1844
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:43,840
of you know really Advance the the plant

1845
01:11:41,479 --> 01:11:46,000
and the safety and efficacy of now the

1846
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,880
the flip side of of the asilis testing

1847
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,439
has been that um people are complaining

1848
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,560
that there's there's visible mold on

1849
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:54,238
some cannabis that gets through that

1850
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,639
aspil it's not aspis right and and

1851
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:57,599
somehow we we probably have to button

1852
01:11:55,639 --> 01:11:59,800
that up with figuring out what that is

1853
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,840
and and and either have a visual screen

1854
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,239
or or finding what other pathogenic

1855
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,199
organisms we're cared about if it's not

1856
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:06,799
pathogenic we you know throw it out if

1857
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:08,599
you can see it like a strawberry but if

1858
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,279
it's pathogenic maybe maybe we got to

1859
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:12,000
keep maybe you got to add something to

1860
01:12:10,279 --> 01:12:15,000
the list but and that's what the f and

1861
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:18,359
for material test is supposed to pick up

1862
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,880
by so there's um I think the species

1863
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:21,679
specific stuff will also reduce a lot of

1864
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,800
the lab shopping because the fail rates

1865
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:25,719
go down so people don't have a

1866
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:28,560
motivation to lab shop as much um and

1867
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:30,960
then you know on top of that the labs

1868
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,800
are are um they're much easier tests to

1869
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,359
perform in that the labto laab they

1870
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,560
won't be as discordant than the total

1871
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:38,439
use and mold tests uh and so you'll

1872
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,600
probably have less of this capacity for

1873
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:42,519
people to find a lab that's got a 2%

1874
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,800
failure rate versus a 15% failure rate

1875
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:46,520
it's you know everyone's going to

1876
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:48,199
probably be floating around three to 5%

1877
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:50,480
uh independent of which which test

1878
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:52,079
provider they're using so it'll probably

1879
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:54,119
Wipe Out the motivation for folks to be

1880
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:56,359
lab shopping off of microbials if we we

1881
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:58,800
get those things done right

1882
01:12:56,359 --> 01:13:00,079
can I um can I mention something else

1883
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,279
about I'm not sure if we wanted to talk

1884
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:04,600
about this today Wade had his hand up

1885
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:06,960
I'm sorry I hate I always got to defend

1886
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:09,000
Wade get in there

1887
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:12,000
Wade thank you

1888
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Marcus

1889
01:13:12,439 --> 01:13:16,879
I oh I think it's mut you're muted

1890
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:25,319
Wade can you hear me now

1891
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:28,679
Absolut okay um patient of many many

1892
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:30,880
years cultivator of many years a lot of

1893
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:33,279
this conversation this morning has

1894
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,760
really been focused around solving

1895
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:40,920
problems that come with indoor

1896
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:44,960
cultivation Andor extensive Greenhouse

1897
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:47,920
cultivation and I could be naive and I

1898
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:51,158
would ask anyone on the panel to call me

1899
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:54,279
out for being naive but when I was a

1900
01:13:51,158 --> 01:13:57,198
cultivator and engaged in what we call

1901
01:13:54,279 --> 01:14:00,079
regenerative practices where I was

1902
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:03,119
creating any of the inputs that I wanted

1903
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:07,000
for my crop on my farm so I knew what

1904
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:09,880
was in it um all of these issues around

1905
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:13,960
asilis yes it's in the atmosphere here

1906
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:16,840
but it's a non-issue in a su grown

1907
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:19,840
regenerative Garden is my experience and

1908
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:22,639
again totally anyone on the on the group

1909
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:25,679
calling me out as [ __ ] here but I

1910
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:28,400
got to say that part of the silo that

1911
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:31,279
has happened in States across this

1912
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:34,119
country is forcing this conversation

1913
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:37,599
upon us and I really want to remind

1914
01:14:34,119 --> 01:14:40,279
people that if you grow your own in the

1915
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,360
sun take care of your plants they'll

1916
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:43,639
take care of

1917
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:46,359
you that's all I got I'm gonna go back

1918
01:14:43,639 --> 01:14:48,440
to listening fascinating conversation

1919
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:50,799
and again thank you Marcus love you

1920
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:52,279
brother I I have some data actually at

1921
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,719
hand that can try to address this so

1922
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:56,559
thank you for bringing it up Wade um so

1923
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:58,319
there there is uh a lot of discussion

1924
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,159
about ASP regillus out there and you

1925
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:02,759
have to keep in mind that aspis has got

1926
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:05,198
280 different species and we only give a

1927
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,760
[ __ ] about four of them all right so

1928
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:08,198
this is um now I don't have this split

1929
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,400
by outdoor and indoor but it's a very

1930
01:15:08,198 --> 01:15:11,960
important Point uh that I'll have to see

1931
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:13,879
if our if we have that information and

1932
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:15,760
we can maybe dissect it and get to that

1933
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,239
but what you're seeing on these on these

1934
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,960
top lines up here that are kind of

1935
01:15:17,238 --> 01:15:22,599
cratering to the right are all aspila

1936
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:24,158
species in in leaves so so let me back

1937
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,000
up we've got about a thousand whole

1938
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:27,920
genome sequin when we do whole genome

1939
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,479
sequencing we get the microbiome picture

1940
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:32,480
with it and so we can then ask what

1941
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:34,119
tissue type did the sequencing come from

1942
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:36,839
and and look at the microbiome per

1943
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:39,238
tissue type so when you look at uh when

1944
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:41,319
you're looking on the on the x-axis here

1945
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:43,279
are the number of reads per million okay

1946
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:44,639
so when you're sequencing the fungal

1947
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:46,479
microbiome we're just counting how many

1948
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:49,679
reads are ASP regillus versus all other

1949
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:51,759
fungal [ __ ] that's there uh and it's

1950
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:54,039
it's they're at you can see 100% of the

1951
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,119
samples will have aspergillus of some

1952
01:15:54,039 --> 01:15:58,840
sort at 100 reads per million still a

1953
01:15:56,119 --> 01:16:01,079
very very low amount but all all of the

1954
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:03,400
samples that we collected this is 943

1955
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:04,639
samples uh that are that are in there

1956
01:16:03,399 --> 01:16:06,000
however when you start going down to the

1957
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:08,239
four that we care about in the

1958
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,560
regulations this drops down to like the

1959
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:13,399
9% range that have 100 reads per million

1960
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,840
we think the PCR tests are kind of

1961
01:16:13,399 --> 01:16:16,759
picking things up somewhere around the

1962
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,079
three or 400 reads per million range so

1963
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,039
the number this is this kind of lines up

1964
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:22,158
with the Alex number around 3 to 4%

1965
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:23,760
failure rate but I just want to show

1966
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:25,960
this because it's often thrown out there

1967
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,159
that asilis is every everywhere which is

1968
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:30,359
true as a Genus but as a species of

1969
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:32,439
these four pathogenic ones there's a

1970
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:35,238
huge gap between all of them in just

1971
01:16:32,439 --> 01:16:36,719
these four so the ubiquity stuff is is

1972
01:16:35,238 --> 01:16:38,399
um you got to keep in mind there's a

1973
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:40,920
major reduction when you just focus on

1974
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:43,839
on the few that are there um but we now

1975
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:45,719
have this kind of information um from

1976
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,360
basically a thousand different uh

1977
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:50,439
cannabis genomes from all over the world

1978
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:52,198
so we know like what pathogens are there

1979
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:53,919
uh so we can better inform Regulators

1980
01:16:52,198 --> 01:16:55,678
that okay these ones we don't need to

1981
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,399
care about these ones do based on the

1982
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,679
frequency of what we found um from

1983
01:16:57,399 --> 01:17:00,319
sequencing data because what they've

1984
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:01,840
really done is just taken most of the

1985
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:04,119
food industry and just lobbed it on top

1986
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,679
of cannabis like they're putting leria

1987
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:08,279
in place we've never found leria we

1988
01:17:06,679 --> 01:17:10,000
don't see leria in this type of

1989
01:17:08,279 --> 01:17:11,479
sequencing data but they want to put it

1990
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,760
in there because the food people use it

1991
01:17:11,479 --> 01:17:14,119
and the food people have a test for it

1992
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:16,199
and they can slap that onto our field

1993
01:17:14,119 --> 01:17:19,319
and start you know harvesting uh some

1994
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:21,599
food testing revenue from us um you know

1995
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:24,039
arguably a Coline cell they're very very

1996
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:26,520
low in frequency um they're they're

1997
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:28,039
there and it's like probably one in a

1998
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,000
thousand samples or something might be

1999
01:17:28,039 --> 01:17:31,158
positive for them so yeah maybe you do

2000
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,800
want to grab those if it's going to end

2001
01:17:31,158 --> 01:17:35,920
up in in you know oral or end up

2002
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,679
ingested in some way but uh I don't

2003
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,079
think anyone is lab shopping off of the

2004
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:40,880
coli cell numbers they're just the

2005
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:42,880
frequency of failure is just too low for

2006
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,239
anyone to give a [ __ ] about uh that it

2007
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,400
wouldn't it wouldn't create that kind of

2008
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:48,158
economic motivation so what we got to do

2009
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:49,719
wait is I got to see if we have that

2010
01:17:48,158 --> 01:17:51,559
information in this database if we can

2011
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:53,560
split it by outdoor indoor because I do

2012
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:55,320
think what Alec is bringing up the

2013
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,000
indoor systems are recirc C ating a lot

2014
01:17:55,319 --> 01:18:00,158
of the air if the spores are in the

2015
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,520
facility they're just recycling those uh

2016
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:04,799
and outdoor systems may have all types

2017
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:07,159
of natural mechanisms to keep asilis at

2018
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:11,600
Bay like all these other gram positive

2019
01:18:07,158 --> 01:18:11,599
bacteria that flush it out of out of um

2020
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:17,679
competition one thing I think's

2021
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:19,840
important to keep in mind is how like

2022
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:21,880
with the data coming from a lot of the

2023
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,719
product that's in the market is not what

2024
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:25,319
the

2025
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:28,079
test actually represents you know

2026
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:30,920
there's a lot of product that just gets

2027
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:32,760
slapped a label on it so to speak um in

2028
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:35,279
every Market where people are just

2029
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:37,440
taking you know part of some other batch

2030
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:39,759
and making it a part of a batch that has

2031
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:41,839
a different sample or test on it and

2032
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,719
that's I I think that the problem is

2033
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,400
probably a lot more widespread than even

2034
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,399
the data would

2035
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:51,839
show it's really good point you know

2036
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:53,839
there's a lot of that going on

2037
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,719
especially nowadays because of the times

2038
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:59,600
that we're in you you know making things

2039
01:18:55,719 --> 01:19:01,520
go further test results last longer um

2040
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:03,440
batching large batches over time and

2041
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:06,360
testing them week after week or every

2042
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:08,879
bi-weekly is a really expensive Endeavor

2043
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:11,119
um you know so I think that's that's a

2044
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,119
good call out I I've thought about that

2045
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:16,760
often it's funny that you bring that up

2046
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:20,158
because it's it's yeah I mean metric

2047
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:24,600
data is is just about as reliable as the

2048
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:27,759
person that's inputting it so change ey

2049
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:29,880
right you know yeah it's definitely it's

2050
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:33,079
definitely true in the sense that you

2051
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:35,760
know it it's not just like and I saw

2052
01:19:33,079 --> 01:19:37,719
this in Jamaica a lot it's not just like

2053
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,119
bad evil people who are like oh I'm just

2054
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:40,920
going to put these chemicals in because

2055
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:43,960
I'm nefarious it's like you see these

2056
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:46,920
situations occur where it's like I will

2057
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:48,960
either feed my family or I won't feed my

2058
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:50,800
family and it's sort of this mentality

2059
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,439
where you're it's like the ultimate

2060
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,079
trial where you're like okay like are

2061
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:57,559
you going to have the high integ and

2062
01:19:55,079 --> 01:20:00,479
bankrupt your life or are you going to

2063
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:03,440
get that 100 pound s you know fig lot

2064
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:05,319
figured out and tested and passed in any

2065
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:08,198
way shape or form that you can so I

2066
01:20:05,319 --> 01:20:11,479
think it's a very good point uh in what

2067
01:20:08,198 --> 01:20:15,719
uh Fletch just said in the sense that uh

2068
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:18,279
it's just so easy to fall victim to

2069
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:19,920
circumstance um I want to keep on the on

2070
01:20:18,279 --> 01:20:22,079
the conversation but I also want to like

2071
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,039
first of all thank everyone from Fletch

2072
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:27,719
I see etan is in the room for the first

2073
01:20:24,039 --> 01:20:29,519
time on 5.0 Brian's back Alec has also

2074
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:31,399
showed up here which has been awesome

2075
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,800
dude listening to you great to have

2076
01:20:31,399 --> 01:20:37,279
Mojave in the house Grandmaster LED

2077
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:40,000
Thomas is here Colin and Wade we got Dr

2078
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:41,800
Mark and of course Kevin McCaron sharing

2079
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,319
sharing the data and it's just a real

2080
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,079
interesting conversation so I wanted to

2081
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:47,399
recognize and thank you all for showing

2082
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:49,039
up I'm here with my homie Merlin my

2083
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:50,799
other friend just rolled up Lincoln

2084
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:53,039
who's kind of off camera but he left the

2085
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:55,800
room so I'll just thank everyone there's

2086
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:57,639
255 people watching right now and let's

2087
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:00,440
uh you know keep this conversation going

2088
01:20:57,639 --> 01:21:02,920
it's awesome thank you

2089
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:05,238
guys yeah I was going to say I I met re

2090
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:10,600
at the emerald cup I met someone who's a

2091
01:21:05,238 --> 01:21:15,039
farmer in Central Valley and he grows in

2092
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:19,039
the state legal Market at scale grows

2093
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:23,399
thca Farm Bill hemp at scale and also

2094
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:26,960
grows traditional Legacy at

2095
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:28,559
scale and plays all three paths and I

2096
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,679
was just like I'm like wow the logistics

2097
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,000
of that that's insane like like wow that

2098
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:34,480
you clearly can handle a lot but think

2099
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,238
about how much you know there's a lot of

2100
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:40,439
diversion in the state obviously and

2101
01:21:37,238 --> 01:21:42,158
everything goes everywhere if it can

2102
01:21:40,439 --> 01:21:43,638
that's and I am hearing that in other

2103
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:45,759
states too I hear in other states where

2104
01:21:43,639 --> 01:21:48,159
people are like you know I would buy

2105
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:51,159
from from the state Market but their

2106
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:53,039
flower sucks so I'm buying imported thca

2107
01:21:51,158 --> 01:21:55,399
flour and then I'm selling it on our

2108
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:58,679
Shelf as Delta 9

2109
01:21:55,399 --> 01:22:01,519
and getting new coo coas on it and it's

2110
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:04,319
just like man it's just nuts you know

2111
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:08,440
and there's a lot of that going on um

2112
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:10,880
and and lab shopping is is kind of at

2113
01:22:08,439 --> 01:22:13,198
the heart of all that because diversion

2114
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,319
and you know working with burner dros

2115
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:18,238
and all that stuff it's all about having

2116
01:22:15,319 --> 01:22:20,158
a piece of paper you know and it's a

2117
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:22,198
it's a dirty supply chain and it's now a

2118
01:22:20,158 --> 01:22:24,839
national dirty supply chain and this

2119
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:27,079
whole 80 farms in one batch of

2120
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,679
distillate those that distillate that go

2121
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:30,439
that went in those Vape pin in La it

2122
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:32,480
also goes to products all over the

2123
01:22:30,439 --> 01:22:34,519
country there's there's you know

2124
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:36,678
Missouri just had the big recall

2125
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:39,080
recently last week again because they

2126
01:22:36,679 --> 01:22:40,840
couldn't validate the supply chain and

2127
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:43,479
that's just validating what where it

2128
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:46,039
came from not what's even in it you know

2129
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:48,839
so it's it's nuts man it's totally

2130
01:22:46,039 --> 01:22:51,719
totally nuts and to me it's because we

2131
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:54,079
never you know it's a real big picture

2132
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:55,679
issue it's like you like Al Alec you

2133
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:57,479
know I mean it's a sacred plant right

2134
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,920
it's like you need to bring you need to

2135
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:00,359
bring the spirit with it but you also

2136
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:03,520
need to bring philosophers and

2137
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:04,960
ethnobotanists and agtech guys and

2138
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,360
everybody gets to get and maybe a

2139
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,119
comedian or two you know get in there

2140
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:11,599
and actually like really approach it

2141
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:13,760
from a comprehensive kind of panel like

2142
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:17,920
approach and we didn't do that and this

2143
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:20,119
is what we do you know and and anyway um

2144
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,119
yeah so the the T you're striking a

2145
01:23:20,119 --> 01:23:23,639
court on the THC flower thing for me

2146
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:24,920
because i' I've had several I have like

2147
01:23:23,639 --> 01:23:26,560
a partner in mind it was in another

2148
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:29,000
state and he was walked into a shop and

2149
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:31,719
they had like just everything lined up

2150
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,000
it like every jili Bean they had sour

2151
01:23:31,719 --> 01:23:36,760
they had you know OG Kush said it all

2152
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,359
just lined up he's like what's the deal

2153
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:40,280
here talk to me about it and he's like

2154
01:23:38,359 --> 01:23:42,759
this is legal he's like well how is it

2155
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:45,359
legal and he walked him through the

2156
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:47,000
process of how he buys his pounds and W

2157
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,679
you know gets it through and puts it in

2158
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,560
the jar and then they basically have a a

2159
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,158
BEDA style set up where they weigh it in

2160
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:55,719
front of you and sell it to you as if

2161
01:23:53,158 --> 01:23:57,799
you're in a dispo and I think that's the

2162
01:23:55,719 --> 01:23:59,880
other aspect of it and those pounds what

2163
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,679
maybe go for 200 300

2164
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:04,480
bucks right so I think that's to Dr

2165
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:07,679
Mark's point on the commodity side

2166
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:10,879
there's there's a huge influx of this

2167
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:12,359
and there's really no one grabbing on to

2168
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,560
where any of it came from there is no

2169
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:16,559
COA on most of this stuff and if it is

2170
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:20,560
it's made up right

2171
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:23,159
so yeah got a question I've got a

2172
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:25,600
question kind of for everybody in here

2173
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:29,119
um

2174
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:32,520
what percentage of the black market weed

2175
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:35,158
that exists today is coming from legal

2176
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:38,080
Farms do you think in my estimation it's

2177
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:41,759
more than 80% of the black market weed

2178
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:43,960
is backdoored product I mean because now

2179
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:46,560
that everybody knows the like the deal

2180
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:49,000
on grows you can't put up an illegal 100

2181
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,679
lighter easily anymore at all everybody

2182
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,079
knows why you're installing air

2183
01:24:50,679 --> 01:24:54,600
conditioners you need a [ __ ] power

2184
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:57,158
upgrade everything that goes with it the

2185
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,719
black market is small little guys mostly

2186
01:24:57,158 --> 01:25:00,799
little hash guys and stuff like that

2187
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:02,840
maybe a few you know Greenhouse outdoor

2188
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,000
Growers and whatever but the vast

2189
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:06,920
majority especially when you're talking

2190
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,960
about indoor flowers all backdoor legal

2191
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:13,239
product I mean like the the market is

2192
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:15,639
not even close like the data isn't even

2193
01:25:13,238 --> 01:25:18,959
close to what the actual Market looks

2194
01:25:15,639 --> 01:25:20,880
like you know I think there's also some

2195
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:23,560
you know there's there's the Big C's as

2196
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,800
I call them um I think everyone can fill

2197
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,520
in the blanks is the the rest of that

2198
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,880
word is that are really running the

2199
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:31,360
larger ones but yeah I think you're

2200
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:33,279
right Fletch like it's mainly smaller

2201
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:35,399
guys but it's coming it's falling out

2202
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:39,439
the back door because it's it's got to

2203
01:25:35,399 --> 01:25:42,279
go somewhere right so that's where it's

2204
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:45,000
going and when and when you're talking

2205
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:47,840
uh extracts and stuff it's probably you

2206
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,158
know it's even more than flour probably

2207
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,840
well sadly sadly from kind of my

2208
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:53,599
observation you know I think some a lot

2209
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,800
of the dirtiest material that wouldn't

2210
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,079
pass testing California goes east you

2211
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:00,199
know and I think that happens in a lot

2212
01:25:57,079 --> 01:26:02,479
of States um you know where they can't

2213
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:05,439
pass a state established quality

2214
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:08,198
standard it diverts wherever it has to

2215
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:10,879
go you know and and um and you know I

2216
01:26:08,198 --> 01:26:14,599
think there's a lot there you know

2217
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:16,719
um you cannabis is you know Mojave you

2218
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:19,119
were saying it's a like dirtiest you

2219
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:21,719
know the supply chain kind of I I think

2220
01:26:19,118 --> 01:26:23,599
I think there's it's exposing the the

2221
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:26,439
potential of how dirty the Agriculture

2222
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,600
and uh landscape is but it's so it's it

2223
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:29,158
has the potential to be the dirtiest

2224
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,600
supply chain but the regulations the

2225
01:26:29,158 --> 01:26:32,000
testing requirements have established it

2226
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,719
to be cleaner than water and food in

2227
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,279
most areas of the country you know when

2228
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:36,480
there's actually Integrity in that and I

2229
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:38,679
think that's something really profound

2230
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:40,079
there's a lot of farmers in California

2231
01:26:38,679 --> 01:26:42,000
like really pridefully kind of

2232
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:44,158
establishing themselves you know and

2233
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,000
branding around how can our cannabis is

2234
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:49,238
cleaner than your food you know and and

2235
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,840
I think that's a really profound kind of

2236
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:53,000
uh thing that the plant is here to also

2237
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:54,319
bring in kind of exposing the you know

2238
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,238
contradictions in our lives of what what

2239
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:57,759
we put in our on our body you know but

2240
01:26:56,238 --> 01:26:59,759
yet we smoked cannabis cleaner than food

2241
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:03,280
and water you know and and so I think

2242
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:05,119
kind of uh you know the um you know it

2243
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:07,920
was interesting because when before we

2244
01:27:05,118 --> 01:27:11,238
opened up SC labs in uh in

2245
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:13,118
2007 N I was working hydro store and and

2246
01:27:11,238 --> 01:27:15,000
and I I saw that there were two types of

2247
01:27:13,118 --> 01:27:17,158
people that were serving this plant you

2248
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,479
know kind of through the lens of this

2249
01:27:17,158 --> 01:27:23,158
whole conversation around IPM you know

2250
01:27:19,479 --> 01:27:25,799
and people would come in like week five

2251
01:27:23,158 --> 01:27:27,759
or six of flour you know webbed spider

2252
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:30,480
mites millions of spider mites kind of

2253
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:32,520
just go you know going RoR and they're

2254
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:36,678
come in in a super Panic moment because

2255
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:39,080
they're like I [ __ ] up I didn't do the

2256
01:27:36,679 --> 01:27:41,079
proper prevention game you know to

2257
01:27:39,079 --> 01:27:43,519
prevent this from being a thing I now

2258
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:46,600
have this really big problem what can I

2259
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:48,400
do you know and and uh it's like always

2260
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:50,800
like dude you don't you can't really do

2261
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:54,799
anything you know it's this

2262
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:58,360
like exactly vacuum you know takes like

2263
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:00,279
bronners and like like sponges you know

2264
01:27:58,359 --> 01:28:02,479
like strip every leaf off the plant that

2265
01:28:00,279 --> 01:28:04,198
is fan leaf or anything kind of that you

2266
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:06,079
can do to kind of remove as much of the

2267
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:07,960
physical kind of material where eggs and

2268
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:10,000
such are you got a lot of work ahead of

2269
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,359
you get after it you know and you know

2270
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,760
you can't even really spray things like

2271
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:13,960
organic oils because those are also

2272
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:17,039
going to be concentrating into your

2273
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:18,679
material you know um and and and so so

2274
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:20,800
it's like there's this very Integrity

2275
01:28:18,679 --> 01:28:22,560
Way of like not compromising the sacred

2276
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,960
Integrity of spirit of of the spirit of

2277
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:26,960
this plant and the healing is to offer

2278
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,439
and then you know there was this other

2279
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,118
approach right this other approach is

2280
01:28:28,439 --> 01:28:32,198
like well cool like so there were people

2281
01:28:31,118 --> 01:28:34,238
that were like all right I'm going to go

2282
01:28:32,198 --> 01:28:35,638
get to work this is sounds like a lot of

2283
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:36,678
work I'm gonna go do this right because

2284
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:38,279
they would never even consider

2285
01:28:36,679 --> 01:28:39,920
compromising this this plant you know

2286
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:41,719
that was going towards in so many ways

2287
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:44,239
compassion and how much it was helping

2288
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:46,560
heal right and like this like act of

2289
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:48,759
like you know gener of Charity and

2290
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:51,320
generosity that you know like those

2291
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:53,320
serving would kind of like take

2292
01:28:51,319 --> 01:28:54,759
seriously with their relationship with

2293
01:28:53,319 --> 01:28:55,880
the plant know but then there's this

2294
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:59,000
other type of person that was in the

2295
01:28:55,880 --> 01:29:01,880
peer pursuit of profit that's like dude

2296
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,800
[ __ ] that give me the UN you know give

2297
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:06,279
me the vials with the little like two m

2298
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:08,039
per [ __ ] gallon thing on the side

2299
01:29:06,279 --> 01:29:10,639
everyone you got you know and they would

2300
01:29:08,039 --> 01:29:14,000
take they would just out of like their

2301
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:17,000
own Panic that they are now faced with

2302
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:20,079
kind of carop loss they would kind of go

2303
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:25,079
above and beyond the need and they would

2304
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:29,439
like take Avid abamectin floramite by F

2305
01:29:25,079 --> 01:29:31,519
is8 Eagle 20 right Michelob betinol they

2306
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:35,359
do this like Trinity like maybe even a

2307
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:37,159
little forbid forf spinos or spicin you

2308
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:38,759
know and they would kind of mix them all

2309
01:29:37,158 --> 01:29:39,960
together and they would spray that on

2310
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:43,119
their plant in week five or six of

2311
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:45,399
flower right that's like akin to like I

2312
01:29:43,118 --> 01:29:47,639
mean the reality of like the what the

2313
01:29:45,399 --> 01:29:49,559
act of poisoning everybody that touches

2314
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:50,560
it from their on that's akin to like

2315
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,520
what's happening currently in

2316
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,760
agriculture with the desiccation of all

2317
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:57,600
the grain crops with [ __ ] up you know

2318
01:29:54,760 --> 01:30:02,079
and glyphosate to spray you know a week

2319
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:05,079
before Harvest yeah to if you dudea

2320
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:08,118
boards if you you mix all of it and any

2321
01:30:05,079 --> 01:30:10,679
of those might stay you will have those

2322
01:30:08,118 --> 01:30:12,439
will be resistant to that application

2323
01:30:10,679 --> 01:30:14,800
now I've seen it with forbid too I've

2324
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:17,479
I've seen people I've been called in to

2325
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:19,600
consult for several people over my time

2326
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:22,118
that have said they've done this crazy

2327
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:23,760
cocktail this number one mistake and

2328
01:30:22,118 --> 01:30:25,238
then they went back in again with them

2329
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,159
as individual

2330
01:30:25,238 --> 01:30:28,799
constituents and yeah balloons are

2331
01:30:27,158 --> 01:30:32,799
popping up like it's nuts because it's

2332
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:35,360
the truth it's it's insane that that is

2333
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,079
a in their mind and well that's ignorant

2334
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:40,519
unmindful use of these anti-life

2335
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:42,920
petrochemical World War II nerve agent

2336
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:44,880
type you know that's like without

2337
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:47,399
awareness doing something that's

2338
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,159
actually really like gnarly towards what

2339
01:30:47,399 --> 01:30:51,079
the

2340
01:30:49,158 --> 01:30:52,198
plants just just to wrap the point

2341
01:30:51,079 --> 01:30:54,238
though I'm sorry just to get back to

2342
01:30:52,198 --> 01:30:55,479
what archive was bringing up you know I

2343
01:30:54,238 --> 01:30:57,559
just wanted to kind of bring this up

2344
01:30:55,479 --> 01:31:01,799
because you know the I think the reality

2345
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:05,039
is um see it's like you know cannabis is

2346
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:07,960
re being reduced to this like commodity

2347
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:09,560
supply chain for Pure pursuit of profit

2348
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:11,319
capitalization that's being like

2349
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:13,840
expressed through all kinds of things

2350
01:31:11,319 --> 01:31:16,279
with you know the legal Market

2351
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:18,600
intentionally diverting 80% of what's

2352
01:31:16,279 --> 01:31:20,279
out there to the traditional market

2353
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,440
right passing a contamination Buck

2354
01:31:20,279 --> 01:31:24,359
outward there's it's happening kind of

2355
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:26,238
in in many different ways and flavor but

2356
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:27,719
I think a lot of it is kind of the dirty

2357
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:29,399
stuff because because the reality is is

2358
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:31,319
what we've seen in California you know

2359
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:33,879
it's like if you look at Prime Agland

2360
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:35,599
across the state and all the green zones

2361
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:37,960
that agriculture practice those are red

2362
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:40,159
zones for cannabis those those are the

2363
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:41,520
zones that are AG adjacent and you're

2364
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:44,559
probably going to be having this ongoing

2365
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:47,960
kind of like issue popping up right

2366
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:49,400
oh and you know but I think but the

2367
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:52,000
point I think I'm getting to there is

2368
01:31:49,399 --> 01:31:53,238
like you know like whenever I I think

2369
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,719
you know and I'm not saying that's just

2370
01:31:53,238 --> 01:31:55,799
because I'm part of a testing laboratory

2371
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:57,880
I'm a culture Anthropologist and

2372
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:59,320
ethnobotanist and kind of my passion is

2373
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:01,679
people and plants and kind of just

2374
01:31:59,319 --> 01:32:04,679
seeing through the lens of testing you

2375
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:06,800
know what this plant is doing and

2376
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:09,158
bringing to the world you know I think I

2377
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,960
think those that are in Integrity with

2378
01:32:09,158 --> 01:32:13,599
the spirit of the plant I mean because

2379
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:15,639
you know it like legalization is just a

2380
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,400
stupid like structure you know people

2381
01:32:15,639 --> 01:32:19,719
have been kind of in service this plant

2382
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:21,158
forever and you know go you know

2383
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:23,880
medicine's been going where it needs to

2384
01:32:21,158 --> 01:32:26,079
go and healing the world it's is it is

2385
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:28,480
is it clean and in Integrity with the

2386
01:32:26,079 --> 01:32:30,880
spirit of the plant or is it toxic right

2387
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:32,839
like all the dirty ass cartridges like

2388
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,279
that are could never pass a test here

2389
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:38,520
going east and that's where I think

2390
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:40,840
cartridges is the worst topic to on this

2391
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:42,840
idea of what is moving out of legal

2392
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:45,840
markets into the these other spaces and

2393
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:48,279
just also flooding that market you know

2394
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:50,239
but it's with a hyper toxified product

2395
01:32:48,279 --> 01:32:52,719
and so you know I think kind of testing

2396
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:54,359
just and then just our global

2397
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:56,000
perspective on

2398
01:32:54,359 --> 01:32:57,439
what it brings I think it brings a

2399
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,198
barrier of Entry I think it keeps the

2400
01:32:57,439 --> 01:33:01,000
integrity and spirit of the plant strong

2401
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:02,638
and I think those that are in Integrity

2402
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,760
with it were always going to find their

2403
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:08,319
way with the plant you know um and and

2404
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:10,920
and and yeah that was a very long-winded

2405
01:33:08,319 --> 01:33:13,840
thought but you know I think um it's the

2406
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:14,960
biggest issue and and it's like you know

2407
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,600
it's all but it's also the biggest

2408
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,600
competitive Advantage you know it's like

2409
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:21,280
those that you know have have operated

2410
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:23,520
by the code of conduct with this plant

2411
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:25,519
and work and solid with their word and

2412
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:27,360
Sol with how they cultivate solid with

2413
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,800
like the relations that that you know

2414
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:33,198
that you have with people you know kind

2415
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:35,600
of in in in growing together you know

2416
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:37,759
it's like it I think it's you know I

2417
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:40,520
think a big thing of the LA Times expose

2418
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:43,679
really exposed this and one of my great

2419
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:46,280
prayers and hopes around this is I feel

2420
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:48,440
like whenever the state of California is

2421
01:33:46,279 --> 01:33:49,840
now on a hyper alert about how big this

2422
01:33:48,439 --> 01:33:51,479
is an issue and it's going to become

2423
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:53,560
just a steady it's a it's a thing now

2424
01:33:51,479 --> 01:33:57,759
it's finally going to become fixed you

2425
01:33:53,560 --> 01:34:03,000
know and I think um the real value of

2426
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:05,119
clean quality bomb material and extracts

2427
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,960
is way undervalued because it's been

2428
01:34:05,118 --> 01:34:08,799
driven to Extinction in price with all

2429
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:12,158
this dirtiest like you know most

2430
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:14,320
contaminated most bulk biomass you know

2431
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:16,079
to where craft is explode or

2432
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:18,359
extinguished almost you know but I think

2433
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:19,840
the reality is is you know people have

2434
01:34:18,359 --> 01:34:22,960
been operating on the idea that cannabis

2435
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:24,880
is a commodity crop like you know just

2436
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:28,800
like price

2437
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:31,359
to that and but the reality is it's a

2438
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:33,239
scarce resource and I think the scarce

2439
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:35,158
resource you know whenever there's

2440
01:34:33,238 --> 01:34:37,198
actual testing and transparency and

2441
01:34:35,158 --> 01:34:40,279
integrity in the system that scarce

2442
01:34:37,198 --> 01:34:43,799
resource is I think what's going to like

2443
01:34:40,279 --> 01:34:46,079
become yeah seems like can the DCC be

2444
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:49,119
successful in policing this if the hemp

2445
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:51,158
Market is outside of it right it seems

2446
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:53,279
like they've got to get uh an equal

2447
01:34:51,158 --> 01:34:55,359
footing on the hemp Market I'm sorry to

2448
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:56,840
even talk anymore too but the reality

2449
01:34:55,359 --> 01:34:58,439
too I think Kevin that's that's the

2450
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:00,719
biggest thing like there I think the

2451
01:34:58,439 --> 01:35:03,559
definition of industrial hemp is is a is

2452
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:05,158
a curse on the plant you know because

2453
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:07,639
nobody's growing Industrial Hemp for

2454
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:09,599
fiber 99% of people growing Industrial

2455
01:35:07,639 --> 01:35:12,719
Hemp are growing type three cannabis you

2456
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:15,079
know and and without with a completely

2457
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:17,319
separate world that it has to apply to

2458
01:35:15,079 --> 01:35:20,079
or participate in you know where it's

2459
01:35:17,319 --> 01:35:22,319
just around this funny game around 3% as

2460
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:25,840
the definition you know there there's

2461
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:28,439
it's it and HCA that

2462
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:30,360
right% all game and it's and and and I

2463
01:35:28,439 --> 01:35:33,238
think until there's a federal kind of re

2464
01:35:30,359 --> 01:35:35,920
like a conversation around kind of being

2465
01:35:33,238 --> 01:35:37,519
cannaboid if if you know regulating type

2466
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,199
one type two type three cannabis that's

2467
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:42,080
Dr grown for drug or medicine

2468
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:43,960
cultivation that's within the same Zone

2469
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:46,639
actual industrial fiber for growing

2470
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:49,359
fiber is you know sure that doesn't need

2471
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:51,400
that that that's relaxed you know but

2472
01:35:49,359 --> 01:35:53,639
but anyway I totally talked way too much

2473
01:35:51,399 --> 01:35:56,559
and so I'll kind of just we'd love when

2474
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:58,679
when you talk too much come on spit this

2475
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:01,199
well that's why we that's why we started

2476
01:35:58,679 --> 01:36:04,199
testing in the first place is because

2477
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:06,839
Growers were inherently

2478
01:36:04,198 --> 01:36:10,960
untrustworthy there I said it you know

2479
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:14,800
uh so so many of them failed when we

2480
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:16,800
started testing and um what did they do

2481
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,360
they took it elsewhere and sold it

2482
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:22,400
because nobody else was testing so the

2483
01:36:19,359 --> 01:36:25,920
market showed me early and often

2484
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:28,039
070809 that that you know Alec as much

2485
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:31,399
as I want to believe in the Kumbaya

2486
01:36:28,039 --> 01:36:33,840
wonderful grower they were fewer and far

2487
01:36:31,399 --> 01:36:36,638
between and unfortunately they still are

2488
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:39,279
from time to you know even people who

2489
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:41,920
are growing industrially realize they

2490
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:43,439
have problems and that's even before we

2491
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:46,679
were talking you know how blading

2492
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:49,238
viroids you know so it's just

2493
01:36:46,679 --> 01:36:53,199
fascinating that the same conundrums the

2494
01:36:49,238 --> 01:36:56,118
same problems the same uh ethical issues

2495
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:59,079
that we discussing back then such as how

2496
01:36:56,118 --> 01:37:02,198
do we release this information then what

2497
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:04,039
is tested on humans versus what this is

2498
01:37:02,198 --> 01:37:06,158
still going on 15 years from now and

2499
01:37:04,039 --> 01:37:09,439
people are still being unethical with

2500
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:12,519
their grows and it's G to be interesting

2501
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:13,839
um moali and I we've been invited to go

2502
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:17,800
check out the

2503
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:19,719
usda's um germ plasm uh Harvest uh

2504
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:22,560
they're doing some Field Days in New

2505
01:37:19,719 --> 01:37:24,319
York in September so we're going to go

2506
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:26,800
check out they're grown over 500

2507
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:30,118
different varietals uh and they're also

2508
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:33,000
doing um density trials so it'll be

2509
01:37:30,118 --> 01:37:34,439
interesting to see uh what they're doing

2510
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,279
because they've been collecting germ

2511
01:37:34,439 --> 01:37:40,000
plasm since um

2512
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:42,198
2021 and yeah they're growing it out

2513
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,599
they're growing it out at six different

2514
01:37:42,198 --> 01:37:47,519
um facilities around the us but the

2515
01:37:44,599 --> 01:37:49,880
majority is it uh they're growing up in

2516
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:52,159
Upstate New York for their uh their own

2517
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:54,319
trial so it's going to be interesting to

2518
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:56,319
see how they hand it they actually

2519
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:59,599
created and made their own

2520
01:37:56,319 --> 01:38:01,319
decorticator uh which is strictly per

2521
01:37:59,599 --> 01:38:04,199
plant so it's nothing large in

2522
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:08,079
industrial but it'll be interesting to

2523
01:38:04,198 --> 01:38:09,839
see um what they're going to and towards

2524
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:12,760
um because it's

2525
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:14,360
yeah same issues nothing has has really

2526
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:16,480
changed you know we've got these ethical

2527
01:38:14,359 --> 01:38:18,439
Growers and now that we've become legal

2528
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:21,479
we've got the industrial problems you've

2529
01:38:18,439 --> 01:38:24,000
got as Wade was pointing out the indoor

2530
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:27,279
versus outdoor versus the Green house

2531
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,840
which um was very interesting to see as

2532
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:32,840
we just saw with the emerald cup do with

2533
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:36,279
its test we also saw the uh State Fair

2534
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:38,599
in California finally do a person's test

2535
01:38:36,279 --> 01:38:41,719
as opposed to just relying on you know

2536
01:38:38,599 --> 01:38:46,199
Laboratory Testing so you know it's

2537
01:38:41,719 --> 01:38:48,800
exciting the boundaries are being pushed

2538
01:38:46,198 --> 01:38:51,519
and we're expanding but we're still

2539
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:54,560
Contracting around these same issues and

2540
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:56,440
problems especially with the you know

2541
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:59,440
industrialization and our own little

2542
01:38:56,439 --> 01:39:01,879
10th Amendment little realities and uh

2543
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:05,919
hi I'm I'm in New Finland right now I'm

2544
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:07,719
way off on the uh the East Coast here so

2545
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,079
uh hi and greetings everybody it's great

2546
01:39:07,719 --> 01:39:13,158
to be back

2547
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:14,840
here I I think I think that that's an

2548
01:39:13,158 --> 01:39:16,519
important just just point is that and

2549
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:19,440
and the reason that we're going to this

2550
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:21,159
St trial and the reason that I'm FOC

2551
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:23,719
I've been focused on the a side of

2552
01:39:21,158 --> 01:39:25,198
cannabis a lot lately is because I've I

2553
01:39:23,719 --> 01:39:27,840
spent my whole life with the plant it's

2554
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:30,279
a sacred plant and it's my commity

2555
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:34,159
literally my entire life right it's been

2556
01:39:30,279 --> 01:39:37,920
my entire Journey with one plant and but

2557
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:41,000
to me that's about how we use the plant

2558
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:42,800
how our bodies use the plant the complex

2559
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,399
chemistry of the plant all the different

2560
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:49,400
uses of the plant but how the plant

2561
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:51,960
grows in the plant itself in terms of it

2562
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:55,000
its morphology and the agronomics about

2563
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:56,880
it to me that is just Agriculture and

2564
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:00,079
increasingly more and more the people

2565
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:02,800
who do cultivate that plant are just

2566
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:04,439
people who are Growers so we have this

2567
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:06,320
weird transition that we're having now

2568
01:40:04,439 --> 01:40:08,719
in the USDA is a perfect example of that

2569
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:12,399
is that we're entering this new cannabis

2570
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:15,319
agriculture phase and US custodians who

2571
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:16,679
are feel very you know passionate about

2572
01:40:15,319 --> 01:40:19,118
you know all the

2573
01:40:16,679 --> 01:40:21,639
complexities we have to pass that on to

2574
01:40:19,118 --> 01:40:23,639
them you know because this just I mean

2575
01:40:21,639 --> 01:40:25,560
capitalism is a hell of a drug right

2576
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:27,440
it's going to happen and and the biggest

2577
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:29,440
contributors to the dirty Vape pin in

2578
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:31,279
this in the country or in the in the

2579
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:33,839
state probably are the big Commercial

2580
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:36,198
Legal Growers honestly you know I know

2581
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,920
plenty of guys who make extract who can

2582
01:40:36,198 --> 01:40:39,279
tell you that when they purchase trim

2583
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,279
from Big commercial

2584
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:43,158
Growers like they say they do the little

2585
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:45,279
quick test and they go hey man this this

2586
01:40:43,158 --> 01:40:47,279
passes on flour it passes on trim it

2587
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:51,000
doesn't pass

2588
01:40:47,279 --> 01:40:53,519
on on the extract right so capitalism

2589
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,399
will be capitalism it'll do what it does

2590
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:58,679
whether you're a small farmer or a big

2591
01:40:55,399 --> 01:41:01,079
farmer right but the plant is a plant

2592
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:03,520
and it's a commodity to a lot of people

2593
01:41:01,079 --> 01:41:05,039
and it's now an international commodity

2594
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,360
and all these testing standards and

2595
01:41:05,039 --> 01:41:08,359
stuff that we kind of established here

2596
01:41:06,359 --> 01:41:10,719
in California Alec you had a lot to do

2597
01:41:08,359 --> 01:41:12,439
with like being a Pioneer on testing

2598
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:15,279
they're now being adopted by the entire

2599
01:41:12,439 --> 01:41:16,839
world cfu counts and stuff like that I

2600
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:19,880
mean the whole world now wants all

2601
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:21,880
cannabis to be irradiated

2602
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:24,840
right right because they didn't see the

2603
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:26,118
opportunity it's like you know or they

2604
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:27,920
set the land the standard like

2605
01:41:26,118 --> 01:41:31,479
Australia's standard and Great Britain's

2606
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:33,639
standard is 50 cfu that's it right

2607
01:41:31,479 --> 01:41:35,399
that's it man so it's like that's how is

2608
01:41:33,639 --> 01:41:38,760
their pesticide

2609
01:41:35,399 --> 01:41:40,759
testing because important yeah yeah

2610
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:42,880
absolutely well it's it's odorous you

2611
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:45,560
know and and that's the point is that

2612
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:47,560
like we we have you know we have to

2613
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:50,880
constantly navigate that intersection

2614
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:53,400
between a and culture and our and our

2615
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:55,239
community and honestly you know the way

2616
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:57,559
I see it going is it is just going to be

2617
01:41:55,238 --> 01:41:59,039
it's a commercial crop now so we have

2618
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:01,639
you know we got to think that way and at

2619
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:04,118
the same time protect it and protect the

2620
01:42:01,639 --> 01:42:06,118
small farmer and create premium products

2621
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:09,399
and stuff so we're not stuck in a weird

2622
01:42:06,118 --> 01:42:13,598
commodity world you know it's like $5

2623
01:42:09,399 --> 01:42:15,559
wine $50 wine $500 wine that's common in

2624
01:42:13,599 --> 01:42:16,960
the the grape growing world but cannabis

2625
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:19,520
is just like a baseline that goes a

2626
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,840
little bit over and below and that's

2627
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:23,920
where there's a lot of

2628
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:26,599
opportunity um but yeah know it's it's a

2629
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:29,639
mess and and and ATN brought up hop and

2630
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:32,719
vroid you know now lab shopping for

2631
01:42:29,639 --> 01:42:34,440
hopon vroid is the thing right where

2632
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:37,359
it's like this kind of weird self-de

2633
01:42:34,439 --> 01:42:38,960
feus kind of thing where people are now

2634
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:42,319
you know choosing the the most

2635
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:45,359
beneficial COA for their their own needs

2636
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:47,639
at that moment versus what does the

2637
01:42:45,359 --> 01:42:49,960
whole Community what does the entire

2638
01:42:47,639 --> 01:42:51,359
like a state of California need cannabis

2639
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:53,359
to be I mean they could have got they

2640
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:56,719
could have attacked hop late and five

2641
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:58,158
years ago and eradicated it by now if

2642
01:42:56,719 --> 01:43:00,520
they approached it like they do other

2643
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:02,519
crops you know it was a relatively

2644
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:04,920
simple approach

2645
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:07,960
so I wanted to raise my hand because

2646
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:09,840
since Kevin's here you know I I had sent

2647
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:12,599
him some samples through the years of of

2648
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:14,840
hot Lane vroid and it honestly scared

2649
01:43:12,599 --> 01:43:17,199
the crap out of me and made me rethink

2650
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:19,440
everything and you know Kevin you you

2651
01:43:17,198 --> 01:43:21,319
went pretty deep on it um with that

2652
01:43:19,439 --> 01:43:22,839
sample and then found other samples

2653
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:23,759
around the country and world I believe

2654
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:27,039
and

2655
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:29,560
kind of went on a tear um you know do

2656
01:43:27,039 --> 01:43:30,719
you believe that viroids are playing a

2657
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:34,000
role

2658
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:36,639
in how we're getting a lot of these

2659
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,198
products to market in terms of of

2660
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:41,239
they're why they're getting you know

2661
01:43:38,198 --> 01:43:44,079
petrius is such a a big deal and powder

2662
01:43:41,238 --> 01:43:45,718
mil pow mil do and so on and so forth

2663
01:43:44,079 --> 01:43:49,158
you think their immune systems of these

2664
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:51,239
plants are are being compromised and

2665
01:43:49,158 --> 01:43:53,759
therefore all these other things are

2666
01:43:51,238 --> 01:43:55,000
happening as a result is that

2667
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:56,719
yeah there's definitely a genetic

2668
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,118
component to this too in that there are

2669
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:00,560
plants out there that seem to keep this

2670
01:43:58,118 --> 01:44:02,719
in the roots and it's unclear whether

2671
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:04,400
they have a yield impact and that that's

2672
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:07,079
what was shown in the Hop industry too

2673
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:10,158
that they have plants that have marginal

2674
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:12,559
5% impact on on volatiles and those that

2675
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:14,559
have like 40% right so it it depending

2676
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:17,199
on your cultivar it can it can it can

2677
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:18,920
create a yield so if you got a plant

2678
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:22,238
that's that suffers from it and it's in

2679
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:24,039
the canopy um then you you you you

2680
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:26,479
probably got to get rid of those but but

2681
01:44:24,039 --> 01:44:27,719
the I think the problem we've seen is a

2682
01:44:26,479 --> 01:44:30,638
lot everyone's running around testing

2683
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:32,840
Roots um and you really got to test both

2684
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:34,279
uh mainly because there if you do that

2685
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,639
you'll Wipe Out the plants that keep it

2686
01:44:34,279 --> 01:44:37,238
in The Roots which are the ones that you

2687
01:44:35,639 --> 01:44:39,440
want to retain those are the ones that

2688
01:44:37,238 --> 01:44:41,559
are that are like tolerant of it um so

2689
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:43,439
we've we've got a few lines that we've

2690
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:45,000
been doing a lot of these experiments on

2691
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:46,638
uh and we can see that you can bring it

2692
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,479
completely into flower the only thing

2693
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:50,319
that'll differ with the plant that's

2694
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:53,198
infected versus not infected is it will

2695
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:55,359
turn purple uh on on the ones that

2696
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:56,919
infected but you won't you won't find it

2697
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:59,679
in the canopy you only find it in the

2698
01:44:56,920 --> 01:45:01,440
roots um you might find it in some green

2699
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:04,399
area of the canopy but anywhere the

2700
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:07,319
anthos sinins are off it is undetectable

2701
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:09,118
PCR um so we've been encouraging people

2702
01:45:07,319 --> 01:45:10,599
to like C that that particular line is

2703
01:45:09,118 --> 01:45:12,519
Jamaican line and it it's not

2704
01:45:10,599 --> 01:45:16,239
necessarily a commercial line it's it's

2705
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:17,520
an outdoor um line that's a type two um

2706
01:45:16,238 --> 01:45:19,238
so people have been trying to cross that

2707
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:20,800
into type ones to see if they can move

2708
01:45:19,238 --> 01:45:23,839
the trait into something that's more

2709
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,159
relevant for like an indoor grow um but

2710
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,880
uh there there is a risk there that if

2711
01:45:25,158 --> 01:45:28,439
you hyper test and you only test the

2712
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:31,199
roots that you're going to weed out the

2713
01:45:28,439 --> 01:45:32,759
plants that you might want to breed with

2714
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:34,479
so um you have to be a little bit

2715
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:36,079
careful on on like how you go about

2716
01:45:34,479 --> 01:45:37,158
doing it there and there there was for a

2717
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:39,439
while this period where everyone was

2718
01:45:37,158 --> 01:45:40,960
just testing Roots because it was always

2719
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:43,719
it was more easy to find

2720
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:45,480
there but uh that means that you're you

2721
01:45:43,719 --> 01:45:48,520
could be killing your moms that are

2722
01:45:45,479 --> 01:45:50,319
likely to survive this uh so the the

2723
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:52,520
testing in the in the canopy and in The

2724
01:45:50,319 --> 01:45:54,279
Roots usually in veg and in flower is

2725
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:55,880
the way to really figure it out um

2726
01:45:54,279 --> 01:45:57,599
because a lot of the plants it's

2727
01:45:55,880 --> 01:46:00,118
undetectable until you pop it into

2728
01:45:57,599 --> 01:46:02,279
flower and then and then that's then if

2729
01:46:00,118 --> 01:46:04,279
it's in the if it's in the leaves in the

2730
01:46:02,279 --> 01:46:06,840
canopy during flowering probably you're

2731
01:46:04,279 --> 01:46:09,639
going to have a yield issue uh and uh it

2732
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:11,800
is very transmissible uh it is not just

2733
01:46:09,639 --> 01:46:13,440
from scissors people are finding this in

2734
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:15,159
um in in the water now they've been

2735
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:17,559
doing testing they can see it's in in in

2736
01:46:15,158 --> 01:46:20,079
fertigation systems there's some papers

2737
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:22,760
suggesting hop stunt virid which is very

2738
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:24,439
similar moves around in fusarium spores

2739
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:26,400
um so that can go through you know

2740
01:46:24,439 --> 01:46:29,000
mycelium networks if you're in the same

2741
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:31,519
like root Zone spores that can move it

2742
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,279
around potentially we we have seen it in

2743
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:36,159
pollen uh now interesting thing about

2744
01:46:34,279 --> 01:46:38,279
pollen is if we take hlate and vared

2745
01:46:36,158 --> 01:46:39,799
positive pollen and pop it onto these

2746
01:46:38,279 --> 01:46:41,559
plants that are known to keep it in The

2747
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:44,800
Roots the seeds that come out of that

2748
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:46,320
are clean uh like like there's like 2%

2749
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,679
3% of them that are positive once you

2750
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:51,118
germinate them but most of them come out

2751
01:46:48,679 --> 01:46:52,359
clean um so there there there's other

2752
01:46:51,118 --> 01:46:53,439
studies others have done I think in

2753
01:46:52,359 --> 01:46:55,079
Arizona

2754
01:46:53,439 --> 01:46:56,559
with plants that are more susceptible to

2755
01:46:55,079 --> 01:46:59,279
this and their seed ratios are much

2756
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:01,039
hotter they're like 40 30 or 40% of the

2757
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:02,880
seeds that they pop are end up positive

2758
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:04,760
but those are plants that are known to

2759
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,400
not suppress it in into just the roots

2760
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:08,960
but they they're known for it to go into

2761
01:47:06,399 --> 01:47:10,479
the entire plant um there's nothing you

2762
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:12,480
can do much to treat this so I don't

2763
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:14,479
know that it's going to cause um a

2764
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:15,839
pesticidal lab shopping issue may maybe

2765
01:47:14,479 --> 01:47:18,319
there's people running around trying to

2766
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:20,079
get C ofas that show it's not there uh

2767
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:21,599
like in a nursery setting or something

2768
01:47:20,079 --> 01:47:23,639
but and most people we interact with

2769
01:47:21,599 --> 01:47:26,199
they want the sensitivity dial so hot

2770
01:47:23,639 --> 01:47:29,319
that it finds you know single molecules

2771
01:47:26,198 --> 01:47:31,319
um which again is is something I I

2772
01:47:29,319 --> 01:47:33,439
caution in that if you have plants that

2773
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:35,479
are keeping this suppressed at a really

2774
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:37,359
late CT and PCR that that means it's

2775
01:47:35,479 --> 01:47:39,238
very low in copy number their immune

2776
01:47:37,359 --> 01:47:41,519
system may be functioning with it fine

2777
01:47:39,238 --> 01:47:44,279
you may have a yield loss it it it may

2778
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:45,239
be a risk that it can move but um you

2779
01:47:44,279 --> 01:47:46,639
know there there's there's a big

2780
01:47:45,238 --> 01:47:48,718
difference between plants that are hot

2781
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:52,159
at a CT of 20 versus plants that are hot

2782
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:55,719
at a CT of 30 that's about a a 10 CTS is

2783
01:47:52,158 --> 01:47:58,679
is like uh what is that that's going to

2784
01:47:55,719 --> 01:48:00,359
be didn't we we saw that with the when

2785
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:02,079
we went on the wild goose chases going

2786
01:48:00,359 --> 01:48:04,238
through all the moms that I had trying

2787
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:06,719
to chase it and we we thought at one

2788
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:08,919
point that a whole lot had been infected

2789
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:10,719
and then we we kept on testing and all a

2790
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:12,079
sudden it just wasn't there anymore went

2791
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:13,920
away yeah you had some that are out at

2792
01:48:12,079 --> 01:48:15,679
past 30 and we're just like hold on

2793
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:17,800
don't kill those your your plant might

2794
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:20,719
just get rid of it yeah I went on it

2795
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:22,880
guys I went on a bender it was yeah yeah

2796
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:24,800
so and I think that's important you

2797
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,480
quantitative test because you know

2798
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:27,520
something has presence absence on this

2799
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:30,118
you you're not going to have that level

2800
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:31,320
of information yeah but the difference

2801
01:48:30,118 --> 01:48:33,118
between 20 and 30 is actually

2802
01:48:31,319 --> 01:48:34,799
thousandfold sorry uh so it's a

2803
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:36,399
thousandfold difference in in the virid

2804
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:38,320
concentration in the plant and so if

2805
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:39,158
your plant's keeping it out at really

2806
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:42,238
low

2807
01:48:39,158 --> 01:48:43,638
numbers uh I'm I'm curious about that

2808
01:48:42,238 --> 01:48:45,879
plant I want to breed with that plant

2809
01:48:43,639 --> 01:48:47,960
because it's suppressing it um as

2810
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:49,639
opposed to taking this kind of you know

2811
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:51,439
chop all your moms down and start over

2812
01:48:49,639 --> 01:48:54,639
thing because then then we lose all the

2813
01:48:51,439 --> 01:48:56,479
genetics up there uh and uh it it may

2814
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:59,560
end up setting us back as opposed to

2815
01:48:56,479 --> 01:49:01,598
moving us forward yeah yeah I had a

2816
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:03,400
plant Kevin that I tried I tried to

2817
01:49:01,599 --> 01:49:05,319
infect a plant that was just always

2818
01:49:03,399 --> 01:49:06,638
wouldn't test and I tried to infect it I

2819
01:49:05,319 --> 01:49:09,079
was actually grafting and I was like

2820
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:12,400
pouring actually run off into the roots

2821
01:49:09,079 --> 01:49:14,238
and it still would test negative um and

2822
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:16,759
then another friend that um has that

2823
01:49:14,238 --> 01:49:18,718
same plant just recently tested positive

2824
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:22,119
I'm not sure what the count was but the

2825
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:24,719
plant is healthy as can be and it's it's

2826
01:49:22,118 --> 01:49:27,399
it's one of those those Typhoid Mary

2827
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:30,719
kind of you know really um asymptomatic

2828
01:49:27,399 --> 01:49:32,319
plants but what noticed is that the

2829
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:35,800
slower rooting plants that have some

2830
01:49:32,319 --> 01:49:37,759
type of a fungal issue like every dted

2831
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:39,480
plant that like really really heavy dted

2832
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:41,440
flower when I rip open the crown the

2833
01:49:39,479 --> 01:49:43,598
crown there's always some type of a

2834
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:45,319
fungal thing going on there yeah so that

2835
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:49,520
relationship I'd really love to hear

2836
01:49:45,319 --> 01:49:49,519
more about how that hop latent and

2837
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:53,560
fungal yeah when they're when they're

2838
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:56,480
really hot with envir there's often

2839
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:59,039
fusarium aium around so um we we try to

2840
01:49:56,479 --> 01:50:00,519
we try to scan for those too but the um

2841
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:02,960
you know when we're when we're doing

2842
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:04,599
these challenge studies um for a while

2843
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,840
the field was just grinding up hop plate

2844
01:50:04,599 --> 01:50:08,760
and vroid positive plants and then

2845
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:11,599
trying to you knowa you know put those

2846
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:12,960
onto the leaves with some injury but

2847
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:14,039
when you do that you don't know what

2848
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,840
else you're introducing you could be

2849
01:50:14,039 --> 01:50:18,439
introducing the pythium and the ferium

2850
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:20,639
and and so uh to solve that you really

2851
01:50:18,439 --> 01:50:22,319
have to isolate hop PL and viroids so we

2852
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:24,199
went and actually synthesized a circular

2853
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:26,719
form this thing so we're now like the

2854
01:50:24,198 --> 01:50:28,519
Wuhan of of uh the [ __ ] hot plon

2855
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:30,319
viroid because we made the damn thing

2856
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:32,239
but when you do that you can get rid of

2857
01:50:30,319 --> 01:50:34,719
all the other unknowns you can inject it

2858
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:37,079
into plants at like you know 700 billion

2859
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:40,239
copies on an injection and these plants

2860
01:50:37,079 --> 01:50:42,078
don't take it right so uh you're never

2861
01:50:40,238 --> 01:50:44,598
going to get that from a from a Mite or

2862
01:50:42,078 --> 01:50:45,799
an insect or or um any of these Leaf

2863
01:50:44,599 --> 01:50:47,679
Hoppers they're just not going to move

2864
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:49,360
that much viate around but we we can

2865
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:51,840
take some of these plants and really

2866
01:50:49,359 --> 01:50:53,319
Hammer them with direct injection of 700

2867
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:56,599
billion of these molecules ules and they

2868
01:50:53,319 --> 01:50:58,039
don't end up getting positive uh so it's

2869
01:50:56,599 --> 01:51:00,039
um there are ones out there that are

2870
01:50:58,039 --> 01:51:01,519
tolerant to this thing if you ever and

2871
01:51:00,039 --> 01:51:03,078
you know they're positive in The Roots

2872
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:05,719
like two weeks after flowering so it's

2873
01:51:03,078 --> 01:51:08,000
in there we can see it that the CT start

2874
01:51:05,719 --> 01:51:09,399
to creep a little bit South on us when

2875
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,679
when it starts going into flowering but

2876
01:51:09,399 --> 01:51:13,118
it never ends up in the canopy so there

2877
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:14,719
there's a there's a set of plants out

2878
01:51:13,118 --> 01:51:16,198
there that we've got to keep our eye on

2879
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:19,560
that are going to get us breed us out of

2880
01:51:16,198 --> 01:51:21,439
this thing um and and the clear cutting

2881
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:23,000
approach of any positivity any signal at

2882
01:51:21,439 --> 01:51:25,198
all I think it's going to be really

2883
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,679
dangerous because we're going to end up

2884
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:29,919
uh basically obliterating all of these

2885
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:31,800
plants that you mentioned if you see any

2886
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:33,920
one Speck of this anywhere in the plant

2887
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:36,239
kill it is is like uh I I don't think

2888
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:37,399
that's how this is going to work um

2889
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:39,879
there's going to be some plants out

2890
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:41,719
there that that that can dance around it

2891
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:43,560
yeah we have we even saw like Mojave we

2892
01:51:41,719 --> 01:51:45,480
saw one of the Strawberry Cough plants

2893
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:49,000
that I've had for like I don't know 18

2894
01:51:45,479 --> 01:51:50,678
19 years that that you would never think

2895
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,399
that that would have anything if you

2896
01:51:50,679 --> 01:51:56,440
didn't test it so that's that's the

2897
01:51:53,399 --> 01:51:58,519
other part of this is it can be in the

2898
01:51:56,439 --> 01:52:01,839
canopy and you not know it until

2899
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:04,520
flowering yep so um definitely some

2900
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:06,920
instances there but we're counting on E

2901
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:09,079
Fletch out there let's get it let's get

2902
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:11,440
that je pool sorted we did see it with

2903
01:52:09,078 --> 01:52:13,599
some of your your Leaf Hoppers though

2904
01:52:11,439 --> 01:52:17,839
yeah that's true that was interesting so

2905
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:19,520
I I I had a I had the the UK cheese

2906
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:20,960
because I just kept it I just wanted to

2907
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,239
keep studying what would happen with it

2908
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:24,560
as it went through its life cycle

2909
01:52:22,238 --> 01:52:27,158
knowing that it had hot Laden so I stuck

2910
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:30,320
it in a part of my property that is just

2911
01:52:27,158 --> 01:52:31,598
like super isolated and then I thought

2912
01:52:30,319 --> 01:52:33,519
well why don't I put like a small

2913
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:35,119
Greenhouse here and put six plants in it

2914
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:37,239
that aren't that I know are absolutely

2915
01:52:35,118 --> 01:52:39,559
clean because I saw Leaf Hoppers I was

2916
01:52:37,238 --> 01:52:40,919
smoking a joint one day back there and I

2917
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:43,159
was just like watching these things just

2918
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:45,279
go boing I was like huh wonder if those

2919
01:52:43,158 --> 01:52:47,039
are munching on that and then passing it

2920
01:52:45,279 --> 01:52:49,359
around to all these other plants around

2921
01:52:47,039 --> 01:52:51,800
here and so I decided to put the

2922
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:54,920
greenhouse there and sure enough I sent

2923
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:56,719
Kevin the samples after you know week

2924
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:59,000
after week and we kept testing and all

2925
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:02,198
of a sudden it was like nothing and then

2926
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:04,840
boom it just hit for it um you know

2927
01:53:02,198 --> 01:53:06,799
there there are I mean it's you know

2928
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:10,039
this isn't rocket science here but it it

2929
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:12,560
was confirming and and really made me

2930
01:53:10,039 --> 01:53:14,439
feel you know like we needed to better

2931
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:17,199
understand more about the vectors than

2932
01:53:14,439 --> 01:53:20,198
we thought because that's it's not just

2933
01:53:17,198 --> 01:53:22,759
touch feel human I smoked a cigarette or

2934
01:53:20,198 --> 01:53:25,799
I touched on the plan or or whatever you

2935
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:27,520
know insert here it's a lot of things

2936
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,520
that we're not paying attention to

2937
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:33,639
around us in in the wild and that's as

2938
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:35,599
as outdoor Growers as a lot of us are we

2939
01:53:33,639 --> 01:53:38,159
don't know what's in our garden until

2940
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:40,360
it's far too late so it's it's um you

2941
01:53:38,158 --> 01:53:42,519
know it's it's just good to know ahead

2942
01:53:40,359 --> 01:53:45,359
of time that if you can test and use

2943
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:48,599
what Kevin's developed to to help you I

2944
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:50,078
know that at scale um I would have it

2945
01:53:48,599 --> 01:53:53,239
would have been devastating what I went

2946
01:53:50,078 --> 01:53:54,920
through to try to kind of go back and go

2947
01:53:53,238 --> 01:53:56,479
through all the moms like I did clean

2948
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:58,440
everything and then isolate them and

2949
01:53:56,479 --> 01:54:01,198
then bring them back in and the amount

2950
01:53:58,439 --> 01:54:03,519
of downtime that took was nuts I mean it

2951
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:04,960
just was really throwing everything out

2952
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:07,920
cleaning it making sure I didn't touch

2953
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:09,359
something that had it on it still oh and

2954
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:11,158
that that's a good point that's

2955
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:14,319
something I wanted to bring up earlier

2956
01:54:11,158 --> 01:54:16,799
is um you know some of these problems

2957
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:18,799
we're talking about they may kind of

2958
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:21,000
self-correct themselves due to the

2959
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:23,239
economics of cannabis long term like a

2960
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:25,560
lot of these really big Farms that

2961
01:54:23,238 --> 01:54:26,839
particularly like you're just saying

2962
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:28,960
going through these things is too

2963
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:30,920
expensive for them that's why they use

2964
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:32,239
all these alternative methods you know

2965
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:35,158
pesticides

2966
01:54:32,238 --> 01:54:37,039
Etc most of the reason those Farms still

2967
01:54:35,158 --> 01:54:39,598
exist to this day is because of the

2968
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:41,198
export market right that's the only way

2969
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:43,119
they're staying alive right because if

2970
01:54:41,198 --> 01:54:44,799
they had to sell all that oil in

2971
01:54:43,118 --> 01:54:46,158
California where they're growing it

2972
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:48,880
they're out of business there's no

2973
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:51,759
there's not enough consumers I mean most

2974
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:54,319
it like even the Thousand light grows I

2975
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:55,760
mean I know a lot of people that grow

2976
01:54:54,319 --> 01:54:58,439
most of the really big grows in

2977
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:00,960
California indoor grows they're it's

2978
01:54:58,439 --> 01:55:03,158
only trap packs keeping everybody alive

2979
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:05,439
right they can't sell all their flour

2980
01:55:03,158 --> 01:55:07,638
into the legal market and so a lot of

2981
01:55:05,439 --> 01:55:10,879
this just may be a you know a

2982
01:55:07,639 --> 01:55:12,639
self-correcting issue where essentially

2983
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:15,520
the

2984
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:17,599
when when all the different markets have

2985
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:19,679
their own cultivation like ma places

2986
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:22,078
like Massachusetts and Maryland and

2987
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:25,359
Florida used to be great export markets

2988
01:55:22,078 --> 01:55:27,198
for from California not so I mean people

2989
01:55:25,359 --> 01:55:29,158
still do it but it's not like it used to

2990
01:55:27,198 --> 01:55:31,359
be it used to be 100% of the product

2991
01:55:29,158 --> 01:55:34,078
going there came from you know the

2992
01:55:31,359 --> 01:55:35,960
traditional market and now a big portion

2993
01:55:34,078 --> 01:55:38,198
of the consumers are buying from big

2994
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:40,399
legal farms and and and then depending

2995
01:55:38,198 --> 01:55:43,000
on the state's laws you may continue to

2996
01:55:40,399 --> 01:55:44,679
have these issues but in places like

2997
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,359
Washington and Oregon pretty much all

2998
01:55:44,679 --> 01:55:48,480
the most of the big grows are all

2999
01:55:46,359 --> 01:55:52,319
shutting down and it's happening in a

3000
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:54,879
lot of other places too and um I think

3001
01:55:52,319 --> 01:55:57,319
Canada is a great example of it as well

3002
01:55:54,880 --> 01:56:00,840
like uh you I mean how many of those big

3003
01:55:57,319 --> 01:56:02,719
$300 million you know Hundred Acre

3004
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:03,760
indoor grows that can be growth put up

3005
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:05,840
are still

3006
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:07,520
operational um they're not and that

3007
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:10,159
because the market finally becomes

3008
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:14,320
localized once the export exporting of

3009
01:56:10,158 --> 01:56:16,279
all this excess product dissipates and

3010
01:56:14,319 --> 01:56:18,679
um and and then now you have to to

3011
01:56:16,279 --> 01:56:20,920
satisfy local consumers which are much

3012
01:56:18,679 --> 01:56:24,239
more picky than people that don't have

3013
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:26,440
access and Export markets

3014
01:56:24,238 --> 01:56:29,198
yeah no well

3015
01:56:26,439 --> 01:56:31,638
said and on that on that um

3016
01:56:29,198 --> 01:56:33,799
cdfa crop statistics report I mentioned

3017
01:56:31,639 --> 01:56:36,800
earlier there's about you know there's

3018
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:39,360
10 or 15 or 20 crops that are 100%

3019
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:41,960
produced in California for export to

3020
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:44,559
either the rest of the country or even

3021
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:46,319
considerable percentage to the world

3022
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:48,760
right and like Alec mentioned all the

3023
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:50,639
best Agland is in the red zone it's like

3024
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:53,800
the reality is if this eventually turns

3025
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:55,840
into agriculture and plants it's the

3026
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:58,039
economy of Agriculture you grow the

3027
01:56:55,840 --> 01:57:00,279
plants that are best suited for a

3028
01:56:58,039 --> 01:57:02,519
particular region for because of climate

3029
01:57:00,279 --> 01:57:04,279
and input and infrastructure cleanliness

3030
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:06,199
of the environment cleanliness of the

3031
01:57:04,279 --> 01:57:08,279
environment and all that and exactly and

3032
01:57:06,198 --> 01:57:10,000
that's that's kind of what California

3033
01:57:08,279 --> 01:57:12,679
was and what it will be and like I

3034
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,679
consult with people in places where and

3035
01:57:12,679 --> 01:57:15,239
I say to them from the beginning I'm

3036
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:17,719
like this is an opportunity for you guys

3037
01:57:15,238 --> 01:57:19,519
to be a part of cannabis right now but

3038
01:57:17,719 --> 01:57:22,319
in the future this all goes away because

3039
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:26,560
for you to grow the way you do now where

3040
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:29,000
it cost you $3 a gram $4 a gram to

3041
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:31,599
produce it it won't happen in the future

3042
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:34,520
when this is really grown as efficiently

3043
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:37,880
as it can be in places like California

3044
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:42,040
and can I ask you a question Mojave yeah

3045
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:46,039
um with uh if if like let's let's just

3046
01:57:42,039 --> 01:57:48,760
say export markets don't exist right and

3047
01:57:46,039 --> 01:57:50,800
you're just a producer in California

3048
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:54,280
what what percentage of the people

3049
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:56,639
growing like uh without an export like

3050
01:57:54,279 --> 01:57:58,880
let's say the state was really good at

3051
01:57:56,639 --> 01:58:00,800
enforcing the law and making sure that

3052
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:04,359
everything you grew in California had to

3053
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:06,320
be sold in California how many outdoor

3054
01:58:04,359 --> 01:58:08,359
and Greenhouse grows would there even

3055
01:58:06,319 --> 01:58:10,158
need to be there there's so many indoor

3056
01:58:08,359 --> 01:58:12,519
lights in California there there'd be

3057
01:58:10,158 --> 01:58:15,000
almost nonone existing on a localized

3058
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:16,560
consumer level absolutely and we grow

3059
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,920
enough weed often we grow enough weed

3060
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:20,840
for all our neighbors just in our own

3061
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:22,960
backyards you know so it's it all goes

3062
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:24,480
away and California is really good at

3063
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:26,599
that they're actually really good at go

3064
01:58:24,479 --> 01:58:28,638
if you go to if you go to uh the cdfa

3065
01:58:26,599 --> 01:58:31,159
and you say hey look I want to grow this

3066
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:32,920
crop next year they'll say hey whoa whoa

3067
01:58:31,158 --> 01:58:34,439
whoa whoa do you know we grow a lot of

3068
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:36,078
that crop and you're probably not going

3069
01:58:34,439 --> 01:58:38,118
to make that much money and if you guys

3070
01:58:36,078 --> 01:58:40,599
grow 20% or more of that crop then the

3071
01:58:38,118 --> 01:58:42,719
commodity price goes down and they

3072
01:58:40,599 --> 01:58:45,000
protect that they protect the commodity

3073
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:46,719
they protect the farmer and they even

3074
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,520
have I believe they even have mechanisms

3075
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:49,719
where they can even buy you out like hey

3076
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:52,119
look you know you're going to tank the

3077
01:58:49,719 --> 01:58:54,118
raisin industry right now and we want to

3078
01:58:52,118 --> 01:58:55,880
keep the prices at a certain point and

3079
01:58:54,118 --> 01:58:57,559
they subsidize you they subsidize your

3080
01:58:55,880 --> 01:59:00,960
farm in order to keep things like don't

3081
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:03,039
grow too much it's bad for everyone one

3082
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:06,439
and they didn't do that with cat I mean

3083
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:08,560
they just wild wild west right and and

3084
01:59:06,439 --> 01:59:11,439
they never really did the math the very

3085
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:13,360
basic math of what is what is needed and

3086
01:59:11,439 --> 01:59:14,399
to me but that applies and that applies

3087
01:59:13,359 --> 01:59:16,679
to the whole world though because

3088
01:59:14,399 --> 01:59:19,359
eventually cannabis will be normalized

3089
01:59:16,679 --> 01:59:21,000
it will be regular it'll be everywhere

3090
01:59:19,359 --> 01:59:23,399
and all these markets will have to

3091
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,039
adjust have to go like hey we did it for

3092
01:59:23,399 --> 01:59:28,359
a while but we don't do it anymore

3093
01:59:25,039 --> 01:59:29,880
because now Mexico's online or you know

3094
01:59:28,359 --> 01:59:32,399
California is back on interstate

3095
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:35,319
commerce it's all this big transition

3096
01:59:32,399 --> 01:59:37,399
and it's just it's all temporary yeah

3097
01:59:35,319 --> 01:59:39,920
and there is this land somewhere else

3098
01:59:37,399 --> 01:59:41,638
that doesn't have the red zone issue Etc

3099
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:44,000
I mean it's someone's going to find a

3100
01:59:41,639 --> 01:59:46,400
better solution to do it cheaper better

3101
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:48,319
whatever and access the market better

3102
01:59:46,399 --> 01:59:49,679
and in a lot of cases it you know

3103
01:59:48,319 --> 01:59:51,840
California is really just not

3104
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:53,960
competitive other than uh because you

3105
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,239
know cost of power cost of land cost of

3106
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:57,760
all these other things you know

3107
01:59:55,238 --> 01:59:59,839
pesticide everything else I mean I think

3108
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:02,119
you know Canada's probably not the best

3109
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:04,560
example because uh the out it's hard to

3110
02:00:02,118 --> 02:00:06,920
grow lots of outdoor relatively speaking

3111
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:10,520
there but you know what percentage of

3112
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:14,599
the Canadian Market uh legal Market is

3113
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:17,280
outdoor and greenhous grown um flow I

3114
02:00:14,599 --> 02:00:18,440
bet it's I bet it's less than the indoor

3115
02:00:17,279 --> 02:00:20,000
whatever it

3116
02:00:18,439 --> 02:00:23,719
is

3117
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:26,479
yeah Holland you have any idea of what

3118
02:00:23,719 --> 02:00:28,480
percentage in Canada it is I have no

3119
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:30,238
idea but I know that if you I mean look

3120
02:00:28,479 --> 02:00:31,959
at Holland Holland still crushes it on

3121
02:00:30,238 --> 02:00:33,559
egg export they don't have the climate

3122
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:35,279
for it but they said this is where we're

3123
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:37,480
going to be we're going to be a

3124
02:00:35,279 --> 02:00:40,039
greenhouse controlled environment

3125
02:00:37,479 --> 02:00:42,399
agriculture country and they nailed it

3126
02:00:40,039 --> 02:00:45,039
so it's like you can be that but if

3127
02:00:42,399 --> 02:00:47,319
you're competing with a pound of flower

3128
02:00:45,039 --> 02:00:50,719
grown in Vermont versus a pound of

3129
02:00:47,319 --> 02:00:52,960
flower grown in California in 10 years

3130
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:54,760
the costs are going to be very lopsided

3131
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:56,239
but if you're talking about like a a

3132
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:58,199
really beautifully grown bell pepper

3133
02:00:56,238 --> 02:01:00,839
from Holland versus a really beautifully

3134
02:00:58,198 --> 02:01:02,759
grown bell pepper from Canada they can

3135
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:05,920
compete because they're both the same

3136
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:07,800
model right because they're both but

3137
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:10,440
neither neither of those business models

3138
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:12,599
that they have exist without export as

3139
02:01:10,439 --> 02:01:14,678
well for all those bell peppers right

3140
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:16,239
it's like they never have that business

3141
02:01:14,679 --> 02:01:18,719
if they're just selling locally and

3142
02:01:16,238 --> 02:01:21,039
that's kind of my point is once it once

3143
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:23,198
everybody can grow indoor everywhere

3144
02:01:21,039 --> 02:01:24,639
legally to Supply their local market

3145
02:01:23,198 --> 02:01:27,118
most people are going to try to take

3146
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:29,520
advantage of that for for the financial

3147
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:31,598
reasons you don't have it that where's

3148
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:33,639
where's all this weed supposed to go to

3149
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:35,719
to third world countries that buy weed

3150
02:01:33,639 --> 02:01:38,159
for less than you can produce it for in

3151
02:01:35,719 --> 02:01:40,840
California no way it's not happening

3152
02:01:38,158 --> 02:01:42,598
it's going to go the other way what if

3153
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:46,840
what if I mean hypothetically like what

3154
02:01:42,599 --> 02:01:49,199
if cannabis like is only $50 a pound for

3155
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:51,279
beautiful sungrown outdoor cannabis and

3156
02:01:49,198 --> 02:01:52,839
then all a sudden all the indoor has to

3157
02:01:51,279 --> 02:01:55,118
rethink about like whoa whoa what kind

3158
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:58,039
of brands are we supporting with this

3159
02:01:55,118 --> 02:02:00,078
high cost is that what hemp is you're

3160
02:01:58,039 --> 02:02:01,519
only focusing on your customer base at

3161
02:02:00,078 --> 02:02:03,118
that point that's it you've had you've

3162
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:04,800
got your brand they like what you do

3163
02:02:03,118 --> 02:02:06,839
You' figured out a profit margin that

3164
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:09,239
works for them and you as a as a

3165
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:10,760
manufacturer and that's all you get

3166
02:02:09,238 --> 02:02:13,198
right Mojave it reminds me of

3167
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:15,000
strawberries in the 80s late 70s early

3168
02:02:13,198 --> 02:02:17,198
80s how they had to figure out how to

3169
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:19,158
chop California up and then export it

3170
02:02:17,198 --> 02:02:21,118
and figure out cold chain and do all

3171
02:02:19,158 --> 02:02:24,158
that there's actually a girl I met

3172
02:02:21,118 --> 02:02:26,039
that's got a uh he has a farm in in

3173
02:02:24,158 --> 02:02:27,920
Santa Barbara called farming first he he

3174
02:02:26,039 --> 02:02:29,880
runs it and he comes from that world and

3175
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:31,960
he talked a lot about his cost per pound

3176
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:34,520
to me when I first met him and I just

3177
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:37,359
was blown away that he was thinking

3178
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:39,280
about the minute details of of

3179
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:41,639
everything that we're speaking about

3180
02:02:39,279 --> 02:02:43,359
along the the the supply chain and what

3181
02:02:41,639 --> 02:02:45,400
that cost structure was of that that

3182
02:02:43,359 --> 02:02:47,759
pound and how that fit within the larger

3183
02:02:45,399 --> 02:02:50,000
model and what she was creating and it

3184
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:52,520
just literally was like a blow wind in

3185
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:54,238
my my hair was flying behind I was like

3186
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:57,480
wow you're you know you're you're

3187
02:02:54,238 --> 02:02:58,959
futurist thinking about this and he dris

3188
02:02:57,479 --> 02:03:00,118
and now driscolls is all over the world

3189
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:02,118
they're growing in Australia they're

3190
02:03:00,118 --> 02:03:03,519
growing they're grow in green houses in

3191
02:03:02,118 --> 02:03:05,799
Japan so it's like they took that

3192
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:07,920
they're like yeah we have to export this

3193
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:09,199
model yeah but it's it's a really

3194
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:10,880
interesting model in terms of

3195
02:03:09,198 --> 02:03:13,118
Agriculture because it's sort of our

3196
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:15,400
dichotomy of like how do we how do we

3197
02:03:13,118 --> 02:03:17,719
grow enough but how do we get it to

3198
02:03:15,399 --> 02:03:19,679
people for so it's fresh and then how is

3199
02:03:17,719 --> 02:03:22,679
it clean because there strawberries are

3200
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:24,199
some of the dirtiest you know in

3201
02:03:22,679 --> 02:03:27,760
dirtiest fruits in the world let's just

3202
02:03:24,198 --> 02:03:32,638
call that um and it

3203
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:35,280
all for can I think we got one big issue

3204
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:38,078
10% of the people smoke weed and 100% of

3205
02:03:35,279 --> 02:03:41,198
the people eat food the volume we need

3206
02:03:38,078 --> 02:03:43,880
to produce is a fraction tiny compared

3207
02:03:41,198 --> 02:03:46,879
to what the the a industry actually

3208
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:48,480
looks like I mean we're most of most of

3209
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:49,840
these business models that people think

3210
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:52,319
are going to work are never going to

3211
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:54,880
work in the future once the once

3212
02:03:52,319 --> 02:03:55,920
the the the playing field has been

3213
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:58,719
leveled

3214
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:01,440
worldwide yeah now I agree man I think

3215
02:03:58,719 --> 02:04:03,520
what you're alluding to is a very

3216
02:04:01,439 --> 02:04:04,919
simplistic thing that I've alluded I've

3217
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:07,280
got I've landed on often which is we've

3218
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:09,639
got it all wrong right and and we're

3219
02:04:07,279 --> 02:04:12,198
kind of um we're kind of in the middle

3220
02:04:09,639 --> 02:04:15,319
of of how do we go forward and how do we

3221
02:04:12,198 --> 02:04:16,678
do this be being mindful as we move

3222
02:04:15,319 --> 02:04:18,639
forward because we will get it wrong

3223
02:04:16,679 --> 02:04:20,319
again it's just a matter of what it's

3224
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:23,118
just we have to figure out the the

3225
02:04:20,319 --> 02:04:25,519
things we can change and and and of what

3226
02:04:23,118 --> 02:04:26,960
can we change what what impact can we

3227
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:29,119
make to make it better and I think

3228
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:32,118
that's you know we're all throwing great

3229
02:04:29,118 --> 02:04:34,078
ideas around today as to do that but

3230
02:04:32,118 --> 02:04:35,639
it's going to take someone in policy I

3231
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:38,519
think to really make sure that that

3232
02:04:35,639 --> 02:04:40,920
drives through so everyone follows the

3233
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:43,079
same plan right everyone's got to walk

3234
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:44,559
together so to speak right otherwise

3235
02:04:43,078 --> 02:04:46,960
it's like if one guy's over here

3236
02:04:44,559 --> 02:04:49,719
spraying Eagle 20 and the other guys you

3237
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:51,880
know growing perfectly and then you know

3238
02:04:49,719 --> 02:04:53,480
they both go to market and they're

3239
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:56,319
shopping to get their products and they

3240
02:04:53,479 --> 02:05:00,158
both get to Market somehow you know it's

3241
02:04:56,319 --> 02:05:02,439
a problem so that's might be alluded to

3242
02:05:00,158 --> 02:05:06,679
the control that every other industry

3243
02:05:02,439 --> 02:05:10,839
has figured out is subsidies and and and

3244
02:05:06,679 --> 02:05:12,679
uh um uh Growers unions right that's it

3245
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:15,559
where they control their supply chain

3246
02:05:12,679 --> 02:05:17,719
that's it we we met we control how much

3247
02:05:15,559 --> 02:05:20,840
you grow what you can sell it for you

3248
02:05:17,719 --> 02:05:23,000
can't [ __ ] it up for all of us um that's

3249
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:24,480
the only thing that that's worked for

3250
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,399
everything else for the last hundred

3251
02:05:24,479 --> 02:05:28,959
years essentially without that farming

3252
02:05:26,399 --> 02:05:32,198
in America is done John Deer tractors in

3253
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:34,439
America done all done without subsidies

3254
02:05:32,198 --> 02:05:36,279
and Growers unions yeah you're striking

3255
02:05:34,439 --> 02:05:38,479
Accord with me because I you know I come

3256
02:05:36,279 --> 02:05:40,000
from the you know I worked in film for a

3257
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:42,198
number of years and that's you know

3258
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,479
there's film unions for a reason because

3259
02:05:42,198 --> 02:05:45,839
when you call gaffer and you need

3260
02:05:43,479 --> 02:05:47,479
somebody to light your set they you know

3261
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:49,719
you have reliable people that you can

3262
02:05:47,479 --> 02:05:52,638
call to come you need a reliable grower

3263
02:05:49,719 --> 02:05:54,319
that can come and grow um that really

3264
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:55,840
makes a lot of sense to me but there is

3265
02:05:54,319 --> 02:05:58,078
you know there's a lot of conversation

3266
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:59,920
in between that I don't know if it's as

3267
02:05:58,078 --> 02:06:02,799
simple as saying we need just a union

3268
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:05,359
but I do think there's I like what you

3269
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:07,880
said there because it we do need to we

3270
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:09,479
need to have um checks and balances like

3271
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:12,440
like we need to have people that if

3272
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:15,319
we're going to bring in to pay them a

3273
02:06:12,439 --> 02:06:17,279
fee to consult or be on the team there

3274
02:06:15,319 --> 02:06:20,880
needs to be some sort of results or some

3275
02:06:17,279 --> 02:06:23,439
sort of uh you know checks and balances

3276
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:25,359
Man Behind why they're there um so I

3277
02:06:23,439 --> 02:06:27,039
think you're yeah you're striking CES

3278
02:06:25,359 --> 02:06:29,558
with me on that man but I I just don't

3279
02:06:27,039 --> 02:06:31,719
know how we would put it

3280
02:06:29,559 --> 02:06:34,360
together if I could kind of weigh in

3281
02:06:31,719 --> 02:06:36,158
real quick um you know you know just

3282
02:06:34,359 --> 02:06:40,399
thinking about cannabis as like this

3283
02:06:36,158 --> 02:06:42,759
idea of this National and international

3284
02:06:40,399 --> 02:06:45,558
export you know eventually right

3285
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:47,280
whenever there's been this you know

3286
02:06:45,559 --> 02:06:49,039
opening up of Interstate Commerce and

3287
02:06:47,279 --> 02:06:50,719
kind of like what's happening in Canada

3288
02:06:49,039 --> 02:06:53,800
Colombia and elsewhere where it's like

3289
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:56,439
internationally sporting right but um

3290
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:56,440
you know I

3291
02:06:56,840 --> 02:07:01,039
mean I think there's the the regional I

3292
02:06:59,719 --> 02:07:02,559
think move you're hitting on part of it

3293
02:07:01,039 --> 02:07:04,479
you know it's like this the Appalachian

3294
02:07:02,559 --> 02:07:06,719
region realities of kind of where

3295
02:07:04,479 --> 02:07:08,078
cannabis does grow best um and also

3296
02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:09,480
practices around understanding how to

3297
02:07:08,078 --> 02:07:10,639
care for it to the point of consumer

3298
02:07:09,479 --> 02:07:12,638
purchase to where you can actually

3299
02:07:10,639 --> 02:07:15,840
preserve the most precious aromatic

3300
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:17,679
attributes that Define the quality of it

3301
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:20,239
when it comes to the most sophisticated

3302
02:07:17,679 --> 02:07:23,719
understanding of the value of what it is

3303
02:07:20,238 --> 02:07:26,078
versus pure biomass right where all the

3304
02:07:23,719 --> 02:07:28,920
aromatics are gone right and it's

3305
02:07:26,078 --> 02:07:31,118
reduced then to a point of THC but it

3306
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:32,639
could still be distilled it can still

3307
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:34,759
you know be made into other types of

3308
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:37,480
products right but you know I think kind

3309
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:38,440
of the idea of like the leveling of

3310
02:07:37,479 --> 02:07:40,519
playing field you know I think it

3311
02:07:38,439 --> 02:07:42,118
happens within each state within and I

3312
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:44,840
think it happens with this ongoing

3313
02:07:42,118 --> 02:07:47,078
dialogue and and and what we like in

3314
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:49,360
each area where in I just proud of

3315
02:07:47,078 --> 02:07:51,880
understanding how the differentiator

3316
02:07:49,359 --> 02:07:54,319
really exists cuz you know like you

3317
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:57,078
can't just I mean you know such a big

3318
02:07:54,319 --> 02:07:58,439
reason why in Oklahoma there's such a

3319
02:07:57,078 --> 02:07:59,719
high percentage of indoor Farms versus

3320
02:07:58,439 --> 02:08:02,198
outdoor Farms is because you can't grow

3321
02:07:59,719 --> 02:08:04,679
outdoor in C in Oklahoma because of how

3322
02:08:02,198 --> 02:08:07,678
toxified the environment is because of

3323
02:08:04,679 --> 02:08:09,719
the last you know multiple Decades of

3324
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:11,279
Agriculture you know and and the amount

3325
02:08:09,719 --> 02:08:13,559
of erosion and the amount of heavy

3326
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:16,439
metals that blown around in the wind you

3327
02:08:13,559 --> 02:08:17,960
couldn't even pass a test you know um

3328
02:08:16,439 --> 02:08:19,598
and I think that speaks for a lot of the

3329
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:22,039
United States I think that speaks for a

3330
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:24,000
lot of the the world where Agri culture

3331
02:08:22,039 --> 02:08:25,719
happens right what what you know

3332
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:29,279
cannabis is helping to expose like what

3333
02:08:25,719 --> 02:08:33,679
you did to the land you know and so it's

3334
02:08:29,279 --> 02:08:35,960
like as if there is you know this actual

3335
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:37,559
kind of like rallied for lobbied for

3336
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:39,000
kind of you know I mean because just

3337
02:08:37,559 --> 02:08:40,279
speaking for California as an example

3338
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,920
California help you know kind of

3339
02:08:40,279 --> 02:08:43,840
established at the time you know I me

3340
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:45,880
because it's not about going so far just

3341
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:47,199
like each state or each country building

3342
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:49,078
on the next to make it even more and

3343
02:08:47,198 --> 02:08:50,719
more strict it's about testing for the

3344
02:08:49,078 --> 02:08:53,118
sake of public like maximizing public

3345
02:08:50,719 --> 02:08:56,198
health and safety you know but like not

3346
02:08:53,118 --> 02:08:57,799
putting such ridiculous regulations over

3347
02:08:56,198 --> 02:08:59,399
the top on it to where you have to

3348
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:01,880
gammer radiate and sterilize all your

3349
02:08:59,399 --> 02:09:03,799
weed and TP zap everything so now you

3350
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:06,440
are again reduced to a commodity you

3351
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:08,360
know but it's like there are testing

3352
02:09:06,439 --> 02:09:11,960
regulations that are rallied for and

3353
02:09:08,359 --> 02:09:13,799
lobbied for that help kind of Ensure the

3354
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:15,239
Integrity of this plant you know I think

3355
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:17,559
that's one of the biggest things that

3356
02:09:15,238 --> 02:09:19,519
those closest to the plant have like

3357
02:09:17,559 --> 02:09:20,880
such a competitive Advantage you know of

3358
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:22,440
knowledge and awareness around where to

3359
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:23,960
find land you know so many people spent

3360
02:09:22,439 --> 02:09:25,919
millions of dollars you I feel like the

3361
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:26,719
more hubis people come in with thinking

3362
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:28,480
they're just going to make a bunch of

3363
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:30,239
money is proportional to how quick they

3364
02:09:28,479 --> 02:09:32,879
face PL you know you see it on a

3365
02:09:30,238 --> 02:09:35,198
corporate level you see it on you know

3366
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:36,840
kind of all these huge multi hundreds of

3367
02:09:35,198 --> 02:09:38,678
million dollar losses and face plants

3368
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:41,719
that have happened because this isn't

3369
02:09:38,679 --> 02:09:43,520
just another agricultural commodity you

3370
02:09:41,719 --> 02:09:46,000
know and I think kind of you know

3371
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:48,199
leaning into what you know I think

3372
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,198
testing brings you know on a global

3373
02:09:48,198 --> 02:09:51,879
scale really helps I think solidify the

3374
02:09:50,198 --> 02:09:54,439
permanence of kind of those

3375
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:58,400
culturally connected to this plant um in

3376
02:09:54,439 --> 02:10:01,158
the long term you know um because it's

3377
02:09:58,399 --> 02:10:03,039
like cannabis is it's it's it's like

3378
02:10:01,158 --> 02:10:05,719
agriculture it's a very perishable

3379
02:10:03,039 --> 02:10:08,319
product you know in in in 30 40 days of

3380
02:10:05,719 --> 02:10:10,719
it's sitting at or above 70 degrees

3381
02:10:08,319 --> 02:10:12,519
temperature or you know the higher you

3382
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:14,800
get from there the quicker it happens

3383
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:16,520
the whole incredible loss factor of all

3384
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:18,599
volatile aromatics that Define the

3385
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:21,520
quality you know it's like I feel like

3386
02:10:18,599 --> 02:10:23,559
in each state like no no individual

3387
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:26,360
cultivator or manufacturer I think

3388
02:10:23,559 --> 02:10:29,199
that's working with the flower can you

3389
02:10:26,359 --> 02:10:31,238
know is even ready for interstate

3390
02:10:29,198 --> 02:10:32,919
commerce they haven't even in their own

3391
02:10:31,238 --> 02:10:34,879
State figured out how to preserve their

3392
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:36,840
turps you know preserve what they have

3393
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:38,800
in their possession you know it's like

3394
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:41,559
keep the cabbage in the

3395
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:43,760
fridge it's like what happens in two

3396
02:10:41,559 --> 02:10:46,559
weeks of just [ __ ] that off you know

3397
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:49,760
and and just allowing kind of it to just

3398
02:10:46,559 --> 02:10:51,800
completely lose its value as a as a as a

3399
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:54,559
vegetable you know and so I think kind

3400
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:56,199
of just you know the the per you know P

3401
02:10:54,559 --> 02:10:59,279
the perseverance and the resilience the

3402
02:10:56,198 --> 02:11:00,839
plant brings I think on on the level of

3403
02:10:59,279 --> 02:11:03,319
working with it and how much it helps

3404
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:05,360
you to like manage chaos and like figure

3405
02:11:03,319 --> 02:11:07,319
out and find the way and kind of learn

3406
02:11:05,359 --> 02:11:10,078
the lesson you know from the face PL

3407
02:11:07,319 --> 02:11:12,519
that happened before but um you know

3408
02:11:10,078 --> 02:11:15,960
there's so much like awareness there

3409
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:18,239
that I don't think you know any Farm on

3410
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:20,118
like big egg or big toac I mean I just

3411
02:11:18,238 --> 02:11:21,718
like there it's and this plant and

3412
02:11:20,118 --> 02:11:23,039
what's happening with it is the anthesis

3413
02:11:21,719 --> 02:11:24,880
of what they've done and what they what

3414
02:11:23,039 --> 02:11:27,279
they do and what they know you know and

3415
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:29,400
so so I think kind of you know being

3416
02:11:27,279 --> 02:11:32,198
able to kind of you know on that idea of

3417
02:11:29,399 --> 02:11:34,719
like you know and once this opens up and

3418
02:11:32,198 --> 02:11:37,359
it's direct consumer kind of in ways

3419
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:40,078
kind of like wine and the wine model I

3420
02:11:37,359 --> 02:11:41,519
mean it's like you know that across all

3421
02:11:40,078 --> 02:11:43,198
testing we've ever performed there's

3422
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:47,880
like you know it's about

3423
02:11:43,198 --> 02:11:49,719
1.4% uh um turp total TP content in

3424
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:51,480
dried flour and then all the other you

3425
02:11:49,719 --> 02:11:52,840
know non-tested Trace Evol volatile

3426
02:11:51,479 --> 02:11:55,879
aromatics that are even more volatile

3427
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:57,599
than the TPS but the potential one is

3428
02:11:55,880 --> 02:12:00,359
most sticky chronic you can stick it to

3429
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:02,239
a window is like 3 to 5 a half% like you

3430
02:12:00,359 --> 02:12:03,880
know and and you know it's also is there

3431
02:12:02,238 --> 02:12:05,638
in taking a Testing Lab a lot of testing

3432
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:08,400
labs are like 9% turps every time you

3433
02:12:05,639 --> 02:12:11,480
know so it's about real taling the data

3434
02:12:08,399 --> 02:12:13,359
but but the reality is is 60 to 80% of

3435
02:12:11,479 --> 02:12:15,799
all turps and all volatile aromatics are

3436
02:12:13,359 --> 02:12:17,598
gone by the time most herb is on

3437
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:20,360
dispensary shelves or retail shelves or

3438
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:25,880
G you know gas station shelves with some

3439
02:12:20,359 --> 02:12:28,319
Delta you hhc you know but um you know

3440
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:29,880
kind of like we've seen this like really

3441
02:12:28,319 --> 02:12:31,759
incredible thing happening in Oregon and

3442
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:33,559
in California where people have figured

3443
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:35,520
out like this continued cold supply

3444
02:12:33,559 --> 02:12:37,760
chain of custody where they like you

3445
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:39,679
know have very actively Monitor and like

3446
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:40,920
ensure like the rapidness to Market you

3447
02:12:39,679 --> 02:12:42,920
know because the average batch takes

3448
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:45,760
like 30 45 days to make a dispensary

3449
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:49,480
shelves that's a huge time for like loss

3450
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:51,719
to set in and you're like what was 3%

3451
02:12:49,479 --> 02:12:53,558
now at 1% cu the average on dispensary

3452
02:12:51,719 --> 02:12:55,599
shelves it's like 1% or less the average

3453
02:12:53,559 --> 02:12:57,719
pre-roll on dispensary shelves is like

3454
02:12:55,599 --> 02:12:59,719
half a percent or less it's like

3455
02:12:57,719 --> 02:13:01,239
cardboard like you know and I think

3456
02:12:59,719 --> 02:13:03,439
that's a big reason why people are just

3457
02:13:01,238 --> 02:13:05,439
like there's a market for the juicing of

3458
02:13:03,439 --> 02:13:07,638
like all these butterscotch flavors and

3459
02:13:05,439 --> 02:13:09,479
all these other things because nobody

3460
02:13:07,639 --> 02:13:11,118
can everybody's like running around

3461
02:13:09,479 --> 02:13:12,879
there's no brand loyalty everybody's

3462
02:13:11,118 --> 02:13:14,960
just chasing their tails trying to buy

3463
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:17,000
something that tastes or flavorful or

3464
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:19,239
has any type of uniqueness to it you

3465
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:21,760
know and so but the thing is is you know

3466
02:13:19,238 --> 02:13:23,118
we I think a lot of the Oregon farmers

3467
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:24,800
you know kind of like made it through

3468
02:13:23,118 --> 02:13:26,639
the collapse and kind of the like now

3469
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:28,760
rebuilding you know it's like they

3470
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:30,760
they've they've begun to substantially

3471
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:32,719
quickly be able to differentiate and you

3472
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:34,079
know build brand loyalty and sell it

3473
02:13:32,719 --> 02:13:35,920
quicker than it's trimmed at the highest

3474
02:13:34,078 --> 02:13:38,319
price the market can be in the deepest

3475
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:40,239
floods and California it's happening too

3476
02:13:38,319 --> 02:13:41,759
you know because those people they like

3477
02:13:40,238 --> 02:13:43,558
instead of continuously doubling down a

3478
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:45,520
production double down a tur

3479
02:13:43,559 --> 02:13:47,639
preservation infrastructure and like you

3480
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:49,440
know kind of maintaining super tight

3481
02:13:47,639 --> 02:13:51,559
temperature and humidity differentials

3482
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:53,319
to treat the herb you know so that

3483
02:13:51,559 --> 02:13:54,760
there's very little to no loss you know

3484
02:13:53,319 --> 02:13:57,158
and they're they're like working within

3485
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:59,480
the Kelvin cycle to harvest like before

3486
02:13:57,158 --> 02:14:01,479
sun rises and temperatures rise where

3487
02:13:59,479 --> 02:14:03,359
the off gassing of turf happen you know

3488
02:14:01,479 --> 02:14:05,039
so I think there's so much and like

3489
02:14:03,359 --> 02:14:06,679
ancestral awareness you know around

3490
02:14:05,039 --> 02:14:08,920
those working with the plant and they

3491
02:14:06,679 --> 02:14:11,960
give a [ __ ] you know that you know is

3492
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:14,319
kind of um you know areas where in each

3493
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:16,319
individual State people can really

3494
02:14:14,319 --> 02:14:19,599
figure out how to differentiate and how

3495
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:22,039
to like bring their turps like hundreds

3496
02:14:19,599 --> 02:14:23,960
of percent more isn't you know than

3497
02:14:22,039 --> 02:14:25,399
anything else on the market you know if

3498
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:27,039
you can figure that out you know I feel

3499
02:14:25,399 --> 02:14:29,078
like that that's what you know Oregon's

3500
02:14:27,039 --> 02:14:31,238
shown it's like and California it's like

3501
02:14:29,078 --> 02:14:32,519
it's that's how you build resilience

3502
02:14:31,238 --> 02:14:36,158
because at least what you have when it's

3503
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:37,840
not selling as quick is super preserved

3504
02:14:36,158 --> 02:14:40,319
and you can always kind of be on that

3505
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:42,279
highest end you know and then you know

3506
02:14:40,319 --> 02:14:44,439
and then kind of I think you know being

3507
02:14:42,279 --> 02:14:46,039
able to just like identify and work with

3508
02:14:44,439 --> 02:14:47,879
you know people you know because because

3509
02:14:46,039 --> 02:14:49,359
that's the thing it's like the the you

3510
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:50,559
know now that testing Integrity is

3511
02:14:49,359 --> 02:14:52,198
coming back in California and

3512
02:14:50,559 --> 02:14:54,840
everybody's freaked out that they're

3513
02:14:52,198 --> 02:14:57,118
going to get caught up in recalls or uh

3514
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:59,039
reputational damage scenarios because of

3515
02:14:57,118 --> 02:15:00,639
being associated with a [ __ ] lab you

3516
02:14:59,039 --> 02:15:02,359
know they're like it's shifting people's

3517
02:15:00,639 --> 02:15:03,800
priorities around like hey maybe if I'm

3518
02:15:02,359 --> 02:15:06,158
paying hundreds of thousands of dollars

3519
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:07,320
a year to a lab maybe I should work with

3520
02:15:06,158 --> 02:15:09,279
a lab that's going to set me up for

3521
02:15:07,319 --> 02:15:11,439
Success you know and I think that's

3522
02:15:09,279 --> 02:15:13,599
really what testing and kind of you know

3523
02:15:11,439 --> 02:15:15,678
offers you know with you know being able

3524
02:15:13,599 --> 02:15:17,520
to help you know kind of Ure you don't

3525
02:15:15,679 --> 02:15:20,520
fail you know and then don't and don't

3526
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:21,719
set up for massive fail scenarios by you

3527
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:23,679
know making sure you're not introducing

3528
02:15:21,719 --> 02:15:26,118
hopl and viroid or aspir Gillis to

3529
02:15:23,679 --> 02:15:28,480
cultivation and being able to kind of

3530
02:15:26,118 --> 02:15:30,479
you know like identify if the land

3531
02:15:28,479 --> 02:15:32,598
you're working on or it before you

3532
02:15:30,479 --> 02:15:34,158
purchase like a cut flower Greenhouse

3533
02:15:32,599 --> 02:15:36,159
you know see what kind of problems are

3534
02:15:34,158 --> 02:15:37,679
they going to haunt you you know and and

3535
02:15:36,158 --> 02:15:38,759
choose like you know but I think a lot

3536
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:41,319
of these things are the biggest

3537
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:43,840
differentiating factors that as testing

3538
02:15:41,319 --> 02:15:45,359
regulations really set in you know and

3539
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:47,279
and the Integrity in it is happening

3540
02:15:45,359 --> 02:15:49,920
because you're seeing just the the whole

3541
02:15:47,279 --> 02:15:51,800
like lab uh fraudulent thing it's like

3542
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:54,039
it's a national top in every state and

3543
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:56,279
it's huge news you know and it's I think

3544
02:15:54,039 --> 02:15:57,639
the more that there becomes Integrity in

3545
02:15:56,279 --> 02:15:59,479
that states kind of build their own

3546
02:15:57,639 --> 02:16:02,440
testing labs and test the testers it's

3547
02:15:59,479 --> 02:16:06,078
going to help really like um in the long

3548
02:16:02,439 --> 02:16:08,198
run help individual groups be able to

3549
02:16:06,078 --> 02:16:10,238
differentiate and survive in a state and

3550
02:16:08,198 --> 02:16:12,158
then as it goes National and even more

3551
02:16:10,238 --> 02:16:14,399
International like have the biggest you

3552
02:16:12,158 --> 02:16:15,679
know differentiating factors because

3553
02:16:14,399 --> 02:16:17,839
heavy metal testing in California

3554
02:16:15,679 --> 02:16:20,199
nobody's ever in the United States have

3555
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:22,360
have had heavy metal testing in place

3556
02:16:20,198 --> 02:16:23,919
you know like in in Europe they have

3557
02:16:22,359 --> 02:16:26,238
really you know 10 years ago they put in

3558
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:29,000
really strict uh heavy metal testing

3559
02:16:26,238 --> 02:16:31,718
requirements and the international caca

3560
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:34,239
Market learned that cadmium and Cacao is

3561
02:16:31,719 --> 02:16:35,879
a really big issue you know and it's a

3562
02:16:34,239 --> 02:16:38,359
fighter remediate of cadmium and if it's

3563
02:16:35,879 --> 02:16:40,079
grown around areas where egg happens it

3564
02:16:38,359 --> 02:16:42,079
remediates out of the soil it pulls out

3565
02:16:40,079 --> 02:16:44,079
of the soil into the cacao and now you

3566
02:16:42,079 --> 02:16:46,718
have like super high levels of cacao in

3567
02:16:44,079 --> 02:16:49,200
the in the bean and so so International

3568
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:51,119
chocolate makers had to learn this and

3569
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:54,280
clean up their whole supply chain and

3570
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:55,760
mix you know mountainous grown cacao

3571
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:57,280
with other cacao to kind of make sure

3572
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:59,478
that they don't fail just so they can

3573
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:00,599
sell into the European Union you know

3574
02:16:59,478 --> 02:17:01,920
the only other people in the United

3575
02:17:00,599 --> 02:17:04,398
States that have ever figured that out

3576
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:05,920
are cannabis farmers in California you

3577
02:17:04,398 --> 02:17:07,879
know it's like

3578
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:09,478
because because heavy metal testing has

3579
02:17:07,879 --> 02:17:11,039
been implemented nothing in the United

3580
02:17:09,478 --> 02:17:13,199
States has been that way so I mean

3581
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:16,160
that's I think a huge different you know

3582
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:19,200
the ability to survive in a export

3583
02:17:16,159 --> 02:17:20,558
Market I think in areas where testing

3584
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:21,399
and public health and safety is going to

3585
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:22,840
be a thing

3586
02:17:21,398 --> 02:17:25,119
I think is going to be ultimately the

3587
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:26,239
biggest thing that helps the culture and

3588
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:28,120
those like that give a [ __ ] about the

3589
02:17:26,239 --> 02:17:30,760
plant survive and it's going to keep out

3590
02:17:28,120 --> 02:17:32,200
the cooks you know and the these like

3591
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:34,000
you know hubristic dudes that are just

3592
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:36,159
face planning left and

3593
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,799
right Alec I want to go back to

3594
02:17:36,159 --> 02:17:40,439
something that you had said earlier you

3595
02:17:37,799 --> 02:17:43,159
know you were talking about um closed

3596
02:17:40,439 --> 02:17:45,760
loop extraction and

3597
02:17:43,159 --> 02:17:48,318
concentrating so like you you could you

3598
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:50,960
could run a clean test on flower

3599
02:17:48,318 --> 02:17:53,519
material that that would look clean

3600
02:17:50,959 --> 02:17:56,959
would pass but then when you extract

3601
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:59,920
that material you would actually see now

3602
02:17:56,959 --> 02:18:02,598
things failing because you're you're

3603
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:05,719
concentrating you know the oily cuticle

3604
02:18:02,599 --> 02:18:08,239
off the plant so like like I'm looking

3605
02:18:05,718 --> 02:18:10,959
at some data here

3606
02:18:08,239 --> 02:18:12,638
so it it's I mean and and you're

3607
02:18:10,959 --> 02:18:16,718
probably more aware of this than anyone

3608
02:18:12,638 --> 02:18:19,239
else on this panel is that the level of

3609
02:18:16,718 --> 02:18:22,759
sophistication of our analytical

3610
02:18:19,239 --> 02:18:26,959
toolbox has in inreased exponentially in

3611
02:18:22,760 --> 02:18:30,159
like the last 10 to 15 years right like

3612
02:18:26,959 --> 02:18:34,518
like we we can see picograms now we

3613
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:36,478
could see things that you know again I I

3614
02:18:34,519 --> 02:18:38,840
used to use the analogy of taking a lint

3615
02:18:36,478 --> 02:18:41,318
brush to a New York City sidewalk we're

3616
02:18:38,840 --> 02:18:45,639
gonna find everything like you're you're

3617
02:18:41,318 --> 02:18:50,799
gonna you you can't necessarily put the

3618
02:18:45,638 --> 02:18:53,839
spec at zero PPM right because you know

3619
02:18:50,799 --> 02:18:56,558
beond PPM there's there's what that's

3620
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:59,359
ppb and then you go down to parts per

3621
02:18:56,558 --> 02:19:01,398
trillion but so the the the thing I

3622
02:18:59,359 --> 02:19:04,120
wanted to show you I wanted to pull up

3623
02:19:01,398 --> 02:19:06,239
some recent data for my of of of mine so

3624
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:08,800
we're we're able to make we're able to

3625
02:19:06,239 --> 02:19:11,079
make a check this out dude because even

3626
02:19:08,799 --> 02:19:13,799
like a handful of years ago on hash

3627
02:19:11,079 --> 02:19:17,398
church we were talking about this and we

3628
02:19:13,799 --> 02:19:20,199
were still in like the low 90s but we

3629
02:19:17,398 --> 02:19:23,199
could routinely produce from clean

3630
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:26,040
flowers that test clean for heavy metals

3631
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:29,920
that test clean for pesticides we can

3632
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:34,439
routinely produce a live resin where the

3633
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:36,318
THC Total is is in the high 770s total

3634
02:19:34,439 --> 02:19:39,280
cannabinoids is about

3635
02:19:36,318 --> 02:19:42,318
91% total tpin in these live resin

3636
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:45,239
sauces are like seven and a half per.

3637
02:19:42,318 --> 02:19:47,159
when you add up these percentages man

3638
02:19:45,239 --> 02:19:49,559
there ain't a whole lot left man that's

3639
02:19:47,159 --> 02:19:51,239
like like on hash Church like I think we

3640
02:19:49,559 --> 02:19:52,920
were on maybe like about four or five

3641
02:19:51,239 --> 02:19:55,959
years ago right Mark and we were talking

3642
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:59,120
about you know what is that last little

3643
02:19:55,959 --> 02:20:01,519
bit like how can we find out like and

3644
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:04,880
and you know Ian Oswald and those guys

3645
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:07,800
down at abstracts basically now teasing

3646
02:20:04,879 --> 02:20:10,799
out all these volatile sulfur components

3647
02:20:07,799 --> 02:20:15,478
so if I add volatile sulfur components

3648
02:20:10,799 --> 02:20:18,719
on my live resin that I'm testing 99 99

3649
02:20:15,478 --> 02:20:20,719
plus so when I just take the tpes alone

3650
02:20:18,719 --> 02:20:25,239
add that to the cannabinoids and this is

3651
02:20:20,719 --> 02:20:27,879
from a third- party lab I'm at like 99

3652
02:20:25,239 --> 02:20:29,478
plus percentage so I've

3653
02:20:27,879 --> 02:20:33,358
characterized

3654
02:20:29,478 --> 02:20:35,358
99% of what's in my jar to me I mean

3655
02:20:33,359 --> 02:20:38,680
that's just right from where we were

3656
02:20:35,359 --> 02:20:41,439
just even like four five years ago C

3657
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:43,559
extraction not live resin kind of you

3658
02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:45,920
yeah there's been that's [ __ ] huge

3659
02:20:43,559 --> 02:20:48,279
like there there's like no big unknown

3660
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:51,478
in there I mean

3661
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:52,760
again what what's that no sorry well

3662
02:20:51,478 --> 02:20:54,559
because I mean the if you look at the

3663
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:56,840
anatomy of a bud you know primarily

3664
02:20:54,559 --> 02:20:58,680
canabo within the your glandular troms

3665
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:00,200
and resin right primarily cannaboids

3666
02:20:58,680 --> 02:21:02,318
followed by the primary and secondary

3667
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:04,200
TPS right there which really five to

3668
02:21:02,318 --> 02:21:06,000
nine of them really constitute a

3669
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:08,520
majority of what is there you know that

3670
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:11,079
could be in flour up to 3 to 5 and a

3671
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:13,720
half% in life resin like yeah up to like

3672
02:21:11,079 --> 02:21:15,799
7 to % you know kind of from what we've

3673
02:21:13,719 --> 02:21:17,279
seen you know and like when you start

3674
02:21:15,799 --> 02:21:19,079
getting that all together and there's

3675
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:21,560
this like remaining percentage which you

3676
02:21:19,079 --> 02:21:24,559
know it's it's not a lot but you know

3677
02:21:21,559 --> 02:21:26,719
that three plus percent whatever more

3678
02:21:24,559 --> 02:21:28,398
less you know kind of based on

3679
02:21:26,719 --> 02:21:30,159
extraction process based on Purity based

3680
02:21:28,398 --> 02:21:32,318
on kind of you know live reson versus

3681
02:21:30,159 --> 02:21:34,159
not you know there is all these other

3682
02:21:32,318 --> 02:21:36,639
yeah volatile Trace aromatics right that

3683
02:21:34,159 --> 02:21:39,840
really Define kind of so much of the

3684
02:21:36,639 --> 02:21:42,039
flavor and Aroma aspects right um flavor

3685
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:44,398
Bas basically what the point I'm trying

3686
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:49,840
to make here is that yeah I mean to me

3687
02:21:44,398 --> 02:21:51,358
we're real close to describing 100% of

3688
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:54,439
everything that's in the jar like

3689
02:21:51,359 --> 02:21:57,720
there's no like Mystery Oil or weird

3690
02:21:54,439 --> 02:21:59,479
[ __ ] from like 10 years ago parts per

3691
02:21:57,719 --> 02:22:00,639
100 but you're looking at Parts some

3692
02:21:59,478 --> 02:22:02,199
some of these pesticides are down in

3693
02:22:00,639 --> 02:22:04,239
parts per thousand you know another

3694
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:06,359
decimal place over or parts per million

3695
02:22:04,239 --> 02:22:08,159
which is even further right so we're

3696
02:22:06,359 --> 02:22:10,559
getting close though right Kevin I mean

3697
02:22:08,159 --> 02:22:13,159
we're it seems like again so what I'm

3698
02:22:10,559 --> 02:22:14,478
trying to what I'm trying to illustrate

3699
02:22:13,159 --> 02:22:16,239
which I don't think I'm doing a good job

3700
02:22:14,478 --> 02:22:19,879
at describing better quantitating yeah

3701
02:22:16,239 --> 02:22:22,719
not only has there been a a increase in

3702
02:22:19,879 --> 02:22:25,000
the level of precision and accuracy of

3703
02:22:22,719 --> 02:22:28,760
what we can test for in cannabis

3704
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:34,159
products including down to the ppb and

3705
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:37,200
EPT levels but extraction has really

3706
02:22:34,159 --> 02:22:39,200
become oh yeah you know really I think

3707
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:41,040
has come a long way I mean to where

3708
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:44,560
black oil crud

3709
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:47,439
to open blasting with Mystery Oil and

3710
02:22:44,559 --> 02:22:49,079
God knows what else was in that crap I

3711
02:22:47,439 --> 02:22:51,079
remember when indur used to be on

3712
02:22:49,079 --> 02:22:53,600
remember Marcus when indur would would

3713
02:22:51,079 --> 02:22:55,559
come on hash church and we would try to

3714
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:58,720
talk to him about testing and he was

3715
02:22:55,559 --> 02:23:02,039
always kind of really guarded because he

3716
02:22:58,719 --> 02:23:04,679
thought that his process was somehow

3717
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:08,280
unique when really passing a hydrocarbon

3718
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:10,280
solvent over you know cannabis and

3719
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:12,159
extracting the oal resin wow that's

3720
02:23:10,280 --> 02:23:14,920
pretty pretty much like making drip

3721
02:23:12,159 --> 02:23:16,478
coffee I mean there's not's not L I

3722
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:18,760
thought the one thing he did that was

3723
02:23:16,478 --> 02:23:21,000
novel was dimple the inside of his

3724
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:25,478
reactor to create cavitation and

3725
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:28,398
eliminate channeling that impressed

3726
02:23:25,478 --> 02:23:30,639
me yeah I guess I was never able to see

3727
02:23:28,398 --> 02:23:32,519
like a set of data that showed the

3728
02:23:30,639 --> 02:23:34,879
impact that that had either in

3729
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:36,560
productivity or resin quality but from

3730
02:23:34,879 --> 02:23:38,839
what I remember because I used to always

3731
02:23:36,559 --> 02:23:41,879
have conversations about him about

3732
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:45,279
testing and that's when this whole

3733
02:23:41,879 --> 02:23:47,278
Mystery Oil thing was coming into play

3734
02:23:45,279 --> 02:23:49,120
and it was always thought of that well

3735
02:23:47,279 --> 02:23:52,079
if you're multiply distilling your

3736
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:55,920
solvent your constantly taking just the

3737
02:23:52,079 --> 02:23:57,799
vles off but could there be in your in

3738
02:23:55,920 --> 02:24:00,000
your early fractions if you don't do

3739
02:23:57,799 --> 02:24:02,318
multiple distillations could there be

3740
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:05,398
that Mystery Oil the crap from the

3741
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:07,000
lubrication of the couplings you know

3742
02:24:05,398 --> 02:24:09,879
when they're handling hydrocarbon

3743
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:11,799
solvents and other [ __ ] you remember

3744
02:24:09,879 --> 02:24:13,920
that stuff Alec we were talking about

3745
02:24:11,799 --> 02:24:16,000
that years ago on hash church trying to

3746
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:18,680
figure out like what that last little

3747
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:22,318
few percent of some

3748
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:24,239
aleric Florine polymer [ __ ] that

3749
02:24:22,318 --> 02:24:26,879
comes along with the ride and these

3750
02:24:24,239 --> 02:24:28,079
gases well on on the on the aromatic

3751
02:24:26,879 --> 02:24:29,799
side of things which is really cool

3752
02:24:28,079 --> 02:24:32,039
because Yeah you mentioned abstracts

3753
02:24:29,799 --> 02:24:33,799
definitely epic did some very pioneering

3754
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:36,000
research helping to kind of really just

3755
02:24:33,799 --> 02:24:38,119
show kind of the some of these Realties

3756
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:40,639
right which are you know because in the

3757
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:42,079
aromatics you know the majority of

3758
02:24:40,639 --> 02:24:44,039
what's there are the primary and

3759
02:24:42,079 --> 02:24:46,799
secondary tpin that very well probably

3760
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:49,439
have the most biologically active

3761
02:24:46,799 --> 02:24:50,840
effects you know Entourage canono stuff

3762
02:24:49,439 --> 02:24:53,520
but then there's all these other

3763
02:24:50,840 --> 02:24:56,239
part per billion part per TR you know

3764
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:59,200
trillion part per you know thousand type

3765
02:24:56,239 --> 02:25:01,079
level compounds that are there in tiny

3766
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:03,560
fraction the level of turpins but you

3767
02:25:01,079 --> 02:25:07,159
know clearly have substantial effects on

3768
02:25:03,559 --> 02:25:09,398
adding Aroma or flavor to you know bring

3769
02:25:07,159 --> 02:25:12,359
out the uniqueness of various aspects of

3770
02:25:09,398 --> 02:25:14,239
cannabis and and uh you know identifying

3771
02:25:12,359 --> 02:25:16,479
you know helping you know like the idea

3772
02:25:14,239 --> 02:25:19,039
of thols right the sufar compounds that

3773
02:25:16,478 --> 02:25:22,199
really bring the gas aspect you know

3774
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:24,439
which seem to be very vola right like um

3775
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:25,920
you know relative to TPS right and then

3776
02:25:24,439 --> 02:25:27,720
there's like these other types of

3777
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:29,439
compounds that are the what you know

3778
02:25:27,719 --> 02:25:31,679
they describe is the Tropicana sulfur

3779
02:25:29,439 --> 02:25:32,800
compounds right and uh you know that I

3780
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:34,239
wanted to bring up a story about the

3781
02:25:32,799 --> 02:25:35,559
emerald cup with that I thought was

3782
02:25:34,239 --> 02:25:38,119
really fascinating because we we

3783
02:25:35,559 --> 02:25:39,840
extended this year you know because you

3784
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:44,520
know over the last few years we've been

3785
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:47,040
we'll test chemotype canab turps um you

3786
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:50,079
know of all the entrance you know help

3787
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:53,000
to sort and by Aroma and flavor right

3788
02:25:50,079 --> 02:25:54,920
and this way um grouping like with like

3789
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:57,040
right so Jack and Hayes Jack and Hayes

3790
02:25:54,920 --> 02:26:01,040
tropical floral tropical floral aamine

3791
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:03,720
right gas desserts sweet and dream types

3792
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:05,520
exotic right so we've we had that right

3793
02:26:03,719 --> 02:26:06,639
um you know but it was really

3794
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:07,880
interesting because over last couple

3795
02:26:06,639 --> 02:26:09,318
years we started to see this really

3796
02:26:07,879 --> 02:26:11,358
fascinating Trend right because

3797
02:26:09,318 --> 02:26:15,199
historically Tangi right smell of Tangi

3798
02:26:11,359 --> 02:26:16,920
forbidden fruit uh Calo Agent Orange

3799
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:20,359
right it's miring really really high

3800
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:22,398
miring low every other tpping right um

3801
02:26:20,359 --> 02:26:25,399
very distinct smell right and it's

3802
02:26:22,398 --> 02:26:27,439
actually it's not a turp right it's trop

3803
02:26:25,398 --> 02:26:30,478
these tropican sulfur type compounds

3804
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:31,600
that um that abstracts is describing you

3805
02:26:30,478 --> 02:26:33,318
know but what's actually interesting

3806
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:36,800
about those is you know and this is just

3807
02:26:33,318 --> 02:26:38,879
a pure observation from my nose and just

3808
02:26:36,799 --> 02:26:40,519
smell of cannabis over the years I don't

3809
02:26:38,879 --> 02:26:41,719
think it's that volatile I think it

3810
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:43,399
actually sticks I think it's one of the

3811
02:26:41,719 --> 02:26:46,079
ones that's like really heavy and it

3812
02:26:43,398 --> 02:26:49,079
sticks around like as all the atps go

3813
02:26:46,079 --> 02:26:52,799
away right it's super present smell um

3814
02:26:49,079 --> 02:26:54,200
across you you know these these these uh

3815
02:26:52,799 --> 02:26:56,639
these different profiles but the point I

3816
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:58,319
wanted to make was you know so

3817
02:26:56,639 --> 02:27:02,000
historically right there's all these

3818
02:26:58,318 --> 02:27:03,680
Tangi forbidden fruit um you know Calo

3819
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:05,079
and orange types that they were always

3820
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:06,398
in the sweet and dream category but over

3821
02:27:05,079 --> 02:27:08,639
the last couple years in the emerald cup

3822
02:27:06,398 --> 02:27:10,398
we started observationally anecdotally

3823
02:27:08,639 --> 02:27:14,639
through our nose and through the judge's

3824
02:27:10,398 --> 02:27:16,639
nose be we started to see the um this

3825
02:27:14,639 --> 02:27:18,278
smell popping up in other primary

3826
02:27:16,639 --> 02:27:19,920
turpine categories so we'd see it

3827
02:27:18,279 --> 02:27:21,560
popping up in the dessert category over

3828
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:24,359
the last couple years the dessert

3829
02:27:21,559 --> 02:27:26,199
category carry off Ling loning like

3830
02:27:24,359 --> 02:27:28,760
which is a lot of the gelato sedding

3831
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:30,880
cakes Sunday driver type strains so

3832
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:35,359
those um like all of a sudden there's

3833
02:27:30,879 --> 02:27:37,599
Mimosa right there's um um tropican uh

3834
02:27:35,359 --> 02:27:39,720
there's there's Sangria right and those

3835
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:41,760
are and those are strains that wash

3836
02:27:39,719 --> 02:27:44,478
really well in hash making and that's

3837
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:47,000
and those are The Carling lening strains

3838
02:27:44,478 --> 02:27:49,199
and that smell started showing up there

3839
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:50,639
but then also like this year like we we

3840
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:52,880
even saw

3841
02:27:50,639 --> 02:27:54,599
um in the Emeral cup data we even saw

3842
02:27:52,879 --> 02:27:57,358
like things like like is if you've ever

3843
02:27:54,600 --> 02:27:59,399
smelled um Clementine right or orange

3844
02:27:57,359 --> 02:28:01,279
creamsicle which just one one of the

3845
02:27:59,398 --> 02:28:04,358
awards in the emerald cup of farms

3846
02:28:01,279 --> 02:28:06,479
essencia um and it's h it it's got that

3847
02:28:04,359 --> 02:28:08,559
Tangy like citrus smell but it's in the

3848
02:28:06,478 --> 02:28:10,639
terpinolene category right like

3849
02:28:08,559 --> 02:28:12,719
Clementine there's like fenos that like

3850
02:28:10,639 --> 02:28:14,760
straddle the edge of being one of the

3851
02:28:12,719 --> 02:28:17,679
other you know but it's again the shared

3852
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:19,159
kind of um aromatic that's a non- turp

3853
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:21,880
and so this year in the Amal cup we

3854
02:28:19,159 --> 02:28:22,879
actually you know kind of where science

3855
02:28:21,879 --> 02:28:24,920
you know because a lot of these

3856
02:28:22,879 --> 02:28:26,398
compounds too like in flour like in

3857
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:28,120
extract sure you might be able to start

3858
02:28:26,398 --> 02:28:30,760
testing them but in flour they're like

3859
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:34,040
undetectable you know by most even most

3860
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:35,359
sensitive instrumentation you know and

3861
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:37,279
and even and for what it's worth a lot

3862
02:28:35,359 --> 02:28:39,120
of these aromatics they don't even make

3863
02:28:37,279 --> 02:28:40,760
it through Harvest because people are

3864
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:43,160
harvesting in the middle of the day in

3865
02:28:40,760 --> 02:28:44,920
the hottest times outside of the Kelvin

3866
02:28:43,159 --> 02:28:46,959
cycle where the off gassing of the

3867
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:49,760
aromatics happen in the early part of

3868
02:28:46,959 --> 02:28:51,919
the day and so so I think kind of you

3869
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:53,359
know and and also how people dry you

3870
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:55,120
know a lot of these really precious

3871
02:28:53,359 --> 02:28:56,520
aromatics don't make it through I think

3872
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:58,120
some of them like the tangin notes they

3873
02:28:56,520 --> 02:29:01,279
make it through past when the turbines

3874
02:28:58,120 --> 02:29:02,760
go but um but my point is is uh this

3875
02:29:01,279 --> 02:29:05,359
year in the emerald cup you know

3876
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:07,200
everything T sorted they gets anonymized

3877
02:29:05,359 --> 02:29:09,840
presented to the judges within its own

3878
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:12,880
category um so like red stickers the

3879
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:15,799
penene Jack and hay types um but you but

3880
02:29:12,879 --> 02:29:18,039
this year because we you know we noticed

3881
02:29:15,799 --> 02:29:21,920
that that smell of Tangi like that that

3882
02:29:18,040 --> 02:29:25,200
Citrus hint um it was it was it was

3883
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:27,159
probably there was probably as many of

3884
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:30,079
that smell entered as there were at like

3885
02:29:27,159 --> 02:29:31,959
OG and gas in the whole competition and

3886
02:29:30,079 --> 02:29:34,039
what was so funny was everybody was

3887
02:29:31,959 --> 02:29:35,438
entering it thinking it was exotic they

3888
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:37,319
were entering it into what they were

3889
02:29:35,439 --> 02:29:39,680
calling the Exotic you know because we

3890
02:29:37,318 --> 02:29:42,079
get you know Amal cup opens for people

3891
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:44,279
to be able to kind of uh put what they

3892
02:29:42,079 --> 02:29:46,239
think category it should be in and

3893
02:29:44,279 --> 02:29:48,960
everybody was entering Tangi and stuff

3894
02:29:46,239 --> 02:29:50,559
as and Mimosa as exotic and it you know

3895
02:29:48,959 --> 02:29:52,438
and so it turned out to be like

3896
02:29:50,559 --> 02:29:55,000
as much or more as the whole gas

3897
02:29:52,439 --> 02:29:58,200
category so so basically all the judges

3898
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:00,680
after the anonymized sort presention

3899
02:29:58,200 --> 02:30:02,399
present of the data in our judges kits

3900
02:30:00,680 --> 02:30:04,680
when everybody was going through you

3901
02:30:02,398 --> 02:30:07,398
know all the judges were empowered to

3902
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:09,760
take you know to with their nose you

3903
02:30:07,398 --> 02:30:12,119
know single out any that smelled citrusy

3904
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:15,159
note it and single out any that smelled

3905
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:18,120
truly exotic to them and and

3906
02:30:15,159 --> 02:30:20,159
market and um and and so yeah so we

3907
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:21,120
created its own tarpine class you that

3908
02:30:20,159 --> 02:30:23,478
we're going to be presenting through the

3909
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:25,439
data like that was you know the judge

3910
02:30:23,478 --> 02:30:28,398
you know the

3911
02:30:25,439 --> 02:30:31,040
um consensus of the data of like the

3912
02:30:28,398 --> 02:30:34,079
judge's picks of the smell you know kind

3913
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:37,560
of correlating and those kind of being

3914
02:30:34,079 --> 02:30:39,398
going into their own category and um and

3915
02:30:37,559 --> 02:30:40,600
then judged within that category and

3916
02:30:39,398 --> 02:30:41,719
because because basically there was a

3917
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:44,559
tremendous amount of the entries that

3918
02:30:41,719 --> 02:30:45,799
were in the Mir scene category there's a

3919
02:30:44,559 --> 02:30:48,760
tremendous amount of those entries that

3920
02:30:45,799 --> 02:30:50,199
were in the Kling line dessert category

3921
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:53,239
and there was a couple that were in the

3922
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:54,800
turpening category and so so yeah but

3923
02:30:53,239 --> 02:30:57,239
take take a look to to Mark's Point here

3924
02:30:54,799 --> 02:30:58,679
on the percentages um so the the

3925
02:30:57,239 --> 02:31:00,159
abstract folks presented a canat a

3926
02:30:58,680 --> 02:31:03,720
couple years now and it's what's really

3927
02:31:00,159 --> 02:31:05,600
cool about data is how low concentration

3928
02:31:03,719 --> 02:31:08,840
these things are and how pungent they

3929
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:10,318
are right there this is H the vsc3 in

3930
02:31:08,840 --> 02:31:12,120
the the bosio

3931
02:31:10,318 --> 02:31:14,478
gelato which is the one that's got the

3932
02:31:12,120 --> 02:31:17,040
highest of factory score is micrograms

3933
02:31:14,478 --> 02:31:18,438
per Mig uh and that's so micrograms per

3934
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:21,120
Mig that's about one in a thousand

3935
02:31:18,439 --> 02:31:24,239
micrograms are 10us 6 are 10us 3rr so

3936
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:26,200
that's a 10 Theus um three effect there

3937
02:31:24,239 --> 02:31:29,478
and they're talking about 10us 2 of that

3938
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:31,399
so that's like one part per 100,000

3939
02:31:29,478 --> 02:31:33,639
creating uh one of the highest all

3940
02:31:31,398 --> 02:31:35,840
Factory scores so just fascin these

3941
02:31:33,639 --> 02:31:38,680
sulfur compounds are really really

3942
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:41,478
potent terms of the a human's nose to

3943
02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:44,200
pick them up like like orders of

3944
02:31:41,478 --> 02:31:46,559
magnitude like right two orders of

3945
02:31:44,200 --> 02:31:48,000
magnitude right several yeah I mean I

3946
02:31:46,559 --> 02:31:50,159
the turps are in the percentages which

3947
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:52,159
are parts per 100 this we're talking

3948
02:31:50,159 --> 02:31:55,439
thousands like a thousand times

3949
02:31:52,159 --> 02:31:57,520
more uh more potent yeah no and that's

3950
02:31:55,439 --> 02:32:01,600
the beauty of the human nose and the old

3951
02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:03,359
fact yeah fact spectoscopy yeah it's the

3952
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:04,680
most sensitive Mass spectrometer on the

3953
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:06,318
planet you know and that's what's really

3954
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:10,239
cool about kind of the thing the themo

3955
02:32:06,318 --> 02:32:12,840
cup is like to you know be able to you

3956
02:32:10,239 --> 02:32:14,439
know as science is kind of helping to

3957
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:16,120
Define some of these things be able to

3958
02:32:14,439 --> 02:32:17,960
take and push the system based on our

3959
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:19,520
own nose and ability to kind of sort

3960
02:32:17,959 --> 02:32:20,799
things these categories but that's

3961
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:24,520
what's really fascinating too to me

3962
02:32:20,799 --> 02:32:28,759
Kevin and and uh and Dr Mark you know is

3963
02:32:24,520 --> 02:32:30,680
just how um some of these super Trace

3964
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:33,120
part per billion whatever level

3965
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:36,279
compounds that are there like in this

3966
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:39,160
sulfur world you know there's the gas

3967
02:32:36,279 --> 02:32:41,800
which to me like from own anecdotes and

3968
02:32:39,159 --> 02:32:44,680
just data what I've seen the gas note

3969
02:32:41,799 --> 02:32:47,239
goes away Way quicker than the turps do

3970
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:51,040
right as opposed to the tangin note

3971
02:32:47,239 --> 02:32:53,920
which observationally stays way longer

3972
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:56,600
as the turps go away so I think type of

3973
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:58,760
correlation there could could could

3974
02:32:56,600 --> 02:33:01,680
couldn't there be kind of like a like I

3975
02:32:58,760 --> 02:33:03,840
I always when I think about Turpin and

3976
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:06,359
the odor of cannabis I always think of a

3977
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:09,159
symphony right so if you think like

3978
02:33:06,359 --> 02:33:11,720
there could be a couple violins and

3979
02:33:09,159 --> 02:33:14,359
there could be you know a couple violas

3980
02:33:11,719 --> 02:33:17,920
and really I mean like if if you think

3981
02:33:14,359 --> 02:33:20,880
about it like so yeah you have the

3982
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:23,840
lenine right which is not loning right

3983
02:33:20,879 --> 02:33:27,000
so so and the interesting thing about

3984
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:30,040
venine venine if you open a bottle of it

3985
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:35,559
smells just like Valencia oranges but

3986
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:37,560
when you when you take so valencene is a

3987
02:33:35,559 --> 02:33:39,879
sesquiterpenoid and or it's a

3988
02:33:37,559 --> 02:33:43,719
sesquiterpene actually and when it

3989
02:33:39,879 --> 02:33:48,000
oxidizes up to the sesquiterpenoid

3990
02:33:43,719 --> 02:33:50,278
none it changes it to

3991
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:53,959
grapefruit so it's so

3992
02:33:50,279 --> 02:33:56,600
[ __ ] cool thinking that again venine

3993
02:33:53,959 --> 02:33:59,799
can basically convert to a more

3994
02:33:56,600 --> 02:34:02,720
grapefruit note just on oxidation and

3995
02:33:59,799 --> 02:34:05,879
that might be happening say like in the

3996
02:34:02,719 --> 02:34:09,199
Cure of the flour so maybe like Valentin

3997
02:34:05,879 --> 02:34:12,119
is kind of like a a pre turpenoid

3998
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:14,279
precursor that ultimately in the Cure

3999
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:16,040
cures up to nud katone which again is

4000
02:34:14,279 --> 02:34:18,200
going to give a more grapefruit kind of

4001
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:20,520
flavor and if I could just give a quick

4002
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:23,960
shout out to uh

4003
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:26,040
skunkman Sam and Rob Clark on their Roma

4004
02:34:23,959 --> 02:34:28,919
story here

4005
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:30,840
um we always wanted to Define what skunk

4006
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:32,040
was like for a long time like what does

4007
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:34,719
the skunk smell because we knew it

4008
02:34:32,040 --> 02:34:37,200
wasn't a turp um and Rob and I wrote an

4009
02:34:34,719 --> 02:34:40,239
article for cannabis business times in

4010
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:41,760
2018 where we pointed out that we

4011
02:34:40,239 --> 02:34:43,439
couldn't say it was in cannabis because

4012
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:46,040
we don't have a lab and we didn't do any

4013
02:34:43,439 --> 02:34:49,720
of that but we found the literature in

4014
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:54,560
hops that that THS were in Hops and the

4015
02:34:49,719 --> 02:34:57,199
junky odor in beer that goes off is a

4016
02:34:54,559 --> 02:34:58,760
thle so we we we we put that out there

4017
02:34:57,200 --> 02:35:00,560
but but one of the points that was

4018
02:34:58,760 --> 02:35:02,520
interesting is it was also a thle that

4019
02:35:00,559 --> 02:35:06,039
was being created through photo

4020
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:08,279
decomposition so it was in it was in The

4021
02:35:06,040 --> 02:35:10,760
Hop it's in the Hops we know that it's

4022
02:35:08,279 --> 02:35:13,840
in the wart it's in the Brew but in

4023
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:16,559
green beer green bottled beer like hinin

4024
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:18,600
and beex and all these German Imports

4025
02:35:16,559 --> 02:35:21,439
that gets photo decomposition and that

4026
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:24,079
creates even a more files when you crack

4027
02:35:21,439 --> 02:35:26,479
that top and you smell that skunky Aroma

4028
02:35:24,079 --> 02:35:28,439
that's that's photo decomposition so I

4029
02:35:26,478 --> 02:35:31,039
guess to Alex's point is that it is

4030
02:35:28,439 --> 02:35:33,000
actually possibly not only is it in

4031
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:36,680
there but it's also continuing to be

4032
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:38,520
created in the plant itself in the Cure

4033
02:35:36,680 --> 02:35:40,639
over time I don't know but that was just

4034
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:42,120
an interesting and the way the where I

4035
02:35:40,639 --> 02:35:44,159
got that is when I moved to Amsterdam in

4036
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:46,960
93 and the first time I opened up a

4037
02:35:44,159 --> 02:35:49,719
brown bottle Heineken and took a drink I

4038
02:35:46,959 --> 02:35:52,478
was like this isn't hinin this a totally

4039
02:35:49,719 --> 02:35:54,719
different beer and then I found out that

4040
02:35:52,478 --> 02:35:56,478
all hinin that goes export to the US

4041
02:35:54,719 --> 02:35:58,840
goes in a green bottle because it's a

4042
02:35:56,478 --> 02:36:00,438
thing and all hinin domestically goes

4043
02:35:58,840 --> 02:36:02,318
into a brown bottle because brown

4044
02:36:00,439 --> 02:36:05,960
bottles block out the light that causes

4045
02:36:02,318 --> 02:36:08,159
that skunky odor and so the the hop

4046
02:36:05,959 --> 02:36:09,478
world had studied that and researched it

4047
02:36:08,159 --> 02:36:11,200
knew all about it and it was kind of

4048
02:36:09,478 --> 02:36:14,039
like a little inside joke about the

4049
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:16,520
skunkin in in beer and how it was a

4050
02:36:14,040 --> 02:36:18,200
green bottle thing um so anyway I I

4051
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:20,439
think that's just that's interesting

4052
02:36:18,200 --> 02:36:22,680
it's it's there's the not nose and it's

4053
02:36:20,439 --> 02:36:24,600
just constantly changing is also the

4054
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:26,479
problem right all I was going to point

4055
02:36:24,600 --> 02:36:27,960
out is the structure of these things um

4056
02:36:26,478 --> 02:36:29,519
some of you may be familiar with these

4057
02:36:27,959 --> 02:36:31,039
look like the precursors to the turpine

4058
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:34,680
pathway that are getting

4059
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:36,160
dilated yeah so there's a I I don't know

4060
02:36:34,680 --> 02:36:38,079
how you know maybe it's enatic maybe

4061
02:36:36,159 --> 02:36:40,359
it's maybe it's light but it's uh it's

4062
02:36:38,079 --> 02:36:43,359
definitely uh an interesting whole new

4063
02:36:40,359 --> 02:36:43,359
arena in the Cannabis

4064
02:36:43,559 --> 02:36:51,719
field no they're prenol sulfides and so

4065
02:36:47,239 --> 02:36:53,799
obviously isoprene is the is the um is

4066
02:36:51,719 --> 02:36:57,358
the starting material for that Kevin it

4067
02:36:53,799 --> 02:36:59,599
it might it might be um right yeah it

4068
02:36:57,359 --> 02:37:02,880
might be I right right a with a

4069
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:05,159
phosphate on there but um yeah it's

4070
02:37:02,879 --> 02:37:07,398
super interesting to think about like

4071
02:37:05,159 --> 02:37:10,680
where does that sulfur come from because

4072
02:37:07,398 --> 02:37:13,239
biological sulfur is something that is a

4073
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:16,359
you know atom of economy I mean mother

4074
02:37:13,239 --> 02:37:20,279
nature uses sulfur all the time right

4075
02:37:16,359 --> 02:37:23,120
it's in cysteine uh methionine

4076
02:37:20,279 --> 02:37:24,920
right and so I was thinking like because

4077
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:26,399
if you look at one of those compounds if

4078
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:29,879
you could pull up those structures again

4079
02:37:26,398 --> 02:37:33,079
Kevin one of those compounds is actually

4080
02:37:29,879 --> 02:37:37,478
a um it's got a C

4081
02:37:33,079 --> 02:37:41,039
C5 tho in it and it's actually optically

4082
02:37:37,478 --> 02:37:44,039
active uh okay now not it it was the

4083
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:46,920
previous set of structures one of those

4084
02:37:44,040 --> 02:37:48,760
structures is actually optically active

4085
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:52,680
and it could basically be again some

4086
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:54,760
kind of cysteine or homosysteine kind of

4087
02:37:52,680 --> 02:37:57,479
pathway

4088
02:37:54,760 --> 02:38:00,478
uh yeah no those aren't the ones neither

4089
02:37:57,478 --> 02:38:05,799
might be from from their more recent

4090
02:38:00,478 --> 02:38:07,639
work okay yeah um but yeah that so again

4091
02:38:05,799 --> 02:38:09,920
just going back to the overall theme

4092
02:38:07,639 --> 02:38:14,278
though is that is that between

4093
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:17,120
extraction and between analysis of

4094
02:38:14,279 --> 02:38:19,760
extracted product we're getting pretty

4095
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:22,640
damn close right I mean we're getting

4096
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:25,478
able to be able to measure you know

4097
02:38:22,639 --> 02:38:27,519
between the lines of like what are in

4098
02:38:25,478 --> 02:38:30,438
these products and that's where it's

4099
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:33,079
like I don't know um Alec if you

4100
02:38:30,439 --> 02:38:35,960
participated with Josh schwier or that

4101
02:38:33,079 --> 02:38:38,760
group down there that they've tagged to

4102
02:38:35,959 --> 02:38:42,799
basically help them in this lawsuit

4103
02:38:38,760 --> 02:38:43,920
that's happening in California where um

4104
02:38:42,799 --> 02:38:45,239
I forget what the name of the

4105
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:47,520
dispensaries but there's a group of

4106
02:38:45,239 --> 02:38:50,799
dispensaries down south that are

4107
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:54,159
basically have a class action lawsuit

4108
02:38:50,799 --> 02:38:57,879
against hemp producers for bringing you

4109
02:38:54,159 --> 02:38:59,959
know hemp derived THC and thca products

4110
02:38:57,879 --> 02:39:02,759
into the state of California they're

4111
02:38:59,959 --> 02:39:07,478
claiming of you know losing market share

4112
02:39:02,760 --> 02:39:10,040
and just you know not proper testing you

4113
02:39:07,478 --> 02:39:13,799
know residual solvents you know THC

4114
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:17,399
isomers that are in there I mean yeah so

4115
02:39:13,799 --> 02:39:20,759
in in one way in one way testing is

4116
02:39:17,398 --> 02:39:22,760
really kind of like the bad news in the

4117
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:25,840
industry right it's the bad news it's

4118
02:39:22,760 --> 02:39:27,840
that there's unworthy you know basically

4119
02:39:25,840 --> 02:39:30,239
producers that are producing all kinds

4120
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:32,760
of [ __ ] because people want to get

4121
02:39:30,239 --> 02:39:35,600
[ __ ] high and I don't ever think it

4122
02:39:32,760 --> 02:39:39,880
was the intention of the United States

4123
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:42,680
Congress to sign the farm bill I believe

4124
02:39:39,879 --> 02:39:45,559
they were snookered on fiber and seeds

4125
02:39:42,680 --> 02:39:47,680
and oil they were like you said Alec you

4126
02:39:45,559 --> 02:39:50,359
hit the nail on the head they were not

4127
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:52,600
thinking about drug variety

4128
02:39:50,359 --> 02:39:55,279
can cannaboids and they didn't even

4129
02:39:52,600 --> 02:39:58,000
contemplate how to bring CBD to Market

4130
02:39:55,279 --> 02:40:01,120
because CBD is the active ingredient of

4131
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:03,040
epidex which is an FDA approved drug so

4132
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:04,720
it's just lowkey legalized cannabis and

4133
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:06,240
created two totally different regulating

4134
02:40:04,719 --> 02:40:07,959
platforms you know which is really

4135
02:40:06,239 --> 02:40:10,359
[ __ ] and needs to be buttoned up you

4136
02:40:07,959 --> 02:40:12,039
know but the you know I think it's it's

4137
02:40:10,359 --> 02:40:14,079
it's just really interesting to see how

4138
02:40:12,040 --> 02:40:16,560
clo how like to your extraction point

4139
02:40:14,079 --> 02:40:18,639
just how much kind of it it went from I

4140
02:40:16,559 --> 02:40:21,239
feel like the correlation of the nail

4141
02:40:18,639 --> 02:40:24,119
and the the the little buckets you know

4142
02:40:21,239 --> 02:40:26,920
kind of uh and how much you see the

4143
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:28,960
sharp like increase in quality you know

4144
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:31,040
from like the black hash oil knife hits

4145
02:40:28,959 --> 02:40:33,398
on stoves to kind of the live resin or

4146
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:35,479
live rosin and you know getting to you

4147
02:40:33,398 --> 02:40:37,879
know the most preserved essence of the

4148
02:40:35,478 --> 02:40:40,959
plant you know and how volatile a lot of

4149
02:40:37,879 --> 02:40:42,599
these compounds are you know and um and

4150
02:40:40,959 --> 02:40:45,079
and you know I I have a lot of questions

4151
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:47,079
around kind of you know the idea of like

4152
02:40:45,079 --> 02:40:48,359
effect you know and how Entourage and

4153
02:40:47,079 --> 02:40:50,039
you know kind of the uniqueness of

4154
02:40:48,359 --> 02:40:51,880
different highs comes about you know how

4155
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:53,920
much Tarpin play a role and how much

4156
02:40:51,879 --> 02:40:56,239
these very Trace part per billion part

4157
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:58,879
per trillion level flavorant or aromatic

4158
02:40:56,239 --> 02:41:00,840
agents kind of play a role but either

4159
02:40:58,879 --> 02:41:02,239
way it's like when they're gone you know

4160
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:05,040
it's like the clo the further out the

4161
02:41:02,239 --> 02:41:06,840
canaba turp ratio goes you know kind of

4162
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:08,640
you know whenever you when it's most

4163
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:13,079
chronic and you got 3% turps and you got

4164
02:41:08,639 --> 02:41:15,039
15% flour THC or 20% or 25% or 30% you

4165
02:41:13,079 --> 02:41:16,639
know it's like a 10 to1 or closer canab

4166
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:19,000
turp ratio you know the presence

4167
02:41:16,639 --> 02:41:21,719
influence effect is substantial the the

4168
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:23,840
Pres obervation of these aromatics and

4169
02:41:21,719 --> 02:41:25,760
all these other Trace volatiles you know

4170
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:27,880
all kind of are you know in their most

4171
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:30,159
present form you know but when that is

4172
02:41:27,879 --> 02:41:31,959
compromised and goes to 100 to one canab

4173
02:41:30,159 --> 02:41:34,079
turp ratio like most of what is on the

4174
02:41:31,959 --> 02:41:36,199
dispensary shelves you know in retail

4175
02:41:34,079 --> 02:41:38,600
markets especially retail markets where

4176
02:41:36,200 --> 02:41:40,840
people have to gamut a radiate and zap

4177
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:42,399
their turps just to be able to sell it

4178
02:41:40,840 --> 02:41:44,239
you know it's like that's herbal

4179
02:41:42,398 --> 02:41:45,799
distillate that's like there's no you

4180
02:41:44,239 --> 02:41:48,000
know there's no turps there's no

4181
02:41:45,799 --> 02:41:50,719
anything it's might as well you know I

4182
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:52,719
mean so so I think uh you know kind of

4183
02:41:50,719 --> 02:41:56,639
ended start bunch of things I'm bringing

4184
02:41:52,719 --> 02:41:58,438
up but like uh I I think ultimately um

4185
02:41:56,639 --> 02:42:02,799
yeah no I totally just got lost in the

4186
02:41:58,439 --> 02:42:04,559
sauce there um but overall um yeah I

4187
02:42:02,799 --> 02:42:06,438
think I think effort for folks to close

4188
02:42:04,559 --> 02:42:08,478
that the this hemp loophole I mean

4189
02:42:06,439 --> 02:42:11,120
what's the uh I think that's the biggest

4190
02:42:08,478 --> 02:42:13,000
thing we need to do like because I feel

4191
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:15,840
like the word Industrial Hemp is such a

4192
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:17,520
misused word and and I think until we

4193
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:19,680
get to the Crux of that you know then

4194
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:22,600
we're not going to be able to Def ior

4195
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:24,760
toine you know kind of the because right

4196
02:42:22,600 --> 02:42:26,559
now you have like hundreds hundreds of

4197
02:42:24,760 --> 02:42:30,439
liters call

4198
02:42:26,559 --> 02:42:32,119
CBD but sorry just call them CBD [ __ ]

4199
02:42:30,439 --> 02:42:35,479
that's all they are is CBD whes it's

4200
02:42:32,120 --> 02:42:38,479
it's no longer oil I will say this about

4201
02:42:35,478 --> 02:42:40,840
it we haded oil into the market cutting

4202
02:42:38,478 --> 02:42:42,559
all the THC in the market and like bring

4203
02:42:40,840 --> 02:42:44,639
it's just destroying the whole thing and

4204
02:42:42,559 --> 02:42:46,799
go ahead Marcus sorry uh just going to

4205
02:42:44,639 --> 02:42:48,639
say about the hemp Industrial Hemp thing

4206
02:42:46,799 --> 02:42:51,959
I mean we got that going here it must

4207
02:42:48,639 --> 02:42:55,119
have been 94 or 95 in Canada I think

4208
02:42:51,959 --> 02:42:58,719
commercial laws changed in 98 which is

4209
02:42:55,120 --> 02:43:00,520
when you saw like um um the companies

4210
02:42:58,719 --> 02:43:03,438
come out and start selling the dehaul

4211
02:43:00,520 --> 02:43:07,279
seed so it was really always a grain

4212
02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:09,318
play in Canada we never did like CBD

4213
02:43:07,279 --> 02:43:11,120
cultivars to try and but then again we

4214
02:43:09,318 --> 02:43:13,600
never had the market that you guys had I

4215
02:43:11,120 --> 02:43:16,120
mean I remember when CBD isolate started

4216
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:18,600
getting produced in Colorado and my

4217
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:22,720
buddy was selling it for like $60,000 a

4218
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:25,960
kilo I think it's like $600 a kilo now

4219
02:43:22,719 --> 02:43:28,318
which speaks 300 okay so this speaks oh

4220
02:43:25,959 --> 02:43:30,639
look he's got the balloons this speaks

4221
02:43:28,318 --> 02:43:33,278
to what Mojave was saying earlier in

4222
02:43:30,639 --> 02:43:35,760
regards to um you know having a

4223
02:43:33,279 --> 02:43:37,800
regulatory body that's sort of says like

4224
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:39,318
hey you know and and uh Fletch as well

4225
02:43:37,799 --> 02:43:41,719
was also speaking to this about saying

4226
02:43:39,318 --> 02:43:43,359
Hey listen we control it we tell people

4227
02:43:41,719 --> 02:43:45,119
how much they can grow and the price

4228
02:43:43,359 --> 02:43:47,800
that they can sell it at and to kind of

4229
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:53,160
try and not implode the entire thing

4230
02:43:47,799 --> 02:43:55,199
definitely saw that in the US CBD um um

4231
02:43:53,159 --> 02:43:58,398
industry and then I guess part of that

4232
02:43:55,200 --> 02:44:00,479
implosion was also the Saving Grace for

4233
02:43:58,398 --> 02:44:02,639
them to convert and to create these

4234
02:44:00,478 --> 02:44:04,318
other canabo that they can then sell at

4235
02:44:02,639 --> 02:44:05,639
gas stations where people can get high

4236
02:44:04,318 --> 02:44:07,359
of which is what this whole

4237
02:44:05,639 --> 02:44:09,799
conversation's been about and I do

4238
02:44:07,359 --> 02:44:13,479
appreciate it it's been really good I

4239
02:44:09,799 --> 02:44:16,358
just wonder you know where it's going in

4240
02:44:13,478 --> 02:44:18,079
a sense I also would would would

4241
02:44:16,359 --> 02:44:20,239
recognize the fact that we are the

4242
02:44:18,079 --> 02:44:21,799
anomaly like we are the small percentage

4243
02:44:20,239 --> 02:44:24,959
like most people probably don't care if

4244
02:44:21,799 --> 02:44:27,358
they're pre-rolled joints or W have

4245
02:44:24,959 --> 02:44:28,639
Botanical turps and 20 different types

4246
02:44:27,359 --> 02:44:30,760
of pesticides they're smoking

4247
02:44:28,639 --> 02:44:32,639
radioactive cigarettes and actively

4248
02:44:30,760 --> 02:44:34,880
enjoying alcohol as their favorite

4249
02:44:32,639 --> 02:44:36,478
personal drug of choice maybe they're on

4250
02:44:34,879 --> 02:44:38,199
like a bunch of pharmaceuticals maybe

4251
02:44:36,478 --> 02:44:40,959
they're on their ninth booster I don't

4252
02:44:38,200 --> 02:44:43,880
know I'm not judging um we all have to

4253
02:44:40,959 --> 02:44:46,119
make our choices but um it is just a

4254
02:44:43,879 --> 02:44:48,278
strange thing to think I always I always

4255
02:44:46,120 --> 02:44:49,560
I always hear Debbie goldsbury you know

4256
02:44:48,279 --> 02:44:51,000
from years ago when when we were going

4257
02:44:49,559 --> 02:44:52,359
off about how it's got to be the best

4258
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:54,359
and we got to have the best turps and

4259
02:44:52,359 --> 02:44:56,520
the this and the that and she's like

4260
02:44:54,359 --> 02:44:58,680
she's like guys I love your passion but

4261
02:44:56,520 --> 02:45:00,439
I'm telling you like in 30 years of

4262
02:44:58,680 --> 02:45:03,600
doing this people don't give a [ __ ]

4263
02:45:00,439 --> 02:45:07,479
about anything other than price and THC

4264
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:09,559
percentage no so it leads me oh go go

4265
02:45:07,478 --> 02:45:11,079
ahead sorry I was just gonna say that's

4266
02:45:09,559 --> 02:45:12,799
the role of the regulator to kind of

4267
02:45:11,079 --> 02:45:14,760
Ensure it's not poisoned you know it's

4268
02:45:12,799 --> 02:45:16,599
like sure if somebody wants it like

4269
02:45:14,760 --> 02:45:19,398
there's the whole Jewel generation of

4270
02:45:16,600 --> 02:45:21,800
kids that are just puffing on those like

4271
02:45:19,398 --> 02:45:24,159
those flavor sticks you know that want

4272
02:45:21,799 --> 02:45:26,318
some butterscotch distillate sure that's

4273
02:45:24,159 --> 02:45:28,318
cool as long as it's not poisoned you

4274
02:45:26,318 --> 02:45:30,039
know it's like when you look at like you

4275
02:45:28,318 --> 02:45:31,760
know a lot of those botanically D turps

4276
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:33,520
they have like huge amounts of benzene

4277
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:35,960
in there anything with a cherry flavor

4278
02:45:33,520 --> 02:45:39,159
anything with a cherry like it's like I

4279
02:45:35,959 --> 02:45:42,559
don't know what it is but

4280
02:45:39,159 --> 02:45:45,039
man I would imagine almost all of those

4281
02:45:42,559 --> 02:45:48,119
those Botanical turps that I've ever

4282
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:50,240
touched have serious problems with all

4283
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:53,160
their

4284
02:45:50,239 --> 02:45:55,359
and a big reason yeah the because all

4285
02:45:53,159 --> 02:45:57,359
the pesticides super concentrate not

4286
02:45:55,359 --> 02:46:01,760
only in the extract but primarily in the

4287
02:45:57,359 --> 02:46:01,760
essential oils you know so it's

4288
02:46:02,439 --> 02:46:08,000
froms Colin everybody you're all experts

4289
02:46:05,079 --> 02:46:10,478
here so I mean has anybody come across

4290
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:13,120
anybody who's been able to come even

4291
02:46:10,478 --> 02:46:14,879
close to replicating what the plant can

4292
02:46:13,120 --> 02:46:17,640
actually

4293
02:46:14,879 --> 02:46:19,599
do well here's another perspective I

4294
02:46:17,639 --> 02:46:21,760
would go as far to say even the plant

4295
02:46:19,600 --> 02:46:24,760
itself has problems with toxicology when

4296
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:26,398
we extract it by itself and by Design

4297
02:46:24,760 --> 02:46:28,800
there's certain constituents and certain

4298
02:46:26,398 --> 02:46:30,398
levels that we shouldn't be ingesting

4299
02:46:28,799 --> 02:46:32,599
you know and that's that's another

4300
02:46:30,398 --> 02:46:36,358
problem right and and in the hemp world

4301
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:38,800
for some reason that happens often um

4302
02:46:36,359 --> 02:46:41,399
and it's not so often in type one but

4303
02:46:38,799 --> 02:46:43,119
there's a lot of turpine extracted

4304
02:46:41,398 --> 02:46:45,358
varietals that are meant for that that

4305
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:46,680
are being sold at scale that do have tox

4306
02:46:45,359 --> 02:46:49,200
problems with them so I want to just

4307
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:51,239
call that out that I've learned over my

4308
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:54,359
time that it is on both sides and and we

4309
02:46:51,239 --> 02:46:56,239
all have to just be really open about

4310
02:46:54,359 --> 02:46:58,600
that the path forward is about

4311
02:46:56,239 --> 02:47:01,359
recognizing hey maybe we shouldn't grow

4312
02:46:58,600 --> 02:47:04,239
super super Haze and extract it for TPS

4313
02:47:01,359 --> 02:47:07,159
because it has this type of you know

4314
02:47:04,239 --> 02:47:09,279
turpine in it that we can't have at 3%

4315
02:47:07,159 --> 02:47:11,840
or more and it's causing you know cell

4316
02:47:09,279 --> 02:47:14,120
damage at this rate and therefore from a

4317
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:16,960
talk perspective it's it's unfit for for

4318
02:47:14,120 --> 02:47:19,680
consumption right so I

4319
02:47:16,959 --> 02:47:21,438
think yeah you you're exactly right on

4320
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:23,040
the toxicology certain things being at

4321
02:47:21,439 --> 02:47:24,800
certain concentrations it like all of a

4322
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:28,120
sudden becomes really gnarly but I think

4323
02:47:24,799 --> 02:47:31,278
I mean but if you grow cannabis hemp

4324
02:47:28,120 --> 02:47:35,160
type three cannabis on clean land with

4325
02:47:31,279 --> 02:47:37,000
clean water clean inputs it's it's clean

4326
02:47:35,159 --> 02:47:39,760
the turps are clean everything's clean

4327
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:42,120
you know and so I think you know again

4328
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:44,120
it's like I think cannabis has the the

4329
02:47:42,120 --> 02:47:47,680
potential to flip agriculture in the

4330
02:47:44,120 --> 02:47:50,120
long run you know in this becoming like

4331
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:52,760
a a bought into to like reality and

4332
02:47:50,120 --> 02:47:54,720
issue and and you know seen kind of as

4333
02:47:52,760 --> 02:47:56,559
from the cultural side of thing I mean

4334
02:47:54,719 --> 02:47:58,398
because you can't just flip a Thousand

4335
02:47:56,559 --> 02:48:01,680
Acre Mega Farm you know you can't just

4336
02:47:58,398 --> 02:48:03,760
flip a a a a greenhouse that's been kind

4337
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:05,279
of cut flowers for the last 10 years

4338
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:07,359
because guess what you're inheriting so

4339
02:48:05,279 --> 02:48:09,760
many of the problems of the past and so

4340
02:48:07,359 --> 02:48:11,318
I think you know again it's like if

4341
02:48:09,760 --> 02:48:13,318
there can be this buttoned up loophole

4342
02:48:11,318 --> 02:48:15,559
between hemp what's called hemp and

4343
02:48:13,318 --> 02:48:17,239
cannabis I think it's kind it's the

4344
02:48:15,559 --> 02:48:19,680
greatest thing that could ever come for

4345
02:48:17,239 --> 02:48:21,359
anybody closest the plant that's in

4346
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:23,079
Integrity with the plant and I think in

4347
02:48:21,359 --> 02:48:24,920
the long run those that are in Integrity

4348
02:48:23,079 --> 02:48:26,318
with the plant are going to succeed you

4349
02:48:24,920 --> 02:48:28,120
know and those that are out of Integrity

4350
02:48:26,318 --> 02:48:30,318
with the plant are might be making some

4351
02:48:28,120 --> 02:48:32,160
like short-term gain and profit but are

4352
02:48:30,318 --> 02:48:34,959
going to have a long-term not successful

4353
02:48:32,159 --> 02:48:36,840
path with the plant and I think whatever

4354
02:48:34,959 --> 02:48:38,679
path it takes it'll correct itself as

4355
02:48:36,840 --> 02:48:40,398
well I think that's important is that

4356
02:48:38,680 --> 02:48:42,800
that every this is all just transition

4357
02:48:40,398 --> 02:48:44,920
so like whether whether it goes back to

4358
02:48:42,799 --> 02:48:46,920
just being state-based license systems

4359
02:48:44,920 --> 02:48:48,840
and we have all these little Islands or

4360
02:48:46,920 --> 02:48:51,398
whether it goes the farm bill path and

4361
02:48:48,840 --> 02:48:53,680
they change the ruling on early Harvest

4362
02:48:51,398 --> 02:48:55,278
window or whether they all the things

4363
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:56,479
that they're going to do we know it's

4364
02:48:55,279 --> 02:48:58,960
going to go back and forth but it will

4365
02:48:56,478 --> 02:49:02,519
correct itself and my hope my hope is

4366
02:48:58,959 --> 02:49:05,159
that in this all this turmoil we're

4367
02:49:02,520 --> 02:49:06,720
we're forced to pick a path which seems

4368
02:49:05,159 --> 02:49:09,318
like what's happening right now because

4369
02:49:06,719 --> 02:49:11,639
there's been a a a a sea change in terms

4370
02:49:09,318 --> 02:49:13,639
of you know Congressional support

4371
02:49:11,639 --> 02:49:15,680
there's it's now every region has

4372
02:49:13,639 --> 02:49:17,519
cannabis in it everyone wants the money

4373
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:19,238
everybody wants it to go for it

4374
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:23,079
everybody knows somebody body who's in

4375
02:49:19,238 --> 02:49:24,799
the business or uses it medically or you

4376
02:49:23,079 --> 02:49:26,120
know it's like there's no anyway we're

4377
02:49:24,799 --> 02:49:27,920
past that so now it's just like we're

4378
02:49:26,120 --> 02:49:30,359
all just waiting like you guys tell us

4379
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:31,600
which path to take and that's why I

4380
02:49:30,359 --> 02:49:33,800
thought this guy this grower who's doing

4381
02:49:31,600 --> 02:49:35,840
the three different angles was a really

4382
02:49:33,799 --> 02:49:37,840
interesting conversation was like dude

4383
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:38,840
and doing it well and you know like hey

4384
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:41,079
like I don't know which way it's going

4385
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:42,600
to go but I got my I got my over here

4386
02:49:41,079 --> 02:49:44,719
and I got it over here and over here and

4387
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:47,399
it either way I'm pivot like we've all

4388
02:49:44,719 --> 02:49:49,318
pivoted many times and medical was a

4389
02:49:47,398 --> 02:49:51,199
pivot we all know medical was a pivot we

4390
02:49:49,318 --> 02:49:52,760
did that you know we wanted medical to

4391
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:55,840
happen but really we're just all trying

4392
02:49:52,760 --> 02:49:57,880
to legalize cannabis hip laws in Canada

4393
02:49:55,840 --> 02:50:00,040
were a pivot everything is a pivot we're

4394
02:49:57,879 --> 02:50:02,759
all just trying to legalize Big C

4395
02:50:00,040 --> 02:50:05,279
cannabis genus cannabis so to me

4396
02:50:02,760 --> 02:50:07,120
whichever way we get there you know

4397
02:50:05,279 --> 02:50:08,680
eventually it'll become some Australia

4398
02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:11,960
is a perfect example Australia started

4399
02:50:08,680 --> 02:50:15,238
out Total Medical like regulated

4400
02:50:11,959 --> 02:50:17,559
federally regulated pharmaceutical thing

4401
02:50:15,238 --> 02:50:20,520
all cannabis cultivars had to be called

4402
02:50:17,559 --> 02:50:23,159
like a leave and refresh and now they're

4403
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:25,800
just now every California brand all the

4404
02:50:23,159 --> 02:50:28,159
cultivars they want chronic they want

4405
02:50:25,799 --> 02:50:30,519
fire they want all the they want it just

4406
02:50:28,159 --> 02:50:32,238
the way everybody does even though they

4407
02:50:30,520 --> 02:50:34,600
call it Medical but guess what in

4408
02:50:32,238 --> 02:50:36,000
Australia now 4% of the population holds

4409
02:50:34,600 --> 02:50:38,920
a medical

4410
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:41,920
C I'd like to know I'd like to know what

4411
02:50:38,920 --> 02:50:43,559
the butt is that Fletch held up uh just

4412
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:45,600
a few minutes ago because that looked

4413
02:50:43,559 --> 02:50:49,199
pretty [ __ ]

4414
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:52,279
delicious that is uh it's B basically

4415
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:55,319
Oishi which is Japanese for

4416
02:50:52,279 --> 02:50:56,520
delicious no [ __ ] it's Skittles cross a

4417
02:50:55,318 --> 02:50:59,719
flavor

4418
02:50:56,520 --> 02:51:01,399
pack it's like breing line I think

4419
02:50:59,719 --> 02:51:04,879
Colin's probably seen that one when I

4420
02:51:01,398 --> 02:51:06,238
was back uh in New York yeah dude the

4421
02:51:04,879 --> 02:51:09,000
the stuff that you showed me and we

4422
02:51:06,238 --> 02:51:11,959
smoked on together like man I gotta get

4423
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:14,040
some packs of that for sure definitely r

4424
02:51:11,959 --> 02:51:16,879
that stuff that stuff's amazing it just

4425
02:51:14,040 --> 02:51:19,279
lingered perfectly guys it was like

4426
02:51:16,879 --> 02:51:21,119
every everyone had a different

4427
02:51:19,279 --> 02:51:22,800
slightly different profile but ended up

4428
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:25,760
the same place where it just lingered

4429
02:51:22,799 --> 02:51:27,959
and just taste just flavor cating so I

4430
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:30,840
have a question for you Fletch why why

4431
02:51:27,959 --> 02:51:33,000
is it that you grow uh and breed such

4432
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:34,398
incredible quality cannabis what what

4433
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:37,159
what are you doing differently is it

4434
02:51:34,398 --> 02:51:39,519
your old factory is it your ability to

4435
02:51:37,159 --> 02:51:41,719
perceive volatile organic compounds is

4436
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:43,479
it something you're doing in the grow is

4437
02:51:41,719 --> 02:51:45,799
it that you have access to incredible

4438
02:51:43,478 --> 02:51:48,119
starter genetics I I because I just I've

4439
02:51:45,799 --> 02:51:50,959
always known you've had great genetics

4440
02:51:48,120 --> 02:51:52,920
but but it's it seems to be even like an

4441
02:51:50,959 --> 02:51:56,199
another level like it's just like you're

4442
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:57,439
just so focused on the exceptional what

4443
02:51:56,200 --> 02:52:00,040
how

4444
02:51:57,439 --> 02:52:01,960
why well I don't know if you guys have

4445
02:52:00,040 --> 02:52:02,720
seen how many joints I've already rolled

4446
02:52:01,959 --> 02:52:05,119
and

4447
02:52:02,719 --> 02:52:07,719
smoked so I think that helps contribute

4448
02:52:05,120 --> 02:52:09,560
to it and then man my passion is just I

4449
02:52:07,719 --> 02:52:12,398
like hunting through

4450
02:52:09,559 --> 02:52:15,398
populations and like giving all the

4451
02:52:12,398 --> 02:52:18,318
different hybrids the opportunity to

4452
02:52:15,398 --> 02:52:20,079
um Express whatever you're looking for I

4453
02:52:18,318 --> 02:52:21,799
mean I you know with breeding for me

4454
02:52:20,079 --> 02:52:23,159
it's like everybody always thinks oh I'm

4455
02:52:21,799 --> 02:52:25,398
going to cross this with this and I'm

4456
02:52:23,159 --> 02:52:28,279
going to get exactly what I imagined and

4457
02:52:25,398 --> 02:52:31,680
for me I'm more just shotgun approach to

4458
02:52:28,279 --> 02:52:36,120
see what hits and um I think it's just

4459
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:38,920
enjoying that and uh that being exciting

4460
02:52:36,120 --> 02:52:41,000
that that just it doesn't matter what

4461
02:52:38,920 --> 02:52:42,639
you even start with necessarily you're

4462
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:45,159
going to continue to improve what you

4463
02:52:42,639 --> 02:52:47,840
have through that process as long as you

4464
02:52:45,159 --> 02:52:49,879
continue to you know reinvest in that

4465
02:52:47,840 --> 02:52:52,680
process as what it is because it's just

4466
02:52:49,879 --> 02:52:55,199
expensive to to have bad runs or

4467
02:52:52,680 --> 02:52:56,720
whatever it is um or where you pick the

4468
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:58,560
wrong parent this time and you need to

4469
02:52:56,719 --> 02:53:03,519
go back and rework a line or whatever it

4470
02:52:58,559 --> 02:53:05,879
is and um just enjoying that process and

4471
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:08,200
then and then part of it was just uh

4472
02:53:05,879 --> 02:53:10,920
always knowing right when I started

4473
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:14,279
growing at least just having collected a

4474
02:53:10,920 --> 02:53:16,478
really wide range of like the American

4475
02:53:14,279 --> 02:53:18,800
clone only genetics and making sure that

4476
02:53:16,478 --> 02:53:22,159
I that I knew what I had and why I had

4477
02:53:18,799 --> 02:53:25,759
it and at that time I only focused on

4478
02:53:22,159 --> 02:53:28,200
Flavor you know and smell but really

4479
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:30,238
things that only transferred to flavor

4480
02:53:28,200 --> 02:53:34,200
or it had an exceptional smell that I

4481
02:53:30,238 --> 02:53:36,238
wanted to make into a good flavor and uh

4482
02:53:34,200 --> 02:53:38,279
that's you know continually been the

4483
02:53:36,238 --> 02:53:40,199
process yeah but the other thing that I

4484
02:53:38,279 --> 02:53:42,640
would add is that your [ __ ] produces

4485
02:53:40,200 --> 02:53:44,359
full melt bubble and that's also not

4486
02:53:42,639 --> 02:53:46,119
something that always translates there's

4487
02:53:44,359 --> 02:53:48,439
tons of cultivars out there that are

4488
02:53:46,120 --> 02:53:51,319
delicious and wonderful and I I love

4489
02:53:48,439 --> 02:53:53,359
love them as you know a vapor off of the

4490
02:53:51,318 --> 02:53:56,159
flower but when I try to turn them into

4491
02:53:53,359 --> 02:53:59,120
hash it's just the yields aren't there

4492
02:53:56,159 --> 02:54:01,439
or if the yields are there it's just not

4493
02:53:59,120 --> 02:54:03,680
translating the same way that what I

4494
02:54:01,439 --> 02:54:06,279
perceived in the flower would be as a

4495
02:54:03,680 --> 02:54:08,079
concentrate out of the flower so I I

4496
02:54:06,279 --> 02:54:10,040
think that that's sort of an you know

4497
02:54:08,079 --> 02:54:11,920
they're really full melt genetics like

4498
02:54:10,040 --> 02:54:13,960
full melt certified genetics a lot of

4499
02:54:11,920 --> 02:54:18,040
your genetics produce when grown

4500
02:54:13,959 --> 02:54:19,719
properly obviously just beautiful hash I

4501
02:54:18,040 --> 02:54:22,479
even I think a lot of that's just the

4502
02:54:19,719 --> 02:54:25,398
selection process too right and using

4503
02:54:22,478 --> 02:54:27,799
multiple or or even having lines made

4504
02:54:25,398 --> 02:54:29,439
from multiple different females and and

4505
02:54:27,799 --> 02:54:32,478
just making more selections and then

4506
02:54:29,439 --> 02:54:35,359
lots of people um grow my seeds out and

4507
02:54:32,478 --> 02:54:37,478
find great selections too and it's it's

4508
02:54:35,359 --> 02:54:41,640
awesome having you know high-end Growers

4509
02:54:37,478 --> 02:54:44,159
grow what we make and and uh and get

4510
02:54:41,639 --> 02:54:46,119
them to perform really well I was going

4511
02:54:44,159 --> 02:54:47,799
to comment on even the the secondary

4512
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:49,600
line that you released that were just

4513
02:54:47,799 --> 02:54:51,559
like stuff didn't really test all that

4514
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:54,960
much like we got a doc times original

4515
02:54:51,559 --> 02:54:56,439
diesel on dude we s we found some four

4516
02:54:54,959 --> 02:54:59,000
heaters in there and there was only six

4517
02:54:56,439 --> 02:55:00,600
seeds in the pack I think yeah well I

4518
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:03,200
can prob take so much credit I mean the

4519
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:05,359
original diesel was you know just making

4520
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:08,000
sure I have the original legitimate

4521
02:55:05,359 --> 02:55:10,439
clone and held it for 20 years and then

4522
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:12,920
Crossing it with a good selection I mean

4523
02:55:10,439 --> 02:55:14,960
and it you know it wasn't even the Dosey

4524
02:55:12,920 --> 02:55:17,120
18 wasn't necessarily like my favorite

4525
02:55:14,959 --> 02:55:21,278
Dosey dough plant for my flavor this or

4526
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:25,279
that it was just the most resist um you

4527
02:55:21,279 --> 02:55:26,760
know highest hash yielding um yeah you

4528
02:55:25,279 --> 02:55:28,479
know type from that original like 30

4529
02:55:26,760 --> 02:55:31,680
seeds I popped it it's not even like it

4530
02:55:28,478 --> 02:55:33,959
was a big big hunt or anything it was

4531
02:55:31,680 --> 02:55:36,559
just the continual process of just

4532
02:55:33,959 --> 02:55:39,079
picking something better every time and

4533
02:55:36,559 --> 02:55:42,199
moving forward is that's the name of the

4534
02:55:39,079 --> 02:55:43,600
game to me it's not every like everybody

4535
02:55:42,200 --> 02:55:46,880
thinks that oh I'm just going to back

4536
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:48,840
cross and it's like all you're doing is

4537
02:55:46,879 --> 02:55:50,879
doubling up tripling up

4538
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:53,359
on the original plant that you were

4539
02:55:50,879 --> 02:55:55,920
trying to improve by going back to the

4540
02:55:53,359 --> 02:55:58,200
plant that has all the problems and so

4541
02:55:55,920 --> 02:55:59,960
to me it's it's about making the

4542
02:55:58,200 --> 02:56:01,920
selections and then moving moving

4543
02:55:59,959 --> 02:56:04,278
forward with the with those and trying

4544
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:05,879
to increase the reoccurrence of the

4545
02:56:04,279 --> 02:56:09,560
trace that you do

4546
02:56:05,879 --> 02:56:12,079
want no that's R cool I think skunkman

4547
02:56:09,559 --> 02:56:15,478
Sam just popped into the

4548
02:56:12,079 --> 02:56:18,359
room howdy everybody yeah I'm a day late

4549
02:56:15,478 --> 02:56:20,438
in a dollar short again

4550
02:56:18,359 --> 02:56:22,760
but we're still here dude like three

4551
02:56:20,439 --> 02:56:24,880
hours later we're still here I know I

4552
02:56:22,760 --> 02:56:27,439
was really surprised to see you still

4553
02:56:24,879 --> 02:56:29,358
here and you came in right when Fletch

4554
02:56:27,439 --> 02:56:31,639
was talking about like selection and

4555
02:56:29,359 --> 02:56:33,640
breeding so I thought that that was very

4556
02:56:31,639 --> 02:56:37,439
uh

4557
02:56:33,639 --> 02:56:40,639
cool well you know me I always like to

4558
02:56:37,439 --> 02:56:44,120
grow out as many as I can a 100 is

4559
02:56:40,639 --> 02:56:48,719
nothing to me uh I've done grow out

4560
02:56:44,120 --> 02:56:51,880
where I did SPO hunting from 20,000

4561
02:56:48,719 --> 02:56:53,920
Jesus Christ yeah I've never had the the

4562
02:56:51,879 --> 02:56:58,559
privilege I go through about a thousand

4563
02:56:53,920 --> 02:57:02,120
to 2,000 a year indoor so yeah no it was

4564
02:56:58,559 --> 02:57:05,439
20,000 skunk number ones half male half

4565
02:57:02,120 --> 02:57:07,600
female so I selected the 10 best boys

4566
02:57:05,439 --> 02:57:09,760
and the 10 best

4567
02:57:07,600 --> 02:57:12,238
girls well and those have spawned

4568
02:57:09,760 --> 02:57:14,600
probably half of the best hash making

4569
02:57:12,238 --> 02:57:18,000
varieties in the last 40

4570
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:20,200
years yeah congratulations skunkman Sam

4571
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:23,200
on the emerald cup recognition and award

4572
02:57:20,200 --> 02:57:25,960
too be absolutely yeah dude for real

4573
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:29,920
hoping to be uh to be able to see you

4574
02:57:25,959 --> 02:57:32,119
there well I'm I'm so worthy I

4575
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:33,680
guess why don't you mention what his

4576
02:57:32,120 --> 02:57:35,920
award was there

4577
02:57:33,680 --> 02:57:37,120
Alec I was I was trying to remember off

4578
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:39,559
the top of my head I think it was

4579
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:44,160
Lifetime Achievement kind of uh no no

4580
02:57:39,559 --> 02:57:47,039
it's it was in into into the beers Hall

4581
02:57:44,159 --> 02:57:48,760
of Fame there we go there we go that's

4582
02:57:47,040 --> 02:57:51,040
what it was yeah thank you for your

4583
02:57:48,760 --> 02:57:53,040
service to humanity and the flavor of

4584
02:57:51,040 --> 02:57:55,840
the

4585
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:59,600
ganja well I I think the biggest thing

4586
02:57:55,840 --> 02:58:03,040
that I did to be honest was I uh sold

4587
02:57:59,600 --> 02:58:03,040
seeds incredibly

4588
02:58:03,318 --> 02:58:09,238
cheap that's why they're that's why

4589
02:58:06,359 --> 02:58:11,318
those genetics are everywhere that's

4590
02:58:09,238 --> 02:58:14,398
absolutely

4591
02:58:11,318 --> 02:58:16,478
true it's I mean it's it's even if we

4592
02:58:14,398 --> 02:58:17,920
don't know it's in something it's a high

4593
02:58:16,478 --> 02:58:19,119
probability that it potentially is in

4594
02:58:17,920 --> 02:58:22,879
there

4595
02:58:19,120 --> 02:58:25,880
somewhere well between Haze and skunk

4596
02:58:22,879 --> 02:58:28,920
was the two that was used the most the

4597
02:58:25,879 --> 02:58:32,000
California Orange and deran poison were

4598
02:58:28,920 --> 02:58:36,000
also used really a lot and I had some

4599
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:39,000
early tie that was used really a lot I

4600
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:42,559
had a variety called bunk which was Tai

4601
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:45,000
ha skunk which was really really

4602
02:58:42,559 --> 02:58:48,439
popular Foundation of most of what's out

4603
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:51,719
there right I use that to read my lemon

4604
02:58:48,439 --> 02:58:55,439
cake literally it's the backbone of it I

4605
02:58:51,719 --> 02:58:57,679
selected a lemon leaner and just hit

4606
02:58:55,439 --> 02:59:02,479
that back to another skunk

4607
02:58:57,680 --> 02:59:04,960
NL I I I tried really hard to uh to get

4608
02:59:02,478 --> 02:59:10,079
varieties that were extremely high in

4609
02:59:04,959 --> 02:59:13,039
tpin and really loud you know

4610
02:59:10,079 --> 02:59:15,478
that's yeah that's what I what I

4611
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:19,840
personally enjoy and that's what

4612
02:59:15,478 --> 02:59:22,799
I I also like dry sify better than water

4613
02:59:19,840 --> 02:59:25,639
house because it's kept a little bit

4614
02:59:22,799 --> 02:59:28,599
more of the tpin and some varieties are

4615
02:59:25,639 --> 02:59:32,358
very sensitive to water other ones just

4616
02:59:28,600 --> 02:59:34,800
ignore it yeah tur water from the after

4617
02:59:32,359 --> 02:59:38,800
yeah but you don't want turp water what

4618
02:59:34,799 --> 02:59:41,879
you want is you want TPS in the the

4619
02:59:38,799 --> 02:59:43,959
resins yes sir I got I've got a question

4620
02:59:41,879 --> 02:59:49,879
this the perfect group to ask in terms

4621
02:59:43,959 --> 02:59:51,478
of uh why certain uh um resin heads wash

4622
02:59:49,879 --> 02:59:52,959
and some don't just because you brought

4623
02:59:51,478 --> 02:59:58,199
it up too and I think this is the

4624
02:59:52,959 --> 03:00:00,839
perfect group to ask is th this is how I

4625
02:59:58,200 --> 03:00:04,319
my assumption I think we've all like

4626
03:00:00,840 --> 03:00:07,559
made plenty of rosin BHO

4627
03:00:04,318 --> 03:00:09,000
Etc some of that some of those resins

4628
03:00:07,559 --> 03:00:12,199
even if you put them in a freezer they

4629
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:15,478
won't harden up right like they just

4630
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:19,000
there's too too much tping sauce I think

4631
03:00:15,478 --> 03:00:21,159
there's too much tpping in them is

4632
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:24,120
and so if it won't if it won't freeze

4633
03:00:21,159 --> 03:00:27,279
yeah if it won't freeze at let's say you

4634
03:00:24,120 --> 03:00:29,079
know uh 32 degrees or even a freezer

4635
03:00:27,279 --> 03:00:32,200
that's seven or negative seven or

4636
03:00:29,079 --> 03:00:34,439
whatever then and and the hash is

4637
03:00:32,200 --> 03:00:35,600
basically just a representation of the

4638
03:00:34,439 --> 03:00:40,800
triome

4639
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:44,238
heads ratio of TH or canono to to other

4640
03:00:40,799 --> 03:00:46,519
compounds essentially if it's too turpy

4641
03:00:44,238 --> 03:00:49,559
like like you just said skunkman Sam it

4642
03:00:46,520 --> 03:00:51,279
won't freeze 32 therefore you can't wash

4643
03:00:49,559 --> 03:00:52,318
it they'll their heads will just burst

4644
03:00:51,279 --> 03:00:55,399
in the

4645
03:00:52,318 --> 03:00:59,680
water no I I don't think that they burst

4646
03:00:55,398 --> 03:01:03,278
as much as some of them seem to be the

4647
03:00:59,680 --> 03:01:06,639
turps are water soluble from the heads

4648
03:01:03,279 --> 03:01:09,960
like yeah you could tell really easy if

4649
03:01:06,639 --> 03:01:13,159
the water is turpy then you know there

4650
03:01:09,959 --> 03:01:17,919
were varieties that we did like

4651
03:01:13,159 --> 03:01:21,719
shitol uh water has and the water would

4652
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:23,840
didn't smell very strong at all and uh

4653
03:01:21,719 --> 03:01:27,079
most of the flavors and The Taste was

4654
03:01:23,840 --> 03:01:30,880
the same whether you dry sied or water

4655
03:01:27,079 --> 03:01:32,680
hash it and uh yeah so well if if the

4656
03:01:30,879 --> 03:01:34,719
tur beans are water soluble the tur

4657
03:01:32,680 --> 03:01:37,639
beans were like some of them inside the

4658
03:01:34,719 --> 03:01:40,159
head right so then it it's not burst but

4659
03:01:37,639 --> 03:01:42,039
it's it's leaked it's it's inard let's

4660
03:01:40,159 --> 03:01:44,359
put it that way and then and then now

4661
03:01:42,040 --> 03:01:47,080
that it's ruptured you can't catch the

4662
03:01:44,359 --> 03:01:49,439
the triome head anymore because it's you

4663
03:01:47,079 --> 03:01:52,760
know that's one of the reasons I like

4664
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:55,000
dry sift and when I would make dry sift

4665
03:01:52,760 --> 03:01:58,359
I would cheer it for three or four

4666
03:01:55,000 --> 03:02:02,359
months so it was more like a little

4667
03:01:58,359 --> 03:02:05,760
raisin than a fresh head because the

4668
03:02:02,359 --> 03:02:08,479
Fresh Heads smear it easy they uh you

4669
03:02:05,760 --> 03:02:11,238
know when you're trying to dry SI it

4670
03:02:08,478 --> 03:02:14,358
uh you don't want it smearing you want

4671
03:02:11,238 --> 03:02:16,439
it you know dry SI and and it's very

4672
03:02:14,359 --> 03:02:18,960
strain dependent there are varieties

4673
03:02:16,439 --> 03:02:21,238
like in fact one of the best dry sift

4674
03:02:18,959 --> 03:02:22,759
varieties I ever had which this was the

4675
03:02:21,238 --> 03:02:26,600
pictures

4676
03:02:22,760 --> 03:02:29,040
uh uh Marcus that you remember um shumy

4677
03:02:26,600 --> 03:02:31,238
420 posted those full melt photos on

4678
03:02:29,040 --> 03:02:35,439
your Forum back in the day that came

4679
03:02:31,238 --> 03:02:38,079
from me um yes anyways the the that was

4680
03:02:35,439 --> 03:02:40,479
a skunk number one times White Rhino

4681
03:02:38,079 --> 03:02:44,039
right just you

4682
03:02:40,478 --> 03:02:46,920
know you know skunk number one is one of

4683
03:02:44,040 --> 03:02:48,399
my favorite for dry safety that's that

4684
03:02:46,920 --> 03:02:50,719
was the most incredible

4685
03:02:48,398 --> 03:02:56,119
I mean I I popped those seeds in

4686
03:02:50,719 --> 03:02:58,238
2004 probably so um you know that was I

4687
03:02:56,120 --> 03:03:01,760
mean it

4688
03:02:58,238 --> 03:03:07,039
was I've always seen if you cured that

4689
03:03:01,760 --> 03:03:09,639
weed was it uh uh easier to dry shift it

4690
03:03:07,040 --> 03:03:12,760
would literally start dry sifting like

4691
03:03:09,639 --> 03:03:16,238
with if I just dried if you know 10day

4692
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:18,359
hang let the room get to like 40%

4693
03:03:16,238 --> 03:03:19,520
humidity and it would just rain Keef

4694
03:03:18,359 --> 03:03:23,000
when you trim

4695
03:03:19,520 --> 03:03:26,439
it yeah we used to always trim on top of

4696
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:29,159
uh silk screen yeah that's right always

4697
03:03:26,439 --> 03:03:31,720
have done too yeah yeah we've done I

4698
03:03:29,159 --> 03:03:33,639
read all your guys books I I took it all

4699
03:03:31,719 --> 03:03:36,719
to into

4700
03:03:33,639 --> 03:03:38,318
practice hey there's know zamir punjob

4701
03:03:36,719 --> 03:03:41,559
did a thing I think at actually at

4702
03:03:38,318 --> 03:03:43,519
canmed and it's a m micros microscopy or

4703
03:03:41,559 --> 03:03:47,439
whatever um on cannabis heads on

4704
03:03:43,520 --> 03:03:50,000
tricomes and he shows some ripe heads

4705
03:03:47,439 --> 03:03:51,880
and the secreting and actually coating

4706
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:53,719
the outer layer and it's kind of far out

4707
03:03:51,879 --> 03:03:55,959
because it's not burst at all it's a

4708
03:03:53,719 --> 03:03:58,238
fully intact head but just it's slowly

4709
03:03:55,959 --> 03:04:00,398
oozing out and it's covering and it's

4710
03:03:58,238 --> 03:04:02,799
always one thing I've always wondered

4711
03:04:00,398 --> 03:04:04,439
like what makes fresh cannabis sticky

4712
03:04:02,799 --> 03:04:06,519
you know is like how does that head's so

4713
03:04:04,439 --> 03:04:08,840
sticky when the chemistry hasn't

4714
03:04:06,520 --> 03:04:10,640
happened until it ruptures but the

4715
03:04:08,840 --> 03:04:13,200
reality is it's happening on a ripe head

4716
03:04:10,639 --> 03:04:15,799
on the inside and on the outside and

4717
03:04:13,200 --> 03:04:18,760
that has a lot to do with you know is it

4718
03:04:15,799 --> 03:04:22,238
is it you going through through the wack

4719
03:04:18,760 --> 03:04:22,238
shell or is it

4720
03:04:23,559 --> 03:04:26,959
coming you know you'll have to I don't

4721
03:04:25,680 --> 03:04:28,800
want to say because I have such a poor

4722
03:04:26,959 --> 03:04:31,079
memory but check it out it's it's it's

4723
03:04:28,799 --> 03:04:32,679
really good image and I I actually sat

4724
03:04:31,079 --> 03:04:34,600
in it I didn't even see it when I sat in

4725
03:04:32,680 --> 03:04:37,000
on the conference but he's basically

4726
03:04:34,600 --> 03:04:39,000
showing fully intact ripe heads that are

4727
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:42,159
slowly oozing out and coating the

4728
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:43,680
outside surface cuticle but it's still

4729
03:04:42,159 --> 03:04:45,159
rip and the other the other source

4730
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:49,279
that's really interesting right now is

4731
03:04:45,159 --> 03:04:51,879
this that photographer um Zoom Gardens

4732
03:04:49,279 --> 03:04:55,120
and he's peeling he's peeling the

4733
03:04:51,879 --> 03:04:57,238
cuticle layer off of the gland head and

4734
03:04:55,120 --> 03:05:00,399
it's far out because sometimes it stays

4735
03:04:57,238 --> 03:05:02,439
intact as the layer comes off and you

4736
03:05:00,398 --> 03:05:06,039
know because all the the the gland is

4737
03:05:02,439 --> 03:05:08,120
this hard structure and so it's it's not

4738
03:05:06,040 --> 03:05:09,439
as much of a water balloon as people

4739
03:05:08,120 --> 03:05:12,120
assume that you just poke it and it

4740
03:05:09,439 --> 03:05:15,559
oozes out sometimes it oozes out very

4741
03:05:12,120 --> 03:05:18,200
slowly and gradually sometimes it's

4742
03:05:15,559 --> 03:05:19,879
R ruptured but still

4743
03:05:18,200 --> 03:05:22,040
so like that freezing and that dry sing

4744
03:05:19,879 --> 03:05:24,119
still works to get it through I think

4745
03:05:22,040 --> 03:05:26,160
that's all just the turine ratio that's

4746
03:05:24,120 --> 03:05:27,760
left like how much and the in the

4747
03:05:26,159 --> 03:05:30,398
temperature that you're at you know if

4748
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:33,359
it's like super turpy it'll it'll be

4749
03:05:30,398 --> 03:05:35,799
gelatinous and if it's like a really low

4750
03:05:33,359 --> 03:05:38,000
turpine you know Turing I mean just all

4751
03:05:35,799 --> 03:05:39,639
of those types of compounds uh

4752
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:41,799
particularly in my imagination it' be

4753
03:05:39,639 --> 03:05:43,599
like alcohol type compounds Just Like

4754
03:05:41,799 --> 03:05:47,238
Liquor doesn't freeze in your freezer

4755
03:05:43,600 --> 03:05:50,399
right so THC it it's hard at like 60 or

4756
03:05:47,238 --> 03:05:53,000
70 degrees and the more TPS you add the

4757
03:05:50,398 --> 03:05:55,799
lower the freezing point gets you I

4758
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:58,398
think goes down to varietal and what's

4759
03:05:55,799 --> 03:06:01,079
there if you're saying like of what that

4760
03:05:58,398 --> 03:06:02,639
100% of what class of chemical

4761
03:06:01,079 --> 03:06:05,600
constituents are there let's say it's

4762
03:06:02,639 --> 03:06:07,879
highpine or high beta chylene or what

4763
03:06:05,600 --> 03:06:09,439
whatever that might be I think that

4764
03:06:07,879 --> 03:06:12,159
spread what you're talking about

4765
03:06:09,439 --> 03:06:14,880
Fletcher I think it's sometimes inside

4766
03:06:12,159 --> 03:06:16,520
of that that wax cuticle and and

4767
03:06:14,879 --> 03:06:18,599
sometimes it's some of the constituents

4768
03:06:16,520 --> 03:06:21,238
are are actually on the outside so

4769
03:06:18,600 --> 03:06:23,359
you're you're but if it's on the outside

4770
03:06:21,238 --> 03:06:26,159
and it washes but the head still stays

4771
03:06:23,359 --> 03:06:28,479
intact we'll get half from it right

4772
03:06:26,159 --> 03:06:31,639
there's certain strains you justt wash

4773
03:06:28,478 --> 03:06:34,159
it and there's literally nothing in

4774
03:06:31,639 --> 03:06:37,159
backing forward right yeah totally yeah

4775
03:06:34,159 --> 03:06:38,799
exactly well and that's I wanted to real

4776
03:06:37,159 --> 03:06:40,478
quick jump in on you know and I really

4777
03:06:38,799 --> 03:06:43,119
appreciate you bringing that up Fletcher

4778
03:06:40,478 --> 03:06:45,119
um bigger respect to Archive as well um

4779
03:06:43,120 --> 03:06:47,800
yeah it's it's really awesome to kind of

4780
03:06:45,120 --> 03:06:50,239
you know and skunkman Sam joining of

4781
03:06:47,799 --> 03:06:51,679
this pretty Legend area but um it's very

4782
03:06:50,238 --> 03:06:54,359
fascinating because if you look at what

4783
03:06:51,680 --> 03:06:56,200
washes typically the things that wash

4784
03:06:54,359 --> 03:06:58,318
best are care offline liing they're in

4785
03:06:56,200 --> 03:07:00,920
that dessert Zone they have the highest

4786
03:06:58,318 --> 03:07:03,760
yields and dumps as opposed to trying to

4787
03:07:00,920 --> 03:07:07,639
wash terpinolene doesn't wash trying to

4788
03:07:03,760 --> 03:07:09,559
wash like a or like I mean all the T all

4789
03:07:07,639 --> 03:07:12,039
the turpins will have different freezing

4790
03:07:09,559 --> 03:07:14,680
points some lower and some higher and

4791
03:07:12,040 --> 03:07:18,479
then concentrations of those versus the

4792
03:07:14,680 --> 03:07:21,200
cannaboid types and those freezing point

4793
03:07:18,478 --> 03:07:23,358
I mean I mean that's makes to me in

4794
03:07:21,200 --> 03:07:25,800
terms of the main factor that makes

4795
03:07:23,359 --> 03:07:27,640
stuff wash or extractable and it's also

4796
03:07:25,799 --> 03:07:30,079
of course temperature dependent like I

4797
03:07:27,639 --> 03:07:32,079
think besides the wash if you could get

4798
03:07:30,079 --> 03:07:34,318
the water colder

4799
03:07:32,079 --> 03:07:37,680
theoretically and besides the freezing

4800
03:07:34,318 --> 03:07:40,398
point it's also different Turpin have

4801
03:07:37,680 --> 03:07:42,040
different solubility in water yep

4802
03:07:40,398 --> 03:07:44,639
hydrophobic or hydrophilic yeah and

4803
03:07:42,040 --> 03:07:45,960
that's kind of something exactly exactly

4804
03:07:44,639 --> 03:07:48,799
yeah and that because that's a you know

4805
03:07:45,959 --> 03:07:51,639
because in in that topic you know like

4806
03:07:48,799 --> 03:07:54,079
what happens to thec those ones that

4807
03:07:51,639 --> 03:07:55,559
watch well real quick real quick um just

4808
03:07:54,079 --> 03:07:57,719
to you know because just wanted to make

4809
03:07:55,559 --> 03:08:00,959
a make a point on on um what we've seen

4810
03:07:57,719 --> 03:08:04,840
with testing right so certain you know

4811
03:08:00,959 --> 03:08:08,079
terpinolene you watch you you BHO that

4812
03:08:04,840 --> 03:08:10,439
it's the most high dump like awesome

4813
03:08:08,079 --> 03:08:12,159
like high turp you know so I think

4814
03:08:10,439 --> 03:08:14,040
there's the right type of extraction for

4815
03:08:12,159 --> 03:08:16,279
right type of Turk you know certain

4816
03:08:14,040 --> 03:08:19,160
things that don't wash like Sam saying

4817
03:08:16,279 --> 03:08:22,399
dry seeve wow you know kind of things

4818
03:08:19,159 --> 03:08:24,159
that you you know unable to do otherwise

4819
03:08:22,398 --> 03:08:26,318
unless you do something like butane

4820
03:08:24,159 --> 03:08:28,760
extract right which is great if you get

4821
03:08:26,318 --> 03:08:31,039
the residual out it's super bomb you

4822
03:08:28,760 --> 03:08:33,079
know um but the but what what I want to

4823
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:35,040
hit on too is like what is within the

4824
03:08:33,079 --> 03:08:36,398
plant right the biggest thing we've

4825
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:38,600
learned about potency and variance from

4826
03:08:36,398 --> 03:08:41,119
top middle to bottom has less to do with

4827
03:08:38,600 --> 03:08:43,238
kind of uh you know bouncing around to

4828
03:08:41,120 --> 03:08:45,560
lab Lab and has more to do with uh

4829
03:08:43,238 --> 03:08:47,159
optimal canopy management processes and

4830
03:08:45,559 --> 03:08:49,278
Le removing Leaf at the right times

4831
03:08:47,159 --> 03:08:52,238
critical through the development of

4832
03:08:49,279 --> 03:08:55,040
flowers and the maturing of flowers and

4833
03:08:52,238 --> 03:08:56,719
people that like strip and remove such a

4834
03:08:55,040 --> 03:08:59,720
vast you know which is very contrary to

4835
03:08:56,719 --> 03:09:02,119
a lot of the old school belief but you

4836
03:08:59,719 --> 03:09:04,199
know like removing 75% of found Leaf

4837
03:09:02,120 --> 03:09:06,120
right at the start of flower uh keeping

4838
03:09:04,200 --> 03:09:09,239
that off on day 21 keeping that off on

4839
03:09:06,120 --> 03:09:12,040
day 56 like what happens is every Bud

4840
03:09:09,238 --> 03:09:14,119
doesn't get any difference in light and

4841
03:09:12,040 --> 03:09:16,960
all mature kind of at the same rate was

4842
03:09:14,120 --> 03:09:20,120
what a top Bud tests so whatever a top

4843
03:09:16,959 --> 03:09:22,398
Bud test s if you have this like Optimal

4844
03:09:20,120 --> 03:09:24,040
canopy management process removing all

4845
03:09:22,398 --> 03:09:25,680
of the leaf at the right times and

4846
03:09:24,040 --> 03:09:29,080
keeping it off then all the buds kind of

4847
03:09:25,680 --> 03:09:31,639
mature at that rate and overall not only

4848
03:09:29,079 --> 03:09:33,639
do we see the standardization of canabo

4849
03:09:31,639 --> 03:09:36,278
content across a plant to what a topw

4850
03:09:33,639 --> 03:09:39,318
tests plus or minus like a 5% relative

4851
03:09:36,279 --> 03:09:41,720
difference um so if you had like a 25 up

4852
03:09:39,318 --> 03:09:44,159
top plus or minus like one and a half%

4853
03:09:41,719 --> 03:09:45,799
or 1.7% or whatever that is so you could

4854
03:09:44,159 --> 03:09:47,398
have kind of this standardization for

4855
03:09:45,799 --> 03:09:49,039
when a compliance test happens and

4856
03:09:47,398 --> 03:09:50,599
representative sampling you're like

4857
03:09:49,040 --> 03:09:52,640
right at the number what a top a test

4858
03:09:50,600 --> 03:09:54,359
right but if you remove like a lot of

4859
03:09:52,639 --> 03:09:56,478
farmers remove way too much Leaf way too

4860
03:09:54,359 --> 03:09:59,520
late in the flower and those are all

4861
03:09:56,478 --> 03:10:01,278
immature developed Buds and so there's

4862
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:04,159
you could have on the same plant you

4863
03:10:01,279 --> 03:10:05,960
know the 25 up here but like 12 or so

4864
03:10:04,159 --> 03:10:08,200
down here at the bottom and now the

4865
03:10:05,959 --> 03:10:09,599
average is like 18 right and so I think

4866
03:10:08,200 --> 03:10:11,439
part of it and you know because when

4867
03:10:09,600 --> 03:10:12,800
we've done this trial repeatedly across

4868
03:10:11,439 --> 03:10:14,720
cultivars and time with different

4869
03:10:12,799 --> 03:10:17,438
Farmers you know we've not only been

4870
03:10:14,719 --> 03:10:19,920
able to show not only can you

4871
03:10:17,439 --> 03:10:21,520
standardize what the canopy test what a

4872
03:10:19,920 --> 03:10:23,799
top Bud test and the genetic bring out

4873
03:10:21,520 --> 03:10:27,000
the genetic full potential the plant and

4874
03:10:23,799 --> 03:10:29,478
canavs and turps and other aromatics but

4875
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:31,680
um you get a yield increased yield per

4876
03:10:29,478 --> 03:10:32,840
plant increased extraction efficiency of

4877
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:35,079
what you're able to pull off that

4878
03:10:32,840 --> 03:10:36,439
material per plant you know because

4879
03:10:35,079 --> 03:10:38,719
because I think it's about optimization

4880
03:10:36,439 --> 03:10:41,880
of How It's cultivated for if it's going

4881
03:10:38,719 --> 03:10:43,719
to be extracted um and then further it's

4882
03:10:41,879 --> 03:10:45,278
about what is the extract what is the

4883
03:10:43,719 --> 03:10:46,760
appropriate extraction process for it to

4884
03:10:45,279 --> 03:10:48,079
be put through so you can even turn it

4885
03:10:46,760 --> 03:10:49,920
into hash

4886
03:10:48,079 --> 03:10:53,799
so dude you're you're touching on things

4887
03:10:49,920 --> 03:10:56,000
that I think is are are a must must have

4888
03:10:53,799 --> 03:10:57,719
topic because it's it's the most

4889
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:59,120
important thing I think any of the

4890
03:10:57,719 --> 03:11:00,879
individuals that are listening that are

4891
03:10:59,120 --> 03:11:03,640
hash makers in the chat right now if

4892
03:11:00,879 --> 03:11:05,318
you're actual hash maker what Alec was

4893
03:11:03,639 --> 03:11:06,760
touching on with your defoliation and

4894
03:11:05,318 --> 03:11:08,159
your Sops that go back to your

4895
03:11:06,760 --> 03:11:10,000
cultivation

4896
03:11:08,159 --> 03:11:11,279
techniques if you know if you've

4897
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:13,760
listened to any of the things that I've

4898
03:11:11,279 --> 03:11:15,760
ever said in any of the the the the

4899
03:11:13,760 --> 03:11:17,559
talks I've done it always starts with

4900
03:11:15,760 --> 03:11:20,200
defoliation and there's a reason Reon

4901
03:11:17,559 --> 03:11:22,318
why everything that Alex just said that

4902
03:11:20,200 --> 03:11:24,640
is going to exponentially help your

4903
03:11:22,318 --> 03:11:26,719
resin quality if you get in there early

4904
03:11:24,639 --> 03:11:28,639
enough and have a a really finite timing

4905
03:11:26,719 --> 03:11:31,398
in which you do that and where you do

4906
03:11:28,639 --> 03:11:33,398
that on the plant at what time so I'll

4907
03:11:31,398 --> 03:11:35,238
leave you to design that for yourselves

4908
03:11:33,398 --> 03:11:37,599
but that is the most that I've learned

4909
03:11:35,238 --> 03:11:40,639
over my time doing this from cultivation

4910
03:11:37,600 --> 03:11:42,399
to oil and there's there's a lot that

4911
03:11:40,639 --> 03:11:44,278
goes into that and it's not just about

4912
03:11:42,398 --> 03:11:46,760
being a great extractor it's about being

4913
03:11:44,279 --> 03:11:50,238
a great Steward of that plant from that

4914
03:11:46,760 --> 03:11:52,238
seed to oil and understanding all the

4915
03:11:50,238 --> 03:11:53,719
ways that you need to do the things you

4916
03:11:52,238 --> 03:11:55,799
need to do in your Sops and work

4917
03:11:53,719 --> 03:11:57,119
instructions as a team because it's not

4918
03:11:55,799 --> 03:11:59,438
singular especially when you're doing

4919
03:11:57,120 --> 03:12:02,560
things at scale it all has to work in

4920
03:11:59,439 --> 03:12:04,359
Harmony and that's a very difficult task

4921
03:12:02,559 --> 03:12:06,559
um so I think that's dude you just you

4922
03:12:04,359 --> 03:12:08,279
hit on all kinds of things that I that I

4923
03:12:06,559 --> 03:12:10,920
really think about on a daily basis

4924
03:12:08,279 --> 03:12:12,640
because it's not just one part of the

4925
03:12:10,920 --> 03:12:14,639
process that makes it great it's all

4926
03:12:12,639 --> 03:12:17,599
these things that amount to where you

4927
03:12:14,639 --> 03:12:19,599
end up and well

4928
03:12:17,600 --> 03:12:22,200
I think really I think totally I

4929
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:24,000
appreciate that um and I and you know

4930
03:12:22,200 --> 03:12:26,439
and you know because I think hesting has

4931
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:28,238
helped me in the huge raat realize so

4932
03:12:26,439 --> 03:12:30,120
much of what the passion people have for

4933
03:12:28,238 --> 03:12:33,279
the plant and for extraction have helped

4934
03:12:30,120 --> 03:12:35,160
them to learn already you know and and I

4935
03:12:33,279 --> 03:12:37,640
think they complement in an incredibly

4936
03:12:35,159 --> 03:12:41,439
big way and and I think a big part of

4937
03:12:37,639 --> 03:12:43,199
this too is you know um diversity right

4938
03:12:41,439 --> 03:12:46,520
because can cannabis has become

4939
03:12:43,200 --> 03:12:48,680
homogenized in the chase for THC strains

4940
03:12:46,520 --> 03:12:50,920
as well as in the chase for strains that

4941
03:12:48,680 --> 03:12:53,559
wash right and we now see in this

4942
03:12:50,920 --> 03:12:56,359
California State Fair in the emerald cup

4943
03:12:53,559 --> 03:12:59,359
you know 60 80% of Any Given category or

4944
03:12:56,359 --> 03:13:01,079
more in the solventless category are all

4945
03:12:59,359 --> 03:13:02,600
the same profile they're very slight

4946
03:13:01,079 --> 03:13:04,520
variations of the same thing and so the

4947
03:13:02,600 --> 03:13:06,880
only thing that people really enter that

4948
03:13:04,520 --> 03:13:08,760
are different or quote unquote exotic

4949
03:13:06,879 --> 03:13:10,519
have some unique Esther or turp or

4950
03:13:08,760 --> 03:13:12,840
something in there like the tropican

4951
03:13:10,520 --> 03:13:14,520
sulfur turps to make like Mimosa smell

4952
03:13:12,840 --> 03:13:16,478
unique which is why people are like oh

4953
03:13:14,520 --> 03:13:19,640
it's exotic it's not exotic it's

4954
03:13:16,478 --> 03:13:21,519
actually abundant and and strong man Sam

4955
03:13:19,639 --> 03:13:24,159
helped bring that to the world you know

4956
03:13:21,520 --> 03:13:26,840
but the thing is is uh it's about like

4957
03:13:24,159 --> 03:13:29,039
diverse cultivar covering the range of

4958
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:31,799
what's possible and then finding and

4959
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:33,800
fine-tuning both the pruning cany

4960
03:13:31,799 --> 03:13:35,478
management process as well as what is

4961
03:13:33,799 --> 03:13:37,719
the ideal extraction process to make

4962
03:13:35,478 --> 03:13:40,879
that most awesome representation of that

4963
03:13:37,719 --> 03:13:42,719
cultivar through hash question for you

4964
03:13:40,879 --> 03:13:44,719
now do you think that's due to and this

4965
03:13:42,719 --> 03:13:47,238
is no shade on clone houses that are

4966
03:13:44,719 --> 03:13:49,799
actually doing commercial cloning not

4967
03:13:47,238 --> 03:13:52,039
guys that are selling clones online do

4968
03:13:49,799 --> 03:13:54,398
you think that's problematic within that

4969
03:13:52,040 --> 03:13:56,120
system that we've developed that you buy

4970
03:13:54,398 --> 03:13:58,599
from a clone house they just have a menu

4971
03:13:56,120 --> 03:14:00,399
for That season that's all you get you

4972
03:13:58,600 --> 03:14:04,279
your pigeon hold into buying whatever

4973
03:14:00,398 --> 03:14:06,199
Kush cake or whatever Skittles they're

4974
03:14:04,279 --> 03:14:09,680
growing that at large or blue drain

4975
03:14:06,200 --> 03:14:11,880
whatever it is um what do you you know

4976
03:14:09,680 --> 03:14:14,520
how do we because you know it's it's

4977
03:14:11,879 --> 03:14:17,159
let's be honest it's scale um owning

4978
03:14:14,520 --> 03:14:19,238
moms and propagation is very expensive

4979
03:14:17,159 --> 03:14:21,959
and it's it's probably the the most

4980
03:14:19,238 --> 03:14:25,439
expensive aspect of of doing all this to

4981
03:14:21,959 --> 03:14:28,358
get yourself set up to grow it um so I

4982
03:14:25,439 --> 03:14:30,439
wonder you know I keep thinking about it

4983
03:14:28,359 --> 03:14:32,238
because feno hunts are tough when you're

4984
03:14:30,439 --> 03:14:34,200
dealing with dollars and cents and

4985
03:14:32,238 --> 03:14:35,719
people that are don't truly own their

4986
03:14:34,200 --> 03:14:37,640
businesses right they're they're really

4987
03:14:35,719 --> 03:14:40,000
just taking money from people and

4988
03:14:37,639 --> 03:14:41,799
they're working for a VC or or a bunch

4989
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:43,600
of people that have funded it and

4990
03:14:41,799 --> 03:14:45,478
they're like they're just they're stuck

4991
03:14:43,600 --> 03:14:48,200
they've got to grow this that they know

4992
03:14:45,478 --> 03:14:50,358
sells and how do we break that mold too

4993
03:14:48,200 --> 03:14:52,000
you know because that's something we I

4994
03:14:50,359 --> 03:14:53,640
we talk about in our team is like we

4995
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:57,120
don't want to be stuck like caught into

4996
03:14:53,639 --> 03:14:58,559
that ever you know well Rob said Rob

4997
03:14:57,120 --> 03:15:00,960
said at the emerald cup years ago it got

4998
03:14:58,559 --> 03:15:03,398
quoted by LA Times which which was seeds

4999
03:15:00,959 --> 03:15:04,879
are life and clones are death and he was

5000
03:15:03,398 --> 03:15:07,920
talking about the bottlenecking of the

5001
03:15:04,879 --> 03:15:09,478
genome right of the gene pool and I know

5002
03:15:07,920 --> 03:15:12,478
of a particular Nursery which I won't

5003
03:15:09,478 --> 03:15:15,879
mention but in California over 50% of

5004
03:15:12,478 --> 03:15:18,478
their sales over 50% last year were

5005
03:15:15,879 --> 03:15:19,799
gelato 41

5006
03:15:18,478 --> 03:15:22,559
at least that one's got a little gas on

5007
03:15:19,799 --> 03:15:24,559
it you know yeah I know but 50% of the

5008
03:15:22,559 --> 03:15:27,198
entire sales and these guys are selling

5009
03:15:24,559 --> 03:15:28,879
all over the states and everywhere we're

5010
03:15:27,199 --> 03:15:30,840
one cutting and that's the big

5011
03:15:28,879 --> 03:15:32,679
bottleneck and to me that's a sign of

5012
03:15:30,840 --> 03:15:34,439
the fast food era that we're in right

5013
03:15:32,680 --> 03:15:36,439
now where everyone's just like cheap and

5014
03:15:34,439 --> 03:15:38,960
easy and what sells and what's colorful

5015
03:15:36,439 --> 03:15:40,680
and what's also a big part of that I

5016
03:15:38,959 --> 03:15:43,799
think is actually what's funny is I

5017
03:15:40,680 --> 03:15:46,398
think CU you know what we've seen is

5018
03:15:43,799 --> 03:15:49,159
this continuous homogenization of Cal of

5019
03:15:46,398 --> 03:15:51,119
flavors California to only be like 60

5020
03:15:49,159 --> 03:15:53,840
80% of what's back it reminds me back in

5021
03:15:51,120 --> 03:15:55,880
the day like in LA 48 or 50 strains on

5022
03:15:53,840 --> 03:15:57,520
the Shelf would be OG Kush variations

5023
03:15:55,879 --> 03:15:59,159
you know and there was like no

5024
03:15:57,520 --> 03:16:00,479
difference right and that blew out and

5025
03:15:59,159 --> 03:16:02,799
then kind of now the rise of the

5026
03:16:00,478 --> 03:16:04,760
desserts but now it's the same thing you

5027
03:16:02,799 --> 03:16:07,799
know and what's a trip of what I'm

5028
03:16:04,760 --> 03:16:09,719
seeing is so much I I I I believe that

5029
03:16:07,799 --> 03:16:12,318
the bulk buying Market is very

5030
03:16:09,719 --> 03:16:14,238
disconnected with the consumer Demand

5031
03:16:12,318 --> 03:16:16,439
right because the bulk buying Market

5032
03:16:14,238 --> 03:16:18,359
largely isn't trying to curtail to the

5033
03:16:16,439 --> 03:16:20,159
unique consumer demand in any given

5034
03:16:18,359 --> 03:16:22,238
state they're like playing to the

5035
03:16:20,159 --> 03:16:25,478
traditional Market you know and so you

5036
03:16:22,238 --> 03:16:28,398
got 60 to 80% of Herb in California

5037
03:16:25,478 --> 03:16:30,438
desserts and that's not slowing down you

5038
03:16:28,398 --> 03:16:33,519
know and you know even though

5039
03:16:30,439 --> 03:16:35,120
terpinolene right strains like that sage

5040
03:16:33,520 --> 03:16:36,840
like that train wreck you know they

5041
03:16:35,120 --> 03:16:39,439
represent like less than 10% of what's

5042
03:16:36,840 --> 03:16:42,199
on dispensary shelves but BDS analytics

5043
03:16:39,439 --> 03:16:44,639
and Leafly data have shown in various

5044
03:16:42,199 --> 03:16:47,279
regions of a state in various counties

5045
03:16:44,639 --> 03:16:48,920
Across the Nation when turpine varieties

5046
03:16:47,279 --> 03:16:50,439
are around they move like five to eight

5047
03:16:48,920 --> 03:16:52,600
times as quick as anything else on the

5048
03:16:50,439 --> 03:16:54,960
Shelf till they're gone right and so

5049
03:16:52,600 --> 03:16:57,199
that's a different value right and and I

5050
03:16:54,959 --> 03:16:58,559
think like ultimately the idea of like

5051
03:16:57,199 --> 03:17:00,520
you know because I think every

5052
03:16:58,559 --> 03:17:02,119
cultivator has to make those types of

5053
03:17:00,520 --> 03:17:04,159
choices right are you g to grow nothing

5054
03:17:02,120 --> 03:17:06,319
but Skittles and gelato by Skittles

5055
03:17:04,159 --> 03:17:07,639
gelato crosses even though 80% of the

5056
03:17:06,318 --> 03:17:09,478
Market's that you know because unless

5057
03:17:07,639 --> 03:17:11,519
your herb is like twice as tped and

5058
03:17:09,478 --> 03:17:13,519
preserved as everything else you just

5059
03:17:11,520 --> 03:17:15,760
blend in with the mass of everything

5060
03:17:13,520 --> 03:17:17,800
else you know but by diversifying your

5061
03:17:15,760 --> 03:17:20,000
portfolio having all these other

5062
03:17:17,799 --> 03:17:23,639
cultivators sure you might grow gelato

5063
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:26,520
41 50% or more of what you bulk grow but

5064
03:17:23,639 --> 03:17:29,439
as long as you have those like really

5065
03:17:26,520 --> 03:17:32,079
epic isolated fenos that you love that

5066
03:17:29,439 --> 03:17:33,880
cover like range of smell and flavor you

5067
03:17:32,079 --> 03:17:37,039
know you can always grow those in

5068
03:17:33,879 --> 03:17:39,119
smaller amounts keep them going and find

5069
03:17:37,040 --> 03:17:41,560
the niche markets and areas in where

5070
03:17:39,120 --> 03:17:44,040
you're at to be able to really start

5071
03:17:41,559 --> 03:17:46,079
building a grassroot demand for those

5072
03:17:44,040 --> 03:17:48,520
because you know what we're seeing when

5073
03:17:46,079 --> 03:17:49,840
people do that like a leap of faith

5074
03:17:48,520 --> 03:17:51,960
because it's like you're making huge

5075
03:17:49,840 --> 03:17:54,238
choices you know but it's like don't not

5076
03:17:51,959 --> 03:17:57,799
grow it just grow way less of it until

5077
03:17:54,238 --> 03:17:59,719
you can start justifying that you know

5078
03:17:57,799 --> 03:18:04,920
or the other thing the other thing that

5079
03:17:59,719 --> 03:18:08,879
can be done is people can cyrogenic

5080
03:18:04,920 --> 03:18:14,719
freeze cryogenically freeze and uh

5081
03:18:08,879 --> 03:18:14,719
clones and uh keep them for uh

5082
03:18:15,600 --> 03:18:20,720
forever I I think what we're going to

5083
03:18:17,639 --> 03:18:23,079
find like in the future Market when

5084
03:18:20,719 --> 03:18:25,879
everywhere has legal grows and there's

5085
03:18:23,079 --> 03:18:28,959
just you know it's available everywhere

5086
03:18:25,879 --> 03:18:31,559
is if you're not innovating your product

5087
03:18:28,959 --> 03:18:34,079
with your products you're G to be

5088
03:18:31,559 --> 03:18:36,359
commoditized or pushed into that market

5089
03:18:34,079 --> 03:18:38,238
because you and everybody else that

5090
03:18:36,359 --> 03:18:40,559
bought the same clones this year are all

5091
03:18:38,238 --> 03:18:43,000
in the market together it doesn't matter

5092
03:18:40,559 --> 03:18:44,879
how new they are you bring back

5093
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:47,559
something from three years ago it it

5094
03:18:44,879 --> 03:18:50,039
won't matter and the the more

5095
03:18:47,559 --> 03:18:52,559
commercialized Growers are are playing

5096
03:18:50,040 --> 03:18:54,239
that game and buying from those places

5097
03:18:52,559 --> 03:18:56,519
and not finding something unique to

5098
03:18:54,238 --> 03:18:58,920
their business the quicker it's going to

5099
03:18:56,520 --> 03:19:02,479
continue to move in that direction well

5100
03:18:58,920 --> 03:19:05,559
to be honest what I I made a lot of

5101
03:19:02,478 --> 03:19:08,719
seeds in my life but the seeds I made

5102
03:19:05,559 --> 03:19:13,318
were I tried to think of other people

5103
03:19:08,719 --> 03:19:13,318
but really they were the ones that I

5104
03:19:13,600 --> 03:19:18,720
like well you have a dis pallet man

5105
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:23,159
and we each do and that's what's so cool

5106
03:19:21,398 --> 03:19:25,478
about this plant you know it's like it

5107
03:19:23,159 --> 03:19:28,079
tickles our old factory senses in a way

5108
03:19:25,478 --> 03:19:30,559
that I mean some people can't eat

5109
03:19:28,079 --> 03:19:32,680
cilantro because it's soapy or don't

5110
03:19:30,559 --> 03:19:34,840
like chocolate or cacao because of the

5111
03:19:32,680 --> 03:19:36,318
bitterness you know and others love it

5112
03:19:34,840 --> 03:19:37,880
you know and that's where you know I

5113
03:19:36,318 --> 03:19:39,359
think it's really about you know what

5114
03:19:37,879 --> 03:19:41,039
we've been working with the emerald Cup

5115
03:19:39,359 --> 03:19:42,439
and the state faon and some really

5116
03:19:41,040 --> 03:19:44,359
Progressive dispensaries in the state

5117
03:19:42,439 --> 03:19:47,520
it's like when you present herb to

5118
03:19:44,359 --> 03:19:49,920
Consumers you know it's like do you have

5119
03:19:47,520 --> 03:19:51,279
80% of what's on your shelf is this one

5120
03:19:49,920 --> 03:19:52,879
thing because you're not really

5121
03:19:51,279 --> 03:19:55,640
providing a difference and there are all

5122
03:19:52,879 --> 03:19:57,599
the TPS gone right but it's like sorting

5123
03:19:55,639 --> 03:19:59,879
like kind of presenting it like when you

5124
03:19:57,600 --> 03:20:01,960
go because when you go into a wine store

5125
03:19:59,879 --> 03:20:04,398
or an alcohol store right like that

5126
03:20:01,959 --> 03:20:05,839
every cashier isn't a small EA nor

5127
03:20:04,398 --> 03:20:08,159
should they be expected to be that's a

5128
03:20:05,840 --> 03:20:10,120
lot to ask but whenever the average

5129
03:20:08,159 --> 03:20:12,680
consumer goes in you got your meros

5130
03:20:10,120 --> 03:20:15,000
merow Shard chardes Cabernet of Cabernet

5131
03:20:12,680 --> 03:20:16,359
roses right and so the average person

5132
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:19,520
can make a choice based on what they

5133
03:20:16,359 --> 03:20:21,760
know flavor preference is and um

5134
03:20:19,520 --> 03:20:23,680
presenting it in such a way not only

5135
03:20:21,760 --> 03:20:26,439
kind of helps to kind of

5136
03:20:23,680 --> 03:20:28,840
really get deeper into like helping

5137
03:20:26,439 --> 03:20:31,318
people find what best you know

5138
03:20:28,840 --> 03:20:33,840
Associates with their endoc canab system

5139
03:20:31,318 --> 03:20:35,959
but it also shows where you're lacking

5140
03:20:33,840 --> 03:20:38,478
you know and and helps to reestablish

5141
03:20:35,959 --> 03:20:42,278
value it's like hey dude if I've got

5142
03:20:38,478 --> 03:20:45,639
unlimited access to gelato 41 and cush

5143
03:20:42,279 --> 03:20:47,120
cake um but I don't have any plugs that

5144
03:20:45,639 --> 03:20:48,799
have anything in the awesome IND

5145
03:20:47,120 --> 03:20:52,640
dominant like tropical sleigh ride or

5146
03:20:48,799 --> 03:20:56,119
pineapple tie pineapple anything or kind

5147
03:20:52,639 --> 03:20:58,559
of terpinolene right or you know sweet

5148
03:20:56,120 --> 03:21:01,439
tooth like you know I mean I think kind

5149
03:20:58,559 --> 03:21:02,600
of um the more and all so much of it

5150
03:21:01,439 --> 03:21:04,079
happens with the retail because I think

5151
03:21:02,600 --> 03:21:06,399
the whole conversation around turps and

5152
03:21:04,079 --> 03:21:08,199
preservation of turs is like almost uh

5153
03:21:06,398 --> 03:21:10,318
preaching of the choir for those closest

5154
03:21:08,199 --> 03:21:12,279
to the plant you know because TN doesn't

5155
03:21:10,318 --> 03:21:15,159
matter right but once you get to like

5156
03:21:12,279 --> 03:21:16,840
the average purchaser at a dispensary

5157
03:21:15,159 --> 03:21:20,119
that's buying off spreadsheets and

5158
03:21:16,840 --> 03:21:22,760
strain names with THC percentages often

5159
03:21:20,120 --> 03:21:25,000
blown out inflated and not even real it

5160
03:21:22,760 --> 03:21:26,639
commoditized it right brings it to a

5161
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:29,959
point where it doesn't even it doesn't

5162
03:21:26,639 --> 03:21:33,000
mean anything and it it it Blends

5163
03:21:29,959 --> 03:21:35,879
biomass versus the most craft chronic

5164
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:38,279
herb in the world you know I absolutely

5165
03:21:35,879 --> 03:21:39,519
agree agree and on the consumer level

5166
03:21:38,279 --> 03:21:40,960
because and because and the awareness

5167
03:21:39,520 --> 03:21:43,199
and I'm sorry to I'm just wrapping the

5168
03:21:40,959 --> 03:21:45,719
point but the awareness is and the

5169
03:21:43,199 --> 03:21:47,800
Epiphany around this turps matter

5170
03:21:45,719 --> 03:21:49,679
aromatics are the most important thing

5171
03:21:47,799 --> 03:21:50,719
and if they're there or not you know

5172
03:21:49,680 --> 03:21:52,840
that's not going to come from an

5173
03:21:50,719 --> 03:21:54,559
epiphany at the average consumer level

5174
03:21:52,840 --> 03:21:56,199
or the average buyer dispensary that's

5175
03:21:54,559 --> 03:21:57,559
buying off spreadsheets is going to come

5176
03:21:56,199 --> 03:21:59,359
from the top thought leaders in the

5177
03:21:57,559 --> 03:22:01,680
space helping to disseminate that out

5178
03:21:59,359 --> 03:22:05,238
you know and leading by example you know

5179
03:22:01,680 --> 03:22:09,318
when is somebody going to test if

5180
03:22:05,238 --> 03:22:11,959
files can contribute and modulate THC

5181
03:22:09,318 --> 03:22:15,519
the way tping do because files the

5182
03:22:11,959 --> 03:22:19,119
latest Cades but nobody knows that they

5183
03:22:15,520 --> 03:22:20,960
potentiate or modulate cannabis

5184
03:22:19,120 --> 03:22:24,680
everybody has guesses but nobody's

5185
03:22:20,959 --> 03:22:26,079
proven it or indol that's that's the one

5186
03:22:24,680 --> 03:22:29,559
I've been

5187
03:22:26,079 --> 03:22:31,600
chasing pretty exciting stuff you know

5188
03:22:29,559 --> 03:22:33,159
and and Sam Actually I brought this up

5189
03:22:31,600 --> 03:22:35,079
earlier but I'd love your kind of

5190
03:22:33,159 --> 03:22:37,159
thoughts on it and your observations

5191
03:22:35,079 --> 03:22:39,959
especially since the orange that you had

5192
03:22:37,159 --> 03:22:42,238
as well as the skunk um you know because

5193
03:22:39,959 --> 03:22:44,398
when it comes to these trace thols and

5194
03:22:42,238 --> 03:22:47,279
sulfur compounds like tropican sulfur

5195
03:22:44,398 --> 03:22:50,639
that makes that Tangy you know orange

5196
03:22:47,279 --> 03:22:53,760
Citrus Vibe um and then the the thols

5197
03:22:50,639 --> 03:22:55,840
that make the gas Vibe right like the

5198
03:22:53,760 --> 03:22:58,199
nose can pick them up at such levels

5199
03:22:55,840 --> 03:23:00,000
that push the capabilities of even the

5200
03:22:58,199 --> 03:23:01,960
most sophisticated analytical chemistry

5201
03:23:00,000 --> 03:23:03,318
equipment and when whenever you go to

5202
03:23:01,959 --> 03:23:05,639
concentrate it and they're there in the

5203
03:23:03,318 --> 03:23:07,439
biggest amounts you know they can be you

5204
03:23:05,639 --> 03:23:08,398
know at that point you know they're

5205
03:23:07,439 --> 03:23:11,159
they're you know we're we've been

5206
03:23:08,398 --> 03:23:13,439
working on methods to develop see what

5207
03:23:11,159 --> 03:23:16,119
of them are even possibly to be tested

5208
03:23:13,439 --> 03:23:18,359
for in flower versus kind of what can be

5209
03:23:16,120 --> 03:23:20,040
shown up and concentrated in extracts

5210
03:23:18,359 --> 03:23:21,920
but that's also where the human nose

5211
03:23:20,040 --> 03:23:24,120
takes it to a whole another level and I

5212
03:23:21,920 --> 03:23:26,398
think this the marriage between science

5213
03:23:24,120 --> 03:23:28,880
and the human old factory triple you

5214
03:23:26,398 --> 03:23:30,760
know Mass spectrometer um I think is

5215
03:23:28,879 --> 03:23:33,920
where kind of this all really is where

5216
03:23:30,760 --> 03:23:36,000
it it kind of evolves to help uh

5217
03:23:33,920 --> 03:23:37,840
celebrate the nuances because in the in

5218
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:39,920
the emerald cup we we just launched a

5219
03:23:37,840 --> 03:23:42,199
new category and that's the the Citrus

5220
03:23:39,920 --> 03:23:43,760
category and because there are so many

5221
03:23:42,199 --> 03:23:46,479
examples entered that people were

5222
03:23:43,760 --> 03:23:48,000
entering as exotic but were there were

5223
03:23:46,478 --> 03:23:50,000
as numerous as gas in the whole

5224
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:52,120
competition and they spanned across

5225
03:23:50,000 --> 03:23:53,840
tpine categories from the mirin category

5226
03:23:52,120 --> 03:23:55,199
to the Carl Ling category to the

5227
03:23:53,840 --> 03:23:57,639
turpening

5228
03:23:55,199 --> 03:24:02,000
category question guys we were breeding

5229
03:23:57,639 --> 03:24:06,000
for tping what we found was and this

5230
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:09,799
blew Rob Clark and M mindes because we

5231
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:13,559
crossed hay with a hemp variety and made

5232
03:24:09,799 --> 03:24:17,759
an grew out the f2s made a selection and

5233
03:24:13,559 --> 03:24:20,959
we found one that smelled exactly like P

5234
03:24:17,760 --> 03:24:20,960
but it had no

5235
03:24:21,520 --> 03:24:28,560
THC and we know how much you do not like

5236
03:24:24,279 --> 03:24:28,560
that that really [ __ ] with your

5237
03:24:28,760 --> 03:24:35,079
nose so Alec like with all that you just

5238
03:24:31,719 --> 03:24:38,198
said imagine owning that wine shop and

5239
03:24:35,079 --> 03:24:40,719
selling like the most rare grapes in the

5240
03:24:38,199 --> 03:24:42,239
world and then having this little tiny

5241
03:24:40,719 --> 03:24:45,278
section on the right that's just like

5242
03:24:42,238 --> 03:24:47,478
ever CLE and some other weird stuff and

5243
03:24:45,279 --> 03:24:48,880
your customers in they're like what do

5244
03:24:47,478 --> 03:24:51,000
you got and you're like well I got all

5245
03:24:48,879 --> 03:24:53,358
this amazing stuff and all these really

5246
03:24:51,000 --> 03:24:56,879
amazing flavors then I've got this stuff

5247
03:24:53,359 --> 03:25:00,720
over here 99 proof Yep they're like well

5248
03:24:56,879 --> 03:25:05,759
I'll take that stuff over there that's

5249
03:25:00,719 --> 03:25:08,079
sure you know 99 proof it's 200 proof

5250
03:25:05,760 --> 03:25:11,279
200 proof or whatever whatever the proof

5251
03:25:08,079 --> 03:25:13,398
is but it's it really it's it feels like

5252
03:25:11,279 --> 03:25:15,640
that's kind of where things have landed

5253
03:25:13,398 --> 03:25:18,238
in in a weird way maybe maybe I correct

5254
03:25:15,639 --> 03:25:21,358
me if I'm wrong anyway but it just seems

5255
03:25:18,238 --> 03:25:24,680
like that analogy feels real right now

5256
03:25:21,359 --> 03:25:26,680
and we as you said Alec like we we we

5257
03:25:24,680 --> 03:25:29,040
can only all as a community talk about

5258
03:25:26,680 --> 03:25:30,559
how that's problematic and we need we do

5259
03:25:29,040 --> 03:25:33,720
need to change it because there is more

5260
03:25:30,559 --> 03:25:36,439
to all of this than just a a

5261
03:25:33,719 --> 03:25:39,920
monomolecular substance and you know

5262
03:25:36,439 --> 03:25:42,479
those that are on here disagree okay but

5263
03:25:39,920 --> 03:25:44,159
um I I don't know I just wanted to spark

5264
03:25:42,478 --> 03:25:46,920
that conversation with everybody here is

5265
03:25:44,159 --> 03:25:48,439
like is that really the path you know

5266
03:25:46,920 --> 03:25:52,000
because there is many paths to

5267
03:25:48,439 --> 03:25:54,159
Therapeutics here um sometimes a

5268
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:57,840
monomolecular compound is Right

5269
03:25:54,159 --> 03:26:00,600
sometimes not but well also too some

5270
03:25:57,840 --> 03:26:03,159
people want the most punch they can get

5271
03:26:00,600 --> 03:26:06,840
for their buck

5272
03:26:03,159 --> 03:26:10,760
and they think that it's THC but for

5273
03:26:06,840 --> 03:26:14,478
example my best skunk clone was only

5274
03:26:10,760 --> 03:26:17,559
177% THC but it was super rich in the

5275
03:26:14,478 --> 03:26:22,358
right turfing yeah like 3 to one T ratio

5276
03:26:17,559 --> 03:26:26,680
5% T and people preferred it over stuff

5277
03:26:22,359 --> 03:26:29,479
that was 22 and 25 THC

5278
03:26:26,680 --> 03:26:31,000
sure right so we haven't proved what we

5279
03:26:29,478 --> 03:26:32,760
haven't shown what potency is with

5280
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:34,439
cannabis at all and that's a big issue

5281
03:26:32,760 --> 03:26:35,880
right we've all we all we like potent

5282
03:26:34,439 --> 03:26:37,279
candles we all like to get high but we

5283
03:26:35,879 --> 03:26:40,119
don't know what potency is and even in

5284
03:26:37,279 --> 03:26:42,399
the literature we use the attached THC

5285
03:26:40,120 --> 03:26:44,920
to potency and like we all know that

5286
03:26:42,398 --> 03:26:46,519
that that's not no one was measuring THC

5287
03:26:44,920 --> 03:26:48,199
in land race populations when they're

5288
03:26:46,520 --> 03:26:51,199
selecting for potency for a thousand

5289
03:26:48,199 --> 03:26:55,439
years they're selecting for potency one

5290
03:26:51,199 --> 03:26:56,880
thing right but um the market you know

5291
03:26:55,439 --> 03:26:58,040
and they want to pay for their they

5292
03:26:56,879 --> 03:26:59,839
that's what they want to do they want to

5293
03:26:58,040 --> 03:27:02,640
get the biggest bang for their Buck but

5294
03:26:59,840 --> 03:27:05,960
we we know that we can deliver a more

5295
03:27:02,639 --> 03:27:08,278
potent variety that's at a lower THC so

5296
03:27:05,959 --> 03:27:10,198
that's that's just about us being bold

5297
03:27:08,279 --> 03:27:12,439
like Alex said brands have to be bold

5298
03:27:10,199 --> 03:27:14,239
breeders have to be bold we have to put

5299
03:27:12,439 --> 03:27:16,520
the product on the shelf for them to

5300
03:27:14,238 --> 03:27:18,359
choose from but at the same time the

5301
03:27:16,520 --> 03:27:20,479
Market's been dumbed down so much that

5302
03:27:18,359 --> 03:27:22,439
they just choose dessert flavors so what

5303
03:27:20,478 --> 03:27:24,559
I think we should do Alec is take all

5304
03:27:22,439 --> 03:27:27,318
the hazes the sages the train wrecks the

5305
03:27:24,559 --> 03:27:28,879
Jacks the durans and rename them all

5306
03:27:27,318 --> 03:27:33,159
fruity flowery

5307
03:27:28,879 --> 03:27:36,318
names purple candy gas yeah yeah what we

5308
03:27:33,159 --> 03:27:37,719
could try and do is educate the consumer

5309
03:27:36,318 --> 03:27:39,119
yeah that's it that's the that's the

5310
03:27:37,719 --> 03:27:42,559
answer friend you were gonna say

5311
03:27:39,120 --> 03:27:44,399
something dude well it just thank you

5312
03:27:42,559 --> 03:27:46,359
just seems like it's kind of confusion

5313
03:27:44,398 --> 03:27:50,478
on both ends when I hear that where you

5314
03:27:46,359 --> 03:27:52,520
have like a high-end bottle of wine and

5315
03:27:50,478 --> 03:27:54,840
and then you have like the low-end

5316
03:27:52,520 --> 03:27:57,359
alcohol so it's kind of confused on the

5317
03:27:54,840 --> 03:28:00,000
Shelf already or in the same in that at

5318
03:27:57,359 --> 03:28:01,840
the store but then confusion on the

5319
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:04,040
customer on the clientele end too where

5320
03:28:01,840 --> 03:28:06,318
if they're coming into that store you

5321
03:28:04,040 --> 03:28:08,560
know not sure where that begins or how

5322
03:28:06,318 --> 03:28:10,959
to where that would correct I'd almost

5323
03:28:08,559 --> 03:28:14,198
go back to Sam or someone in Amsterdam

5324
03:28:10,959 --> 03:28:16,119
right now where checking in to see if

5325
03:28:14,199 --> 03:28:18,800
there if there are any like really high

5326
03:28:16,120 --> 03:28:21,399
highend or organic you know organic

5327
03:28:18,799 --> 03:28:24,599
regenerative even soil grown you know as

5328
03:28:21,398 --> 03:28:27,238
the basis for for high-end cannabis or

5329
03:28:24,600 --> 03:28:29,238
hash in Amsterdam as you know like a are

5330
03:28:27,238 --> 03:28:31,600
there places where you could find any of

5331
03:28:29,238 --> 03:28:34,159
that because I haven't heard you can you

5332
03:28:31,600 --> 03:28:37,120
can you have to find it by word of mouth

5333
03:28:34,159 --> 03:28:40,238
but it's it it can be done but it's a

5334
03:28:37,120 --> 03:28:41,160
minority of the product I always Pro my

5335
03:28:40,238 --> 03:28:44,639
plants

5336
03:28:41,159 --> 03:28:46,879
organically in the soil in the ground in

5337
03:28:44,639 --> 03:28:50,398
a greenhouse yeah I would have grown It

5338
03:28:46,879 --> 03:28:54,559
Outdoors in California but you can't do

5339
03:28:50,398 --> 03:28:56,079
it Outdoors here it just don't work well

5340
03:28:54,559 --> 03:28:58,760
right in

5341
03:28:56,079 --> 03:29:03,840
Amsterdam I can't remember who said it

5342
03:28:58,760 --> 03:29:08,199
earlier but uh you were talking about

5343
03:29:03,840 --> 03:29:10,760
um with uh with the market difference

5344
03:29:08,199 --> 03:29:13,920
between uh or the demands of the

5345
03:29:10,760 --> 03:29:16,840
traditional Market versus what the

5346
03:29:13,920 --> 03:29:19,879
actual recreational consumer is

5347
03:29:16,840 --> 03:29:23,000
and that drives a lot of what people

5348
03:29:19,879 --> 03:29:25,719
grow in terms of like the like you know

5349
03:29:23,000 --> 03:29:28,359
just in that conversation of of what

5350
03:29:25,719 --> 03:29:30,198
strains people are choosing to grow and

5351
03:29:28,359 --> 03:29:33,600
why the market is like candy heavy and

5352
03:29:30,199 --> 03:29:35,520
it's because most Rec grows big big ones

5353
03:29:33,600 --> 03:29:38,760
especially are having a hard time moving

5354
03:29:35,520 --> 03:29:40,760
all their stuff through recck shops y so

5355
03:29:38,760 --> 03:29:45,040
they're still trying to manage all right

5356
03:29:40,760 --> 03:29:47,559
we're going to plant 80% runs and then

5357
03:29:45,040 --> 03:29:49,120
20% couple sativas and some [ __ ] and if

5358
03:29:47,559 --> 03:29:51,000
it sells on they don't even put any

5359
03:29:49,120 --> 03:29:52,439
energy into it and they're actually

5360
03:29:51,000 --> 03:29:55,760
growing more than the market really

5361
03:29:52,439 --> 03:30:00,120
demands of them for that product anyways

5362
03:29:55,760 --> 03:30:02,238
so and between those markets and then

5363
03:30:00,120 --> 03:30:04,319
and then businesses trying to fill both

5364
03:30:02,238 --> 03:30:05,879
at the same time right well and it's

5365
03:30:04,318 --> 03:30:08,039
keeping us in the Stone Age because in

5366
03:30:05,879 --> 03:30:10,318
any state where this the catering to the

5367
03:30:08,040 --> 03:30:12,399
east coast demand which is usually like

5368
03:30:10,318 --> 03:30:14,760
the fivey year ago Trend in like

5369
03:30:12,398 --> 03:30:16,639
California or another state you know

5370
03:30:14,760 --> 03:30:18,279
it's kind of leading to that's all you

5371
03:30:16,639 --> 03:30:19,920
can grow because that's all that bulk

5372
03:30:18,279 --> 03:30:23,238
buyers want to sell but again I think

5373
03:30:19,920 --> 03:30:26,318
that's where just like the you know the

5374
03:30:23,238 --> 03:30:28,520
leap of faith exists you know for people

5375
03:30:26,318 --> 03:30:30,318
that are in the wck market to kind of

5376
03:30:28,520 --> 03:30:32,960
again find the right ratios of what

5377
03:30:30,318 --> 03:30:34,519
you're growing but but don't give up and

5378
03:30:32,959 --> 03:30:36,159
like you know don't if you can't beat

5379
03:30:34,520 --> 03:30:38,079
them join them but not when it comes to

5380
03:30:36,159 --> 03:30:39,799
Growing nothing but that because it's

5381
03:30:38,079 --> 03:30:41,318
like that's going to be the collapse and

5382
03:30:39,799 --> 03:30:43,119
the commoditization of the market

5383
03:30:41,318 --> 03:30:45,198
whereas but then but then they have to

5384
03:30:43,120 --> 03:30:47,120
invest in breeding and finding their own

5385
03:30:45,199 --> 03:30:48,600
[ __ ] well isolating finding your right

5386
03:30:47,120 --> 03:30:50,000
finding the fenos that cover the range

5387
03:30:48,600 --> 03:30:52,079
but the people like I was mentioning

5388
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:53,238
earlier like in Oregon and California

5389
03:30:52,079 --> 03:30:55,600
that are selling out quicker than is

5390
03:30:53,238 --> 03:30:57,959
Trimm to the heist priced Market G bear

5391
03:30:55,600 --> 03:30:59,800
in the deepest floods you know they've

5392
03:30:57,959 --> 03:31:03,039
started to be able to kind of create

5393
03:30:59,799 --> 03:31:04,879
markets for these rare unique cultivars

5394
03:31:03,040 --> 03:31:06,680
because of how much they invested in

5395
03:31:04,879 --> 03:31:09,599
turp preservation infrastructure and

5396
03:31:06,680 --> 03:31:11,359
treating cannabis like cabbage and like

5397
03:31:09,600 --> 03:31:13,840
ensuring that they can deliver to the

5398
03:31:11,359 --> 03:31:16,120
point of sale at a retail shelf herb

5399
03:31:13,840 --> 03:31:18,478
that is hundreds of percents more more

5400
03:31:16,120 --> 03:31:20,680
flavorful aromatic sticky than anything

5401
03:31:18,478 --> 03:31:22,039
else on the Shelf you know those that do

5402
03:31:20,680 --> 03:31:23,439
that like there comes a point when a

5403
03:31:22,040 --> 03:31:25,040
market because every it happens in every

5404
03:31:23,439 --> 03:31:26,199
Market the same thing there's this over

5405
03:31:25,040 --> 03:31:27,640
production that leads to price

5406
03:31:26,199 --> 03:31:30,079
compression that leads to potency

5407
03:31:27,639 --> 03:31:31,599
inflation and fraudulent lab practices

5408
03:31:30,079 --> 03:31:33,719
that blows out the market and then the

5409
03:31:31,600 --> 03:31:35,559
consumers at some point lose faith in

5410
03:31:33,719 --> 03:31:37,000
the entire system and they're just

5411
03:31:35,559 --> 03:31:40,840
bouncing from Brand to brand with no

5412
03:31:37,000 --> 03:31:43,520
loyalty because everything has a 40%

5413
03:31:40,840 --> 03:31:45,600
flow result and tastes like hay you know

5414
03:31:43,520 --> 03:31:48,040
and so what happens is whenever that

5415
03:31:45,600 --> 03:31:50,120
happen s in a market and the consumer

5416
03:31:48,040 --> 03:31:51,800
loses faith and there's no loyalty those

5417
03:31:50,120 --> 03:31:53,920
that double down on tur preservation

5418
03:31:51,799 --> 03:31:55,759
that have a diverse array of profiles

5419
03:31:53,920 --> 03:31:57,639
all of a sudden through the dispensary

5420
03:31:55,760 --> 03:32:00,079
Market when they're delivering like this

5421
03:31:57,639 --> 03:32:02,639
they're like the the the Savior you know

5422
03:32:00,079 --> 03:32:04,398
and like all of a sudden the they build

5423
03:32:02,639 --> 03:32:05,559
these relations where they're you know

5424
03:32:04,398 --> 03:32:07,358
selling out quicker than trim the

5425
03:32:05,559 --> 03:32:09,600
highest price and a lot of them are

5426
03:32:07,359 --> 03:32:11,399
getting cash on delivery because of how

5427
03:32:09,600 --> 03:32:13,279
chronic their herb is and how high their

5428
03:32:11,398 --> 03:32:16,519
consumer demand and loyalty for that

5429
03:32:13,279 --> 03:32:19,079
brand is yep I mean like I know guys and

5430
03:32:16,520 --> 03:32:21,120
you know that only grow three varietal

5431
03:32:19,079 --> 03:32:23,159
just don't won't change because they

5432
03:32:21,120 --> 03:32:25,199
know it sells it's already sold before

5433
03:32:23,159 --> 03:32:28,199
it's down

5434
03:32:25,199 --> 03:32:29,720
CED and it's three of the most popular

5435
03:32:28,199 --> 03:32:33,040
varial in the game and they they're just

5436
03:32:29,719 --> 03:32:34,879
like I can't dir deviate because I'm I'm

5437
03:32:33,040 --> 03:32:37,960
you know I can't risk it you know it's

5438
03:32:34,879 --> 03:32:39,599
too risky to risk the fact that I might

5439
03:32:37,959 --> 03:32:42,879
have a bad batch when everything's just

5440
03:32:39,600 --> 03:32:44,720
sold right so I think that's another

5441
03:32:42,879 --> 03:32:46,920
that's another problem right so I think

5442
03:32:44,719 --> 03:32:49,079
there's also that too hereo I think

5443
03:32:46,920 --> 03:32:51,120
looking at markets like Oregon and

5444
03:32:49,079 --> 03:32:53,439
Washington that are just super mature at

5445
03:32:51,120 --> 03:32:55,279
this point and there's not California

5446
03:32:53,439 --> 03:32:58,120
Oklahoma all these other states have

5447
03:32:55,279 --> 03:33:00,279
taken over the like bulk game you know

5448
03:32:58,120 --> 03:33:02,120
so there's grows here aren't really

5449
03:33:00,279 --> 03:33:03,399
trying to cater to that for the most

5450
03:33:02,120 --> 03:33:05,800
part there's there's I mean there's

5451
03:33:03,398 --> 03:33:09,920
still some people but it's less so than

5452
03:33:05,799 --> 03:33:12,398
probably anywhere else and um yeah I I

5453
03:33:09,920 --> 03:33:14,279
think I think you're right Alec that uh

5454
03:33:12,398 --> 03:33:15,559
the companies that focus on preserving

5455
03:33:14,279 --> 03:33:19,640
the product to the consumer just like

5456
03:33:15,559 --> 03:33:21,359
you with a gallon of milk um uh is is

5457
03:33:19,639 --> 03:33:22,879
the name of the game and it's but it's

5458
03:33:21,359 --> 03:33:24,680
really hard to do that because most the

5459
03:33:22,879 --> 03:33:25,839
retail stores have no idea what they're

5460
03:33:24,680 --> 03:33:28,920
doing with their product and aren't

5461
03:33:25,840 --> 03:33:30,600
willing infastructure to do it which is

5462
03:33:28,920 --> 03:33:32,879
why we've been vertically integrated for

5463
03:33:30,600 --> 03:33:34,760
the last like seven or eight years in

5464
03:33:32,879 --> 03:33:37,398
Oregon it's because there was no other

5465
03:33:34,760 --> 03:33:38,800
way to do it you know I was I've I'm

5466
03:33:37,398 --> 03:33:40,840
from Washington and we couldn't

5467
03:33:38,799 --> 03:33:43,398
vertically integrate here legally so I

5468
03:33:40,840 --> 03:33:45,478
didn't do it here that's that's it it's

5469
03:33:43,398 --> 03:33:47,398
it was like there's no point for me to

5470
03:33:45,478 --> 03:33:50,159
I'm going to be end up in a commoditized

5471
03:33:47,398 --> 03:33:51,959
market if I can't control the

5472
03:33:50,159 --> 03:33:55,119
presentation and the supply and demand

5473
03:33:51,959 --> 03:33:58,318
of my own product and um it's turned out

5474
03:33:55,120 --> 03:34:00,720
well for us um but you have but you have

5475
03:33:58,318 --> 03:34:03,318
to gauge in size your market and your

5476
03:34:00,719 --> 03:34:04,879
demand and your supply correctly you

5477
03:34:03,318 --> 03:34:06,959
can't just be like oh I'll do as much as

5478
03:34:04,879 --> 03:34:10,599
I like because you're still you have to

5479
03:34:06,959 --> 03:34:12,358
remember you're focusing on some uh uh

5480
03:34:10,600 --> 03:34:14,720
satisfying your local consumer at the

5481
03:34:12,359 --> 03:34:16,439
end of the day it's not about all these

5482
03:34:14,719 --> 03:34:18,238
other people everywhere where else that

5483
03:34:16,439 --> 03:34:21,880
are coming into buy packs and all this

5484
03:34:18,238 --> 03:34:24,439
other [ __ ] which is where I'd say still

5485
03:34:21,879 --> 03:34:28,000
80% of the legal most legal markets are

5486
03:34:24,439 --> 03:34:32,000
still at and so and then you look at

5487
03:34:28,000 --> 03:34:34,959
Oregon and you can't really grow um the

5488
03:34:32,000 --> 03:34:37,879
like known clones for that long before

5489
03:34:34,959 --> 03:34:40,000
it's that strains commoditized so most

5490
03:34:37,879 --> 03:34:41,599
growers in Oregon are popping their own

5491
03:34:40,000 --> 03:34:43,318
seeds finding their own stuff making

5492
03:34:41,600 --> 03:34:46,520
their own hybrids making little deals

5493
03:34:43,318 --> 03:34:48,600
with other breeders to get some stuff in

5494
03:34:46,520 --> 03:34:50,199
and and that's becoming more and more

5495
03:34:48,600 --> 03:34:52,318
commonplace and those are those same

5496
03:34:50,199 --> 03:34:55,239
brands that are selling their product

5497
03:34:52,318 --> 03:34:58,398
out and but but they're not 500 lights

5498
03:34:55,238 --> 03:35:00,959
they're 50 lights exactly for for a guy

5499
03:34:58,398 --> 03:35:03,398
with you know a 50 lighter in his

5500
03:35:00,959 --> 03:35:06,198
backyard like it used to be but selling

5501
03:35:03,398 --> 03:35:10,760
it all legally at 3,000 a pound is a

5502
03:35:06,199 --> 03:35:12,279
great business um and uh that I think

5503
03:35:10,760 --> 03:35:14,238
looking at markets like Oregon and

5504
03:35:12,279 --> 03:35:16,800
Washington and even Canada kind of at

5505
03:35:14,238 --> 03:35:19,478
this point those big models aren't even

5506
03:35:16,799 --> 03:35:22,318
working even with export even with

5507
03:35:19,478 --> 03:35:25,438
export available to these big operations

5508
03:35:22,318 --> 03:35:28,920
in Canada it's not working it's

5509
03:35:25,439 --> 03:35:31,000
unable as not enough demand yeah and and

5510
03:35:28,920 --> 03:35:33,520
I feel like the plant is at certain

5511
03:35:31,000 --> 03:35:35,398
certain fundamental level uncor iable in

5512
03:35:33,520 --> 03:35:38,560
this way of scaling

5513
03:35:35,398 --> 03:35:40,719
commoditizing yeah yes they bought runs

5514
03:35:38,559 --> 03:35:42,920
into its own roadblocks with the

5515
03:35:40,719 --> 03:35:45,039
consumer trying to do it trying you're

5516
03:35:42,920 --> 03:35:47,520
not wrong the big companies have have

5517
03:35:45,040 --> 03:35:49,640
definitely like stopped trying to

5518
03:35:47,520 --> 03:35:51,760
produce millions of AC uh millions of

5519
03:35:49,639 --> 03:35:53,719
feet of canopy it's just not a reality

5520
03:35:51,760 --> 03:35:55,680
for them right now but there are some

5521
03:35:53,719 --> 03:35:58,438
larger outdoor grows like my friend

5522
03:35:55,680 --> 03:36:00,600
Merlin who was here with me earlier uh

5523
03:35:58,439 --> 03:36:03,559
he invited me to go see one in October

5524
03:36:00,600 --> 03:36:05,760
that's 94 Acres which is Big that's a

5525
03:36:03,559 --> 03:36:09,000
big grow that's producing a fair amount

5526
03:36:05,760 --> 03:36:11,478
of cannabis I've been in a 77 acre one I

5527
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:15,120
have a friend who has close to 200 acres

5528
03:36:11,478 --> 03:36:18,198
here in BC I'm sure there's right that's

5529
03:36:15,120 --> 03:36:20,399
for know I don't know if there I can't

5530
03:36:18,199 --> 03:36:22,680
imagine there's Canadians are buying all

5531
03:36:20,398 --> 03:36:24,478
that yeah but in the end with export

5532
03:36:22,680 --> 03:36:26,520
even it gets pretty strict and there's

5533
03:36:24,478 --> 03:36:29,639
most of like if it's European it's got

5534
03:36:26,520 --> 03:36:32,238
to be eug GMP if it's Australia you can

5535
03:36:29,639 --> 03:36:34,680
have some other regulations everyone's

5536
03:36:32,238 --> 03:36:37,359
definitely trying to get their their Mar

5537
03:36:34,680 --> 03:36:39,559
cannabis from Canada into those markets

5538
03:36:37,359 --> 03:36:41,600
because CA Canada doesn't have much of a

5539
03:36:39,559 --> 03:36:44,079
market it's a small that's my point

5540
03:36:41,600 --> 03:36:45,760
that's my point yeah it's a small Market

5541
03:36:44,079 --> 03:36:48,639
can't they destroy and just get full

5542
03:36:45,760 --> 03:36:53,279
value over Insurance up there because of

5543
03:36:48,639 --> 03:36:56,599
the structure no right they can't I

5544
03:36:53,279 --> 03:36:58,479
thought that they were allowed to other

5545
03:36:56,600 --> 03:37:00,600
other crops crop insurance but I don't

5546
03:36:58,478 --> 03:37:03,519
know about who's gonna insure

5547
03:37:00,600 --> 03:37:05,120
cannabis ins is really there is some

5548
03:37:03,520 --> 03:37:08,120
crop insurance but I think that like

5549
03:37:05,120 --> 03:37:10,160
right away that was probably abused or

5550
03:37:08,120 --> 03:37:12,640
used up it's like it's like when we

5551
03:37:10,159 --> 03:37:14,000
signed up with lighting there's so many

5552
03:37:12,639 --> 03:37:15,840
insurance policies that we did for

5553
03:37:14,000 --> 03:37:18,159
shipping and they'd be like after our

5554
03:37:15,840 --> 03:37:20,920
very first claim they' cut us

5555
03:37:18,159 --> 03:37:22,600
off what's the point well what's crazy

5556
03:37:20,920 --> 03:37:24,520
about crop insurance is it's like

5557
03:37:22,600 --> 03:37:26,359
because farmers and agriculture required

5558
03:37:24,520 --> 03:37:29,040
to create crop insurance not for if they

5559
03:37:26,359 --> 03:37:30,840
their crop [ __ ] and lost because their

5560
03:37:29,040 --> 03:37:32,760
practices but in case they get sued and

5561
03:37:30,840 --> 03:37:35,559
held liable because they're spraying and

5562
03:37:32,760 --> 03:37:38,079
overspray effects another Farm you know

5563
03:37:35,559 --> 03:37:40,359
so on that end with crop insurance and

5564
03:37:38,079 --> 03:37:42,199
agriculture that's on the high high

5565
03:37:40,359 --> 03:37:44,800
that's on the rise and premiums are on

5566
03:37:42,199 --> 03:37:46,800
the rise because cannabis farmers and

5567
03:37:44,799 --> 03:37:49,039
how valuable crop is whenever they get

5568
03:37:46,799 --> 03:37:51,438
drifted on there's hell to

5569
03:37:49,040 --> 03:37:54,760
pay well the government will pay you to

5570
03:37:51,439 --> 03:37:58,079
not grow in regular agriculture at least

5571
03:37:54,760 --> 03:38:00,800
sometimes yeah no it's the truth man

5572
03:37:58,079 --> 03:38:03,398
yeah it's I think the couple thing Alex

5573
03:38:00,799 --> 03:38:05,920
you said you know really resonated with

5574
03:38:03,398 --> 03:38:08,000
like what is too much and same with you

5575
03:38:05,920 --> 03:38:09,600
you know Fletch like what is too much

5576
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:13,680
you know what is the canopy size that

5577
03:38:09,600 --> 03:38:15,880
makes it makes sense so everybody with

5578
03:38:13,680 --> 03:38:18,159
population you just do it with popul

5579
03:38:15,879 --> 03:38:20,039
consumer based X percentage smoke this

5580
03:38:18,159 --> 03:38:22,079
amount and then you look at it go this

5581
03:38:20,040 --> 03:38:23,239
is the amount of square foot not lights

5582
03:38:22,079 --> 03:38:25,279
not anything else this is how many

5583
03:38:23,238 --> 03:38:27,198
square feet we need how many people do

5584
03:38:25,279 --> 03:38:29,319
we think are going to try to be in this

5585
03:38:27,199 --> 03:38:31,479
business 5,000 people break the square

5586
03:38:29,318 --> 03:38:33,719
footage down to the square to the people

5587
03:38:31,478 --> 03:38:36,079
that's where you start everybody starts

5588
03:38:33,719 --> 03:38:38,238
there if you can if you can sell your

5589
03:38:36,079 --> 03:38:39,760
[ __ ] out you can get more licensing and

5590
03:38:38,238 --> 03:38:42,039
more licensing and keep growing your

5591
03:38:39,760 --> 03:38:44,920
business that's how I would do it I like

5592
03:38:42,040 --> 03:38:47,520
that I mean Massachusetts has a path

5593
03:38:44,920 --> 03:38:49,439
like that for for the 5,000 foot micro

5594
03:38:47,520 --> 03:38:52,399
business where you can resubmit if

5595
03:38:49,439 --> 03:38:54,960
you're you know if you need more um I

5596
03:38:52,398 --> 03:38:56,519
think it's Anor it also keeps corporate

5597
03:38:54,959 --> 03:38:59,119
investment out because the first stage

5598
03:38:56,520 --> 03:39:00,600
will be such a low bar that it won't

5599
03:38:59,120 --> 03:39:03,560
have millions and millions and millions

5600
03:39:00,600 --> 03:39:05,399
of dollars worth of of returns you know

5601
03:39:03,559 --> 03:39:06,959
it's going to be a small business until

5602
03:39:05,398 --> 03:39:08,760
you show that you're successful and

5603
03:39:06,959 --> 03:39:11,079
you're not flooding the market with

5604
03:39:08,760 --> 03:39:13,719
cheap [ __ ] that's Tain it with

5605
03:39:11,079 --> 03:39:17,600
pesticides and F them mold that doesn't

5606
03:39:13,719 --> 03:39:19,719
test you know just like that's are full

5607
03:39:17,600 --> 03:39:22,520
of MOT toxins that have been remediated

5608
03:39:19,719 --> 03:39:25,799
I mean all of that is just part of Comm

5609
03:39:22,520 --> 03:39:29,279
the commercialization of it instead of

5610
03:39:25,799 --> 03:39:30,719
affecting some sort of production

5611
03:39:29,279 --> 03:39:33,238
control

5612
03:39:30,719 --> 03:39:35,879
right yeah it's all

5613
03:39:33,238 --> 03:39:37,680
about method that's easier than that I'm

5614
03:39:35,879 --> 03:39:40,639
not saying it's the best method but it's

5615
03:39:37,680 --> 03:39:42,040
very simple right but it's about to me

5616
03:39:40,639 --> 03:39:43,959
it's about what piece of Pi is the

5617
03:39:42,040 --> 03:39:45,800
regional model as we are in this

5618
03:39:43,959 --> 03:39:48,318
transitional period so every wants a

5619
03:39:45,799 --> 03:39:50,000
slice of the pie right so we're creating

5620
03:39:48,318 --> 03:39:51,879
all these different Regional models and

5621
03:39:50,000 --> 03:39:53,840
Regional regulations for everyone to

5622
03:39:51,879 --> 03:39:55,679
figure out who can participate on

5623
03:39:53,840 --> 03:39:58,318
investment how much canopy can this

5624
03:39:55,680 --> 03:40:02,199
Corporation own all that those are all

5625
03:39:58,318 --> 03:40:04,478
temporary adjustments based off of the

5626
03:40:02,199 --> 03:40:05,840
current state of affairs and and that to

5627
03:40:04,478 --> 03:40:07,599
me is the biggest challenge that's where

5628
03:40:05,840 --> 03:40:09,159
all the investors like I get more people

5629
03:40:07,600 --> 03:40:10,640
asking me about like so what what what

5630
03:40:09,159 --> 03:40:12,719
do you guys in the US going to do about

5631
03:40:10,639 --> 03:40:14,799
the farm bill like we're not ready to

5632
03:40:12,719 --> 03:40:17,799
invest here because you haven't figured

5633
03:40:14,799 --> 03:40:20,198
out Farm F Bill hemp in the US you know

5634
03:40:17,799 --> 03:40:22,238
what I mean it's like well like it's

5635
03:40:20,199 --> 03:40:24,439
nuts right so everyone knows it's headed

5636
03:40:22,238 --> 03:40:25,760
towards an international commodity

5637
03:40:24,439 --> 03:40:27,800
everybody knows that the guys that are

5638
03:40:25,760 --> 03:40:30,199
planting those acreage in in Canada

5639
03:40:27,799 --> 03:40:32,358
they're doing it for a future Emerging

5640
03:40:30,199 --> 03:40:34,399
Market that's going to need it and

5641
03:40:32,359 --> 03:40:36,680
hoping that it happens at the right time

5642
03:40:34,398 --> 03:40:39,318
that they can get it there and you know

5643
03:40:36,680 --> 03:40:40,840
but it's anyway so I think we're all we

5644
03:40:39,318 --> 03:40:42,879
all understand that it's just in a big

5645
03:40:40,840 --> 03:40:44,318
transition and and we're all just going

5646
03:40:42,879 --> 03:40:45,759
to have to roll with the punches because

5647
03:40:44,318 --> 03:40:48,840
I don't think anyone's going to come up

5648
03:40:45,760 --> 03:40:53,000
with a solution you know one time I

5649
03:40:48,840 --> 03:40:57,000
actually sat down and I figured out with

5650
03:40:53,000 --> 03:41:02,840
mathematics how much cannabis is smoked

5651
03:40:57,000 --> 03:41:05,799
in Canada and in uh America uh totally

5652
03:41:02,840 --> 03:41:08,639
and I figured out that whether you smoke

5653
03:41:05,799 --> 03:41:13,079
in marijuana whether you smoke in

5654
03:41:08,639 --> 03:41:18,840
hashish uh rosin whatever it can all be

5655
03:41:13,079 --> 03:41:21,639
grown on 50 square miles in California

5656
03:41:18,840 --> 03:41:23,639
right in the perfect climate with all

5657
03:41:21,639 --> 03:41:25,079
the infrastructure and all the culture

5658
03:41:23,639 --> 03:41:27,238
and all the labor and all the great

5659
03:41:25,079 --> 03:41:29,359
genetics and all the great minds just

5660
03:41:27,238 --> 03:41:31,119
like they do with 20 other crops where

5661
03:41:29,359 --> 03:41:33,238
we're like look man we got this we can

5662
03:41:31,120 --> 03:41:35,720
handle it don't worry about it it'll

5663
03:41:33,238 --> 03:41:37,639
actually be better for everybody and I

5664
03:41:35,719 --> 03:41:39,278
do believe that and I'm not a California

5665
03:41:37,639 --> 03:41:41,158
exceptionalist but I just believe that's

5666
03:41:39,279 --> 03:41:45,720
the way we set up this state as an a

5667
03:41:41,158 --> 03:41:49,238
state California Selena say is the salid

5668
03:41:45,719 --> 03:41:52,198
of America right and there's a reason

5669
03:41:49,238 --> 03:41:54,760
why because of prohibition though we've

5670
03:41:52,199 --> 03:41:58,120
proliferated this ideal of cannabis to

5671
03:41:54,760 --> 03:42:01,000
be indoor grown indoor looking even for

5672
03:41:58,120 --> 03:42:03,880
even for the like cheap weed now it's

5673
03:42:01,000 --> 03:42:05,719
people want [ __ ] that looks like indoor

5674
03:42:03,879 --> 03:42:09,438
especially for flower at least the hash

5675
03:42:05,719 --> 03:42:11,079
is a whole different story and so now

5676
03:42:09,439 --> 03:42:12,600
all these new markets around the world

5677
03:42:11,079 --> 03:42:14,439
that may have historically just been

5678
03:42:12,600 --> 03:42:16,238
where California could just grow it all

5679
03:42:14,439 --> 03:42:18,398
and we just ort it all and everybody

5680
03:42:16,238 --> 03:42:20,760
thinks weeds like cigarettes we've got

5681
03:42:18,398 --> 03:42:24,198
40 years of this culture of

5682
03:42:20,760 --> 03:42:26,960
wanting the like indoor cannabis because

5683
03:42:24,199 --> 03:42:28,640
of prohibition so now all these states

5684
03:42:26,959 --> 03:42:30,719
and we're already seeing it in America I

5685
03:42:28,639 --> 03:42:32,959
mean the evidence is there everyone

5686
03:42:30,719 --> 03:42:35,438
wants to grow their own [ __ ] and sell it

5687
03:42:32,959 --> 03:42:37,198
to the rest of the world well that's

5688
03:42:35,439 --> 03:42:38,720
like being a grower in California who

5689
03:42:37,199 --> 03:42:41,439
are you gonna sell your weed to another

5690
03:42:38,719 --> 03:42:44,158
grower like what are you talking

5691
03:42:41,439 --> 03:42:45,880
about yeah but also at the same time

5692
03:42:44,158 --> 03:42:47,719
such I have to say

5693
03:42:45,879 --> 03:42:49,358
30 years ago outdoor weed looked very

5694
03:42:47,719 --> 03:42:52,478
different than it does today and with

5695
03:42:49,359 --> 03:42:54,720
the right selection and breeding we can

5696
03:42:52,478 --> 03:42:57,079
I think we can create we can select

5697
03:42:54,719 --> 03:43:00,198
cultivars that grow and Seed crops that

5698
03:42:57,079 --> 03:43:02,199
grow so well in the ideal climate that

5699
03:43:00,199 --> 03:43:04,040
it'll be close enough that that hole I

5700
03:43:02,199 --> 03:43:05,880
need it to be indoor and I need it to be

5701
03:43:04,040 --> 03:43:08,239
depth It'll be such a quick shift where

5702
03:43:05,879 --> 03:43:10,839
people go wow $50 an

5703
03:43:08,238 --> 03:43:13,398
ounce that it'll it'll win because of

5704
03:43:10,840 --> 03:43:16,639
price exactly but but here's a thing

5705
03:43:13,398 --> 03:43:19,680
where the um government should be smart

5706
03:43:16,639 --> 03:43:22,238
enough to not incentivize that because

5707
03:43:19,680 --> 03:43:25,000
people only smoke so much cannabis if

5708
03:43:22,238 --> 03:43:26,799
you take it from $300 an ounce to 50

5709
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:28,840
bucks an ounce what everybody pays all

5710
03:43:26,799 --> 03:43:31,398
you did is turn A2 billion Doll Market

5711
03:43:28,840 --> 03:43:34,238
into a $400 million market and you got

5712
03:43:31,398 --> 03:43:35,840
more people you everybody shot for A2

5713
03:43:34,238 --> 03:43:38,680
billion Doll Market and now everybody's

5714
03:43:35,840 --> 03:43:40,520
trying to share 4 $400 million Market

5715
03:43:38,680 --> 03:43:42,960
it's happened in every single legal

5716
03:43:40,520 --> 03:43:45,760
state that this has occurred in what

5717
03:43:42,959 --> 03:43:48,318
used to be a $2 billion markets now

5718
03:43:45,760 --> 03:43:50,040
worth 500 million bucks who does that

5719
03:43:48,318 --> 03:43:52,318
help especially the state who's trying

5720
03:43:50,040 --> 03:43:54,279
to tax it right it's like that they're

5721
03:43:52,318 --> 03:43:56,519
shooting themselves in the foot by doing

5722
03:43:54,279 --> 03:43:59,479
so and so are all the Growers that push

5723
03:43:56,520 --> 03:44:01,600
that that mentality of the cultivation

5724
03:43:59,478 --> 03:44:04,398
because prohibition created this

5725
03:44:01,600 --> 03:44:06,120
ballooned market right and people are

5726
03:44:04,398 --> 03:44:07,680
happy with it as long as they're paying

5727
03:44:06,120 --> 03:44:10,239
whatever they feel like they're getting

5728
03:44:07,680 --> 03:44:13,880
their money's worth whatever that means

5729
03:44:10,238 --> 03:44:16,920
and once you fully industrialize the

5730
03:44:13,879 --> 03:44:19,639
production and bottom the the value of

5731
03:44:16,920 --> 03:44:22,639
the product the incentive for anyone to

5732
03:44:19,639 --> 03:44:24,799
do any of that all of it's gone and

5733
03:44:22,639 --> 03:44:26,559
everybody's sharing thinner and thinner

5734
03:44:24,799 --> 03:44:28,599
and thinner pieces of pie every year

5735
03:44:26,559 --> 03:44:32,318
someone grows an extra acre but that's

5736
03:44:28,600 --> 03:44:36,158
also will always be new people creating

5737
03:44:32,318 --> 03:44:38,920
new varieties For the Love of it because

5738
03:44:36,158 --> 03:44:41,760
not everybody's chasing money I never

5739
03:44:38,920 --> 03:44:44,079
did well California is a whole different

5740
03:44:41,760 --> 03:44:45,600
world nowadays but what and and that's

5741
03:44:44,079 --> 03:44:48,279
the thing California is going through it

5742
03:44:45,600 --> 03:44:49,880
own collapse like Oregon went through

5743
03:44:48,279 --> 03:44:52,238
you know that Oregon's kind of been

5744
03:44:49,879 --> 03:44:54,719
coming out of right it happens in every

5745
03:44:52,238 --> 03:44:56,760
state you know and and you know even the

5746
03:44:54,719 --> 03:44:58,719
biggest people I mean there's been like

5747
03:44:56,760 --> 03:45:01,158
some of these monoliths that lost 600

5748
03:44:58,719 --> 03:45:03,278
mil and like have left the state right

5749
03:45:01,158 --> 03:45:05,359
of California Oregon and Colorado the

5750
03:45:03,279 --> 03:45:08,199
three most competitive mature markets in

5751
03:45:05,359 --> 03:45:10,359
the nation you know all of them are are

5752
03:45:08,199 --> 03:45:12,439
disappearing from competitive

5753
03:45:10,359 --> 03:45:15,238
market yeah well that's the thing it's

5754
03:45:12,439 --> 03:45:17,479
like comp they're not competitive from I

5755
03:45:15,238 --> 03:45:18,559
read you know like when the prohibition

5756
03:45:17,478 --> 03:45:20,478
of because when the prohibition of

5757
03:45:18,559 --> 03:45:22,158
alcohol ended there was this 80-year

5758
03:45:20,478 --> 03:45:25,000
consolidation among a few families

5759
03:45:22,158 --> 03:45:27,760
before craft was even established in the

5760
03:45:25,000 --> 03:45:28,840
80s right and and the the big prayer

5761
03:45:27,760 --> 03:45:30,680
right is that doesn't happen with

5762
03:45:28,840 --> 03:45:33,318
cannabis because the prob cannabis

5763
03:45:30,680 --> 03:45:35,279
ending you got Budweiser and craft

5764
03:45:33,318 --> 03:45:39,079
running in the same sprint the same

5765
03:45:35,279 --> 03:45:41,158
field in a market where it's I feel like

5766
03:45:39,079 --> 03:45:44,199
the hyperfocus on THC is the only way to

5767
03:45:41,158 --> 03:45:46,840
distinguish quality is such a mark of

5768
03:45:44,199 --> 03:45:48,359
the ad Ence and the immaturity of a

5769
03:45:46,840 --> 03:45:50,478
market because we don't even know and

5770
03:45:48,359 --> 03:45:52,760
have the tools to establish what is

5771
03:45:50,478 --> 03:45:55,398
quality right but what happens

5772
03:45:52,760 --> 03:45:57,000
inevitably those that build resilience

5773
03:45:55,398 --> 03:45:59,079
and double down a tur preservation

5774
03:45:57,000 --> 03:46:00,639
infrastructure to have because when when

5775
03:45:59,079 --> 03:46:02,559
herb doesn't when the flood and over

5776
03:46:00,639 --> 03:46:04,398
production sets in herb isn't moving as

5777
03:46:02,559 --> 03:46:05,879
quick as it used to and so it sits

5778
03:46:04,398 --> 03:46:07,519
around and it's really exposed to

5779
03:46:05,879 --> 03:46:09,238
whatever infrastructure you have or

5780
03:46:07,520 --> 03:46:10,960
don't have to care for the herb and

5781
03:46:09,238 --> 03:46:13,000
turps in your possession and if you

5782
03:46:10,959 --> 03:46:14,919
don't have that and it goes bad you're

5783
03:46:13,000 --> 03:46:17,279
just racing to the bottom with the

5784
03:46:14,920 --> 03:46:19,719
commoditized Market as opposed to like

5785
03:46:17,279 --> 03:46:22,640
you know the long game of preservation

5786
03:46:19,719 --> 03:46:26,039
and how much that's

5787
03:46:22,639 --> 03:46:28,439
cnia what we haven't we haven't figured

5788
03:46:26,040 --> 03:46:30,920
out how to I mean we know how to

5789
03:46:28,439 --> 03:46:33,559
stabilize cannabis we know how to make

5790
03:46:30,920 --> 03:46:36,680
it if we actually injected it with you

5791
03:46:33,559 --> 03:46:39,238
know nitrogen and Argon gas to actually

5792
03:46:36,680 --> 03:46:42,359
stabilize it because of these large

5793
03:46:39,238 --> 03:46:45,279
Productions but the DCC has its head so

5794
03:46:42,359 --> 03:46:48,120
far up its ass it can't even realize

5795
03:46:45,279 --> 03:46:50,399
that you have to stabilize these quality

5796
03:46:48,120 --> 03:46:52,040
genetics because there's so much

5797
03:46:50,398 --> 03:46:54,198
production that's sitting on the shelf

5798
03:46:52,040 --> 03:46:56,199
for so long they can't even get past

5799
03:46:54,199 --> 03:46:57,880
that so I mean they don't even

5800
03:46:56,199 --> 03:47:01,120
understand quality much less how to

5801
03:46:57,879 --> 03:47:02,799
sustain quality so California is [ __ ]

5802
03:47:01,120 --> 03:47:04,960
and I'm just saying this so other states

5803
03:47:02,799 --> 03:47:07,198
could learn from [ __ ] up so that you can

5804
03:47:04,959 --> 03:47:09,599
learn how to do it right because we're

5805
03:47:07,199 --> 03:47:13,199
not big

5806
03:47:09,600 --> 03:47:15,520
time over prodction issue one I think

5807
03:47:13,199 --> 03:47:17,720
that's what also uh with Illustrated in

5808
03:47:15,520 --> 03:47:20,960
this LA Times expose you know the state

5809
03:47:17,719 --> 03:47:22,879
has to be overly restrictive and testing

5810
03:47:20,959 --> 03:47:24,198
and auditing of the Laboratories that

5811
03:47:22,879 --> 03:47:27,438
are the final check in the Integrity of

5812
03:47:24,199 --> 03:47:30,640
the supply chain if there is a robust

5813
03:47:27,439 --> 03:47:33,318
State program to ensure the quality of

5814
03:47:30,639 --> 03:47:36,358
what the standards are put in place that

5815
03:47:33,318 --> 03:47:37,680
combined with people doubling down tur

5816
03:47:36,359 --> 03:47:39,439
preservation infrastructure I mean

5817
03:47:37,680 --> 03:47:42,000
that's there's there's you know over

5818
03:47:39,439 --> 03:47:45,279
production is an inevitable but the

5819
03:47:42,000 --> 03:47:47,840
thing is is clean quality bomb input are

5820
03:47:45,279 --> 03:47:50,000
a resource they're a scarce resource and

5821
03:47:47,840 --> 03:47:53,279
unless you know the folks that have them

5822
03:47:50,000 --> 03:47:55,199
you know you don't inced to do that when

5823
03:47:53,279 --> 03:47:57,319
over production is happening though

5824
03:47:55,199 --> 03:48:01,439
that's the problem no one's incentivized

5825
03:47:57,318 --> 03:48:01,439
you have to get rid yeah

5826
03:48:02,158 --> 03:48:06,760
totally down the top but that's where

5827
03:48:04,799 --> 03:48:08,679
vertical like you're doing in Oregon is

5828
03:48:06,760 --> 03:48:10,800
is you know building resilience and I

5829
03:48:08,680 --> 03:48:13,680
know brands in California that are

5830
03:48:10,799 --> 03:48:16,879
focused specifically on cultivation that

5831
03:48:13,680 --> 03:48:19,479
have done very thing and have in the

5832
03:48:16,879 --> 03:48:21,238
most flooded space built their brand to

5833
03:48:19,478 --> 03:48:23,478
sell out Quicken this trimmed cash on

5834
03:48:21,238 --> 03:48:24,840
delivery as a result of you know they're

5835
03:48:23,478 --> 03:48:27,478
not having cash flow issues like with

5836
03:48:24,840 --> 03:48:29,158
the dispensar not paying can we agree

5837
03:48:27,478 --> 03:48:30,799
they're few and far between oh few and

5838
03:48:29,158 --> 03:48:32,119
far between for sure for sure and and

5839
03:48:30,799 --> 03:48:34,198
that's you know 100% And that's the

5840
03:48:32,120 --> 03:48:37,479
thing it's like we're because we're in

5841
03:48:34,199 --> 03:48:39,560
live a motion action you know working

5842
03:48:37,478 --> 03:48:40,840
through quality like it's like the the

5843
03:48:39,559 --> 03:48:42,478
the dirtiest and the cleanest in the

5844
03:48:40,840 --> 03:48:44,880
state competing at the same price point

5845
03:48:42,478 --> 03:48:46,559
the cleanest or the the most chronic and

5846
03:48:44,879 --> 03:48:48,559
most biomass in the state competely the

5847
03:48:46,559 --> 03:48:50,639
same price point you know so it's like

5848
03:48:48,559 --> 03:48:53,119
that we're we're I think as a culture

5849
03:48:50,639 --> 03:48:54,879
like working a power through that and be

5850
03:48:53,120 --> 03:48:57,279
build resilience in time where there

5851
03:48:54,879 --> 03:49:00,318
it's not looking good but the thing is

5852
03:48:57,279 --> 03:49:03,000
is there is hope and those that really

5853
03:49:00,318 --> 03:49:04,478
figure that side of it out build the

5854
03:49:03,000 --> 03:49:06,840
resilience needed to make it through the

5855
03:49:04,478 --> 03:49:09,358
deepest floods you know and build that

5856
03:49:06,840 --> 03:49:10,880
grassroot consumer loyalty around not

5857
03:49:09,359 --> 03:49:12,399
only the quality of their product

5858
03:49:10,879 --> 03:49:14,759
because there's such a huge shock in

5859
03:49:12,398 --> 03:49:16,959
consumer trust and confidence right now

5860
03:49:14,760 --> 03:49:18,760
because of this like Expose and LA Times

5861
03:49:16,959 --> 03:49:21,198
so it's like you you know you can't just

5862
03:49:18,760 --> 03:49:23,040
like trust you know like you got to

5863
03:49:21,199 --> 03:49:25,158
trust but verify and if you can find a

5864
03:49:23,040 --> 03:49:27,520
brand and like you know that are not

5865
03:49:25,158 --> 03:49:29,439
only full built with integrity and kind

5866
03:49:27,520 --> 03:49:30,680
of doubling down on the turps and like

5867
03:49:29,439 --> 03:49:32,520
it's the only thing you can find in a

5868
03:49:30,680 --> 03:49:34,920
five mile radius that's got any flavor

5869
03:49:32,520 --> 03:49:36,800
Aroma there's a point where that matters

5870
03:49:34,920 --> 03:49:38,359
in the collapse of every market and it's

5871
03:49:36,799 --> 03:49:40,398
just about making it through breaking

5872
03:49:38,359 --> 03:49:41,479
even like you know just getting to that

5873
03:49:40,398 --> 03:49:43,519
point because if you're doing that

5874
03:49:41,478 --> 03:49:45,519
you're crushing it you know because once

5875
03:49:43,520 --> 03:49:46,880
this opens up you know there's no one in

5876
03:49:45,520 --> 03:49:49,800
the world that will be able to compete

5877
03:49:46,879 --> 03:49:51,358
with Oregon kind of California type you

5878
03:49:49,799 --> 03:49:53,959
know I mean you

5879
03:49:51,359 --> 03:49:57,559
know if the state prevented the over

5880
03:49:53,959 --> 03:50:01,079
production of all that like the like

5881
03:49:57,559 --> 03:50:02,920
there's a ton of grows that wouldn't

5882
03:50:01,079 --> 03:50:05,079
survive without

5883
03:50:02,920 --> 03:50:09,199
backdooring the majority of their

5884
03:50:05,079 --> 03:50:13,039
product and for sure if the state just

5885
03:50:09,199 --> 03:50:16,399
regulated that well not even perfectly

5886
03:50:13,040 --> 03:50:20,439
but just even at all right yeah that

5887
03:50:16,398 --> 03:50:22,278
would basically get rid of all the fluff

5888
03:50:20,439 --> 03:50:24,238
well that's those people that we're

5889
03:50:22,279 --> 03:50:27,000
talking about right that that these

5890
03:50:24,238 --> 03:50:29,359
grows that we want to see do well that

5891
03:50:27,000 --> 03:50:31,318
can't afford to grow and put hand

5892
03:50:29,359 --> 03:50:35,960
manicure in time and everything into

5893
03:50:31,318 --> 03:50:39,119
$1,500 pounds um where the market will

5894
03:50:35,959 --> 03:50:42,039
actually uh reward them for that and the

5895
03:50:39,120 --> 03:50:44,880
retailers won't be able to bully them

5896
03:50:42,040 --> 03:50:46,840
because of the over production

5897
03:50:44,879 --> 03:50:48,879
availability of something quote unquote

5898
03:50:46,840 --> 03:50:50,799
comparable that then the customer now

5899
03:50:48,879 --> 03:50:52,478
pays the price for because they're

5900
03:50:50,799 --> 03:50:55,398
buying three-month old weave for half

5901
03:50:52,478 --> 03:50:58,519
the price because it's there and like

5902
03:50:55,398 --> 03:51:01,119
you know or give me one second like in

5903
03:50:58,520 --> 03:51:03,199
Colorado when they started their legal

5904
03:51:01,120 --> 03:51:05,640
it was the 7030 rule where you had to

5905
03:51:03,199 --> 03:51:08,319
grow 70% of the [ __ ] that you sold and

5906
03:51:05,639 --> 03:51:12,158
you had to have your own store created a

5907
03:51:08,318 --> 03:51:14,000
great market right and so I'm just

5908
03:51:12,158 --> 03:51:16,639
showing how it does we even have

5909
03:51:14,000 --> 03:51:19,120
evidence to no whereare does work even

5910
03:51:16,639 --> 03:51:21,799
that that's that's cool you that's

5911
03:51:19,120 --> 03:51:24,640
that's a great data point because what

5912
03:51:21,799 --> 03:51:27,438
I'm thinking of is what Alex said about

5913
03:51:24,639 --> 03:51:29,559
cood and terms and how that doesn't work

5914
03:51:27,439 --> 03:51:32,079
and how that catches up with everyone

5915
03:51:29,559 --> 03:51:33,840
and that's really there's a million

5916
03:51:32,079 --> 03:51:35,879
reasons and analogies you could bring up

5917
03:51:33,840 --> 03:51:37,559
in terms of food why you would pay for

5918
03:51:35,879 --> 03:51:38,959
your meal first and you're not going to

5919
03:51:37,559 --> 03:51:40,680
leave the restaurant without paying your

5920
03:51:38,959 --> 03:51:42,438
bill right so why would you leave a

5921
03:51:40,680 --> 03:51:44,680
dispo and why would the dispo not pay

5922
03:51:42,439 --> 03:51:47,079
you on delivery right and then

5923
03:51:44,680 --> 03:51:49,079
furthermore it's you know the dros are

5924
03:51:47,079 --> 03:51:51,158
forcing people into buying scenarios and

5925
03:51:49,079 --> 03:51:54,199
buying schemes that are very familiar to

5926
03:51:51,158 --> 03:51:55,840
the beverage markets where you want one

5927
03:51:54,199 --> 03:51:57,479
brand well you got to buy a thousand

5928
03:51:55,840 --> 03:52:00,279
other of this other brand and that's not

5929
03:51:57,478 --> 03:52:01,639
moving to liquidate this inventory for

5930
03:52:00,279 --> 03:52:04,319
me to give you actually what you're here

5931
03:52:01,639 --> 03:52:06,318
for and I think those types of tactics

5932
03:52:04,318 --> 03:52:09,278
Force retailers to buy things they don't

5933
03:52:06,318 --> 03:52:10,600
want them to then in turn kind of slow

5934
03:52:09,279 --> 03:52:12,920
roll things that they've bought that

5935
03:52:10,600 --> 03:52:14,600
they do want and then it overshadows it

5936
03:52:12,920 --> 03:52:16,760
and it's this weird deconomy of like

5937
03:52:14,600 --> 03:52:18,880
well take a thousand of these for 200 of

5938
03:52:16,760 --> 03:52:21,199
these and you're just in this weird

5939
03:52:18,879 --> 03:52:23,599
dichotomy of of forcing yourself with

5940
03:52:21,199 --> 03:52:26,640
the dro to buy certain things so I think

5941
03:52:23,600 --> 03:52:29,000
that's a deeper curtain that I'm pulling

5942
03:52:26,639 --> 03:52:31,439
on all of it but it is a problem that

5943
03:52:29,000 --> 03:52:33,158
I've seen overall you look at the cut

5944
03:52:31,439 --> 03:52:36,439
flow

5945
03:52:33,158 --> 03:52:39,478
industry Holland used to dominate it

5946
03:52:36,439 --> 03:52:41,760
America used to dominate it it's not

5947
03:52:39,478 --> 03:52:44,879
that way anymore it's all done in

5948
03:52:41,760 --> 03:52:48,279
Colombia Ecuador you know a on the

5949
03:52:44,879 --> 03:52:51,639
tropics because it's so much cheaper the

5950
03:52:48,279 --> 03:52:55,720
labor and you you can grow the same

5951
03:52:51,639 --> 03:52:59,119
quality and uh I honestly think that's

5952
03:52:55,719 --> 03:53:02,438
the way cannabis will be uh it'll be

5953
03:52:59,120 --> 03:53:07,560
produced where it's cheaper to produce

5954
03:53:02,439 --> 03:53:07,559
and this as high quality as the

5955
03:53:07,799 --> 03:53:12,238
craft yeah well I'd say cannabis is very

5956
03:53:10,439 --> 03:53:14,040
different than Wine but it's for

5957
03:53:12,238 --> 03:53:16,279
California it's a similar Dynamic and

5958
03:53:14,040 --> 03:53:19,760
that like the 50s and 60s it was a jug

5959
03:53:16,279 --> 03:53:21,920
wine crappy wine cheap wine you know get

5960
03:53:19,760 --> 03:53:23,800
drunk and there wasn't a lot of real

5961
03:53:21,920 --> 03:53:26,680
high-end California didn't have a name

5962
03:53:23,799 --> 03:53:28,519
for itself globally and while California

5963
03:53:26,680 --> 03:53:31,439
built a name for itself globally and

5964
03:53:28,520 --> 03:53:34,238
France and Italy and Spain took a hit

5965
03:53:31,439 --> 03:53:36,359
also Argentina took off and Australia

5966
03:53:34,238 --> 03:53:39,198
took off and South Africa took off and

5967
03:53:36,359 --> 03:53:41,520
Chile took off and now California

5968
03:53:39,199 --> 03:53:43,760
competes with the Global Wine Market but

5969
03:53:41,520 --> 03:53:46,680
we still crush it and California wine

5970
03:53:43,760 --> 03:53:49,279
still has a brand worldwide you know and

5971
03:53:46,680 --> 03:53:51,600
that's because it was done collectively

5972
03:53:49,279 --> 03:53:54,840
with Farmers with regulation with

5973
03:53:51,600 --> 03:53:57,720
Appalachians with UC Davis with the

5974
03:53:54,840 --> 03:54:00,040
state and they decided collectively we

5975
03:53:57,719 --> 03:54:02,599
want to make California wine a thing we

5976
03:54:00,040 --> 03:54:05,000
want it to be a player in the Global

5977
03:54:02,600 --> 03:54:06,880
Wine world and we still are but it took

5978
03:54:05,000 --> 03:54:09,719
a real concerted effort to do it and a

5979
03:54:06,879 --> 03:54:13,318
lot of luck you know also Geographic

5980
03:54:09,719 --> 03:54:15,840
dominance and a lack of an indoor Supply

5981
03:54:13,318 --> 03:54:17,439
like we know you know you can do with

5982
03:54:15,840 --> 03:54:19,559
green houses and everything else it's

5983
03:54:17,439 --> 03:54:21,279
why you know Canada can supply their

5984
03:54:19,559 --> 03:54:23,478
themselves they don't need California

5985
03:54:21,279 --> 03:54:25,840
weed you could never you could also

5986
03:54:23,478 --> 03:54:27,840
never pass a test if you grew a urb in

5987
03:54:25,840 --> 03:54:30,840
Napa Valley you know it's like a

5988
03:54:27,840 --> 03:54:33,318
absolute poisoned tainted region of the

5989
03:54:30,840 --> 03:54:34,920
state right but my point is how much

5990
03:54:33,318 --> 03:54:37,398
what what could the the impact of

5991
03:54:34,920 --> 03:54:40,238
California would have son's Prohibition

5992
03:54:37,398 --> 03:54:41,840
in cannabis in terms of a global market

5993
03:54:40,238 --> 03:54:43,920
you know and what what impact it will

5994
03:54:41,840 --> 03:54:45,680
have in the future you know so Canada

5995
03:54:43,920 --> 03:54:47,719
might not have happened the way it did

5996
03:54:45,680 --> 03:54:49,318
if they could buy California wine just

5997
03:54:47,719 --> 03:54:50,879
like they don't you know so they had to

5998
03:54:49,318 --> 03:54:52,840
they were forced to grow indoors just

5999
03:54:50,879 --> 03:54:54,719
like we're all forced to grow indoors I

6000
03:54:52,840 --> 03:54:57,158
think that like Canada going the way

6001
03:54:54,719 --> 03:54:59,398
that it has kind of proves that there's

6002
03:54:57,158 --> 03:55:01,920
not even enough International demand

6003
03:54:59,398 --> 03:55:04,318
really right because I mean like to to

6004
03:55:01,920 --> 03:55:06,960
sustain even that level of what they

6005
03:55:04,318 --> 03:55:09,680
were doing you know it's like California

6006
03:55:06,959 --> 03:55:11,278
can come online too and grow bazillion

6007
03:55:09,680 --> 03:55:13,079
pounds but it's going to have the same

6008
03:55:11,279 --> 03:55:14,760
effect it's just going to bottom the

6009
03:55:13,079 --> 03:55:16,359
price and then people go out of business

6010
03:55:14,760 --> 03:55:18,760
and shut down all the big farms and then

6011
03:55:16,359 --> 03:55:20,479
you end up with small high-end stuff

6012
03:55:18,760 --> 03:55:22,478
that's servicing the local consumers you

6013
03:55:20,478 --> 03:55:25,238
got a few big guys that are crushing it

6014
03:55:22,478 --> 03:55:27,238
on some weird export thing that they

6015
03:55:25,238 --> 03:55:28,959
figured out that's that's super

6016
03:55:27,238 --> 03:55:31,398
lucrative they they'll be out there

6017
03:55:28,959 --> 03:55:34,398
don't get me wrong but they're going to

6018
03:55:31,398 --> 03:55:36,519
be few and that's why all the the uh

6019
03:55:34,398 --> 03:55:39,719
canac Corps have all left California I

6020
03:55:36,520 --> 03:55:43,680
mean to me the craziest thing is this

6021
03:55:39,719 --> 03:55:46,238
like if I if I um am like in the movie

6022
03:55:43,680 --> 03:55:48,238
industry I moved to Hollywood to go sell

6023
03:55:46,238 --> 03:55:50,840
my movies

6024
03:55:48,238 --> 03:55:53,639
right if I'm in the wheed industry like

6025
03:55:50,840 --> 03:55:56,079
these Canada corporations and I can't go

6026
03:55:53,639 --> 03:55:59,920
to California and make money selling

6027
03:55:56,079 --> 03:56:03,639
weed how bad are you at what you do I

6028
03:55:59,920 --> 03:56:05,760
mean you gotta be horrible I mean like

6029
03:56:03,639 --> 03:56:08,278
California is like fifth biggest fifth

6030
03:56:05,760 --> 03:56:11,040
biggest economy in the world they spend

6031
03:56:08,279 --> 03:56:13,000
we money on weed like nobody's business

6032
03:56:11,040 --> 03:56:16,080
there the velocity of money in

6033
03:56:13,000 --> 03:56:18,920
California Dwarfs anywhere else and

6034
03:56:16,079 --> 03:56:22,120
you're telling me you can't make money

6035
03:56:18,920 --> 03:56:25,600
selling weed there I mean you're you

6036
03:56:22,120 --> 03:56:27,159
must suck at weed because that's that'd

6037
03:56:25,600 --> 03:56:28,880
be like me saying I went to Hollywood to

6038
03:56:27,158 --> 03:56:31,520
sell movies and I couldn't sell a movie

6039
03:56:28,879 --> 03:56:33,000
there it's like well I'm probably not

6040
03:56:31,520 --> 03:56:35,279
very good

6041
03:56:33,000 --> 03:56:37,000
then a lot of those people though that

6042
03:56:35,279 --> 03:56:38,960
what they do their reason why they're

6043
03:56:37,000 --> 03:56:41,398
successful is because they've found a

6044
03:56:38,959 --> 03:56:43,000
way to through the high cost barrier of

6045
03:56:41,398 --> 03:56:45,238
entry into a lot of markets that are

6046
03:56:43,000 --> 03:56:47,318
limited license essentially build their

6047
03:56:45,238 --> 03:56:49,238
own little Monopoly even though their

6048
03:56:47,318 --> 03:56:51,879
product couldn't even make the cut in

6049
03:56:49,238 --> 03:56:53,799
Oregon or California or Colorado let go

6050
03:56:51,879 --> 03:56:55,198
man that just means their days are

6051
03:56:53,799 --> 03:56:58,158
numbered though

6052
03:56:55,199 --> 03:57:00,120
right yeah until there's limit until

6053
03:56:58,158 --> 03:57:01,600
there's no more limited licensing States

6054
03:57:00,120 --> 03:57:03,479
they really because I see it all the

6055
03:57:01,600 --> 03:57:05,359
time man look at I get text messages

6056
03:57:03,478 --> 03:57:08,000
from like Kentucky oh this is gonna

6057
03:57:05,359 --> 03:57:11,559
fireing off right now it's it's nuts man

6058
03:57:08,000 --> 03:57:13,760
people are people are hungry for things

6059
03:57:11,559 --> 03:57:16,119
that they don't really understand and I

6060
03:57:13,760 --> 03:57:18,719
think that that is a problem in our

6061
03:57:16,120 --> 03:57:20,319
industry where other industry comes in

6062
03:57:18,719 --> 03:57:21,599
and they've got better ideas and they're

6063
03:57:20,318 --> 03:57:24,359
going to go do this because they can get

6064
03:57:21,600 --> 03:57:25,479
the investment into it but then what

6065
03:57:24,359 --> 03:57:26,800
happens when you spend all the

6066
03:57:25,478 --> 03:57:29,198
investment and there's nothing left and

6067
03:57:26,799 --> 03:57:31,119
there's no return they go to another

6068
03:57:29,199 --> 03:57:34,040
place to do it again right until

6069
03:57:31,120 --> 03:57:37,000
something either clicks or they just run

6070
03:57:34,040 --> 03:57:39,199
out of money but it just seems to me

6071
03:57:37,000 --> 03:57:40,639
that that's never going to stop just

6072
03:57:39,199 --> 03:57:43,760
like the hemp markets are never going to

6073
03:57:40,639 --> 03:57:46,039
stop unless there's real reform um you

6074
03:57:43,760 --> 03:57:47,478
know but we as you said Fletcher like

6075
03:57:46,040 --> 03:57:49,920
there's a real opportunity sitting in

6076
03:57:47,478 --> 03:57:51,840
front of everyone and I I get most both

6077
03:57:49,920 --> 03:57:53,359
sides of it I always say we all need to

6078
03:57:51,840 --> 03:57:55,520
go back to the basics and just grow

6079
03:57:53,359 --> 03:57:58,040
really good herb again and stop worrying

6080
03:57:55,520 --> 03:57:59,680
about the rest and the flip side of that

6081
03:57:58,040 --> 03:58:01,800
is that someone will say well I want it

6082
03:57:59,680 --> 03:58:03,318
cheaper right well what happens when we

6083
03:58:01,799 --> 03:58:06,039
stop saying that it's

6084
03:58:03,318 --> 03:58:08,278
cheaper I've got when we say it just

6085
03:58:06,040 --> 03:58:10,120
costs this much you know I've got I've

6086
03:58:08,279 --> 03:58:12,439
got a funny metaphor I've thought of

6087
03:58:10,120 --> 03:58:14,760
before and you know how we were talking

6088
03:58:12,439 --> 03:58:18,760
about subsidies earlier

6089
03:58:14,760 --> 03:58:20,238
um prohibition was a multi-billion

6090
03:58:18,760 --> 03:58:21,880
multi-trillion

6091
03:58:20,238 --> 03:58:26,279
overtime

6092
03:58:21,879 --> 03:58:31,438
dollar subsidy for cannabis

6093
03:58:26,279 --> 03:58:34,479
Growers they created a lack of

6094
03:58:31,439 --> 03:58:36,840
Supply which proliferated the the

6095
03:58:34,478 --> 03:58:39,039
culture the industry everything that we

6096
03:58:36,840 --> 03:58:42,639
all love

6097
03:58:39,040 --> 03:58:44,640
right why would we want anything other

6098
03:58:42,639 --> 03:58:47,680
than essentially the same

6099
03:58:44,639 --> 03:58:50,959
thing after

6100
03:58:47,680 --> 03:58:54,079
prohibition where we're cont basically

6101
03:58:50,959 --> 03:58:58,358
in one form or another

6102
03:58:54,079 --> 03:58:59,879
enforcing um keeping things small that's

6103
03:58:58,359 --> 03:59:03,720
what I mean look at the Hydroponics

6104
03:58:59,879 --> 03:59:05,920
industry it's basically done right it's

6105
03:59:03,719 --> 03:59:07,198
just you can't even find hydro shops on

6106
03:59:05,920 --> 03:59:09,719
the west coast

6107
03:59:07,199 --> 03:59:12,079
anymore you got to drive 50 miles in

6108
03:59:09,719 --> 03:59:15,079
between stores it's

6109
03:59:12,079 --> 03:59:17,719
insane so

6110
03:59:15,079 --> 03:59:19,039
um you know how's that good for the

6111
03:59:17,719 --> 03:59:21,679
economy and how does that how does that

6112
03:59:19,040 --> 03:59:23,800
even help the state after prohibition

6113
03:59:21,680 --> 03:59:26,479
like they want all they they looked at

6114
03:59:23,799 --> 03:59:28,278
weed and go look how much it's worth

6115
03:59:26,478 --> 03:59:31,879
they selling pound you remember the old

6116
03:59:28,279 --> 03:59:33,479
uh news articles of pounds worth $8,000

6117
03:59:31,879 --> 03:59:36,119
right and they tell you it's worth 50

6118
03:59:33,478 --> 03:59:38,438
pounds is four million bucks you know

6119
03:59:36,120 --> 03:59:40,720
it's like that's they were looking at it

6120
03:59:38,439 --> 03:59:43,040
like we're going to get our 25% and here

6121
03:59:40,719 --> 03:59:44,719
they are you just allow over production

6122
03:59:43,040 --> 03:59:48,520
and

6123
03:59:44,719 --> 03:59:52,238
well warehouses warehouses full of Super

6124
03:59:48,520 --> 03:59:57,279
Sacks full of hemp from last year right

6125
03:59:52,238 --> 03:59:59,760
just Chuck full of 400 to 500 pounds per

6126
03:59:57,279 --> 04:00:02,319
super sack right and know that [ __ ] was

6127
03:59:59,760 --> 04:00:04,920
all grown last year and it ain't moving

6128
04:00:02,318 --> 04:00:06,680
because the CBD Market's been stagnated

6129
04:00:04,920 --> 04:00:10,600
so what are people doing they're

6130
04:00:06,680 --> 04:00:12,880
spraying that [ __ ] with thca or THC

6131
04:00:10,600 --> 04:00:15,199
rather putting it into pre-rolls and

6132
04:00:12,879 --> 04:00:17,799
selling it at gas stations and bodegas

6133
04:00:15,199 --> 04:00:19,199
in New York City you know New York City

6134
04:00:17,799 --> 04:00:21,039
is just such an interesting thing we

6135
04:00:19,199 --> 04:00:23,158
don't need to have time to go into it

6136
04:00:21,040 --> 04:00:25,040
right Colin will tell you this that

6137
04:00:23,158 --> 04:00:27,238
every time they make some big

6138
04:00:25,040 --> 04:00:29,760
announcement about trying to shut down

6139
04:00:27,238 --> 04:00:33,079
the Trap Market in New York because the

6140
04:00:29,760 --> 04:00:35,920
Trap Market is just it's just there's

6141
04:00:33,079 --> 04:00:38,840
there's like 10 shops on every block in

6142
04:00:35,920 --> 04:00:42,158
Manhattan right and you could buy you

6143
04:00:38,840 --> 04:00:45,439
know a nice you know sandwich and get

6144
04:00:42,158 --> 04:00:48,600
get a u get a drink and then buy some

6145
04:00:45,439 --> 04:00:51,960
weat at the same store you know so it's

6146
04:00:48,600 --> 04:00:54,238
[ __ ] crazy man some of the

6147
04:00:51,959 --> 04:00:57,959
stuff another

6148
04:00:54,238 --> 04:01:00,559
state Alex said it earlier too you know

6149
04:00:57,959 --> 04:01:02,318
what's happening now because I think I

6150
04:01:00,559 --> 04:01:03,879
had said this earlier and hey Fletch

6151
04:01:02,318 --> 04:01:08,278
it's good to see you again man it's been

6152
04:01:03,879 --> 04:01:13,079
a while man but um uh it's it's it's an

6153
04:01:08,279 --> 04:01:14,720
order magnitude cheaper to make THC from

6154
04:01:13,079 --> 04:01:18,799
CBD

6155
04:01:14,719 --> 04:01:20,760
that it is to grow weed extract it and

6156
04:01:18,799 --> 04:01:24,039
distill it refine it into that same

6157
04:01:20,760 --> 04:01:26,920
molecule of THC you'll pay 10 times the

6158
04:01:24,040 --> 04:01:30,760
amount to get to that same molecule of

6159
04:01:26,920 --> 04:01:33,719
THC so I mean this is just yeah it's a

6160
04:01:30,760 --> 04:01:36,238
[ __ ] show it's being commoditized I

6161
04:01:33,719 --> 04:01:38,519
don't know how any cannabis companies

6162
04:01:36,238 --> 04:01:41,719
expect to make any money when the

6163
04:01:38,520 --> 04:01:44,040
competition can sell an $8 vape pen two

6164
04:01:41,719 --> 04:01:45,799
clicks after you said you're 21 on

6165
04:01:44,040 --> 04:01:49,159
website they're asking you for your

6166
04:01:45,799 --> 04:01:51,559
credit card information you know I mean

6167
04:01:49,158 --> 04:01:53,639
it's just there's no way that the

6168
04:01:51,559 --> 04:01:56,639
regular Canabis Market gotta sell The

6169
04:01:53,639 --> 04:01:59,358
Chronic you got sell The Chronic and and

6170
04:01:56,639 --> 04:02:01,959
service a specific consumer and that's

6171
04:01:59,359 --> 04:02:04,000
that's my op yeah you gotta make a brand

6172
04:02:01,959 --> 04:02:06,158
promise and they trust you and that's

6173
04:02:04,000 --> 04:02:07,639
why they do business with you I'm on

6174
04:02:06,158 --> 04:02:09,600
board with you but you know what the

6175
04:02:07,639 --> 04:02:13,559
majority of beer drinkers in this

6176
04:02:09,600 --> 04:02:16,880
country drink Budweiser Bud Light that

6177
04:02:13,559 --> 04:02:19,398
they Buy in cases at Walmart so when you

6178
04:02:16,879 --> 04:02:19,398
could buy

6179
04:02:20,760 --> 04:02:26,600
weed weed with spray Delta eight on it

6180
04:02:24,359 --> 04:02:29,000
and you could buy it at Walmart guess

6181
04:02:26,600 --> 04:02:31,960
what all those Walmart consumers are

6182
04:02:29,000 --> 04:02:34,600
gonna buy it by the ton it's gonna be

6183
04:02:31,959 --> 04:02:36,438
new Prevagen or new Kunal right you'll

6184
04:02:34,600 --> 04:02:38,559
see jelly

6185
04:02:36,439 --> 04:02:42,479
donuts I mean

6186
04:02:38,559 --> 04:02:45,278
crazy everybody and Budweiser also has a

6187
04:02:42,478 --> 04:02:48,438
lot of glyphosate in it and glyos one of

6188
04:02:45,279 --> 04:02:51,800
the biggest deseri of the

6189
04:02:48,439 --> 04:02:53,880
desertified to all like 80% of all

6190
04:02:51,799 --> 04:02:56,478
long-term chronic illness autoimmune

6191
04:02:53,879 --> 04:02:58,358
conditions of all types into all

6192
04:02:56,478 --> 04:03:00,358
different types of cancer and so you I

6193
04:02:58,359 --> 04:03:02,760
think we're entering into this world of

6194
04:03:00,359 --> 04:03:04,399
uh this time of radical transparency

6195
04:03:02,760 --> 04:03:06,439
because of how compromised the food

6196
04:03:04,398 --> 04:03:09,559
system is how compromised all these

6197
04:03:06,439 --> 04:03:12,439
systems are and captured by corporate

6198
04:03:09,559 --> 04:03:14,559
poisoning PE Industries it's like it's

6199
04:03:12,439 --> 04:03:17,439
leading in this era for those that are

6200
04:03:14,559 --> 04:03:19,760
trying to live a long healthy life and

6201
04:03:17,439 --> 04:03:22,559
not get Parkinson's or Dementia or ALS

6202
04:03:19,760 --> 04:03:24,559
or Alzheimer's in their late time it's

6203
04:03:22,559 --> 04:03:26,238
like you have to be radically aware of

6204
04:03:24,559 --> 04:03:27,439
what you're putting in or on your body

6205
04:03:26,238 --> 04:03:30,079
you know and I think that just really

6206
04:03:27,439 --> 04:03:32,040
helps us to kind of get into that zone

6207
04:03:30,079 --> 04:03:34,478
and uh and the reality is is like yeah

6208
04:03:32,040 --> 04:03:37,040
there's going to be Budweiser you know

6209
04:03:34,478 --> 04:03:39,158
and and um and you know it's I mean and

6210
04:03:37,040 --> 04:03:41,880
the more we can do to kind of you know

6211
04:03:39,158 --> 04:03:43,000
identify test you know because taxes are

6212
04:03:41,879 --> 04:03:44,438
destroying everything I mean there's so

6213
04:03:43,000 --> 04:03:46,639
much destroying everything the state not

6214
04:03:44,439 --> 04:03:48,680
regulating Labs but I think ultimately

6215
04:03:46,639 --> 04:03:50,439
the testing it's again the biggest

6216
04:03:48,680 --> 04:03:53,439
barrier of Entry to keep out the

6217
04:03:50,439 --> 04:03:57,000
poisonous people that are you know their

6218
04:03:53,439 --> 04:04:00,600
only game is to like monocrop f and you

6219
04:03:57,000 --> 04:04:02,520
know desiccate with glyphosate you know

6220
04:04:00,600 --> 04:04:05,238
like the whole reality and so but the

6221
04:04:02,520 --> 04:04:06,680
thing is is that's also poisoning

6222
04:04:05,238 --> 04:04:09,520
ourselves it's poisoning the planet it's

6223
04:04:06,680 --> 04:04:10,920
poisoning all life species and um I

6224
04:04:09,520 --> 04:04:12,920
don't think that's the long run that's

6225
04:04:10,920 --> 04:04:14,960
going to succeed um but those that are

6226
04:04:12,920 --> 04:04:17,158
like radically transparent and able to

6227
04:04:14,959 --> 04:04:19,238
kind of build long-term kind of loyalty

6228
04:04:17,158 --> 04:04:20,879
around that you know I think is how kind

6229
04:04:19,238 --> 04:04:22,238
of a lot of those that are in most

6230
04:04:20,879 --> 04:04:24,759
Integrity with the plant are going to

6231
04:04:22,238 --> 04:04:26,600
like find their path and don't you think

6232
04:04:24,760 --> 04:04:28,279
that the majority of the people in

6233
04:04:26,600 --> 04:04:32,120
America

6234
04:04:28,279 --> 04:04:34,199
eat heavily processed chemical grown

6235
04:04:32,120 --> 04:04:36,159
food I mean for sure and they're also

6236
04:04:34,199 --> 04:04:38,960
developing all these long-term chronic

6237
04:04:36,158 --> 04:04:41,719
of course they are but Al I'm saying

6238
04:04:38,959 --> 04:04:46,158
is they're still buying

6239
04:04:41,719 --> 04:04:47,559
it well marus I know you want to jump I

6240
04:04:46,158 --> 04:04:49,719
know you want to jump but I want to make

6241
04:04:47,559 --> 04:04:51,398
I want to make a point before you end

6242
04:04:49,719 --> 04:04:54,000
this episode this has been a great

6243
04:04:51,398 --> 04:04:57,238
episode guys we talked about a lot of

6244
04:04:54,000 --> 04:04:59,879
stuff but um you know Unilever the

6245
04:04:57,238 --> 04:05:02,478
multi-billion dollar consumer product

6246
04:04:59,879 --> 04:05:04,599
Corporation Unilever they they're the

6247
04:05:02,478 --> 04:05:06,559
people who make who bring us helman's

6248
04:05:04,600 --> 04:05:10,120
mayonnaise right I don't know if you

6249
04:05:06,559 --> 04:05:12,840
like mayonnaise on your BLT but it's

6250
04:05:10,120 --> 04:05:15,359
it's probably they own like 150 food

6251
04:05:12,840 --> 04:05:18,719
companies yeah well they're they're just

6252
04:05:15,359 --> 04:05:22,680
this huge mega consumer product well

6253
04:05:18,719 --> 04:05:25,358
they have a new uh advertising uh slogan

6254
04:05:22,680 --> 04:05:27,158
or a new advertising kind of gist where

6255
04:05:25,359 --> 04:05:29,680
they want to talk about sustainable

6256
04:05:27,158 --> 04:05:32,799
farming practices because they use

6257
04:05:29,680 --> 04:05:36,720
soybean oil in the manufacturer of

6258
04:05:32,799 --> 04:05:39,599
mayonnaise right so and they they talk

6259
04:05:36,719 --> 04:05:42,358
about it so they they they they show

6260
04:05:39,600 --> 04:05:44,318
customers walking into like a deli and

6261
04:05:42,359 --> 04:05:46,479
then getting like a sandwich that's got

6262
04:05:44,318 --> 04:05:49,760
nothing in the rapper so it's a pretty

6263
04:05:46,478 --> 04:05:52,799
provocative kind of you know consumer

6264
04:05:49,760 --> 04:05:55,719
campaign but it's it's it's really it's

6265
04:05:52,799 --> 04:05:58,519
not paying attention to Marcus what you

6266
04:05:55,719 --> 04:06:01,318
guys figured out in Canada which is that

6267
04:05:58,520 --> 04:06:04,720
the driver for cannabis and hemp

6268
04:06:01,318 --> 04:06:06,760
ultimately is not THC and it's not CBD

6269
04:06:04,719 --> 04:06:08,039
and it's really not medicine it's

6270
04:06:06,760 --> 04:06:11,279
[ __ ]

6271
04:06:08,040 --> 04:06:13,720
food Everybody Eats food not everyone

6272
04:06:11,279 --> 04:06:15,479
smokes weed like Alex said right so

6273
04:06:13,719 --> 04:06:18,318
there's a limited market when it comes

6274
04:06:15,478 --> 04:06:20,799
to you know how widespread can you

6275
04:06:18,318 --> 04:06:23,719
produce cannabis but ultimately if

6276
04:06:20,799 --> 04:06:26,318
you're trying to display soybean on

6277
04:06:23,719 --> 04:06:30,559
protein per acre now you're up against

6278
04:06:26,318 --> 04:06:34,439
the industrial agricultural food complex

6279
04:06:30,559 --> 04:06:36,959
of archers Daniel Midland Bungie Dupont

6280
04:06:34,439 --> 04:06:39,520
senta you know all those chemical

6281
04:06:36,959 --> 04:06:41,839
companies all of them without exception

6282
04:06:39,520 --> 04:06:44,079
bought seed companies so they could

6283
04:06:41,840 --> 04:06:46,799
genetically engineer their seed

6284
04:06:44,079 --> 04:06:49,840
to be resistant to their fungicides and

6285
04:06:46,799 --> 04:06:53,358
their insecticides and herbicides so

6286
04:06:49,840 --> 04:06:56,439
yeah all I I think the ultimate driver

6287
04:06:53,359 --> 04:06:59,279
here Alec I don't know I I I could be

6288
04:06:56,439 --> 04:07:02,040
wrong on this when it comes to protein

6289
04:06:59,279 --> 04:07:05,120
per acre I think with soybeans you can

6290
04:07:02,040 --> 04:07:09,000
get somewhere between 360 to

6291
04:07:05,120 --> 04:07:11,439
380 pounds of soluble protein per acre

6292
04:07:09,000 --> 04:07:13,719
with hem and Sam tell me if these

6293
04:07:11,439 --> 04:07:16,520
numbers are are are in line with what

6294
04:07:13,719 --> 04:07:20,039
what you know hemp with the high like

6295
04:07:16,520 --> 04:07:22,000
phola high oil variety strains they

6296
04:07:20,040 --> 04:07:25,000
think the estimates are somewhere like a

6297
04:07:22,000 --> 04:07:27,398
thousand pounds an acre so if you're a

6298
04:07:25,000 --> 04:07:30,680
farmer and you're looking to raise I

6299
04:07:27,398 --> 04:07:33,439
don't know uh protein for your you know

6300
04:07:30,680 --> 04:07:36,479
livestock feed because you need to make

6301
04:07:33,439 --> 04:07:38,720
more red meat hamburgers for Big Macs

6302
04:07:36,478 --> 04:07:40,799
and leather shoes and [ __ ] like that I

6303
04:07:38,719 --> 04:07:43,559
mean protein per acre it's going to

6304
04:07:40,799 --> 04:07:45,599
matter how how productive that acre of

6305
04:07:43,559 --> 04:07:48,318
land could be and if you could make a

6306
04:07:45,600 --> 04:07:52,279
th000 pounds on that acre versus just

6307
04:07:48,318 --> 04:07:54,879
360 pounds an acre it's a no-brainer but

6308
04:07:52,279 --> 04:07:56,600
now again you're up against the

6309
04:07:54,879 --> 04:08:00,358
industrial

6310
04:07:56,600 --> 04:08:03,439
agricultural complex of these huge

6311
04:08:00,359 --> 04:08:04,720
multinational corporations that need to

6312
04:08:03,439 --> 04:08:06,760
keep raising

6313
04:08:04,719 --> 04:08:08,679
soybeans right and if you look at

6314
04:08:06,760 --> 04:08:10,960
soybeans soy beans keep going up keep

6315
04:08:08,680 --> 04:08:12,800
going up keep going up but what what the

6316
04:08:10,959 --> 04:08:14,679
other thing that keeps going up is the

6317
04:08:12,799 --> 04:08:17,398
amount of chem chicals that are applied

6318
04:08:14,680 --> 04:08:20,559
to the land where the soybeans are grown

6319
04:08:17,398 --> 04:08:23,478
we know hemp doesn't need the chemical

6320
04:08:20,559 --> 04:08:25,719
applications so the chemical companies

6321
04:08:23,478 --> 04:08:28,760
that own the seed companies have a

6322
04:08:25,719 --> 04:08:30,879
vested interest to keep soybeans being

6323
04:08:28,760 --> 04:08:33,478
grown right because they're selling tons

6324
04:08:30,879 --> 04:08:35,639
of chemicals right guess what when hemp

6325
04:08:33,478 --> 04:08:38,719
takes over they don't need to sell those

6326
04:08:35,639 --> 04:08:40,318
chemicals anymore so yeah I mean I I

6327
04:08:38,719 --> 04:08:42,318
think food is going to be the ultimate

6328
04:08:40,318 --> 04:08:44,398
driver I really I don't I don't think

6329
04:08:42,318 --> 04:08:47,198
you're wrong for sure and and cannabis

6330
04:08:44,398 --> 04:08:50,599
protein is like the it's like the

6331
04:08:47,199 --> 04:08:53,119
Cannabis of food it is so complex and so

6332
04:08:50,600 --> 04:08:55,119
perfect and so incredible it's been

6333
04:08:53,119 --> 04:08:57,239
compared to breast milk you know in

6334
04:08:55,119 --> 04:08:59,800
regards to the essential amino acids all

6335
04:08:57,238 --> 04:09:03,079
of the ones that adults need omegas

6336
04:08:59,799 --> 04:09:05,879
babies need the the ratios of 3 to1 glna

6337
04:09:03,079 --> 04:09:08,959
to GLA all of that plays a factor as

6338
04:09:05,879 --> 04:09:11,959
well listen this has been [ __ ] an

6339
04:09:08,959 --> 04:09:14,599
incredible conversation I think I spoke

6340
04:09:11,959 --> 04:09:16,839
twice because I was really just enjoying

6341
04:09:14,600 --> 04:09:18,399
listening uh and I have felt bad for

6342
04:09:16,840 --> 04:09:20,158
people in the past who haven't spoken

6343
04:09:18,398 --> 04:09:21,478
much and now I can appreciate their

6344
04:09:20,158 --> 04:09:23,199
perspective when you're not speaking

6345
04:09:21,478 --> 04:09:24,799
much you're listening you're getting

6346
04:09:23,199 --> 04:09:27,239
more out of it than you probably get out

6347
04:09:24,799 --> 04:09:29,118
of it when you share I want to thank

greatness with a skunkman Sam I'm so

6380
04:10:38,719 --> 04:10:42,599
glad you made it dude I was worried the

6381
04:10:41,040 --> 04:10:43,760
whole time for a couple hours I was like

6382
04:10:42,600 --> 04:10:45,520
he's going to miss it

6383
04:10:43,760 --> 04:10:47,199
as the conversation got better and

6384
04:10:45,520 --> 04:10:49,680
better I I felt like maybe he is going

04:11:23,559 --> 04:11:27,519
think I'm seeing for the first time how

6402
04:11:25,760 --> 04:11:29,359
important this dialogue is for our

6403
04:11:27,520 --> 04:11:32,079
industry and it's it's it's great that

6404
04:11:29,359 --> 04:11:36,000
we're all doing our individual things on

6405
04:11:32,079 --> 04:11:39,279
our own but when we get together the the

6406
04:11:36,000 --> 04:11:41,000
synergistic gain that we produce with uh

6407
04:11:39,279 --> 04:11:42,479
bouncing off each other not always

6408
04:11:41,000 --> 04:11:43,920
agreeing with each other sharing

6409
04:11:42,478 --> 04:11:46,000
different perspectives

6410
04:11:43,920 --> 04:11:49,920
