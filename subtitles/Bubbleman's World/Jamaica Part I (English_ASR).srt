yesterday out on the road one of the

18
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,479
local artists uh and he introduced me to

19
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,238
the medicine medicine man Gussy Clark

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,558
who I had never actually met before but

21
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,719
was friends with some of my other

22
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:08,000
friends like red who you guys have seen

23
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:10,719
on the steam chalice video and Bongo

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,879
roach another local Medicine Man and so

25
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,118
they said that they were going to help

26
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:18,759

28
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:21,519
and I'm going to try and do an interview

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
with both of those groups of people

30
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,280
potentially together potentially

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,280
separate and of course I'm going to be

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,920
covering uh the world's uh that

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,920
International Cannabis Cup that's

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,920
happening here uh on the 12th to the

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,079
15th we got a whole slew of people

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,920
coming over for that and then in the

37
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:39,078
meantime I thought we would start it off

38
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,680
with a few dabs of some beautiful Rosen

39
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:46,319
that I just happened to uh find here in

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:49,920
Jamaica I did unfortunately have a minor

41
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,879
disaster with my um Sapphire I dropped

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,680
it just a few seconds ago and smashed it

43
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,920
into Oblivion but luckily the good

44
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,039
people at Dil had sent me a quartz

45
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,079
version as well so the quartz is brand

46
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:05,280
new it's sitting sitting hot and heavy

47
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,199
at about 640 de and uh why don't we

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,719
start this off with a little rip maybe

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,719
I'll take you guys for a walk down by

50
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,239
the water show you the cliffs real quick

51
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,719
and then I'll try and uh fill in the

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,239
rest of the show with uh you know a

53
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,959
little bit of uh Adventure here

54
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,599
throughout the day uh here in the Gill

55
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,680
so let's start it out with a nice wake

56
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,679
and bake surprising uh how stable this

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,599
rosin is sitting out even in the it's

58
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,959
very hot right now it's got to be 85

59
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:35,079
Plus de for you Americans uh

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,280
31Â° C for you Canadians and uh yeah I

61
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,519
think we're ready for the rip let's do

62
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,519
it fresh off the

63
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,318
quartz we go

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,200
damn nice taste off the course I've been

65
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,360
hitting the Sapphire for so

66
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:11,598
long slightly different taste for sure

67
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,599
as I know this resin quite

68
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,319
well got a bags of Q-tips for some quick

69
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,799
cleaning this just cleans up the

70
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,438
majority of the uh

71
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,360
that leftover resin I thought it was

72
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:38,519
funny when someone told me it was called

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,720
the Zamboni Tech everything's a tech

74
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,879
even taking a Q-tip and wiping your

75
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,719
bowl made me laugh hey I wanted to shout

76
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,318
out the fire Bros for passing me these

77
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,799
uh slick uh pads these they're very much

78
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,238
like an oil slick pad but I guess their

79
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,560
own little version of it with their

80
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,560
graphics on it it's been coming in quite

81
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,640
handy I like the length of it I can fit

82
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,878
three pieces of Glass on it at once I

83
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,158
just uh I prefer it to the square units

84
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,359
there's definitely something to be said

85
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,479
for the rectangular units um anyway I

86
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,280
think we're going to head down to the

87
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,039
water give you guys a little uh view of

88
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,719
the cliffs and the water it is a little

89
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:15,519
bit rough today not as uh as quiet as it

90
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,040
was I was uh snorkeling in there the

91
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,519
other day with my son and we saw a

92
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,720
beautiful sea turtle which is uh quite a

93
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,040
lucky site if you're uh ever in Jamaica

94
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,280
and you're in the water it's not like

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,560
you see them everywhere I've been coming

96
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,839
for 20 years and I'd never seen one so I

97
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,038
was really stoked to see one and

98
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,879
hopefully we can get the GoPro down into

99
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,879
the water and we can show you some of

100
