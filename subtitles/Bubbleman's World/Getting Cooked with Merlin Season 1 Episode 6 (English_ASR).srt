today you guys want to tell them you

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,920
want to tell them merlin what to do

91
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,239
well it's a rainy day so i thought we'd

92
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,958
do a soup we're going to do some spring

93
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,200
rolls and some ramen beautiful yeah

94
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,360
that's awesome

95
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,439
on a cold rainy day and the

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,760
winter is coming it's dumping up and

97
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,400
whistling so oh yeah major dumping it's

98
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:49,519
been raining here like crazy in fact

99
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,080
i did get my drone resorted it was kind

100
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,360
of down the battery died on my um

101
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,360
phantom 4.

102
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,799
um so i've got that battery replaced and

103
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,720
every day that we filmed this for the

104
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,200
last like two or three cooking with

105
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,039
merlin's i've thought if the rain ends

106
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,399
i'll shoot the drone out for a little

107
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,479
visual because

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
part of this episode in my opinion

109
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,479
that's the magic is is the view and

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
today it's not really there you can't

111
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,119
even see the mountains it's just some

112
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,840
trees and some

113
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,439
some fog but it is pretty beautiful uh

114
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,798
when you can see it so eventually we're

115
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,040
gonna get that drone up there and we'll

116
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,120
get some drone footage cut into these

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,120
videos but in the meantime

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,240
quick little sessions smoke some joints

119
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,879
light some bowls um get iri and then get

120
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,079
into the kitchen today merlin has a lot

121
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,120
of sous chefs you're going to be on the

122
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,879
camera

123
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
right um i can cook something i'm going

124
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,079
to be doing no i mean for your own like

125
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,519
okay we'll get some stuff yeah and then

126
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,399
so you guys are probably going to be in

127
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,240
sous chef position from uh although i'm

128
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,239
guessing rome's probably gonna need one

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,160
of you to do to serve him dabs and

130
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,560
joints yeah so probably one of them will

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,680
get that job right that's simon's normal

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,680
job but he's in my table as well he put

133
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,280
remo to work the other day and it took

134
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,959
him only about 10 minutes to realize

135
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,758
maybe i should get rimo to be rolling

136
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,560
joints

137
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
yeah

138
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,879
it really was a good idea it was a good

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,160
move he was doing great

140
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,000
it was definitely not a shot against

141
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,439
remo he did great in the work that he

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,759
was doing but when he said that what was

143
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,439
his quote i can burn water

144
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,759
when he said that i i felt a little bit

145
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,160
of the confidence uh he wrote out

146
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,160
his soul

147
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,839
so we put him on joy switch this guy out

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,439
when i'm sitting beside merlin that i do

149
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,679
the best i can to stay out of his way

150
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,759
right it moves on fire yeah it moves

151
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,600
like fire did you try holding a camera

152
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,240
on the guy you couldn't imagine but i'm

153
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,160
telling you the wide lens helps because

154
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,038
if i had the normal camera lens that

155
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,960
this camera has i'd have to like stand

156
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,959
in the back corner uh over by the

157
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,719
skateboard deck that some of you have

158
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,478
noticed maybe people see if any of you

159
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,639
others notice the skateboard deck this

160
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,639
episode in the meantime it's time for a

161
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,639
dab

162
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,560
if anyone can see this stuff is

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,800
ridiculous what is this marcus that is

164
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,680

175
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,000
deserving to be on the brand such a

176
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,680
difficult thing to create exceptional

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,918
quality products

178
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,759
in the regulatory framework it really is

179
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,478
a challenge a lot of work a lot of

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,240
hurdles but we're there we're gonna do

181
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,599
it it still beats having a gun put in

182
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,160
your face and having your kids taken

183
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,080
away in your dog shot in my opinion it's

184
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,880
not much stress to be honest comparing

185
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,478
the

186
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,240
in the space no

187
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,079
exactly

188
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,639
about it yeah he brexit is give

189
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,959
everybody excited about it

190
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,960
thank you sir

191
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,879
film or rising film evaporators nope

192
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,360
no well this is kind of what that's

193
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,598
based on it's based on pulling the resin

194
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,240
up into this part of the not letting the

195
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,399
dab just be taken on the pan but getting

196
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,160
it pulled into this little tube that's

197
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,079
also heated up

198
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,520
and then the little marble inside is

199
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,359
just moving it around to make sure that

200
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,918
it's painting and touching as much of

201
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,038
that surface area as possible this is to

202
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:41,359
reduce uh oxygen as well as this so it

203
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,038
makes it that tighter little pull yeah

204
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,840
you know shout out to nephilim glass

205

readout on how hot my banger is i could

228
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,719
imagine it would be oh was it

229

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,200
check it out yeah where's it at

244
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,278
320 398 400 degrees

245
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,680
you know it seems ridiculous but if you

246
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,679
dab a lot knowing the temperature of the

247
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,199
banger

248
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,719
and the amount of time that you heat it

249
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,720
up you ready to see some groupings it

250
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,560
changes from banger to banger depending

251
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,920
on the thickness the type of material

252
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,599
that it's made out of so what's the what

253
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,439
type of what are we aiming for well

254
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,680
everyone's different okay so like for

255
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,360
instance people that really like

256
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,159
if you want to take the rocket ship to

257
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,680
the moon a warmer or hotter temperature

258
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,600
will get you there

259
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,599
um anyone that's accidentally taking a

260
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,759
hot dab knows that

261
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,440
exactly but that didn't seem too hot

262
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,159
no that was a low time no i just i'm

263
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,760
just we're just total rookies well or

264
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,879
here's the question

265
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,879
do you smoke cigarettes

266
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,439
do you smoke cigarettes i haven't i

267
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,240
haven't i have you recently that's what

268
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,839
i mean

269
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,039
i normally have stopped today yeah

270
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,519
yeah cigarettes can have an effect on

271
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:10,159
your lungs for certain right all right

272
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,000
okay that makes sense because um

273
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,439
i mean soaking a good dab

274
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,879

so this april will be two years

407

it's a

408
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,799
lawsuit against the manitoba

409
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:11,519
government's ban on homegrown cannabis

410
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,359
i remember when the ban first came into

411
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,759
place in 2018

412
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,879
i was working for with merlin at the

413
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,240
time

414
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,720
and

415
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,159
really really annoyed me but i wasn't at

416
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,199
the time personally affected by it

417
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,439
because i didn't have a place where i

418
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:28,399
could grow and was traveling for work

419
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,040
but when kovid came around

420
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,860
and our governments instructed us to

421
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,120
find

422
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,440
[Music]

423
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,679
creative and constructive

424
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,279
projects to work on during lockdown

425
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,198
i

426
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,198
started researching how i could launch

427
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:46,000
this lawsuit and

428
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,159
went shopping for lawyers and

429
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,360
launched the initial lawsuit in august

430
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,679
after about

431
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,720
four and a half months of diligence and

432
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,239
um

433
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,160
shopping through lawyers

434
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,360
which was a lot of fun in itself and do

435
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,679
you want to tell us who you ended up

436
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,639
with yeah we started with mlt aikens

437
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,359
they

438
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,798
they're massive firm across western

439
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,919
canada and

440
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,838
they

441
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,000
built a very strong foundation and a lot

442
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,438
of research in what we were doing i then

443
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,038
transitioned to

444
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,360
daniel trenipinsky which is a smaller

445
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,119
single lawyer just to control the the

446
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,119
legal bills because obviously the big

447
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,038
firm you pay more it was just us

448
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,879
initially uh funding this

449
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,119
and yeah it's um

450
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,039
it's been a learning curve and a half

451
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,519
and i'm really happy with the amount of

452
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,839
community support we have behind it

453
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,440
dude talk about being a local hero when

454
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,240
that lawsuit goes through and you win

455
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,279
the rights for all manitoba's manitobans

456
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,038
to grow

457
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,960
in their plans yeah that's going to be

458
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,319
different dude that's a right that we

459
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,240
all earned here that it should have

460
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,720
happened in legalization and you're you

461
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,640
know it's the last bit of activism left

462
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,519
onto the cannabis market i'd say the

463
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,919
last fight and the the premier who is

464
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,599
recently

465
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,840
appointed in manitoba is actually the

466
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,918
one who wrote the ban and she's publicly

467
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,439
stated she will defend it so

468
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,120
looking like it'll be a fight till the

469
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,279
end which probably is a year and a half

470
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,719
from now until oh my god she's so on the

471
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,319
wrong side of history and she doesn't

472
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,440
even know it your next fight should be

473
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,439
to not tax us to death

474
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,079
manitoba is actually the best tax in

475
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,319
canada as far as excise but the rest of

476
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,240
the country we get slaughtered

477
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,439
damn well that's crazy man that's great

478
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,079
to hear and so where can people go and

479
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,558
read about this and support this

480
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,399

well we were we were the yeah in

522
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,640
manitoba we were probably the first and

523
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,038
it was just like it was like martin and

524
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,480
alex and neil and john

525
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,599
these guys were all kind of the core

526
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,759
group but then there were other people

527
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,839
from the university of manitoba who

528
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,158
started a hemp group that were a part of

529
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:17,199
it and other activists that came into

530
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,840
play like you know paul de feliz and and

531
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,319
alan middlemess from nelson from the

532

kootenays the holy smokes guys

533
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,599
so lots of people were a part of it for

534
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
sure but yeah

535
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,359
i feel lucky enough to be able to say

536
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,038
that we got that license for that first

537
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:35,439
five acre experimental field in 1995 and

538
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,879
driving my volkswagen van through that

539
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,240
hemp field

540
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,080
was uh

541
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,798
in a way it was the first cannabis

542
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,918
activism in manitoba really

543
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,639
yeah i mean i don't know there might

544
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,080
have been people in the 70s and the 60s

545
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,080
because that i would have missed that

546
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,678
boat and not been you know like i

547
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,079

pipes and kind of like different kind of

549
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,079
weed positive things which i guess in a

550
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,159
sense during prohibition that would

551
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,839
still be part of it kind of a bit of

552
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,600
activism you know where you're like hey

it is miso actually it's just another

572

this should start to

584
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,000
kind of turn into a broth a little bit

585

yeah you're rolling up yourself

599
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,359
you just have to focus on it and make

600
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,880
sure you execute

601
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,000
and then everyone can smoke weed

602
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,559
everywhere that they grew in their

603
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,558

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,240
someone else want to help me out simon's

that'd be delicious

630
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,399
and then i guess we'll make the peanut

631
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,799

00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,839
give it a little bite

651
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:26,080
a little bit of garlic

652
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,079
now a little bit of lime juice

653
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,440
looking good yeah and then

654
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,200
we're gonna put a little bit of this as

655
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,600
well and which one's that now a little

656
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,600
bit of sesame oil just a little shot of

657
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,599
a little cesare of miso as well can be

658
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,558
pretty tasty in there

659
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,719
while we're doing it all right

660
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:50,720
yeah

661
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,720
almost held back almost held back i

662
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,119
thought twice about it because miso is

663
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,480
super salty but i'm not going to put any

664
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,399
salt in here i'm just going to place it

665
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,880
with the music i think it'll kind of fit

666
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,880

750
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,319
plate the spring rolls while this is

751
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,240
cooking real quick here this shouldn't

752
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,158
take too long you know you kind of want

753
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,120
to keep the crisp

754
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,120
this is going here

755
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:09,599
uh you can put it in the fridge if you

756
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,960
like

757
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,398
time to plate

758
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,399
these plates sprinkles

759
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,559
every good kitchen there's some good

760
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,119
knives

761
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,278
oh yeah these are looking good yeah

762
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,759
this one's pretty bad at us too

763
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:29,759
oh yeah

764
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,639
i need to get rid of it

765
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,440
that was a good save that was a really

766
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,038
good save because that is what happens

767
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,880
in a stoner kitchen

768
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,599
these are not the tightest roll joints

769
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,600
over here jesse i have to admit yeah

770
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:50,798
yeah yeah dog's like yeah lunch

771
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,000
i'm all about air pockets good flow good

772
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,079
flow

773
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,679
these have incredible flow

774
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,038
incredible flow you could actually call

775
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,320
these air pockets that would be really

776
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,640
good for you that might be probably like

777
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:04,038
the product name if we sold them in

778
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,038
grocery stores

779
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,460
[Music]

780
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,559
so jesse when do you when do you plan on

781
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,480
closing out uh tobogram when do you

782
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,558
think that you're gonna get a resolution

783
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,960
so you gotta think of

784
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:26,000
law cases in three stages

785
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,919
so quebec for example 2019 they had

786
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,240
their first stage then there was an

787
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,880
appeal which is stage two and supreme

788
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,960
court is stage three quebec supreme

789
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,480
supreme court stage three will be a year

790
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,240
and a half from now

791
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,360
in manitoba we're gonna have our stage

792
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,240
one court proceedings in february march

793
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,398
yeah

794
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,200
and then uh roughly

795
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:47,038
six

796
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,558
to eight months after that will be in

797
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,679
the appeal court

798
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:51,678
so

799
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,000
all in all for quebec and manitoba to

800
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,240
start growing weed is probably

801
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,119
a year and a half to two years away if

802
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,038
the governments continue to fight really

803
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,239
so it's a long ways away before anyone's

804
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:03,919
gonna be able to grow their stuff at

805
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,720
their house legally at least and

806
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,840
hundreds of thousands in legal bills

807
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,000
and thousands

808
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,759
and on their side it's taxpayers paying

809
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,240
for it

810
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,759

this is over the top

898
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,160
she looks like something

899
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,799
i don't know if anyone wants it but

900
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:09,440
you guys like a little chunk of butter i

901
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,800
suggest as usual

902
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:15,440
goes in this ramen as well you just put

903
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,200
a little chunk of butter in each one

904
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,760
just gives it a nice little creaminess

905
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:19,759
as it melts

906
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,800
just so everyone knows this is a razor

907
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,039
sharp knife so i'll try not to cut

908
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,280
myself yeah try to not cut yourself that

909
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:36,079
would suck

910
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,079
take your time

911
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,960

912
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,159

bean sprouts i like them crunchy

923
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,079

if they could make them taste like this

983
