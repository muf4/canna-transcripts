10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,160
little bit different from the you know

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,118
the constant bud and hash porn that you

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,600
see here on Bubble man's world as well

13
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,640
as the education that you often get

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,520
through shows like hash church and uh

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,000
the videos that I do that are howtos but

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,920
I thought you know let's share a little

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,878
bit more eye candy it's easy for me all

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,280
I have to do is film a little intro and

19
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:48,439
then I'm able to Simply cut it into the

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,039
video that I want to share and boom

21
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:52,839

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,920
video I'm going to share with you is up

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,239
on the pton ice caps again uh snowboard

uh access only and uh snowmobile access

25
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:03,078
only I should say and we we got up on

26
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:05,478
the on our sleds took us about an hour

27
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,799
and a half to get to this Zone and uh my

28
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:09,239
friend and I Ben actually we rode down

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,118
together while our other two friends

30
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,199
stayed up top to come down and get us

31
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,680
afterwards and it's just a real nice

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,960
video it's only a couple of minutes 2

33
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,439
and 1 half minutes long but you'll

34
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,879
really get the idea of how beautiful

35
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,478
this place is uh we use the stick with

36
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,959
the GoPro and we actually pass it back

37
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,400
and forth a few times and so you see the

38
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,798
editing from both of our perspectives so

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,719
sometimes you'll see me in the orange

40
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,600
and the blue and other times you'll see

41
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:34,519
B and uh and it's pretty cool video so

42
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:38,000
uh I guess what we're going to do is

43
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:39,118
we're going to have a little dab on this

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,759
you know the temperature is just

45
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,399
slightly cool and the rosin has become

46
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,079
incredibly

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,879
