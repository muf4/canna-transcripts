1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:07,589
hey everybody welcome to bubble man's

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:10,259
world welcome to episode 161 of hashed

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,150
Church we have taken a couple of weeks

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,160
off many of you may have noticed my wake

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,350
and bakes had ceased to exist and the

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,300
hash churches have dried up a little bit

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,510
and that's not because I didn't want to

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,949
do it that's because I've been in

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,800
excruciating pain for the last couple of

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,689
weeks three weeks now I hurt myself on

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,910
my dirt bike to make a long story short

12
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,189
I didn't really like fall and hurt

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,939
myself as much as just wrote it too long

14
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,549
and too hard and therefore I damaged my

15
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,500
hip flexor I'm actually standing right

16
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,078
now which I'll probably be doing for the

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,238
rest of this episode I'm gonna try and

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,189
get through as many hours as possible

19
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,378
but it looks like maybe a one to two

20
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,429
hour Church might be maximum for me

21
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:52,409
today we'll see how well the

22
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,149
conversation goes I wanted to have a

23
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:55,828
conversation about hashish today so I

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,789
have tried to get in touch with some

25
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,890
hashish guys Michigan melts dab logic

26
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:05,189
solvent was mined of course as well as

27
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,510
many of our regulars and as always it's

28
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:08,728
hard to get in touch with them at 9:00

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,010
in the morning on a Sunday so why don't

30
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:13,799
I invite in our regulars we can get miss

31
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,640
yes yeah Faulk that into the room oh

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,840
yeah I've also invited maple butter and

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,509
guys have been making some really nice

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,310
product here I wanted to invite them in

35
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,659
because they also grow their own product

36
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,920
and I think it's hard to talk about

37
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,450
hashish without really discussing

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:36,439
growing for how she so without further

39
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:38,879
ado I will send out Z invitations and

40
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:43,349
see if we can't get some friends into

41
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,670
the room there we go there we go I hope

42
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:51,389

59
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,040
few weeks

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,540
happy daylight savings time change and

61
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,219
shout out to all the CBD people they're

62
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:42,780
catching a lot of flak right now in the

63
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,460
United States they finally sent out

64
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,960
those letters that we were expecting

65
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,849
finally treat everybody in the CBD realm

66
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,800
but today's top thing and then the news

67
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:55,560
is THC may be effective in the treatment

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,360
of sleep apnea according to a clinical

69
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,370
study study of the University of

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,020
illinois-chicago THD was effective in

71
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,050
reducing symptoms of patients suffering

72
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:08,760
from obstructive sleep apnea 73 adults

73
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:11,939
25 receiving placebo 21 received THC

74
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,949
daily and 27 received 27 milligrams of

75
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:20,180
THC one hour before bedtime for up to

76
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:22,139
six weeks and as I'm going in here

77
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,459
authors concluded that these findings

78
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,958
support the therapeutic potential

79
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,930
cannabinoids in patients with

80
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,330
obstructive sleep apnea so there we go

81
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,520
another one that came out study of the

82
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,430
University of Lyon France is cannabis

83
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,219
use resulted in a small increased risk

84
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,050
of causing fatal accidents as we know

85
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:45,150
drug driving is an issue especially

86
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:49,110
within exit in experienced users as we

87
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,730
know so that's the major situation that

88
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,540
still has to be dealt and confronted

89
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:55,919
with even in our community medicine

90
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:57,569
medicines agency issues warning to

91
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,849
companies selling CBD and cleaning

92
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,169
anti-cancer effects this is a very

93
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:02,639
interesting way the United States is

94
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,708
going after it they're not going after

95
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,199
it saying it's a schedule one drugs

96
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,959
they're going after claiming any type of

97
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:13,159
medical effect if you're trying to say

98
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,629
that you know CBD stops or you know

99
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,519
cancer from moving etc etc they're

100
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:19,889
trying they're coming hard right now on

101
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,240
CBD products because they've made a huge

102
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:26,370
proliferation across the board so you're

103
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,300
starting to see a crackdown finally of

104
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,579
some of these proven

105
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,650
because we know there's a lot of people

106
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:34,318
out here selling a lot of [ __ ] CBD

107
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:37,019
products putting CBD this and making all

108
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,729
kind of claims and it's you know we have

109
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,098
to be aware of claims people it's very

110
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:43,408
dangerous when we say that this thing is

111
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:45,959
going to help heal or do something when

112
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:48,810
we have no science to back it up and

113
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,430
anecdotal evidence and yeah I was

114
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,259
talking to Hilary Bloch about this very

115
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,970
thing just yesterday she was like what

116
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,919
do you think about all these claims and

117
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,009
I might claims and she's like well you

118
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,258
know the CBD claims and then now CBN and

119
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:03,180
CBG claims and I'm like what do you

120
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,479
think of it I'm like well III mean

121
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,098
personally I think that it's much like

122
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:09,449
you know everything there's a there's

123
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:11,279
there's little grains of truth

124
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:14,848
throughout the center and then people

125
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:17,848
you know just sort of rap [ __ ]

126
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:21,000
around it to make sales CBD is a tough

127
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:23,279
one because it's one where so many

128
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,288
people are willing to try and make money

129
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:29,968
with CBD that it's I don't know it's I

130
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:31,649
definitely believe there's medicinal

131
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:33,389
components to be had it's a cannabinoid

132
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:35,399
there's something going on there but

133
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,560
it's a tough one with all the claims

134
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,060
that people are making right now for

135
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,439
sure

136
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,579
well we have to have science to back up

137
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,649
those claims and that's one of the

138
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:45,028
things why we got into testing and doing

139
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:47,459
all these things in the first place is

140
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:50,250
we wanted to debunk these misinformation

141
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,388
and start isolating reality to start

142
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,098
pointing things in a proper direction

143
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:58,740
and you know we've had a profession of

144
00:05:56,098 --> 00:06:00,089
all these johnny-come-lately who see

145
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,550
money and have dollar signs in their

146
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:05,068
eyes or selling everything from CBD

147
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,560
infused water which you know we know CBD

148
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:10,289
doesn't infuse in water in various other

149
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,019
realities that people are trying to you

150
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:15,149
know punch their ticket into the regular

151
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:16,649
market what do you think of all this Sam

152
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:18,388
you've you've got to kind of be amused

153
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:22,378
by all this since you've discovered and

154
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:24,718
discarded CBD years ago and now to watch

155
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:30,919
this proliferation of this commercial

156
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:35,069
idiocy has to trouble you somewhat I

157
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:38,459
mean if they're making claims from CBD

158
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:41,300
or any other cannabinoid then they need

159
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:44,959
to really put up

160
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:48,559
I personally believe it it has a lot of

161
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:50,899
uses but I don't make claims and besides

162
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:55,130
that you know how I personally feel

163
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:59,468
about CBD you love it hits your face

164
00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:01,879
[Laughter]

165
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:03,978
this is something we're fighting all

166
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,899
around the world because supposedly you

167
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:08,028
know CBD was made you know people are

168
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:11,509
mailing it you know people are you know

169
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:13,579
you saw target actually sell CBD

170
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:15,379
products and actually have them pulled

171
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:19,128
within a few hours of actually going

172
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:21,499
online so there's major issues that I

173
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:23,689
think I mean investors are looking at

174
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:25,610
that they've looked past that you know

175
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:27,289
the schedule one reality for a lot of

176
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,139
people and if thrown caution to the wind

177
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:31,848
and a backed CBD unlike anything that

178
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:36,468
I've seen you know in our world and a

179
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:38,959
bit yeah it's true it's definitely I

180
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:43,699
mean I see it as clear as day it's it's

181
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:46,819
it's like it's what most people are

182
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:50,180
willing to do before the laws open up

183
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:51,800
and and allow for actual you know for

184
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,439
this planet to actually be studied and

185
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,418
and and you know created into different

186
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:58,849
products without all these absolute

187
00:07:56,418 --> 00:08:02,808
ridiculous restrictions of limitations

188
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:05,658
it's it's pretty incredible oh I wanted

189
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:08,349
to welcome John and Neil into the room

190
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:12,800
these guys are from maple butter and

191
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:14,990
they're good [ __ ] dudes what's up

192
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,778
Marcus thanks for having us yeah guys

193
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:21,019
welcome welcome I'm uh I'm enjoying some

194
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:22,308
maple butter uh as we speak here so I'm

195
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:24,379
kind of trying to figure out which one I

196
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:28,610
should go in on I've really been loving

197
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:30,349
the Rockstar Kush it's so stable yeah it

198
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,019
is a little bit more savvy than the

199
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:34,519
regular ones but very cushy what makes

200
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:37,490
it rock star compared to your regular

201
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:41,509
standard cush oh it's just the the

202
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:43,370
genetic just a rock star cush yeah what

203
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:46,970
is their specific tutors are just a

204
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,860
nomenclature probably have to ask Remo I

205
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:52,819
know he's been growing it for quite a

206
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,899
while yeah I'm not quite sure myself I

207
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:57,379
just though that's one that we

208
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:59,600
along the way not one of our stable

209
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:01,669
genetics that we have here there was a

210
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,370
few rock stars over the years I remember

211
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:08,089
bond guru came out with a rock star back

212
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:10,070
in the day and then I think this is so

213
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,379
much rock bud and since he started cross

214
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,390
two I think that was a rock star okay

215
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:17,539
yeah yeah yeah so many things to keep up

216
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:19,789
with yeah that's why I asked because the

217
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:21,620
the mutation of these genetics and names

218
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:23,209
and nomenclature you know people want to

219
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,159
know and need to know so that we can

220
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,870
clarify some of this because there's

221
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:29,149
some kinds of names that we've thrown on

222
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,769
things that are saying genetics but now

223
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,870
we've got different generations growing

224
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:35,000
out thinking this is this when it's

225
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,230
really this because you know somewhere

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,970
along the name somebody changed your

227
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,629
name so I'm just trying to dispel the

228
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,629
baloney

229
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:50,960
that was really good why is Johnny B not

230
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:53,269
in here where did Johnny B go sorry guys

231
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,950
I'm not Mike I'm not my usual self today

232
00:09:53,269 --> 00:10:00,470
I'm a little off I'm not gonna lie sorry

233
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:04,400
about your back buddy I know back

234
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:06,320
injuries are painful they take time I've

235
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,509
accidentally pinched a sciatic nerve and

236
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,620
if you've done that you know quickly you

237
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:15,019
can be a mobile and I actually have

238
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,759
pretty good mobility what I've done is

239
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:19,189
I'm pretty sure I've damaged my hip

240
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,529
flexor and we have quite a few hip

241
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,360
flexors but the one that I've damaged in

242
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,279
kind of you know where your leg plugs

243
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,930
right into your hip there's these

244
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,789
muscles and ligaments that go all around

245
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:31,219
there it's very similar to a rotator

246
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:34,250
cuff which if you've ever damaged this

247
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,649
rotator cuff like it can take months to

248
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,360
heal and in fact some a lot of times

249
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:41,659
people end up going in for surgery to

250
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,269
heal little tears in that muscle it

251
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:46,639
feels very much like that in my hip it

252
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:49,279
doesn't really hurt in my back as much

253
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:52,639
as right under my left ass cheeks it's

254
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,519
just emanating a throbbing pain and it

255
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:58,460
really sucks welcome mr. dr. Sheldon how

256

258
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:09,919

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,259
excruciating pain for the last couple of

260
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,929
weeks been trying to deal with it the

261
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:18,230
best that I can but I'll tell ya I did

262
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:21,679
300 milligrams one day just to like just

263
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:24,200
till it relax the the body and it didn't

264
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,169
even really what did you do did you lay

265
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,759

think I'm I don't sit down on my bike I

276
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,320
ride on my pegs standing so if you got

277
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,059
into the position of a goaltender where

278
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,250
you bend your legs and you okay that's

279
00:11:56,059 --> 00:12:00,559
the position I was in for 14 hours in

280
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,149
three days yeah you don't Ranger you

281
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,949
straighten all your muscles yeah well

282
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,419
flap who used to be a goaltender was

283
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,950
like oh dude you probably [ __ ] up your

284
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:08,360
hip flexor and then of course is like oh

285
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,030
man that's like that could take a year

286
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,680
to heal like that's a bad one I was like

287
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:16,100
hello thanks for the you know thanks for

288
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:19,069
the the good words but well you'd rather

289
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,149
know the truth and you know if sometimes

290
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,890
you don't want to know the truth but in

291
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:23,959
this case you do because you know these

292
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:25,279
types of those types of injuries are you

293
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,420
know you get tendons and everything

294
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,879
involved and they have to do their thing

295
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:33,709
well you know as always during an

296
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:37,340
episode of hash Church where I have a

297
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,810
specific conversation to take place 90%

298
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,670
of the people that I've invited have not

299
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:42,079
responded it's Sunday so I suspect

300
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:45,799
they'll be sleeping till 11 or 12

301
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,000
o'clock I'm not too sure if they're

302
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,399
gonna come in a little bit later

303
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,200
hopefully they do cuz I had I liked the

304
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,620
idea of having a nice conversation about

305
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,860
making hash today listen it's no problem

306
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,850
Marcus because I know everything about

307
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,740

excruciating chronic pain that will not

340
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:34,339
subside it's got my brain on fire and

341
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:37,669
it's it's quite something to try and to

342
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:40,130
just try and notice the notice pain and

343

348
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:53,049
feel for you when you're in it yourself

349

that's for sure

350

383
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,700
important to me but not only good

384
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:32,039
quality you've got a good composition

385
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,410
there that's what I'm saying it's nice

386
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,569
composition I just like the way it's all

387
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:39,329
been laid out I love seeing collections

388
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,610
over the years I've gone to do some

389
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,410
different hash maker's places around the

390
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,730
globe and stuff what really amazed me

391
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:47,759
about that work

392
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:50,519

kind of breaking up a little bit though

398
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,099
oh [ __ ] well maybe your internet isn't

399
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,979

good who's to know or you can try

401
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,808
reducing your picture that sometimes

402
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:20,308
helps yeah that's very true sometimes

403
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:25,139
you can go up into a little Wi-Fi even

404
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:26,670
and you can adjust the the quality of

405
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,550
your screen and I guess if you lower

406
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:32,490
read enough it can speed it can speed

407

bikes you could lose your car if you

429
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:31,769
haven't been there much but losing your

430

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,410
haze cross the skunk number one crossed

451

with haze crossed with haze crossed with

452
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:42,420
Northern Lights number five and then the

453
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,360
biker pushes the Lucifer og cross with

473
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,830
coaches are definitely my medicine but

474
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:32,529
when I was in after them

475
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:34,509
that was my go-to there and then I went

476
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:38,079
to dampering of course he gave him that

477
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:39,819
over to um was the other one grazing

478
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,879
those are the two places and karma of

479
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:46,389

480
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,730

call it I said see see I say things

483
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:56,710
backwards people really getting used to

484
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,839
that Marc knows it like a hundred

485
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,940
percent he corrects me and that I don't

486
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:09,730
know as I get my insurance at the auto

487
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:13,299
place we looked at me go ski another

488
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:17,759
popular coffee shop is cat to cat suit

489
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:20,619
that's where I go as they got the hazel

490
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,150
and they sell it by the bug they're at

491
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:23,859
cuts dude they don't sell it by the gram

492
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:28,630
which is another reason why I like going

493
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:32,769
there I remember in 1998 Adam made some

494
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:36,400
sage - Oh water hash and it was for sale

495
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:38,289
at the katsu and man I'll tell ya it was

496
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,960
just like hey what do you want to do I

497
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:43,389
don't know want to uh head back down to

498
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,350
the cats - yeah let's go down to the cat

499
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,530
see it's like we were just there

500
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:49,359
yesterday night like lates well let's go

501
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:52,210
get some more just couldn't [ __ ] get

502
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,919
enough of that like sage - OH

503
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,100
even the play on the name with the water

504
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:01,090
and that it was just was absent that he

505
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:02,230
pressed into little cards exactly with

506
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:05,079
the helpless

507
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:08,110
was really spectacular yeah when you

508
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:10,720
mixed it 50/50 with skunk number one

509
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:11,349
rezoned it really made something special

510
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,179
I really

511
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:15,009
really liked it yeah well it was

512
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:17,559
definitely tore penal enriched it was

513
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:19,298
definitely like some high anxiety resin

514
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:21,579
which of course you would really really

515
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:23,798
like I also really really liked that

516
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:26,199
it's funny because a lot of people

517
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:27,429
really really really don't like that you

518
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,190
give them a blast of that and I just

519
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,929
like oh man I feel like you're like

520
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,669
jump-started my central nervous system

521
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:37,380
like yeah dude that's what we just did

522
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:40,120
but to each their own to each their own

523
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:43,630
different smokes for different folks

524
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:44,619
yes that's like a shirt from 1968 or

525
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:48,070
something I love it

526
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:50,558
or different saturation points for every

527
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:53,769
endocannabinoid system right that's

528
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:56,339
that's a little more 2014 my wife says

529
00:22:53,769 --> 00:23:02,168
to say I'm still wearing the shirt from

530
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:04,779
1968 when I please take a shower oh I

531
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:07,750
love when your wife posts pictures of

532
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:09,339
your guys's travels and you know when

533
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,730
you guys were really young it's very

534
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:13,928
neat to see that's I could be honestly

535
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,779
like a book in itself

536
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:19,630
I honestly can't remember when I was

537
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:21,038
really young it's just too long ago well

538
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,049
that's what the beauty of pictures are

539
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:26,650
you know you can look at the pictures

540
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:29,859
and be like oh [ __ ] that was me that was

541
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:32,409
me I did I tell you guys the funny story

542
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:34,750
that was me story of the guy who hit the

543
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:36,610
dmt and Nelson a bunch of people

544
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,259
standing around and he hit the ground in

545
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:41,288
front of us and he was doing this crazy

546
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:45,038
Homer Simpson like full-blown freakout

547
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:48,220
and we were all like whoa he is tripping

548
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,658
balls and then out of the blue he like

549
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,909
that was one of these moves where he

550
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:55,330
just pops up off of his shoulder onto

551
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:58,120
his feet kind of backwards back into the

552
00:23:55,329 --> 00:24:01,269
crowd of people like with us looking

553
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:01,959
down and he goes that was me tripping

554
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:04,240
like that

555
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,429
like he came to this realize that he

556
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,339
should that it was it was [ __ ] one of

557

593
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,120
board's so hop skip and a jump across

594
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,250
the border oh yeah I'm just like a hop

595
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,819
skip and a jump away not that far from

596

00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:57,649
in Olympia

599
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:59,720
I'm not I'm not sure if he's I think he

600
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:03,170
might have moved oh he's moved from

601
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,910
Olympia then yeah I haven't been up

602
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:07,100
there in a long time to his place I

603
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:13,100
could be wrong but he definitely still

604
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:15,589
lives in Washington tomorrow alright

605
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:17,899
well let's talk hash guys this is a

606
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:20,720
hashish episode let's talk hash I kind

607
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,610
of wished I could have gotten in touch

608
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,480
with solvent las' mine because he's just

609
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:28,879
been crushing the hash game lately but

610
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,430
such as life when you're in chronic pain

611
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,290
and you have no chance or ability to get

612
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:36,170
up off the couch and actually send a

613
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:38,269
message to someone to do the pre I'd

614
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,889
love to do the pre check on

615
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:43,788
see if everyone's equipments gonna work

616
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:46,189
but I just don't pull it off I'm just

617
00:26:43,788 --> 00:26:47,979
not professional enough so that hash is

618
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:50,479
looking pretty good for your pain yeah I

619
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:52,489
mean yes and no Johnny be it's

620
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:54,619
definitely like there are moments where

621
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:57,379
as I suspect a lot of people have this

622
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:59,388
that have great levels of pain there are

623
00:26:57,378 --> 00:27:03,079
moments in the day where the pain is

624
00:26:59,388 --> 00:27:05,148
just much much greater where you just

625
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:07,968
get a tour of three or a four hour

626
00:27:05,148 --> 00:27:11,358
period where nothing seems to release it

627
00:27:07,969 --> 00:27:14,929
at all and that's when you get into the

628
00:27:11,358 --> 00:27:16,968
good old heavy doses of textures yeah

629
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:19,038
the nice roll-ons with terms that I got

630
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:21,469
from dr. Natasha which were really good

631
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,929
so there's all these different ways but

632
00:27:21,469 --> 00:27:26,239
everything here this is this is a this

633
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:29,809
is obviously an extraction made with a

634
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:32,690
Harlequin and Halley's Comet sugar leaf

635
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:35,628
which is all CBD put it into a tincture

636
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:37,578
so when I'm in a lot of pain lately I've

637
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:40,128
been kind of using this and I have a CVD

638
00:27:37,578 --> 00:27:43,668
roll-on for my knees which is also made

639
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:46,608
with gopher hash right so I have most of

640
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:48,349
that stuff as well different you know

641
00:27:46,608 --> 00:27:51,558
creams and salves and textures and

642
00:27:48,348 --> 00:27:54,439
capsules and whatnot but my pain

643
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:57,739
threshold is is so high that it's doing

644
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:00,320
very very little to actually relieve the

645
00:27:57,739 --> 00:28:04,119
pain the pain is just it's just insane

646
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,999
dude even right now it's [ __ ] Robin

647
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:10,249
yeah well that's when you get on those

648
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:12,379
well for me I had took a bunch of [ __ ]

649
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:14,028
that came out of a trim then I did this

650
00:28:12,378 --> 00:28:15,888
trimming through so trim Bend was

651
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:18,069
roughly what a hundred microns screen I

652
00:28:15,888 --> 00:28:20,868
think that sits on top of those and

653
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:22,308
brought that home and cleaned there up

654
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:25,699
there on Friday just you're on the

655
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:27,200
screen did the static Queen and man

656
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,479
that's what I'm hitting right now and

657
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,919
believe me it's doing really well I mean

658
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:33,619
there's different ways to being able to

659
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,869
get what you need but for me I'm a daily

660
00:28:33,618 --> 00:28:37,999
hash maker just like yourself a lot of

661
00:28:35,868 --> 00:28:40,308
other people here and if a non squishing

662
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:43,338
I'm sifting there's another sickness

663
00:28:40,308 --> 00:28:46,700
cushion I'm washing but right now I'm

664
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:48,979
not washing because of the netting so I

665
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,348
would not be surprised later when I go

666
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:52,069
to the hospital and get x-rayed if they

667
00:28:51,348 --> 00:28:55,730
tell me my

668
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:57,889
hip is broken that's the kind of pain

669
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,990
that I'm in and it's just been

670
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:02,150
consistent for like a couple weeks now

671
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:06,440
yeah well then this time we'll get some

672
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:07,970
x-rays yep gonna have to do it and since

673
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,320
you broke in two weeks ago will it makes

674
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,750
no difference now is it something like

675
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:12,950
that they'll tell you to lie down which

676
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,140
is what I've been doing anyway I've

677
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,850
broken 16 bones in my life including my

678
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:20,270
collarbone and my wrists most of my

679
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:25,609
fingers my thumbs my both my wrists my

680
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:28,299
ankles just even about the per capita

681
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:31,250
average cuz I haven't broken anything

682
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:32,990
well I'm a bit of an extreme person in

683
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,849
the sense that I've always pushed my

684
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:39,799
body a little further than it could

685
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:44,269
really go hey Sam broken a lot of heads

686
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:49,399
off of stocks he's broken a lot of oh

687
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:52,279

Zach good to see if she can become Zach

689
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:57,019

691
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:06,579
right now the last time I was with Zach

692
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:10,369
we made hash firm was a straight day

693
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:12,349
yeah yeah two days yeah I thought so we

694

701
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:31,309
[ __ ] thing actually pieces on the

702
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:33,890
plane I was gonna say that's such a

703
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:36,559
Johnny be maneuver like we eat we eat to

704
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:41,380
eat we need two pieces each there's like

706
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,730
John's like already then there is four

707
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:49,849
you know it's like a two took two with

708
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:53,319
me it's a long flight home welcome

709
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:56,599
Savile is binded hey Hoshi you made it

710
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:59,359
how do I use this you just like that you

711
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:01,429
just talking it's nice you're doing it

712
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,889
although there will be a point where

713
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:05,548
someone might unmute their mic that

714
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,230
might create a feedback and in

715
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:08,788
that sense if you click your mouse on

716
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,278
the screen somewhere and look for the

717
00:31:08,788 --> 00:31:13,769
little icon that's a microphone you can

718
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,690
click on that and it will mute you and

719
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:17,460
unmute you when you want to talk it's

720
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,798
definitely the best if you can figure

721
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:34,200
that part out but otherwise you sound

722
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:36,269
good so what is good with it you're

723
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,399
killing me what can ask him buddy looks

724
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:43,278
good that was watching your [ __ ] than

725
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:47,569
that my complaining Wow Wow planning

726
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:50,608
planning micro planning our seething

727
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:52,048
sieving sorry I was gonna say we got to

728
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:54,658
be specific because we don't want to

729
00:31:52,048 --> 00:32:00,329
call right you know what so micro

730
00:31:54,659 --> 00:32:02,629
planner yeah heard that guy haven't

731
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:05,009
heard that before

732
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:08,878
well you've microplane before haven't

733
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:11,339
you Johnny B oh I've done things I'm

734
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:13,439
complaining I've done something else I

735
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:16,589
really if there's anything new I can

736
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,570
learn that'd be fantastic I'm always

737
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:23,388
willing to find and learn new things so

738
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:26,009
it's all about the hash which is nice

739
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:27,808
well it is all about the hash and as far

740
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:29,759
as I'm concerned it seems to all be

741
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:32,700
about at least for mechanical screen

742
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:35,608
separation and water hash it seems to be

743
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,308
about capitate stocks and the sessile

744
00:32:35,608 --> 00:32:41,220
stocks trichome because i don't seem to

745
00:32:38,308 --> 00:32:44,249
pull out as many of the bulbous as i do

746
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:46,980
of those particular - to me it's always

747
00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:49,259
made the argument as to why oil comes

748
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,358
out with a higher yield although I know

749
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:53,460
Indra and other people claim that the

750
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:55,589
oils are present inside the plant not

751
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,179
just in the head but for me I've only

752
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:59,788
really ever seen it in the head I've

753
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:01,559
only experienced it in the head and so

754
00:32:59,788 --> 00:33:04,618
those two types of heads of the heads

755
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:07,558
that I'm looking to extract but before I

756
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:10,618
get to looking to extract heads I need

757
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:13,108
to find people that can allow those

758
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:15,618
heads to express themselves to the

759
00:33:13,108 --> 00:33:18,769
maximum potential of their genetic

760
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:21,049
ability as well as the you know the very

761
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:23,269
that are going on in in the room the

762
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:25,309
greenhouse the field wherever it happens

763
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:27,200
to be growing so hopefully development

764
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:28,700
that I've seen when I brought new hash

765
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,990
from other friends of mine and you've

766
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,900
cleaned and you like it just there's

767
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:35,329
nothing there yeah what's the question

768
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:39,500
yeah that's a question hey how do I get

769
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:40,220
my hash to melt like yours oh you gotta

770
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,130
grow in first

771
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,930
you're not gonna well I told solvent

772
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,420
less - just the other day I just said

773
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:49,039
well I you have to grow better buds or

774
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,860
whoever you're getting your material

775
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,159
from has to grow better buds it's always

776
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:56,990
nice when you're in the situation that

777
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:59,570
maple butter is in where you are

778
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:02,539
controlling that aspect because you're

779
00:33:59,569 --> 00:34:06,169
growing that butt and it's it's not easy

780
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:08,570
to find that quality of material just

781
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:11,240
out in the world and to be honest

782
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,740
yeah it's taken years and to be honest I

783
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:14,359
said this as well to solve almost mine

784
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:17,750
the other day the guys that you know of

785
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:20,240
as the best hash makers you know the

786
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,800
most key important factor in all of that

787
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:27,439
is that they either grow or get given

788
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,810
the best quality material that's step

789
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,539
one it's just step one if you're not

790
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:34,119
getting that material it's very hard to

791
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:38,199
polish a turd

792
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:41,809
you sometimes see varieties cooking this

793
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:44,689
really great hash but just not very much

794
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:49,940
of it what you really want is both you

795
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:52,070
want great hash and lots of it yes

796
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,769
absolutely once you get to once you get

797
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:59,090
to great quality resin and that you can

798
00:34:54,769 --> 00:35:01,130
unveil - beautiful quality hash it's the

799
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,900
the next most sensible thing is that you

800
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,910
want to get a great yield off of it and

801
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:08,150
that's why you've heard me raving about

802
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:10,879
this where is my bike great taste - 28

803
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:13,039
to 30 percent squished out of a rosin

804
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,390
press every time like you can't believe

805
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:18,110
that you just put a little button and

806
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:20,509
then it just squishes the most like 30

807
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:22,910
percent and I know there's people oh why

808
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:26,210
we get 32 we got 35 of them like great

809
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:29,899
good for you wonderful but is it of a

810
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:32,309
profile that's this exciting I searched

811
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:35,490
it in concert do you

812
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:36,239
consider that hashish or you consider it

813
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:38,789
oil

814
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:41,729
I consider it oil and for whatever

815
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:43,710
reason people get pissed at me for that

816
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,599
which is like I just consider it that

817
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,820
from basically the book that you and Rob

818
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,920
wrote you know the information from the

819
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,690
old schools that's been passed down you

820
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,329
know I always thought that intact

821
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:58,050
glandular trichomes heads even pressed

822
00:35:54,329 --> 00:36:00,779
it's it's hash but but completely melted

823
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:02,730
and extracted into a liquid it's kind of

824
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,010
the fact like when we came up with full

825
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,409
melt and full melt clear dome and then

826
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:10,250
Jeff Church took it the step further and

827
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:14,000
came up with the melt star melt

828
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:16,769
categories which the 1 2 3 4 5 &amp; 6 star

829
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,989
that's for the melt factor so when I

830
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:21,239
started seeing going to the cups and

831
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:23,219
seeing booths that were oil people like

832
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:24,959
full-blown oil companies and I'm not

833
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:27,809
saying that is a bad thing it's just

834
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,360
what they specialize in called 7 star

835
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:33,750
and it's like listen you understand that

836
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:37,530
the star rating is for the fact that the

837
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:40,019
hash melts if you have Marcus a separate

838
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:42,810
little thing here for one second what

839
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:47,360
made the most bubbles that you've seen

840
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:50,789
was it dry sip water hash rosin or what

841
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:54,840
for me like the meltia sporadic has been

842
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:56,670
at first by like by far was your sift

843
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:00,090
the first time I saw that I was just

844
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:02,789
like oh [ __ ] this isn't because people

845
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:06,890
like even me who was helping you know

846
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:09,599
popular popularize these terms and

847
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:11,699
telling people no you think it's full

848
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,460
mouth it's really like half sizzle like

849
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:15,989
it's it's faux melt at best you know

850
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,369
because people have definitions and they

851
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:19,500
want to be like oh my shits full mouth

852
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:20,819
and it's like that's fine it doesn't

853
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,869
hurt anyone if you want to say that but

854
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,250
if you're a dispensary and you're

855
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:24,989
calling it full mouth and someone comes

856
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,389
in pace 80 bucks a gram for it and it's

857
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:29,309
like half sizzle and it's like just like

858
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:31,650
moisture on the top of it sizzling

859
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:33,329
that's that's not full melt the first

860
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:36,300
time I saw your [ __ ] it turned to water

861
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:38,400
and dripped through the screen it took

862
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,640
me a few more years to get to a point

863
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,980
where I could grow resin that well to

864
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:46,559
produce into hash and

865
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:49,740
I would say that the the best water hash

866
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,570
I ever made was was was pretty much on

867
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:53,669
par with the best sift that I ever

868
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:56,010
smoked they were they were both like 10

869
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:58,170
pluses you wouldn't kick either of them

870
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:03,630
out of bed for eating crackers sore to

871
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:05,519
speak if that makes sense I I guess what

872
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:08,490
I was really wondering because I'm

873
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:13,170
pretty familiar with the first two was

874
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:15,118
if the rosin was ever more bubbly well

875
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,430
I've seen rosin froth

876
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,800
but it's different it's oil already so

877
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:21,989
it's it's it's not quite the same as

878
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,359
like whatever that violence is that's

879
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:26,909
happening inside the hash where these

880
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:29,969
terpenes or whatever just exploding and

881
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:31,980
trying to escape that process that's not

882
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:34,409
well whatever mark do you know what you

883
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,730
will we'll get right back to you in one

884
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:38,368
second I just want to finish the thought

885
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,409
while it's boiling and melting like that

886
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:43,079
for whatever reason to me it's like a

887
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:45,569
six-course dinner versus rosin which is

888
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:47,639
more like a dessert to me and I smoked

889
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,830
rosin and I loved it but it doesn't feel

890
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:53,219
as fulfilling as whatever's going on in

891
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:59,579
the hash that's boiling and melting go

892
00:38:53,219 --> 00:39:05,000
ahead mark oh uh that that carboxylation

893
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:05,000
right it's the conversion of tea

894
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:14,549
hey 210 and that you're breaking up

895
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:16,019
really laughs Arthur's mom now we can

896
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,810
hear you really good yeah you were

897
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:24,530
breaking up bed okay baby I'll kill your

898
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:27,750
picture and just talk I am my power cord

899
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:30,740
got fried last night so I have my mom my

900
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:33,329
phone I'm not usually on a laptop so I

901
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:37,858
apologize if I'm not coming through

902
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:41,190
clear I lost both my headphone and my my

903
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:43,739
my computer in one day so I got to go to

904
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:49,440
the Best Buy but I'm here in sunny

905
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:51,719
Southern California I'm gonna go later

906
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,970
on so maybe we'll hook up from Chris

907
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:55,769
Brown's lap later if there's still a

908
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:57,159
hashed Church going on but mark what I

909
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:59,048
was saying was that bubble

910
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:04,568
that you're seeing is the

911
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:08,588
decarboxylation of THC to me I'm sorry

912
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:14,739
of THC a to man THC and so when and that

913
00:40:08,588 --> 00:40:16,389
heats up it or voxel AIDS the more heat

914
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:19,348
that you're putting in the faster that's

915
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:23,739
going to be in a more the frothiness me

916
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:25,780
10 of the types of facts that may be in

917
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:27,699
there because certainly things are gonna

918
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,579
be a lot more viscous if there's more

919
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:31,629
fats at larger molecules also these are

920
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:34,599
different

921
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:36,910
the higher the terpene content the more

922
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,950
rapid the bubbling I guarantee it

923
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:41,230
yeah well it's gotta be something like

924
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:43,029
that otherwise all hash would would

925
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,579
bubble like that while you were lighting

926
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:48,010
it and it's just not the case it's all

927
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:51,369
decarboxylated but it's all melting and

928
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:53,770
bubbling there's a there's a subtle

929
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:57,059
difference between the way that the hash

930
00:40:53,769 --> 00:41:00,940
is prepared and how it actually behaves

931
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:03,309
something bubbling sort of process right

932
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:08,460
none of the hash that I ever made dry

933
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:11,079
setting even a year or two old was ever

934
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:16,659
decarboxylated it was always in the acid

935
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:18,278
form yeah man those guys look like

936
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:20,259
they're having too much fun over there

937
00:41:18,278 --> 00:41:21,940
just like mad acts and look at them all

938
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:28,630
they all look at the camera at the same

939
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:31,269
time we're just we're just showing off

940
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:35,760
here we've got a got some nice big huge

941
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:38,650
jars sift here we did so beautiful yeah

942
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,278
so have a big huge jar of sift

943
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:43,329
although when you get to be

944
00:41:41,278 --> 00:41:45,760
obsessive-compulsive sift cleaner guy

945
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:47,829
every time you see sift you're like I

946
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,470
wonder what the percentage of

947
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:52,059
contaminant is in yeah well we're John's

948
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:54,669
gonna go through this it'll probably be

949
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:57,240
down to like a third a quarter of this

950
00:41:54,670 --> 00:42:00,639
jar eventually so that's still great

951
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:02,618
yeah Mon for sure that's a I guess what

952
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:05,588
is this a five minute tumble we did on

953
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:07,390
the last whole crop mix well that's a

954
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:11,278
that's a world away from the great

955
00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:11,278
gardeners 24-hour tumbles

956
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:17,420
yeah we did this one we froze everything

957
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:22,340
we tumbled outside it was minus 12 this

958
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:24,500
week here so we use the outdoors to a to

959
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,800
our advantage a peeling that if you

960
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:33,340
measure the THC of that what is it at

961
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:36,560
when I used to do just sifting of

962
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:40,670
manicured buds we used to get about 30

963
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:43,099
33 percent THC well what is that do you

964
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,900
have any idea I don't have an idea but I

965
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:48,469
know like it squishes that squish is at

966
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:51,829
about 50 to 60 percent on rose and just

967
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:54,379
as is so uh it's gotta be it's gotta be

968
00:42:51,829 --> 00:43:01,519
up there it's gotta be up there that's

969
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:05,780
pretty good eh da not THC correct no its

970
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:10,519
THC a correct and if I completely

971
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:13,070
cleaned up resin so that it was 99.9

972
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:18,019
percent and I measured that it was in

973
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:20,210
the very very low eighties yeah go ahead

974
00:43:18,019 --> 00:43:22,159
I think that's what uh like I think Tony

975
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:23,240
was analyzing his some of his Raw's and

976
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,879
when he was doing the Pens and it was

977
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:29,329
roughly about that eighty percent THC on

978
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,800
rosin and then what like 12% terpenes on

979
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:33,170
his sauce or now he's bringing it down

980
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,940
to like eight percent or so but yeah I

981
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:39,110
figured it was about let's say this must

982
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:46,010
be around 40% 50% th I would say maybe

983
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:48,410
40% THC as is before cleaning yeah well

984
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:50,810
getting 50 percent return on sift like

985
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:54,679
having 50 percent heads is definitely a

986
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:58,279
pretty pretty decent I've seen much much

987
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:59,919
much lower most farmers grade is is much

988
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,970
lower you know

989
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,730
they're just it's a counterintuitive

990
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:07,879
thing once again it's like let's turn

991
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:10,449
this on and tumble it for a full day so

992
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:14,019
we make sure we get everything it's like

993
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:16,699
I'll usually do three times might tumble

994
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:20,269
what's that in I said I remember the

995
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:22,949
first time I tumbled nice you even

996
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:25,929

yes so I got you covered hey Marcus we

1012
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:18,608
argue what I would do which is smoke a

1013
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:20,800
pipe or Ebola patch yeah the best night

1014
00:45:18,608 --> 00:45:23,920
is right that was so wonderful dude we

1015
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:27,640
Josh and Kelly gifted my wife and I some

1016
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,980
tickets to go see Roger Waters recently

1017
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:31,960
and we got to sit with them and we got

1018
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:34,838
to smoke pure hash joints in the in the

1019
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:37,119
crowd while like while resist was being

1020
00:45:34,838 --> 00:45:38,799
put up on the giant screen and the

1021
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,140
security guards were coming and telling

1022
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,740
us hey you can't smoke that bro

1023
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:47,078
you can't smoke that shows I've ever

1024
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:50,588
been to - oh just people passing around

1025
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:53,170
joints and hi I'm Susan the joint that

1026
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:55,059
they'll it was from my friend in the

1027
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:57,670
Kootenays a pure house joint and I'm

1028
00:45:55,059 --> 00:46:00,849
telling you this thing was like a house

1029
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:03,250
fire it was like we survived it was like

1030
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:05,200
we set our chair on fire it was it was

1031
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:08,230
not your normal amount of smoke no

1032
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:11,259
matter what kind of hash was it Marcus

1033
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:14,079
because it's not easy to roll really

1034
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:16,810
really really high quality resin into a

1035
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,519
joint it just melts and bubbles you are

1036
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:20,650
correct you are correct so what my

1037
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:23,710
friend does is he uses some lower

1038
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:25,180
quality or contaminated dry sift with

1039
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,679
you know natural plant matter like

1040
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:29,649
trichome components that aren't

1041
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:32,649
glandular and he gets it down to a it's

1042
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:34,750
like a grand per joint and I smoked one

1043
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:36,239
to my own head you definitely get pretty

1044
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,878
high if you smoke a whole one

1045
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:41,099
my most-watched YouTube video is smoking

1046
00:46:38,878 --> 00:46:43,918
one of these pure hash joints like 1.3

1047
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:46,139
million video views so they're awesome

1048
00:46:43,918 --> 00:46:47,608
little joints for me when they said they

1049
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:50,189
had one because they make these

1050
00:46:47,608 --> 00:46:51,568
beautiful these beautiful little hat you

1051
00:46:50,188 --> 00:46:54,148
know they got these little guys here

1052
00:46:51,568 --> 00:46:55,798
that gifted but I don't smoke these kind

1053
00:46:54,148 --> 00:46:58,228
of joints so these these are going to

1054
00:46:55,798 --> 00:46:59,458
some friends of mine but when they when

1055
00:46:58,228 --> 00:47:00,808
they were like well we have a joint you

1056
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:04,348
can smoke and they pulled out of pure

1057
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:12,269
hash joint I was like now that I can get

1058
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:15,659
behind so good tried to make one

1059
00:47:12,268 --> 00:47:17,758
immediately did that very thing you know

1060
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:19,559
and it's it took him a long time to come

1061
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:23,429
up with the recipe to figure out the

1062
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:27,389
know-how because his are perfect yeah

1063
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:29,898
it's not easy to do no and what he used

1064
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:34,588
to say to me was oh oh one is nothing

1065
00:47:29,898 --> 00:47:40,648
start doing 100 an hour if your hash can

1066
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:42,599
burn with the cherry instead of a really

1067
00:47:40,648 --> 00:47:45,568
really really clean resin which will

1068
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:48,539
melt and drip and bubble then you can

1069
00:47:45,568 --> 00:47:50,639
smoke a joint out of it pure ash yeah

1070
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:53,009
exactly and that was the situation of

1071
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:56,189
this it was just that situation exactly

1072
00:47:53,009 --> 00:47:59,849
and the maple and the where's my bike

1073
00:47:56,188 --> 00:48:01,798
was truly phenomenal while we were there

1074
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:05,129
we got to smoke it and it was amazing

1075
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:06,648
watching it squish out so good job

1076
00:48:05,128 --> 00:48:10,438
everyone

1077
00:48:06,648 --> 00:48:13,558
absolutely it was I got a little of that

1078
00:48:10,438 --> 00:48:15,058
Frenchy cannoli bubble hash that he came

1079
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:16,919
and made with my friend from high

1080
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:19,289
integrity glass art recently they left

1081
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:20,338
the years might have to hit a little dab

1082
00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:24,299
of that right now

1083
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:27,119
how is that stove it's nice I mean it's

1084
00:48:24,298 --> 00:48:28,469
melt you know it's a you know from my

1085
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,269
perspective all the different

1086
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:33,119
methodologies of how you get it off and

1087
00:48:30,268 --> 00:48:35,338
how cold you make it and how you mix I

1088
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,889
mean it's really a simple process that

1089
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:40,378
that if you break it down it's like it

1090
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:42,869
can get most of what's there of those

1091
00:48:40,378 --> 00:48:45,118
two types of bland heads it can do it

1092
00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:47,219
fairly efficiently depending on if you

1093
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,409
don't overstuff it if you get it cold

1094
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:50,289
enough if you don't over mix all of

1095
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:52,150
these little bit

1096
00:48:50,289 --> 00:48:54,400
tables that people like yourself seem to

1097
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:56,168
figure out pretty quickly I mean the

1098
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,449
informations out there and nothing

1099
00:48:56,168 --> 00:49:01,028
teaches you better than just you know

1100
00:48:58,449 --> 00:49:02,949
making your own mistakes which is why

1101
00:49:01,028 --> 00:49:07,088
when I actually went to make bubble hash

1102
00:49:02,949 --> 00:49:10,479
with Zach you know I to make a few

1103
00:49:07,088 --> 00:49:13,208
mistakes to show him like yeah like did

1104
00:49:10,478 --> 00:49:15,428
you notice the difference like it to

1105
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:18,219
experience a little mistake is sometimes

1106
00:49:15,429 --> 00:49:20,168
better and more valuable in your hash

1107
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:22,418
making skills than to try and avoid all

1108
00:49:20,168 --> 00:49:25,058
of them and just ask everyone a million

1109
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:26,708
questions it's like man the reason that

1110
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:28,630
guy knows all that [ __ ] is because he

1111
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:30,759
went out and made his own mistakes you

1112
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:34,689
can do the same thing and leave him the

1113
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:36,849
[ __ ] alone it's absolutely true I mean

1114
00:49:34,688 --> 00:49:40,649
if you think of children how did they

1115
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:43,479
learn what is hot and what is not hot

1116
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:46,150
it's really simple they touch it and

1117
00:49:43,478 --> 00:49:48,399
then they don't do it again

1118
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:51,759
the master has failed more than the

1119
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,528
student has tried people like how do you

1120
00:49:51,759 --> 00:50:07,269
take how do you take such great pictures

1121
00:49:53,528 --> 00:50:10,059
I took 25 thousand bad ones next

1122
00:50:07,268 --> 00:50:11,558
question is that what micron is that but

1123
00:50:10,059 --> 00:50:13,630
you can only do your gabbing on right

1124
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:15,849
now if I would have put my money on it

1125
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:18,219
because my friend brought it to me and

1126
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:20,289
had it in his pocket I would say it's 90

1127
00:50:18,219 --> 00:50:23,108
micron but I'd have to ask them it

1128
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:25,719
definitely is between 73 and 120 seems

1129
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:29,018
like a 90 but Special K I haven't hit

1130
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:30,458
this cultivar in a long time yeah I just

1131
00:50:29,018 --> 00:50:32,108
figured that if if thought you can old

1132
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:35,228
it was making it he was gonna pull false

1133
00:50:32,108 --> 00:50:37,328
crack or something when that nature well

1134
00:50:35,228 --> 00:50:41,889
but my buddy's all about his bags as

1135
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:44,169
well so Special K that a good variety

1136
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:46,208
per breakfast are you talking about

1137
00:50:44,168 --> 00:50:48,038

1139
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:50,979
high integrity glasses art I think I

1140
00:50:49,778 --> 00:50:52,838
just chatted with him not that long ago

1141
00:50:50,978 --> 00:50:54,489
and he was telling me that Frenchy was

1142
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:56,318

1143
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:58,329

1149
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,090
bubble I know a few things about it

1150
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:09,890
myself I live right across the water but

1151
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:12,230
by all means fly people up from other

1152
00:51:09,889 --> 00:51:14,440
parts of the country I get where you're

1153
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:16,219
coming from

1154
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:21,559
what do you smoke

1155
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:25,489
oh yeah I guess I am busy though that's

1156
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:30,079
amazing rosin from God gas leak from

1157
00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:32,989
Southfork seeds it's amazing what's the

1158
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:35,389
flavor profile on that very gassy it's

1159
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:37,339
the gas leak so it's like a chem by cam

1160
00:51:35,389 --> 00:51:40,849
bite it's like bat crossed four times or

1161
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:43,250
something like that yes good I love gas

1162
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:45,759
tea I love the whole gamut I'm not gonna

1163
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:51,920
lie I love the fruitiness I love the

1164
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:53,900
exotic haziness I love the gas it's it's

1165
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,269
all good from where I sit I'll tell you

1166
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:59,420
I I look forward to a day where we can

1167
00:51:56,269 --> 00:52:02,389
pull up terpenes that are less known and

1168
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:04,849
pull those up into the into the more

1169
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:09,859
known you know producing you got there a

1170
00:52:04,849 --> 00:52:13,039
little ball - this is two and a half

1171
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:17,240
years old now from our farm from our

1172
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:19,309
land and we've been keeping it sealed

1173
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:22,219
and everything it's super squishy and

1174
00:52:19,309 --> 00:52:23,929
really nice outdoor resins from the land

1175
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:29,000
well it's been under ground on the other

1176
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:30,230
side of the border - that's the best you

1177
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,449
know what I grew stumped

1178
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:34,159
when I did go to the US I used to do

1179
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:36,919
that a lot

1180
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:41,569
it's the way to go yeah on both sides it

1181
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:43,159
was just always so like all right makes

1182
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:46,160
me feel really good about going over the

1183
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:47,899
border though but it is legal on either

1184
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:50,119
side of the border you know it's just at

1185
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:52,730
that exact line it's not legal but

1186
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:55,069
Washington it's mine BC it's fine it's

1187
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:56,329
interesting it definitely seems to me

1188
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:59,180
that they're gonna have to figure out

1189
00:52:56,329 --> 00:53:01,250
their whole zero tolerance thing when

1190
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:02,839
you know people are human and mistakes

1191
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:05,119
happen and especially when it comes to

1192
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,490
medications and pain management and all

1193
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:11,989
these other things it's I predict right

1194
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:14,269
now that Commerce and money will be more

1195
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:15,558
important and before Americans and

1196
00:53:14,269 --> 00:53:17,208
Canadians are allowed

1197
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:19,400
across the border if they're admitting

1198
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:22,938
cannabis users they're going to admit

1199
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:26,150
tons of cannabis between Canada and

1200
00:53:22,938 --> 00:53:29,420
America and legal will be legal

1201
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:31,130
recreational but if you're a smoker you

1202
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:34,130
still won't be able to go between the

1203
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:37,338
damn two countries so dumb

1204
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:39,318
is so dominant so true I agree there's

1205
00:53:37,338 --> 00:53:41,778
so many Canadians that can't go into

1206
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:43,429
America for that reason and Americans

1207
00:53:41,778 --> 00:53:45,978
that camp can't come into Canada but

1208
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:48,828
they can fly all over the world Mexico

1209
00:53:45,978 --> 00:53:52,429
Thailand doesn't matter you're anywhere

1210
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:53,439
I mean odds god damn US or Canada is

1211
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:56,028
just [ __ ]

1212
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:58,608
well Canada is the only country that

1213
00:53:56,028 --> 00:54:02,298
America shares it's a criminal database

1214
00:53:58,608 --> 00:54:07,880
with so they know everything about every

1215
00:54:02,298 --> 00:54:11,889
American when they look hmm passages for

1216
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:16,039
many years - they can look back like wow

1217
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:17,509
you gotta get that [ __ ] - yeah that'll

1218
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:18,829
be a nice day when we won't have to

1219
00:54:17,509 --> 00:54:20,420
worry about it anymore

1220
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:22,189
reciprocity is something that I'm

1221
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:24,289
looking forward to in all the different

1222
00:54:22,188 --> 00:54:26,568
cannabis friendly federally cannabis

1223
00:54:24,289 --> 00:54:28,609
friendly you know countries that have

1224
00:54:26,568 --> 00:54:30,288
federal programs they should have

1225
00:54:28,608 --> 00:54:31,699
reciprocity you should be able to fly

1226
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:35,449
from one of those countries to the other

1227
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:38,239
and have your medicine for commercial

1228
00:54:35,449 --> 00:54:40,999
purposes just like wine you should be

1229
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:44,838
able to buy cannabis you know in the

1230
00:54:40,998 --> 00:54:46,838
glass jars or however from anywhere in

1231
00:54:44,838 --> 00:54:50,328
the world there should be not only

1232
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:52,219
interstate business like in America but

1233
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:54,439
there should be intercontinental

1234
00:54:52,219 --> 00:54:59,208
business with cannabis it should be

1235
00:54:54,438 --> 00:55:02,899
allowed at the duty-free shop in the air

1236
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:07,129
I could buy Canadian whisky there why

1237
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:11,599
can't I buy cash well because one is a

1238
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:14,390
tear on the social fabric and one is a

1239
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,160
healer to the social fabric so I think

1240
00:55:14,389 --> 00:55:18,650
they're more into tearing it open than

1241
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:21,288
know you eight and see Marcus as soon as

1242
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:23,778
the government is making taxes and big

1243
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:26,209
business is allowed to sell it it'll be

1244
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:27,349
just another business well they're doing

1245
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:29,359
it here we they

1246
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:31,880
just announce the tax on medical

1247
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:34,960
cannabis will be $1 per gram which is

1248
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:38,210
you know it's like a that's pretty high

1249
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:43,880
for for medical they're pretty bummed

1250
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:46,159
out about it here but yeah I'm sure they

1251
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,990
were it said now that means an ounce of

1252
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:50,599
cannabis at ten dollars a gram will be

1253
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:58,129
three hundred and twenty-two dollars

1254
00:55:50,599 --> 00:56:00,139
Canadian oh wow email these guys maybe

1255
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:05,539
they're not investors they're out vest

1256
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:07,279
errs right out Fester's there you go

1257
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:10,309
it's kind of like the Rastafarian

1258
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,160
version of understand is over stand I

1259
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:18,469
always love that I used to understand

1260
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:20,059
but now I over stand yep that is the

1261
00:56:18,469 --> 00:56:24,500
perspective changer right there all

1262
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:27,230
right so I forgot about these two here

1263
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:32,690
another hash making couple from the US

1264
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:34,369
but I'm going to invite in to do and

1265
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:36,440
hopefully we can get to talking about

1266
00:56:34,369 --> 00:56:41,920
some hashish I mean let speak out on the

1267
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:41,920
ship I love it you want to hear about it

1268
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:48,680
people want to hear about it more

1269
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:50,239
importantly people want to smoke it man

1270
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:52,119
we have come a long way though I'll tell

1271
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:58,519
you what in the last twenty years has

1272
00:56:52,119 --> 00:57:00,469
come a long way incredible well we

1273
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:02,449
really enjoyed doing some dry sips the

1274
00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:04,429
other day when it was super super low

1275
00:57:02,449 --> 00:57:06,559
temperatures outside too and it's really

1276
00:57:04,429 --> 00:57:09,109
fun to just go out at night with a full

1277
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,210
moon with the snow outside everywhere

1278
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:15,079
and set up a little table and a little

1279
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:17,630
light get out the dry stuff material and

1280
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:19,369
just make it just do a quick little run

1281
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,930
so it's nice and pure and then bring it

1282
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:23,210
in and smoke it's been a lot of fun

1283
00:57:20,929 --> 00:57:25,569
lately it warmed up now but I hope it

1284
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:28,220
gets cold against it in countries like

1285
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:31,309
Afghanistan they wouldn't make cash

1286
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:34,549
sheesh from bulk their bulk grown

1287
00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:38,179
marijuana until there was snow on the

1288
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:40,130
ground it makes all the sense in the

1289
00:57:38,179 --> 00:57:41,059
world when you're connected to it you

1290
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,829
got other things

1291
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:44,509
to do in Afghanistan and the hills

1292
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:45,980
they're like trying to save their food

1293
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:47,990
and everything and that they can just

1294
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:49,099
wait on that until the snow comes and

1295
00:57:47,989 --> 00:57:49,759
they're like hey let's go back to the

1296
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:51,380
Hashi SHhhh

1297
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,410
and you can save tremendous amounts of

1298
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:56,869
money and on your ice - maybe I don't

1299
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:59,989
have bridges so it's way easier to wait

1300
00:57:56,869 --> 00:58:02,559
for the air to be the fridge then

1301
00:57:59,989 --> 00:58:05,119
anything else well this year I

1302
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,440
absolutely want to maybe you want to

1303
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,029
come up with a solvent as mind I don't

1304
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,909
know what your border scene is like but

1305
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:13,640
I want to sled into the backcountry and

1306
00:58:10,909 --> 00:58:17,329
I want to go to this like many thousands

1307
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:20,000
of year old ice cave electric blue ice

1308
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:22,489
walls like crazy [ __ ] bucket list

1309
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,070
place and make some dry sift and do a

1310
00:58:22,489 --> 00:58:26,539
run of bubble hash and just get in there

1311
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:28,580
and make hash and film the whole thing

1312
00:58:26,539 --> 00:58:30,500
bring the drone hook up with my buddy

1313
00:58:28,579 --> 00:58:35,420
who's got a plane like just make an

1314
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:40,579
absolute like [ __ ] killer video that

1315
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:42,170
could last could last the time in fact

1316
00:58:40,579 --> 00:58:44,480
I've seen ice cave that you're talking

1317
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:46,130
about that you have film or your photos

1318
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,869
of we're in that was the most

1319
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:49,340
unbelievable photo I've seen in a long

1320
00:58:47,869 --> 00:58:52,460
time it's been on my mind

1321
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:54,530
yeah it's they are absolutely

1322
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:57,199
spectacular and beautiful IIIi think I

1323
00:58:54,530 --> 00:59:01,280
showed them on on hash Church or one of

1324
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:05,029
my wake and bakes before it's a place to

1325
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:08,090
make would be second to none there would

1326
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:11,900
be no other place to make hash like this

1327
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:14,990
in my opinion and so let me just get a

1328
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:16,849
little little little little picture open

1329
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:22,449
to let everyone know where what we're

1330
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:25,750
talking about this one's kind of kind of

1331
00:59:22,449 --> 00:59:25,750
there we go

1332
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:31,039
kind of surreal this particular one it

1333
00:59:28,429 --> 00:59:32,989
doesn't even look real and this one I

1334
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:35,119
had to climb through a very tight hole

1335
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:39,579
barely a little bit bigger than the size

1336
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:43,250
of my body to get into this open area

1337
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:46,009
pretty epic little ice cave so when are

1338
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:48,320
we doing it well it's just a matter of

1339
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:51,650
enough snow falling and then and then

1340
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:53,980
going look at that ice dude you're dumb

1341
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:58,420
down this [ __ ]

1342
00:59:53,980 --> 01:00:00,579
that [ __ ] and and it's like super not

1343
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:02,170
easy to get there like the adventure

1344
01:00:00,579 --> 01:00:04,840
will be get there that's the [ __ ]

1345
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:08,019
hole we had to climb through to get into

1346
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:10,990
that other little little zone it was

1347
01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:13,030
it's it's so beautiful and then you're

1348
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:14,739
limited for your time everything is

1349
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:17,260
limited because you know as it gets

1350
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:19,539
darker you you can't be there because

1351
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:21,550
you know you'll perish if you try to

1352
01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:22,779
stay overnight unless you've built a

1353
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:25,990
little fire I guess but look at the

1354
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:27,910
walls that's is the cave the same every

1355
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:30,608
year or does it change from year to year

1356
01:00:27,909 --> 01:00:33,339
have you seen any changes month to month

1357
01:00:30,608 --> 01:00:35,049
dude this gives you an idea of the

1358
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:37,570
entrance of how big it is you know those

1359
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:40,570
are six foot tall dudes it's like a 30

1360
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:44,109
foot 40 foot tall it's like walking into

1361
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:46,600
a cathedral mine 3 of Star Wars

1362
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:48,219
you know honestly dude it does remind

1363
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:49,989
you Star Wars this is taken from the

1364
01:00:48,219 --> 01:00:53,019
back of the cave with the natural light

1365
01:00:49,989 --> 01:00:58,358
shining through the ice that ice is like

1366
01:00:53,019 --> 01:01:00,820
20 feet thick it's pretty awesome anyway

1367
01:00:58,358 --> 01:01:03,119
I'm not gonna show a gazillion more you

1368
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:05,530
guys get the idea this is what's coming

1369
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:08,619
we've talked I've been talking about it

1370
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:10,450
for quite a few years so I really have

1371
01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:11,858
to make it happen this year whoever

1372
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:15,669
wants to come you're gonna have to get a

1373
01:01:11,858 --> 01:01:18,039
sled if you're gonna use thousands of

1374
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:21,430
year old ice don't you need to use

1375
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:23,289
thousands of year old dressin well I was

1376
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:25,509
hoping Sam that you could send me like a

1377
01:01:23,289 --> 01:01:27,639
couple of kilos of like mummified like

1378
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:30,130
cannabis that was found in a grave

1379
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:32,710
somewhere in like well I do have some

1380
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:36,250
Egyptian stuff that I found in a pyramid

1381
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:37,960
I believe you do Sam put the oldest

1382
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:41,889
seeds I've ever held in my life like

1383
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,920
cannabis seeds that were like 2727 yes

1384
01:01:41,889 --> 01:01:49,059
correct

1385
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:51,760
2700 Hasmik Qasr ik tombs found by the

1386
01:01:49,059 --> 01:01:54,759
cynthia graves where the seeds were

1387
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:57,070
found in a little leather pouch inside

1388
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:00,060
the grave just walks up to me he's like

1389
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:03,070
hey check this out I'm like what is that

1390
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:04,269
so no one has ever grown those out have

1391
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:06,280
they or have they

1392
01:02:04,269 --> 01:02:07,389
oh no I've got them I grow them every

1393
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:11,440
year No

1394
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:18,250
silly there 2007 seven years old I know

1395
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:19,889
my god these maybe maybe at 2500 years

1396
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:23,170
you could have got it to pop but come on

1397
01:02:19,889 --> 01:02:25,029
2700 years I was impressed when my 20

1398
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:27,849
year old seed from Jamaica popped I was

1399
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:30,100
doing backflips 2700 years old that's

1400
01:02:27,849 --> 01:02:32,500
like there's got to be some machines

1401
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:36,369
that can extract DNA and even see if

1402
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:40,000
it's maybe maybe it was frozen that

1403
01:02:36,369 --> 01:02:41,799
entire time right it might be good but I

1404
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,360
I wouldn't count on it

1405
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,530
but that must be out there somewhere in

1406
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,660
the world there must be some like

1407
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:50,769
thousand-year-old cannabis seeds that

1408
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:53,230
are frozen in ice somewhere yeah but for

1409
01:02:50,769 --> 01:02:55,869
several thousand years to have never

1410
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:57,880
thought out that's a bit tougher but

1411
01:02:55,869 --> 01:02:59,819
yeah maybe if it's down in the

1412
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:02,500
permafrost yeah it could be

1413
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:05,170
they're probably gonna find a dude on a

1414
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:07,989
mammoth up in the Arctic who like has a

1415
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:09,550
bag of weed seeds on him fully preserved

1416
01:03:07,989 --> 01:03:11,169
and they're gonna be like whoa this is

1417
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:13,600
the guy who is like trying to save

1418
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:16,090
cannabis for all of existence and we

1419
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:19,360
save cannabis and he was what killing

1420
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:21,490
off the mammoths now he's riding the man

1421
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,590
misusing those suckers he was like one

1422
01:03:21,489 --> 01:03:24,009
with the mammoths that one with the

1423
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:25,539
mammoth

1424
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:28,480
you know I imagine those things were

1425
01:03:25,539 --> 01:03:31,389
pretty [ __ ] wild even elephants like

1426
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:33,340
nothing really Fox with elephants I

1427
01:03:31,389 --> 01:03:35,679
remember the first time I landed in New

1428
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:37,059
Delhi India which if you guys have seen

1429
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,949
what's going on there right now man

1430
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:41,199
that's crazy the [ __ ] smog in that

1431
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:44,469
city right now is equivalent to 50

1432
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:46,659
cigarettes a day which is from all these

1433
01:03:44,469 --> 01:03:48,549
like different festivals that happen so

1434
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:50,259
fireworks that got blown off and then

1435
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:52,960
pollution from different plants they're

1436
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:55,090
all just went it's like yellow air super

1437
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,760
nasty but the first time I ever landed

1438
01:03:55,090 --> 01:04:00,070
there I got out of the airport and flew

1439
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,570
into Calcutta then flew to Delhi got out

1440
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:03,190
of the airport in Delhi jumped in a cab

1441
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:06,370
and didn't even get out of the airport

1442
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:07,960
and there was an elephant walking on the

1443
01:04:06,369 --> 01:04:09,460
street and I was kind of like oh that's

1444
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:11,139
cool you know India I guess there's

1445
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:13,869
elephants on the streets or whatever but

1446
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:16,059
this one was actually a wild elephant

1447
01:04:13,869 --> 01:04:18,730
and it wasn't like being you know

1448
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:20,289
attempted to being controlled by a human

1449
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:22,360
it was just a wild elephant that it

1450
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:24,039
come out of the jungle and was walking

1451
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:27,010
in the city which I guess is a little

1452
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:29,650
more rare and man were people giving

1453
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:33,400
this [ __ ] thing it's you know

1454
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:35,889
distance like those things can yes

1455
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,570
they're super big I grew up in Honolulu

1456
01:04:35,889 --> 01:04:41,469
Hawaii and we had that elephant escape

1457
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:43,269
from the circus and go on a rampage its

1458
01:04:41,469 --> 01:04:44,889
trainer and got out and started running

1459
01:04:43,269 --> 01:04:48,639
down the street they had to gun it down

1460
01:04:44,889 --> 01:04:50,710
unfortunately but just went psycho well

1461
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:52,869
no [ __ ] the education of elephant it's

1462
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:57,579
like that's like kg and elephants come

1463
01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:59,799
on yeah no it's not good the caged bird

1464
01:04:57,579 --> 01:05:01,230
oh you can fly I'm gonna put you in a

1465
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:05,110
cage how do you think of them apples

1466
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:08,019
when I was living in South India in

1467
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:11,620
Kerala up in the mountains there they

1468
01:05:08,019 --> 01:05:16,239
still catch wild elephants like up by

1469
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:18,730
Lake paddy are and you they would get a

1470
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:21,009
couple of well trained elephants two or

1471
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:26,740
three of them and then they would catch

1472
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:30,310
a wild elephant and the bigger tamed

1473
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:32,379
elephants would force them into an area

1474
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:36,269
where they would eventually calm them

1475
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,269
down and make them working elephants

1476
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:42,750
yeah that's crazy

1477
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:45,849
so is it true that I heard that with

1478
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:47,920
bubble hasher there was a story old

1479
01:05:45,849 --> 01:05:52,569
story of monks being up in the mountains

1480
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:56,110
of the Himalayas that would wash ganja

1481
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:57,340
in the rivers with silks has anyone ever

1482
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:59,920
heard this story

1483
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:02,650
no I I've never heard that ever and I'd

1484
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:06,519
be surprised if it's true but they did

1485
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:09,160
wash ganja just because ganja used to be

1486
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:12,210
kind of dirty and they would wash it and

1487
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:14,799
then smoke it afterwards they said it

1488
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:17,860
made it cooler too and easier on the

1489
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:21,070
throat and also they weren't washing

1490
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:22,769
away any of the things that were good

1491
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:26,940
they were just washing away

1492
01:06:22,769 --> 01:06:30,610
water-soluble dirt dust and debris yes

1493
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:32,860
I've seen them do it many times yeah you

1494
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:33,608
know I looked pretty hard into the water

1495
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,700
hash

1496
01:06:33,608 --> 01:06:39,130
history mainly because I was involved in

1497
01:06:36,699 --> 01:06:42,608
litigation with a gentleman who has a

1498
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:45,278
patent for water extraction Reinhart

1499
01:06:42,608 --> 01:06:49,028
belt and so Reinhart Delft built this

1500
01:06:45,278 --> 01:06:51,039
machine I guess in this 90s late 90s

1501
01:06:49,028 --> 01:06:53,980
middle you know maybe he built it in 96

1502
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:56,859
or 97 I think the first year he showed

1503
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:59,349
up at the Cannabis Cup was in 97 he had

1504
01:06:56,858 --> 01:07:01,119
the machine he showed it to Mila Mila

1505
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:03,309
had a couple of friends over one of

1506
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,588
which is Mark Rose my manufacturer the

1507
01:07:03,309 --> 01:07:07,989
other which was Eldon a longtime friend

1508
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:09,998
of Mark and our big hashish aficionado

1509
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:13,329
he used to live in Kathmandu with Mark

1510
01:07:09,998 --> 01:07:15,548
and so Eldon was staring at this machine

1511
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:17,019
the ice-cold extractor which is

1512
01:07:15,548 --> 01:07:19,389
Rinehart's machine that he has the

1513
01:07:17,018 --> 01:07:21,368
patent on and it's it's a single screen

1514
01:07:19,389 --> 01:07:23,379
it's a mixer that kind of goes down into

1515
01:07:21,369 --> 01:07:24,818
a funnel and you can collect the resin

1516
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:27,759
it's it's kind of unique in a sense

1517
01:07:24,818 --> 01:07:31,659
because Reinhardt Reinhardt isn't trying

1518
01:07:27,759 --> 01:07:34,960
to collect you know all the different

1519
01:07:31,659 --> 01:07:37,778
micron sizes his mentality was let's do

1520
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:40,358
a light mixture and allow the most

1521
01:07:37,778 --> 01:07:42,880
mature heads to fall the most readily

1522
01:07:40,358 --> 01:07:45,460
available ones the ones that are just

1523
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,259
ready to snap with the lightest little

1524
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:49,989
mixture and then I'll collect all of

1525
01:07:47,259 --> 01:07:52,028
those on a single screen and so it's

1526
01:07:49,989 --> 01:07:54,130
it's it's definitely a unique way of

1527
01:07:52,028 --> 01:07:55,690
doing it I see that it has its place I

1528
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:57,640
came from a different place where it's

1529
01:07:55,690 --> 01:08:00,009
like let's deconstruct this we can

1530
01:07:57,639 --> 01:08:01,808
always reconstruct it or reconstruct it

1531
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:04,389
in any way that we choose so it seemed

1532
01:08:01,809 --> 01:08:05,589
like the better of both worlds obviously

1533
01:08:04,389 --> 01:08:07,690
if you're collecting everything on one

1534
01:08:05,588 --> 01:08:09,818
screen you're gonna have a very hard

1535
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:11,980
time ever trying to separate that

1536
01:08:09,818 --> 01:08:13,869
afterwards to experience it under the

1537
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:16,060
different micron diameters which

1538
01:08:13,869 --> 01:08:18,190
seemingly for anyone that's smoked

1539
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:20,859
enough of it does produce different

1540
01:08:18,189 --> 01:08:23,229
profiles 45 micron is a very unique

1541
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:25,929
profile that almost all cultivars

1542
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:29,198
produce this oily you know large

1543
01:08:25,929 --> 01:08:31,420
yielding just kind of unique different

1544
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:33,638
resonance to me it's because of the size

1545
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:35,920
of the head so Reinhard had this machine

1546
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:38,850
Eldon was looking at it on the couch at

1547
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:41,920
Mila's and he said two five gallon sized

1548
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:43,569
nylon bags with screen bottoms in a

1549
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,328
five-gallon bucket and you've got the

1550
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:49,420
same thing and so right then and

1551
01:08:46,328 --> 01:08:51,158
the isolator bags were born mark Rose

1552
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:52,719
was the manufacturer for those bags out

1553
01:08:51,158 --> 01:08:55,328
of Katmandu and he also named the

1554
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:57,009
product isolator by looking at if you

1555
01:08:55,328 --> 01:08:58,420
know how his brain works he was looking

1556
01:08:57,009 --> 01:09:00,460
at it and he was like he's using the ice

1557
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:04,719
he's isolating the glans it's the I

1558
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:06,880
stole later and Mila was going to sell

1559
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:09,520
them so she became the isolator lady she

1560
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:12,279
sold the bags that was in 98 she sold

1561
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,900
her first bags I less than a year after

1562
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:15,699
seeing that machine as the cannabis cup

1563
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:17,048
of course is always in November third

1564
01:09:15,698 --> 01:09:19,928
week in November American Thanksgiving

1565
01:09:17,048 --> 01:09:23,380
you forgot to mention that the machine

1566
01:09:19,929 --> 01:09:24,699
was rather large and expensive yeah it

1567
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:26,618
was like a thousand bucks for the

1568
01:09:24,698 --> 01:09:28,988
machine and it was it was absolutely

1569
01:09:26,618 --> 01:09:30,729
rather large there was just that Mila

1570
01:09:28,988 --> 01:09:32,828
and Reinhardt had sort of signed a

1571
01:09:30,729 --> 01:09:35,798
contract in order for him to show the

1572
01:09:32,828 --> 01:09:37,328
machine in the first place and so that

1573
01:09:35,798 --> 01:09:40,179
they all ended up starting their own

1574
01:09:37,328 --> 01:09:41,649
company Elden got screwed out of

1575
01:09:40,179 --> 01:09:43,809
everything and never got paid a penny

1576
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:45,848
which is why I used to give him his

1577
01:09:43,809 --> 01:09:47,048
ticket to the legends of hashish Sam I'm

1578
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:48,789
not sure if he knew that but I would

1579
01:09:47,048 --> 01:09:51,698
always buy Eldon's ticket for the

1580
01:09:48,789 --> 01:09:52,960
legends just cuz I felt like jeez think

1581
01:09:51,698 --> 01:09:56,259
I didn't even get anything out of it no

1582
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,969
problem I've known him since 1965 I knew

1583
01:09:56,260 --> 01:10:00,010
you knew Eldon for a long time probably

1584
01:09:57,969 --> 01:10:02,590
not much longer than I think mark met

1585
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:04,000
him in like 72 or 73 or something so

1586
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:05,770
yeah you guys have known each other the

1587
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,750
longest I guess he's passed away since

1588
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:10,840
our IP if everyone wants to maybe have a

1589
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:13,448
puff for a hashish aficionado Eldon that

1590
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:17,139
would be nice so the bags thought

1591
01:10:13,448 --> 01:10:21,519
created I came in literally less than a

1592
01:10:17,139 --> 01:10:22,960
year later and tried to sell isolator

1593
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,699
bags out of Canada because I had just

1594
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,649
been busted with 16 and a half pounds at

1595
01:10:24,698 --> 01:10:28,569
a roadblock it was kind of like oh [ __ ]

1596
01:10:26,649 --> 01:10:30,219
I don't think I can really flip pounds

1597
01:10:28,569 --> 01:10:32,289
of weed anymore I'm like thanks cor

1598
01:10:30,219 --> 01:10:34,149
nobody wants to work with me I got to do

1599
01:10:32,289 --> 01:10:35,828
something else my wife's like can you do

1600
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:38,408
something that potentially won't get us

1601
01:10:35,828 --> 01:10:38,889
arrested and thrown in jail I was like

1602
01:10:38,408 --> 01:10:40,929
yes

1603
01:10:38,889 --> 01:10:43,359
I can do that so I went to Amsterdam to

1604
01:10:40,929 --> 01:10:45,219
talk to Mila not really knowing who Mark

1605
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:48,609
Rose was not really knowing who Eldon

1606
01:10:45,219 --> 01:10:51,639
was at the time and ended up not having

1607
01:10:48,609 --> 01:10:53,139
the best experience not getting sort of

1608
01:10:51,639 --> 01:10:55,449
what I wanted and coming home and

1609
01:10:53,139 --> 01:10:56,949
started my own my own water extraction

1610
01:10:55,448 --> 01:10:59,479
company and that's really thanks to my

1611
01:10:56,948 --> 01:11:02,509
wife saying she needs so the first bags

1612
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:05,929
that's how bubble bags came to be in

1613
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:09,860
March of 1999 we went public and started

1614
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:12,260
posting where is that first bag in my

1615
01:11:09,859 --> 01:11:15,799
garage you still have it

1616
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:18,170
yeah oh you want it no I just think it's

1617
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:20,449
cool we should keep it in a museum you

1618
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:23,359
should have your first bag that your

1619
01:11:20,449 --> 01:11:25,250
wife and so I absolutely do and it's

1620
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:27,199
very cool and it's very hilarious to

1621
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:30,380
look at them I'm like whoa I started a

1622
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:32,260
company with these and you know it was

1623
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:36,020
funny because it's all how karma works

1624
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:38,449
you know because I guess Mia and Mark

1625
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:40,070
just you know mark was making bags for

1626
01:11:38,449 --> 01:11:41,720
Milla but Milla was like oh he's

1627
01:11:40,069 --> 01:11:43,219
charging too much so I guess she ended

1628
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:46,070
up going and getting some other bags

1629
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:48,260
made in Turkey and Mark found out about

1630
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:51,829
it and so mark was upset this was maybe

1631
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:54,230
in 2000 2001 so just two or three years

1632
01:11:51,829 --> 01:11:55,939
into they both got two pounds that's

1633
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:58,069
about when we got our first bags but

1634
01:11:55,939 --> 01:12:01,039
keep going right well right around then

1635
01:11:58,069 --> 01:12:03,649
is when Mark rose hit me up because he

1636
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:05,779
saw me doing what I was doing and it was

1637
01:12:03,649 --> 01:12:07,789
more along in lines with what he wanted

1638
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:10,130
in the way of promote he was like man

1639
01:12:07,789 --> 01:12:11,600
meal is not really promoting it the same

1640
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:13,279
way you're like passionate about this

1641
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,260
you actually smoked it not mixed with

1642
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:17,149
tobacco which is also very different you

1643
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:19,880
know hard to promote something in North

1644
01:12:17,149 --> 01:12:22,219
America the way I did if all you smoke

1645
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,500
is hashed with tobacco and that's in no

1646
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:26,720
way am I putting Milla down she's done

1647
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,909
her own work and she you know she she

1648
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:31,159
was a very important piece in the latter

1649
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:34,880
of all of this and I don't put anyone

1650
01:12:31,159 --> 01:12:36,680
down in that sense and it was just all

1651
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,150
the way karma worked out that Mark Rose

1652
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,680
would get in touch with me because he

1653
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:42,500
didn't feel the business he was doing

1654
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:45,020
was was good and we ended it we've been

1655
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:46,789
in business together for for 15 years

1656
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:50,180
like he's been the manufacturer of

1657
01:12:46,789 --> 01:12:52,340
bubble bags for 15 years and then I

1658
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:55,820
never called the mark I was called good

1659
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:58,100
never mark yeah of course because he is

1660
01:12:55,819 --> 01:12:59,869
metal mark he makes all his own clothes

1661
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:01,640
out of stinging nettle they're all

1662
01:12:59,869 --> 01:13:03,229
handmade clothes and the clothes are

1663
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:05,329
like you know you got to hike into the

1664
01:13:03,229 --> 01:13:07,459
jungle for three days to find this [ __ ]

1665
01:13:05,329 --> 01:13:10,789
and then you gotta like cut it down

1666
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:12,199
pound it on a big smooth stone in front

1667
01:13:10,789 --> 01:13:14,569
of a

1668
01:13:12,199 --> 01:13:16,550
ever get it on to an 8-foot backstrap

1669
01:13:14,569 --> 01:13:20,210
loom fiber eyes it like these

1670
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:23,329
[ __ ] were doing this [ __ ] were

1671
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:27,340
made in Asia and many other places you

1672
01:13:23,329 --> 01:13:29,750
know blacks Neverland hemp are three

1673
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:32,270
textiles that are really really similar

1674
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:36,619
to each other well now when when there

1675
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:38,000
were leading and cedar marking what I

1676
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:39,949
was gonna say about Neville is that

1677
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,329
there's no plowing there's no planting

1678
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:43,519
there's no irrigation

1679
01:13:41,329 --> 01:13:44,960
it's jungle it grows live and it's just

1680
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,110
it's in the jungle in it there's also

1681
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:53,140
there's also no resin is what I used to

1682
01:13:48,109 --> 01:13:55,699
give him that's awesome

1683
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:57,680
it's awesome because metal metal is

1684
01:13:55,699 --> 01:13:59,539
actually a master plant in a really

1685
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:02,210
similar way that cannabis those we

1686
01:13:59,539 --> 01:14:05,029
understand I understand that alive used

1687
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:10,819
it for a very very long time but it

1688
01:14:05,029 --> 01:14:14,509
ain't cannabis no it feeds cannabis it

1689
01:14:10,819 --> 01:14:17,599
grows really nice can fermentations from

1690
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:19,480
it help oh I would agree with that

1691
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,250
[Music]

1692
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:23,469
biodynamic users have used nettles for a

1693
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:26,329
very long time

1694
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:29,210
the very first outdoor patches we grew

1695
01:14:26,329 --> 01:14:30,769
up in BC way a long time ago back in the

1696
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:32,899
times that you're talking about Marcus

1697
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:34,760
we're all done in nettle patches with

1698
01:14:32,899 --> 01:14:38,420
nothing else but nettles and it was

1699
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:40,489
beautiful you know often times nine days

1700
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:42,350
to try to find our nettle patches it

1701
01:14:40,489 --> 01:14:45,679
wasn't like we were the south west

1702
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:47,720
facing metal slide avalanche shoot with

1703
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49,700
gravity-fed water that was our big

1704
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:53,030
because the nettles always had the good

1705
01:14:49,699 --> 01:14:54,529
soil mmm nettles make good soil you find

1706
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:58,039
nettles there's good soil underneath

1707
01:14:54,529 --> 01:15:02,449
there yeah mmm imagine like 20 foot tall

1708
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:04,310
ones we've I only said I think the long

1709
01:15:02,449 --> 01:15:07,130
longest one I found was 11 feet at

1710
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:08,570
Oregon Country Fair which is pretty good

1711
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:12,590
oh yeah absolutely

1712
01:15:08,569 --> 01:15:15,590
Katmandu though ones you know hey give

1713
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:17,270
it up for Mandel and I it's quite a bit

1714
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:19,579
different species too because when we

1715
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:20,840
were up in the Himalayas days are

1716
01:15:19,579 --> 01:15:22,960
different yeah they're a little bit

1717
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:25,239
different a little bit more fibrous and

1718
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,529
gorgeous and they don't spike here and

1719
01:15:25,239 --> 01:15:28,719
they don't hurt as much the stinging

1720
01:15:26,529 --> 01:15:31,449
nettle isn't as quick to sting you is

1721
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:33,850
what we noticed I used to Cellmark roses

1722
01:15:31,449 --> 01:15:35,619
stinging nettle clothes at my gallery at

1723
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:38,289
the melting point they were the wildest

1724

1748
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:46,510

already like you're not just you asking

1750
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:52,119
me when I do to like prep yeah well I

1751
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:54,039
mean after I take it out of the freeze

1752
01:16:52,119 --> 01:16:56,079
dryer I'm left with this [ __ ] powder

1753
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:58,269
that's like uncontrollable

1754
01:16:56,079 --> 01:17:00,880
it's like anthrax wants to fly in the

1755
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:04,030
air even if it's greasy so what I do is

1756
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,739
I use my t-shirt press I set it like 120

1757
01:17:04,029 --> 01:17:07,989
degrees and I put a piece of parchment

1758
01:17:05,739 --> 01:17:10,210
on it then I fold like hot dog style and

1759
01:17:07,989 --> 01:17:12,219
half and then what I'll do is I'll take

1760
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:14,260
the stuff out of the jar and I'll pour

1761
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:15,789
it on that piece of paper and then I'll

1762
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:18,190
fold the piece of paper over and I'll

1763
01:17:15,789 --> 01:17:19,989
press it all down so everything gets

1764
01:17:18,189 --> 01:17:22,210
crushed down and then it becomes this

1765
01:17:19,989 --> 01:17:23,949
big French and cannoli you know it

1766
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:26,350
becomes friends you can only hash big

1767
01:17:23,949 --> 01:17:28,599
[ __ ] that looks full spec and

1768
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:31,390
flattened out without using a bottle and

1769
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,320
Turkey bags or whatever yeah but it's

1770
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:34,119
the same concept

1771
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:35,859
so I flatten it out like that and then

1772
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:36,460
I'm able to take it with my gloves and

1773
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:39,909
just

1774
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:42,010
into 30 gram or 1 ounce you know pieces

1775
01:17:39,909 --> 01:17:43,689
and then we just pretty much make it the

1776
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:45,670
size for the bag and we put it into the

1777
01:17:43,689 --> 01:17:48,579
bags and works really easy that way I

1778
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:50,770
mean you can pour powder but like I said

1779
01:17:48,579 --> 01:17:54,069
it's gonna [ __ ] be everywhere so we

1780
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:55,930
decided to stop or powder and is that a

1781
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:58,059
lower star rating that you're pressing

1782
01:17:55,930 --> 01:18:00,850
it like are you do you you you obviously

1783
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:05,890
grow make hash that's like six star that

1784
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:08,680
you just don't press o you're muted

1785
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:10,630
again okay there we go

1786
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,800
so this right here is the quality that's

1787
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:16,390
in the bags right now

1788
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:18,610
don't 159 273 mm-hmm so I mean it's it's

1789
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:20,020
not like six star but I would say it's

1790
01:18:18,609 --> 01:18:22,659
close to like four and a half almost

1791
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:24,310
five star like up there because I mean

1792
01:18:22,659 --> 01:18:26,800
the grower crushed it

1793
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:29,680
let washes came out [ __ ] [ __ ]

1794
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,420
melty just unbelievable nice so you

1795
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,950
don't press it all in the rosin then oh

1796
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:36,730
absolutely not

1797
01:18:32,949 --> 01:18:38,710
all the melts are are still melts I kind

1798
01:18:36,729 --> 01:18:40,269
of want to tell the younger generation

1799
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:42,000
that's up and coming that's all these

1800
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:46,840
guys impressive some hashing right now

1801
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:50,020
that rosin is amazing but I don't know

1802
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:52,449
if it's the reason you would grow I

1803
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:53,830
think you want to grow for the best

1804
01:18:52,449 --> 01:18:55,599
resin that you can get whether you're

1805
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:56,979
sifting it or whatever you're doing with

1806
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,840
it you just want it to be the best

1807
01:18:56,979 --> 01:19:00,579
quality resin that you can get and I see

1808
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,539
a lot clearer what he was showing is

1809
01:19:00,579 --> 01:19:05,969
that dry scepters that Watership

1810
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:09,250
material that's been made into rosin

1811
01:19:05,969 --> 01:19:11,079
water that's water it's not rosin though

1812
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:13,529
this is literally just I press this out

1813
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:16,869
to to dab it you know what I mean just

1814
01:19:13,529 --> 01:19:19,000
kind of see where it laid on my nail you

1815
01:19:16,869 --> 01:19:21,219
know they leave a lot of char then it

1816
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,140
melts away nice you know like I judge

1817
01:19:21,219 --> 01:19:25,270
everything based off the sharp leads

1818
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:26,650
behind but it doesn't necessarily mean

1819
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:28,420
it's the best hatch is because it

1820
01:19:26,649 --> 01:19:30,009
doesn't leave any char behind I did

1821
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:32,170
stuff that leaves nothing on my nail but

1822
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:35,140
barely gets me high so I don't know what

1823
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:37,119
I would consider the best hash right

1824
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:39,760
what you like the best

1825
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:41,619
after you've smoked it yeah you know

1826
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,000
what I that's why I came up with a

1827
01:19:41,619 --> 01:19:44,829
method for the legends and I

1828
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,180
unfortunately wasn't really able to be

1829
01:19:44,829 --> 01:19:49,489
there to kind of overlook it but I

1830
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:51,970
to do this if we throw legends of hash

1831
01:19:49,489 --> 01:19:55,789
in Barcelona this year or next year Sam

1832
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:57,140
which is which which is what Mark Rose

1833
01:19:55,789 --> 01:19:59,149
used to tell me about that they would do

1834
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:01,070
in Katmandu during shivaratri that all

1835
01:19:59,149 --> 01:20:02,779
these Baba's Saudis would walk from all

1836
01:20:01,069 --> 01:20:04,670
over India and Kathmandu and they'd all

1837
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:06,920
link up and meet in this little spot and

1838
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:08,960
they don't put like their hash that they

1839
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,250
had out on little plates and they

1840
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,140
weren't like putting their names on it

1841
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:15,199
or anything their egos aren't trapped in

1842
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:17,210
all of that sort of attachment but you

1843
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:19,819
know the best hash was just the one that

1844
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:21,529
got smoked first it was like obviously

1845
01:20:19,819 --> 01:20:24,049
the best because it's the one everyone

1846
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:25,369
smoked it's like it's the simplest you

1847
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:27,289
know if you want to make a little bit of

1848
01:20:25,369 --> 01:20:29,180
a kind of contest out of it which I

1849
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:32,149
don't necessarily want to but if people

1850
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:33,710
want to that to me is really a pretty

1851
01:20:32,149 --> 01:20:36,679
legitimate you know People's Choice

1852
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:39,380
Award where it's like look it's it was

1853
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:41,869
the one that got smoked the first the

1854
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:43,609
one that everyone's I got it attracted

1855
01:20:41,869 --> 01:20:47,029
to the one that this the nose and

1856
01:20:43,609 --> 01:20:48,920
everything was on point I'm sure that at

1857
01:20:47,029 --> 01:20:50,359
a legends though it might get a little

1858
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,039
bit harder in the last couple of years

1859
01:20:50,359 --> 01:20:55,569
some really nice things started showing

1860
01:20:52,039 --> 01:20:58,189
up for legends really nice things

1861
01:20:55,569 --> 01:21:00,799
someone to ask you um what do you think

1862
01:20:58,189 --> 01:21:04,369
of what French you can only says fresh

1863
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:06,980
never frozen like he's saying not to

1864
01:21:04,369 --> 01:21:08,869
freeze any of your material that you

1865
01:21:06,979 --> 01:21:11,149
should be running it fresh in the field

1866
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:11,809
- fresh from the garden and not freezing

1867
01:21:11,149 --> 01:21:14,210
it at all

1868
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:16,340
well I mean it's his opinion I think

1869
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:18,470
that it's a legitimate opinion in the

1870
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:20,210
sense but what is the mentality behind

1871
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:21,829
it is he saying that people who are

1872
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:24,189
freezing it or doing it wrong because

1873
01:21:21,829 --> 01:21:27,470
then that would be more than an opinion

1874
01:21:24,189 --> 01:21:30,319
you know cuz to me I've run fresh I've

1875
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:34,510
run fresh shows I really respect Frankie

1876
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:38,329
that said he's also of the opinion that

1877
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:42,770
pressed resin is better than unpressed

1878
01:21:38,329 --> 01:21:45,769
resin and I have never seen that I've

1879
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:48,050
seen it changes so that you might like

1880
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:50,450
those changes for taste and other

1881
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:53,119
characteristics better but does it

1882
01:21:50,449 --> 01:21:56,329
scientifically make it superior or

1883
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:57,829
better I've never seen that mmm yeah if

1884
01:21:56,329 --> 01:22:00,869
also that's kind of one of the main

1885
01:21:57,829 --> 01:22:03,210
things that that I've been in this

1886
01:22:00,869 --> 01:22:06,000
with just from what I've seen myself not

1887
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:08,640
I've never really noticed resin becoming

1888
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,250
he's obviously a serious and

1889
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:14,280
knowledgeable lover a present

1890
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:17,069
yeah hash aficionado for certain he's

1891
01:22:14,279 --> 01:22:19,590
he's inside he's on the team I was just

1892
01:22:17,069 --> 01:22:21,359
wondering because I've seen a post that

1893
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:23,489
he made and I kind of got into a

1894
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:26,189
conversation with him because I've tried

1895
01:22:23,489 --> 01:22:26,849
the whole fresh not frozen and it was a

1896
01:22:26,189 --> 01:22:29,189
mess

1897
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:31,860
it was sticky [ __ ] everywhere look I I

1898
01:22:29,189 --> 01:22:33,719
don't know I just like the heads weren't

1899
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:36,210
even heads they were literally just like

1900
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:37,980
grease so it was like trying to scrape

1901
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:40,409
oil out of my bags and I just thought

1902
01:22:37,979 --> 01:22:42,389
that like that's not the way to go but

1903
01:22:40,409 --> 01:22:43,800
then he made a post and it was pretty

1904
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:45,210
much saying you know everybody that's

1905
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,460
freezing their material they're not

1906
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:49,230
doing it right because if you freeze

1907
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:50,939
your material it does this to the cell

1908
01:22:49,229 --> 01:22:53,429
walls of the plant and this and that and

1909
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:56,099
it releases chlorophyll and that's why

1910
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:57,300
everything gets green I don't think if

1911
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,650
that's true though because I've watched

1912
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:01,199
the whole plant fresh frozen all the

1913
01:22:58,649 --> 01:23:03,329
time and I don't see any green and then

1914
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:04,979
I watched some stuff and I'm gonna get

1915
01:23:03,329 --> 01:23:07,019
green and I noticed it's when I'm using

1916
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:09,719
less ice if I don't have enough ice in

1917
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:14,480
the mix [ __ ] will get green yeah mmm

1918
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:16,980
interesting yeah I've never really

1919
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:18,829
thought that it's better to do one or

1920
01:23:16,979 --> 01:23:23,969
the other it's for me as I get older

1921
01:23:18,829 --> 01:23:26,039
it's all about a quiver you know it's

1922
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:28,350
all about having more options than less

1923
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:30,869
and and it's definitely not all about

1924
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:33,450
telling people that you're all doing it

1925
01:23:30,869 --> 01:23:35,640
wrong and I'm doing it right because

1926
01:23:33,449 --> 01:23:37,529
that's just a sort of a dangerous

1927
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:39,180
position to get into it's good to

1928
01:23:37,529 --> 01:23:41,219
believe in your methods and it's good to

1929
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:43,050
have that confidence but I think it's

1930
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:45,720
also good to have that humility and that

1931
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:48,329
humbleness that says well you know what

1932
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:51,030
like this is what I like this is

1933
01:23:48,329 --> 01:23:53,489
attached to my opinion not like I'm not

1934
01:23:51,029 --> 01:23:56,579
a scientific expert that has irrefutable

1935
01:23:53,489 --> 01:23:58,800
proof it's just my opinion and so

1936
01:23:56,579 --> 01:24:00,539
sometimes our opinions get the best of

1937
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:03,090
us and I know when I first came out I

1938
01:24:00,539 --> 01:24:04,859
was a lot more strong-minded and moral

1939
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:07,650
more along the lines of telling people

1940
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:09,689
that very same thing whereas now it's

1941
01:24:07,649 --> 01:24:11,579
like oh you know what make your own

1942
01:24:09,689 --> 01:24:12,769
mistakes maybe you'll discover something

1943
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:14,659
new I

1944
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:17,600
definitely don't know everything and I'm

1945
01:24:14,659 --> 01:24:19,309
learning everyday as well and when we

1946
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,050
separate the people on the same team

1947
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:22,880
then we're just not as powerful as a

1948
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:24,800
community and right now we really need

1949
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,050
to come together as a community and like

1950
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:30,320
pure medicine and that we see this as

1951
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:31,880
something that can heal the world big

1952
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:34,099
that's one of our biggest missions in

1953
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:35,690
life is how to grow the best resident I

1954
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:37,700
mean we should definitely be talking all

1955
01:24:35,689 --> 01:24:39,979
there is about you know extracting it

1956
01:24:37,699 --> 01:24:42,289
but without being able to grow the right

1957
01:24:39,979 --> 01:24:44,689
resident exactly how to do that you know

1958
01:24:42,289 --> 01:24:47,659
it's a the most important part of the

1959
01:24:44,689 --> 01:24:51,819
puzzle really oh yeah I myself

1960
01:24:47,659 --> 01:24:55,340
personally I love older more mature

1961
01:24:51,819 --> 01:24:58,639
plant resin in other words a little bit

1962
01:24:55,340 --> 01:25:01,400
past one you might pick it for four

1963
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:05,240
smells and flavors because I'm picking

1964
01:25:01,399 --> 01:25:08,420
up a resin and so I want it as big and

1965
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:17,479
mature as possible I also like it very

1966
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:21,829
fresh in other words a little bit also a

1967
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:24,589
little bit drier than many people I like

1968
01:25:21,829 --> 01:25:27,590
it dried for two weeks and then appeared

1969
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:31,010
for a couple of months then the resin is

1970
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:36,470
easily to work with unless it's super

1971
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:38,659
super super gooey resin but III like to

1972
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:43,630
work with dry set that's easy to work

1973
01:25:38,659 --> 01:25:47,029
with and I also when when I made resin I

1974
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:49,369
separated it I did it in a freezer even

1975
01:25:47,029 --> 01:25:53,569
after the material had been dried for

1976
01:25:49,369 --> 01:25:55,760
two weeks and also cured for several

1977
01:25:53,569 --> 01:25:57,559
months yeah that's why we have a walk-in

1978
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,840
freezer for the bubble man brand

1979
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:01,789
although toni was starting to do the

1980
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,489
washing in the freezer I told him dude

1981
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:07,100
that's completely unnecessary the bags

1982
01:26:04,489 --> 01:26:08,899
themselves will be cold enough it's just

1983
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:12,620
for working with the resin the walk-in

1984
01:26:08,899 --> 01:26:15,739
freezer is a real just joy it was really

1985
01:26:12,619 --> 01:26:18,319
primarily to prevent smearing of the

1986
01:26:15,739 --> 01:26:22,369
resin to try to keep it as intact as

1987
01:26:18,319 --> 01:26:25,659
possible yeah which lasts right up until

1988
01:26:22,369 --> 01:26:25,659
you put it in your little container

1989
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:29,590
yeah I feel like a lot of people these

1990
01:26:28,119 --> 01:26:31,689
days are pulling their plants early

1991
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:34,150
because they can hype the color of their

1992
01:26:31,689 --> 01:26:36,099
hash or their rosin but they don't

1993
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:38,769
understand that like that no high should

1994
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:40,600
email thank you that it doesn't matter

1995
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:42,550
how pretty it looks if it doesn't get me

1996
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:44,020
high I really don't give a [ __ ] I think

1997
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:44,920
especially had the prices that these

1998
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:47,800
[ __ ] charge

1999
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:48,940
I couldn't imagine paying $100 for a

2000
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,279
gram of something I'm gonna get high

2001
01:26:48,939 --> 01:26:53,589
like three times for 15 minutes like I

2002
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:55,059
couldn't imagine that yeah no that's a

2003
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:56,860
really important part of the

2004
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:58,270
conversation actually that he brought up

2005
01:26:56,859 --> 01:27:00,969
because we talked about that a little

2006
01:26:58,270 --> 01:27:03,400
bit the other day that you see the resin

2007
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:05,860
behind me here you see the colors on the

2008
01:27:03,399 --> 01:27:07,809
dry seft you see the color on the water

2009
01:27:05,859 --> 01:27:10,539
hash you see the color on the rosin

2010
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:14,380
these were all exceptional exceptional

2011
01:27:10,539 --> 01:27:19,979
smokes the dry v is actually skunk man

2012
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:23,470
Sam's skunk number one the water hash is

2013
01:27:19,979 --> 01:27:26,049
master Scott I believe from West Coast

2014
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:29,050
concentrate and then the rasa that was

2015
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:32,500
some rasa that I pressed out using some

2016
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:34,360
of the hash having that color to me like

2017
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:37,060
as a photographer the second everyone

2018
01:27:34,359 --> 01:27:39,029
started using freeze dryers I was no

2019
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:41,380
longer really interested in taking

2020
01:27:39,029 --> 01:27:44,319
pictures of the resin and I don't know

2021
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:46,510
why this is and I'm not sure you know

2022
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:48,279
exactly what it is that's going on but

2023
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:52,539
for whatever reason when I photograph

2024
01:27:48,279 --> 01:27:55,449
resin that's been freeze-dried it's full

2025
01:27:52,539 --> 01:27:56,920
of capitate stocks like unbelievable

2026
01:27:55,449 --> 01:27:59,649
amounts of them now they seem to be

2027
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:01,659
almost artifacts of the actual or

2028
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:04,929
shadows of their former self they seem

2029
01:28:01,659 --> 01:28:07,899
to be almost like the shape in the

2030
01:28:04,930 --> 01:28:10,720
lightest you know type of cellulose like

2031
01:28:07,899 --> 01:28:12,039
just thin thin thin bait it's like

2032
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:14,100
they're not even there they don't affect

2033
01:28:12,039 --> 01:28:17,859
the melt they don't really affect the

2034
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:20,920
the high but the photographs I just

2035
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:22,569
stopped photographing freeze dried resin

2036
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,920
with my macro lens because I felt that

2037
01:28:22,569 --> 01:28:28,299
it would just make the people who are

2038
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:30,039
making the hash look bad and it's it's

2039
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:31,869
weird you know when you when you dry

2040
01:28:30,039 --> 01:28:34,689
hash properly and you cure it and you

2041
01:28:31,869 --> 01:28:37,989
you pull that water out slowly with a

2042
01:28:34,689 --> 01:28:40,299
desk in church we always say cleanliness

2043
01:28:37,989 --> 01:28:42,579
is next to godliness

2044
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:44,980
yeah you said that to me like one of the

2045
01:28:42,579 --> 01:28:47,890
first times I ever met you dude and it

2046
01:28:44,979 --> 01:28:50,500
was it stuck with me like I can hear you

2047
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:53,829
saying that the first one of the first

2048
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:55,600
times I ever you know met you in a way

2049
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:57,189
that I was actually talking to you not

2050
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,810
like someone cuz I met you a few times

2051
01:28:57,189 --> 01:29:02,289
prior to that that you definitely that's

2052
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:04,480
assuming you already have the resin that

2053
01:29:02,289 --> 01:29:10,659
you love then what you want to do is

2054
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:12,699
make it as clean as possible right hey

2055
01:29:10,659 --> 01:29:16,149
welcome guys you guys made it in

2056
01:29:12,699 --> 01:29:18,449
Dobis family that's Jessica keep

2057
01:29:16,149 --> 01:29:26,349
forgetting your name I feel terrible I

2058
01:29:18,449 --> 01:29:28,239
don't want to miss it but yeah I also

2059
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:30,850
feel like the the freeze dryer just

2060
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:32,260
powder Rises the hash whereas like micro

2061
01:29:30,850 --> 01:29:33,640
planing and [ __ ] doesn't it doesn't

2062
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:36,820
really powder eyes it like that so it

2063
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:41,650
doesn't fly into the air yeah you can

2064
01:29:36,819 --> 01:29:43,090
hear it like a go ahead like you can

2065
01:29:41,649 --> 01:29:45,489
hear the resin like when you when you

2066
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:48,850
dump it off a paper into the jar yes

2067
01:29:45,489 --> 01:29:50,649
you're the resin like regular sugar you

2068
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:53,230
know rolling down the paper into the jar

2069
01:29:50,649 --> 01:29:55,479
but you write like freeze dry it you

2070
01:29:53,229 --> 01:29:57,879
don't even hear that [ __ ] just sounds

2071
01:29:55,479 --> 01:29:59,679
like [ __ ] dust just kind of moving

2072
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:01,239
down the paper and you can kind of see

2073
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:03,400
it just kind of like going in the air

2074
01:30:01,239 --> 01:30:04,960
even if it's the same quality as a stuff

2075
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:06,009
the microplane so that's another thing

2076
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,230
that confusing

2077
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:11,400
yeah well you have cut in them right

2078
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:14,529
nobody want to try to control that

2079
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:16,509
static energy that's sending the dust

2080
01:30:14,529 --> 01:30:18,250
all over the place I don't know if they

2081
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:19,230
still sell these things but those of us

2082
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:21,760
who are old enough to remember

2083
01:30:19,229 --> 01:30:24,699
turntables and record players they used

2084
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:26,920
to sell this little static gun that you

2085
01:30:24,699 --> 01:30:28,569
could basically knock out the static

2086
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:30,220
electricity on your record player or on

2087
01:30:28,569 --> 01:30:31,659
your record that you're returning on a

2088
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:34,990
turntable because that would lead

2089
01:30:31,659 --> 01:30:36,609
sometimes to popping and noise so what

2090
01:30:34,989 --> 01:30:38,949
what I find is that when you're weighing

2091
01:30:36,609 --> 01:30:41,909
out a very flocculant solid like that

2092
01:30:38,949 --> 01:30:44,529
that tends to be just dispersed by

2093
01:30:41,909 --> 01:30:46,180
static electricity what you can do is

2094
01:30:44,529 --> 01:30:48,279
you can use one of those little spark

2095
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:50,890
guns basically to remove the static

2096
01:30:48,279 --> 01:30:52,989
electricity and see if that helps cool

2097
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:53,920
it's the static electricity I mean like

2098
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:55,719
even when you take it

2099
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:59,199
the freeze dryer and you dump it from

2100
01:30:55,720 --> 01:31:00,940
the tray paper into the sieve and you

2101
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:02,859
just start shaking the sieve back and

2102
01:31:00,939 --> 01:31:05,889
forth you can just see the [ __ ] just

2103
01:31:02,859 --> 01:31:07,960
[ __ ] fly it away yeah so that's

2104
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:10,180
that's similar to taking a blown-up

2105
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:12,369
balloon and rubbing it on your head and

2106
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:14,079
having the static electricity hold the

2107
01:31:12,369 --> 01:31:16,689
balloon to the side of your shirt so

2108
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:17,890
yeah absolutely yeah but that should not

2109
01:31:16,689 --> 01:31:19,299
be happening I'm telling you there's

2110
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:21,100
something that's getting taken out of

2111
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:23,050
that resin that we don't want to be

2112
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:26,320
taking out of it to turn it into a

2113
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:28,659
fluffy Telkom like powder that's like

2114
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:30,579
the that's like the tell-tale sign of

2115
01:31:28,659 --> 01:31:33,159
shitty dry sick that's what we clean out

2116
01:31:30,579 --> 01:31:35,409
of our dry slept so it's got me a little

2117
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:36,939
freaked out the the the freeze dry tech

2118
01:31:35,409 --> 01:31:38,829
and how many people have jumped on the

2119
01:31:36,939 --> 01:31:41,079
bandwagon and I know when Tony got one

2120
01:31:38,829 --> 01:31:42,670
for the brand I told him listen I'm down

2121
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:45,250
with experimenting and playing with this

2122
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:47,230
but I want to have absolutely five and

2123
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:49,270
six star but it's still cured out the

2124
01:31:47,229 --> 01:31:50,559
way I like to cure it out there's

2125
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:53,440
something to be said about that

2126
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:56,070
I mean well what was said before what

2127
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:58,869
was said before about the phenomena of

2128
01:31:56,069 --> 01:32:01,389
fresh frozen when you actually freeze

2129
01:31:58,869 --> 01:32:04,750
the plant material that Tyrael that you

2130
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:09,700
know know the water that's associated

2131
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:11,590
watered I'm sorry the water thank you

2132
01:32:09,699 --> 01:32:14,260
for muting that yes water associated

2133
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:16,630
with the plant cells will begin to

2134
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:19,030
freeze and will begin to rupture cell

2135
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:20,380
walls I mean this is absolutely known

2136
01:32:19,029 --> 01:32:21,009
and you could actually see this under

2137
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:23,170
the microscope

2138
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:24,820
so perhaps Marcus and this is just a

2139
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:28,239
theory I don't have any evidence to

2140
01:32:24,819 --> 01:32:32,199
support this then again the the leaf is

2141
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:36,219
a thing part of the plant that basically

2142
01:32:32,199 --> 01:32:39,699
exudes this waxy texture and perhaps the

2143
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:43,539
freezing of the water at the base of the

2144
01:32:39,699 --> 01:32:46,119
leaf is what's leading to the loss of

2145
01:32:43,539 --> 01:32:49,449
the of the whole try time as opposed to

2146
01:32:46,119 --> 01:32:52,029
just that the top so maybe again the

2147
01:32:49,449 --> 01:32:54,909
expansion that's caused by water

2148
01:32:52,029 --> 01:32:56,859
freezing most liquids when they freeze

2149
01:32:54,909 --> 01:32:59,289
actually contract but water because of

2150
01:32:56,859 --> 01:33:01,659
its hydrogen bonding actually forms

2151
01:32:59,289 --> 01:33:03,699
larger ice crystals than the volume of

2152
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:05,889
water from which it was derived and so

2153
01:33:03,699 --> 01:33:07,750
that change in volume that's why a soda

2154
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:10,360
will explode explode you

2155
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:12,369
the freezer that change in volume might

2156
01:33:10,359 --> 01:33:15,549
be the mechanical force that's

2157
01:33:12,369 --> 01:33:18,250
disrupting the interface between the

2158
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:20,079
waxy portion of the trichome and a

2159
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:22,569
continuous structure of the leaf which

2160
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:25,539
is very hydrophilic and very water

2161
01:33:22,569 --> 01:33:29,849
loving and very water like as opposed to

2162
01:33:25,539 --> 01:33:33,789
the waxy trichome which is hydrophobic

2163
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:39,190
even when you separate dry septa resin

2164
01:33:33,789 --> 01:33:41,729
and you've got it dry it's it's it and

2165
01:33:39,189 --> 01:33:47,500
you've got it separated so that it's a

2166
01:33:41,729 --> 01:33:51,579
50 60 70 90 percent resin heads it can

2167
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:54,670
be very hydrophilic I believe is a

2168
01:33:51,579 --> 01:33:59,859
proper word which means it can absorb

2169
01:33:54,670 --> 01:34:01,359
the water from the atmosphere yes that's

2170
01:33:59,859 --> 01:34:02,739
actually that phenomena is not called

2171
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:06,429
hydrophilic that's actually called

2172
01:34:02,739 --> 01:34:09,519
hygroscopic so when a dried organic

2173
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:10,750
material absorbs ambient moisture from

2174
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:14,110
the air that's that's called a

2175
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:17,949
hygroscopic it really depends on the

2176
01:34:14,109 --> 01:34:21,519
variety of resin some varieties are

2177
01:34:17,949 --> 01:34:24,639
incredibly so other varieties they

2178
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:28,270
really just don't do it right

2179
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:34,150
I think it's dependent on the terpene

2180
01:34:28,270 --> 01:34:36,760
that contents yeah I assume so that's

2181
01:34:34,149 --> 01:34:39,309
the real differentiation in-between

2182
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:42,220
necessarily cannabinoids but it's the

2183
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:45,370
the terpenes and and which ones are

2184
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:47,050
there and at what levels absolutely we

2185
01:34:45,369 --> 01:34:49,569
also know that you know freeze drying

2186
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:51,820
food as opposed to like drying food or

2187
01:34:49,569 --> 01:34:54,009
sun drying food you know they do a lot

2188
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:55,630
of tests on freeze drying just food and

2189
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:56,949
it loses a tremendous amount of

2190
01:34:55,630 --> 01:35:00,069
nutrients like there's nothing really

2191
01:34:56,949 --> 01:35:01,779
left in freeze-dried food so sort of a

2192
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:04,359
side note but something that's been

2193
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:05,679
tested and true yeah that's what I was

2194
01:35:04,359 --> 01:35:08,349
trying to say I was trying to explain

2195
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:10,510
like if I take at night my 90 bags and

2196
01:35:08,350 --> 01:35:12,640
I'm microplate all right I freeze the

2197
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:15,489
patty and I'm microplane it it will

2198
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:17,740
never ever be the same as the stuff that

2199
01:35:15,489 --> 01:35:19,090
90 that I put into the freeze dryer the

2200
01:35:17,739 --> 01:35:21,840
stuff that comes out of the freeze dryer

2201
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:23,220
is like anthrax it will go airborne

2202
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:24,690
right out of the [ __ ] freeze-dried

2203
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:26,610
look you can grab the sides of the paper

2204
01:35:24,689 --> 01:35:29,189
and just crunch it in on itself and you

2205
01:35:26,609 --> 01:35:30,779
can see does fly it off that that's the

2206
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:33,329
same night view that I'm talkin about

2207
01:35:30,779 --> 01:35:35,189
those then I also froze and microplane

2208
01:35:33,329 --> 01:35:36,899
and it won't do that I think I can

2209
01:35:35,189 --> 01:35:39,029
literally fold the paper over on itself

2210
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:42,029
and I can hit it with the metal and this

2211
01:35:39,029 --> 01:35:43,979
metal block for a rosin flower press now

2212
01:35:42,029 --> 01:35:45,899
hit it with the block and it'll just

2213
01:35:43,979 --> 01:35:48,449
break everything down into powder but

2214
01:35:45,899 --> 01:35:51,149
still it will not lift off of the paper

2215
01:35:48,449 --> 01:35:53,130
even after completely raping it you know

2216
01:35:51,149 --> 01:35:54,929
like with uh with the metal block so I

2217
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:55,590
don't understand why the freeze-dry

2218
01:35:54,930 --> 01:35:58,289
material

2219
01:35:55,590 --> 01:36:00,180
what's the float I just don't get it I

2220
01:35:58,289 --> 01:36:01,739
mean he's explained a few things but it

2221
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:04,650
still doesn't make sense to me because

2222
01:36:01,739 --> 01:36:06,960
like the the metal seed is it going to

2223
01:36:04,649 --> 01:36:09,899
create any type of static so like just

2224
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,699
dumping those chunks into a sieve and

2225
01:36:09,899 --> 01:36:13,019
then shaking it and it's just dusting

2226
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:14,609
without you even using a spoon you

2227
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:16,860
literally just shake the the seed back

2228
01:36:14,609 --> 01:36:18,119
and forth but the particles that are

2229
01:36:16,859 --> 01:36:18,899
flying into the air you almost need to

2230
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:20,250
wear a mask

2231
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:22,559
otherwise you'll be bringing that [ __ ]

2232
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:26,090
in but it doesn't happen with microplane

2233
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:26,090
- that's what I'm talking about [ __ ]

2234
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:31,380
well there's got to be a temperature

2235
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:33,450
that you know it's breaking down the

2236
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:35,699
resins and when you get it that cold you

2237
01:36:33,449 --> 01:36:38,550
know there's probably it's breaking down

2238
01:36:35,699 --> 01:36:42,149
the resins and that's that it could also

2239
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:44,100
be a difference in volatile if molecules

2240
01:36:42,149 --> 01:36:46,349
are released it will change the basic

2241
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:48,690
nature of the resin all right check this

2242
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:51,060
guy's exactly right then that was me

2243
01:36:48,689 --> 01:36:52,619
that said [ __ ] by the way for those of

2244
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:53,880
you wondering okay here's the photo it

2245
01:36:52,619 --> 01:36:55,680
took me a while this is West Coast

2246
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:58,199
concentrator this is they make beautiful

2247
01:36:55,680 --> 01:37:01,590
hash this is their hash right here okay

2248
01:36:58,199 --> 01:37:04,349
same same everything except freeze-dried

2249
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:07,140
okay look at that [ __ ]

2250
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:09,210
I wouldn't even post it I was like yeah

2251
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:12,090
it looks like it's 20% capitate stock

2252
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:14,250
sorry I'm not posting that but it is

2253
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:17,190
what it is it's not just them it's every

2254
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:20,279
[ __ ] freeze-dried bubble hash that I

2255
01:37:17,189 --> 01:37:23,489
put under my wing you're mine you can't

2256
01:37:20,279 --> 01:37:25,679
see it no I could see it but it looks

2257
01:37:23,489 --> 01:37:27,630
like it has a lot of contaminants in it

2258
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:29,340
Marcus I mean it looks like it you

2259
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:31,590
absolutely know there's a lot of

2260
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:33,810
contaminants in it you can just see

2261
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:34,409
that's not food look at all that [ __ ]

2262
01:37:33,810 --> 01:37:37,020
210

2263
01:37:34,408 --> 01:37:42,988
there's that's an enormous amount for a

2264
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:45,840
melty for a melty hash is because the

2265
01:37:42,988 --> 01:37:49,019
resin heads have been shredded and it's

2266
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:51,869
somehow makes it look like it's not pure

2267
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:53,699
resin heads but it actually is no it's

2268
01:37:51,869 --> 01:37:55,170
definitely not pure resin heads I don't

2269
01:37:53,698 --> 01:37:57,629
know what it is I don't know why that

2270
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:59,579
why when you like I just don't

2271
01:37:57,630 --> 01:38:01,710
understand it enough but it's a

2272
01:37:59,579 --> 01:38:04,380
conversation that I want to make sure

2273
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:06,929
we're having because you know I'm also

2274
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:09,779
not overly sold on the freeze dryer you

2275
01:38:06,929 --> 01:38:14,100
know this it's funny too because once

2276
01:38:09,779 --> 01:38:19,380
I've got my resin separated and dried

2277
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:22,889
and cured and separated I presume that's

2278
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:25,920
what I do that's how I keep it know just

2279
01:38:22,889 --> 01:38:28,739
like it was the day I froze it but you

2280
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:30,210
know it but it's but it's different than

2281
01:38:28,738 --> 01:38:34,079
what you're talking about for sure

2282
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:37,198
well I photographed frozen heads and you

2283
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:40,710
know frozen heads that have been you

2284
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:43,769
know thawed out and I've never seen them

2285
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:45,869
like break I've never seen them shredded

2286
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:48,600
or crack or or do any of these things

2287
01:38:45,869 --> 01:38:50,219
under my micro lens however I remember

2288
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,600
when people were micro planing and I was

2289
01:38:50,219 --> 01:38:52,920
saying you're shredding the heads and

2290
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,060
they were like no no we're not shredding

2291
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:56,730
the heads I'm like oh no you're

2292
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:58,500
shredding the heads on wet hash and

2293
01:38:56,729 --> 01:39:00,359
mixing the oil from the inside of the

2294
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:02,340
heads with the water I promise you're

2295
01:39:00,359 --> 01:39:04,079
doing that oh no no no no no finally

2296
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:06,659
just take the macro lens get it out and

2297
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:08,399
and look at it under the microscope well

2298
01:39:06,658 --> 01:39:11,279
it looks like little like diamonds

2299
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:13,529
because the heads have been shredded

2300
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:17,429
very different from sieving and I don't

2301
01:39:13,529 --> 01:39:19,979
say that see micro planing is is wrong I

2302
01:39:17,429 --> 01:39:23,039
just preferred personally I took

2303
01:39:19,979 --> 01:39:25,468
personally to to leave my heads intact I

2304
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:29,100
don't want them to get to get shredded

2305
01:39:25,469 --> 01:39:33,600
like that yeah I agree on a percent only

2306
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:36,030
micro plane if I can't see you know some

2307
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:38,460
stuff is just [ __ ] liquid you can't

2308
01:39:36,029 --> 01:39:39,960
there's just a going through a sieve I

2309
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:42,210
don't give a [ __ ] how cold the room is

2310
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:45,260
it don't matter as soon as you mash that

2311
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:46,760
spoon down yeah well that's it

2312
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:48,170
so you said it there's the [ __ ] up right

2313
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:49,670
because you don't know there's certain

2314
01:39:48,170 --> 01:39:52,579
stuff comes out and it's such a high

2315
01:39:49,670 --> 01:39:54,409
quality but it's pressing it with

2316
01:39:52,579 --> 01:39:56,180
gravity just sitting there and the paddy

2317
01:39:54,409 --> 01:39:58,340
before you do anything if you just tap

2318
01:39:56,180 --> 01:40:00,619
it a little bit you're like oops it's

2319
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:02,900
like hard like bubblegum or something

2320
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:04,670
it's like yeah I know I've put it into a

2321
01:40:02,899 --> 01:40:05,989
sieve and done like this with the spoon

2322
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:09,560
and just watched it go

2323
01:40:05,989 --> 01:40:11,119
smear exactly that's why it's tested out

2324
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:12,380
right out of the bag I'll take my finger

2325
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:14,510
and I'll just get a little tiny bit of

2326
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:15,920
it okay squeeze it hard between my

2327
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:17,720
fingers get the water away from it and

2328
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:19,940
then start trying to roll it just

2329
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:21,980
reaches in my fingers it's not going in

2330
01:40:19,939 --> 01:40:25,399
the sieve but if it rolls up into a ball

2331
01:40:21,979 --> 01:40:27,739
there's a chance there is a chance what

2332
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:31,009
do you do the for besides the save do

2333
01:40:27,739 --> 01:40:33,649
you just let it cure what do you mean

2334
01:40:31,010 --> 01:40:42,890
after I Seaver or micro Blanc if it's

2335
01:40:33,649 --> 01:40:46,099
too greasy what do you do with it all

2336
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:47,750
right my complains it yeah what I'll do

2337
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:49,280
is is I'll freeze all my patties I'll

2338
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:50,989
make them small and I'll freeze them all

2339
01:40:49,279 --> 01:40:53,659
but I won't freeze them until I've got

2340
01:40:50,989 --> 01:40:56,269
almost all the moisture out so what I do

2341
01:40:53,659 --> 01:40:58,760
is I take my 25 micron pressing screen

2342
01:40:56,270 --> 01:41:00,560
and I just put the hatch on it or in a

2343
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,360
paper towel with underneath it so I'll

2344
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,150
fold a paper towel up a few times and

2345
01:41:02,359 --> 01:41:06,829
I'll make sure the paddy is sitting on

2346
01:41:04,149 --> 01:41:07,789
an actual paper towel on the pressing

2347
01:41:06,829 --> 01:41:09,710
screen and I'll leave it in my

2348
01:41:07,789 --> 01:41:12,289
refrigerator and then I'll keep swapping

2349
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:13,579
the paper towel out so like gonna be 20

2350
01:41:12,289 --> 01:41:15,470
minutes I'll put another paper towel

2351
01:41:13,579 --> 01:41:16,640
underneath it in the fridge no don't put

2352
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:19,490
into freezer leave it in the fridge

2353
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:20,990
allow most of moisture to come out of

2354
01:41:19,489 --> 01:41:22,729
the paddy because the last thing you

2355
01:41:20,989 --> 01:41:24,859
want to do when you're microplane it's

2356
01:41:22,729 --> 01:41:26,539
microplane ice cubes you want a

2357
01:41:24,859 --> 01:41:29,059
microplane frozen hatch you don't want

2358
01:41:26,539 --> 01:41:31,159
to have ice water in the mix so your

2359
01:41:29,060 --> 01:41:32,690
best bet is to use the paper towels

2360
01:41:31,159 --> 01:41:34,729
until you've linked almost every bit of

2361
01:41:32,689 --> 01:41:36,769
the moisture out then take those patties

2362
01:41:34,729 --> 01:41:38,179
and put them into your freezer at that

2363
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:39,770
point after they're completely frozen

2364
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:41,900
you'll be able to microplane it with

2365
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:43,610
ease but if you leave too much water and

2366
01:41:41,899 --> 01:41:45,109
it was gonna be a nightmare for you to

2367
01:41:43,609 --> 01:41:46,939
microplane you're gonna feel like you're

2368
01:41:45,109 --> 01:41:48,559
literally taking an ice cube and trying

2369
01:41:46,939 --> 01:41:51,589
to shave it with a [ __ ] cheese grater

2370
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:54,460
it's gonna be a nightmare and the hash

2371
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:58,750
I'll end up sizzling good too

2372
01:41:54,460 --> 01:41:58,750
we don't want no sizzle in the hash

2373
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:05,130
Oh boom knowledge drop dabs four days

2374
01:42:01,729 --> 01:42:07,199
how about a bond rip for the whole PAL

2375
01:42:05,130 --> 01:42:09,779
and the rest of the audience as well

2376
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:11,039
let's uh let's do this mother lovers

2377
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:15,000
let's do it

2378
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:16,350
I just wanted that what better another

2379
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,289
comment I don't know if it's relevant

2380
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:21,030
but remember when you freeze different

2381
01:42:19,289 --> 01:42:22,920
things that are derived from different

2382
01:42:21,029 --> 01:42:25,259
materials and certainly the waxy

2383
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:26,789
trichome is very very different than the

2384
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:29,159
leaf from the plant and the rest of the

2385
01:42:26,789 --> 01:42:30,479
cellular structure of the plant when

2386
01:42:29,159 --> 01:42:34,859
things freeze

2387
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:38,789
they have different thermal conductivity

2388
01:42:34,859 --> 01:42:41,429
Xand so they have different so not all

2389
01:42:38,789 --> 01:42:43,920
things contract the same rate not all

2390
01:42:41,430 --> 01:42:45,720
things the same rate and so I think the

2391
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:49,590
freezing process itself is basically

2392
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:52,579
just fracturing this the surface of the

2393
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:56,100
leaf from from the from the waxy tripod

2394
01:42:52,579 --> 01:42:58,199
being nonspecific fracturing because

2395
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:59,730
again these two things if you get the

2396
01:42:58,199 --> 01:43:01,229
chemical content of what's in the truck

2397
01:42:59,729 --> 01:43:02,849
foam and the chemical content of what's

2398
01:43:01,229 --> 01:43:04,799
in the leaf they're very very different

2399
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:06,210
and because they're very very different

2400
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,430
when they freeze they're gonna freeze

2401
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:10,829
then they're gonna contract and expand

2402
01:43:08,430 --> 01:43:12,780
at different rates and those

2403
01:43:10,829 --> 01:43:17,930
contractions and expansions are the

2404
01:43:12,779 --> 01:43:21,569
reason why they're going to separate

2405
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:28,650
well as the horse on Ren &amp; Stimpy used

2406
01:43:21,569 --> 01:43:33,299
to say no sir I don't like it no sir

2407
01:43:28,649 --> 01:43:35,460
didn't like it well I'm gonna brush my

2408
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:37,560
teeth and then head over to the lab I'll

2409
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:39,180
reconnect at the lab so everybody could

2410
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:43,560
say hi Chris thanks for having me on

2411
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:44,820
Marcus and I want to clear up on hashed

2412
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:48,060
Church TV here

2413
01:43:44,819 --> 01:43:50,729
I do not own indras extractor okay so I

2414
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:53,490
know that this was a sin a bunch of

2415
01:43:50,729 --> 01:43:55,799
times on episode 116 that I wasn't on I

2416
01:43:53,489 --> 01:43:58,800
don't own injuries extractor a client of

2417
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:01,650
mine does come online if it ever does

2418
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:03,720
come online we'll hear more about it so

2419
01:44:01,649 --> 01:44:05,489
stop that's all you're bettering me

2420
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:09,000
asking me about injures extractor

2421
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:12,609
because I don't have one no no I think I

2422
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:15,550
think it was implied

2423
01:44:12,609 --> 01:44:18,329
had one delivered to a client of yours

2424
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:18,329
in Oakland

2425
01:44:19,738 --> 01:44:24,069
exactly

2426
01:44:20,948 --> 01:44:25,719
shout out to Indra actually his life

2427
01:44:24,069 --> 01:44:28,210
partner there Annie had a pretty bad

2428
01:44:25,719 --> 01:44:29,368
aneurysm stroke recently and is in the

2429
01:44:28,210 --> 01:44:32,710
hospital

2430
01:44:29,368 --> 01:44:34,509
so our thoughts are with them I hope

2431
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:38,829
that she is getting better and feeling

2432
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:40,989
better it was a big scare for sure so

2433
01:44:38,829 --> 01:44:44,979
we'll see you on a few minutes yes

2434
01:44:40,988 --> 01:44:46,448
sounds good mark Jessica and Andrew make

2435
01:44:44,979 --> 01:44:50,229
it back now I don't know what was going

2436
01:44:46,448 --> 01:44:52,868
on with those guys so when people wash

2437
01:44:50,229 --> 01:44:54,908
their bugs off and they in Nate they're

2438
01:44:52,868 --> 01:44:56,889
getting the water-soluble contaminants

2439
01:44:54,908 --> 01:44:59,469
off of it aren't they potentially also

2440
01:44:56,889 --> 01:45:01,230
taking water-soluble trichomes off or

2441
01:44:59,469 --> 01:45:03,340
not try cuz a water-soluble

2442
01:45:01,229 --> 01:45:06,399
properties off the outside of the

2443
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:09,730
trichomes as well yeah they might be but

2444
01:45:06,399 --> 01:45:13,479
if you've got old nasty dried squashed

2445
01:45:09,729 --> 01:45:17,468
buds like the Indians often did then

2446
01:45:13,479 --> 01:45:19,599
maybe you're the Vantage's outweigh the

2447
01:45:17,469 --> 01:45:22,539
disadvantages yeah there's something to

2448
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:25,179
be said I'm just talking about a lot of

2449
01:45:22,539 --> 01:45:27,010
people online doing fresh buds right out

2450
01:45:25,179 --> 01:45:29,800
of the thing into water doing all this

2451
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:31,860
I'm just like Oh cold water to don't do

2452
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:36,070
it in cold water that's the key and

2453
01:45:31,859 --> 01:45:40,000
Marcus and I heard about it from sad

2454
01:45:36,069 --> 01:45:44,769
news in India they all said you know you

2455
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:48,368
don't wash your your ganja before you

2456
01:45:44,770 --> 01:45:51,250
know you put it in the Chilam I would

2457
01:45:48,368 --> 01:45:53,799
say no you do and they would explain to

2458
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:57,420
me why we'd be like first of all we're

2459
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:57,420
not putting any ganja in this Chilam

2460
01:45:58,109 --> 01:46:04,210
actually that's true but I said I would

2461
01:46:01,719 --> 01:46:06,850
like to hear from satyrs why they were

2462
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:08,649
washing their ganja before they smoked

2463
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:12,100
it and they would explain to me then

2464
01:46:08,649 --> 01:46:15,868
they would explain to me why they did

2465
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:19,060
what they did with cobra venom or or

2466
01:46:15,868 --> 01:46:22,670
scorpion tails or any other psychoactive

2467
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:24,600
substance that they were ingesting

2468
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:26,699
yeah it's an interesting conversation

2469
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:29,070
because it seems like it sort of like

2470
01:46:26,699 --> 01:46:31,859
the thing to do with fresh buds to get

2471
01:46:29,069 --> 01:46:33,149
the contaminants off you know but one

2472
01:46:31,859 --> 01:46:35,159
thing that I'm concerned about is that

2473
01:46:33,149 --> 01:46:37,049
you know the cure is really important to

2474
01:46:35,159 --> 01:46:39,389
us and the way that we cure our weed is

2475
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:40,590
super important and you're really

2476
01:46:39,390 --> 01:46:43,380
getting rid of a lot of that

2477
01:46:40,590 --> 01:46:45,300
cyanobacteria that digests a lot of the

2478
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:47,220
nitrogen which helps to make a really

2479
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:48,810
nice cure so that's another conversation

2480
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:50,610
you know if you're not going to make it

2481
01:46:48,810 --> 01:46:53,670
directly into handle right away you're

2482
01:46:50,609 --> 01:46:55,259
here your flowers you know washing it

2483
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:56,730
might be getting rid of that those

2484
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:58,460
important that when you're talking about

2485
01:46:56,729 --> 01:47:03,959
the Indian ganja we're talking about

2486
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:07,470
MetLife but most of the ganja sold in

2487
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:10,800
India is what is called pressed ganja

2488
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:13,110
the buds after that you've got a bunch

2489
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:15,840
of buds that are dried and cured they

2490
01:47:13,109 --> 01:47:18,869
walk on them and they press them just

2491
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:22,079
for transport and for long-term storage

2492
01:47:18,869 --> 01:47:24,630
it works better in those conditions I

2493
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:27,359
don't agree with that but that's the way

2494
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:29,730
it is well there's some processes here

2495
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:32,939
you know because we do microbial testing

2496
01:47:29,729 --> 01:47:34,919
and I have personally walked onto farms

2497
01:47:32,939 --> 01:47:36,659
and seen people spraying their buds down

2498
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:38,940
with hydrogen peroxide as soon as they

2499
01:47:36,659 --> 01:47:43,769
come out of that little trimmer and it's

2500
01:47:38,939 --> 01:47:46,199
just like makes me cringe Allah p.m.

2501
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:48,540
action yeah well they just do it anyway

2502
01:47:46,199 --> 01:47:51,599
just just just just just to be safe it

2503
01:47:48,539 --> 01:47:55,619
seems like hydrogen peroxide make it

2504
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:57,570
bubble a lot more well it's it's

2505
01:47:55,619 --> 01:47:59,880
obviously diluted in water but you know

2506
01:47:57,569 --> 01:48:03,119
it's it's just a practice I've seen use

2507
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:06,239
just to ensure the bait cast microbial

2508
01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:08,640
testing I have yet to see really nice

2509
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:10,679
good cured weed that's been fresh washed

2510
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:12,539
like that or that they've used hydrogen

2511
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:14,250
peroxide you know it will be interesting

2512
01:48:12,539 --> 01:48:17,310
it's not that I'm saying it's impossible

2513
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:19,800
but we really know about how those

2514
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:22,110
microbes work in the curing process to

2515
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:24,630
make that you know bud as beautiful as

2516
01:48:22,109 --> 01:48:28,349
it is you know the cyanobacteria stays

2517
01:48:24,630 --> 01:48:30,930
on the plant its entire life so that it

2518
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:33,289
can be able to help cure the weed when

2519
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:33,289
it's cut down

2520
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:41,260
oh I always wondered what it did to the

2521
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:43,990
trichome adds something to that outer

2522
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:45,659
layer that powder waxy layer kind of

2523
01:48:43,989 --> 01:48:48,369
breaking it down a little bit you know

2524
01:48:45,659 --> 01:48:52,569
it's gonna start that breakdown for sure

2525
01:48:48,369 --> 01:48:54,519
I know it will yeah freeze I die if I

2526
01:48:52,569 --> 01:48:55,869
freeze Drive that'd be like whoa [ __ ]

2527
01:48:54,520 --> 01:49:00,130
yeah it's like taking off that

2528
01:48:55,869 --> 01:49:03,670
protective coating for sure doesn't know

2529
01:49:00,130 --> 01:49:07,109
how you get the full melt though that's

2530
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:07,109
the big secret don't tell anyone

2531
01:49:08,579 --> 01:49:12,789
sorry about that guys just getting

2532
01:49:10,930 --> 01:49:15,430
messages over here I want it to actually

2533
01:49:12,789 --> 01:49:18,519
show for any of you guys that have

2534
01:49:15,430 --> 01:49:20,590
traveled in Nepal or in India you know

2535
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:22,870
and you meet the smoker Bubba's that the

2536
01:49:20,590 --> 01:49:24,909
bubbles were real hashish aficionados

2537
01:49:22,869 --> 01:49:28,090
they tend to have these really cool

2538
01:49:24,909 --> 01:49:29,739
handmade banks these really thick thick

2539
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:31,720
bags that they make and they had the

2540
01:49:29,739 --> 01:49:34,210
reed raksha's hanging off of them so I

2541
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:36,909
was gifted one years ago by my

2542
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:39,039
manufacturer from Nepal and this is this

2543
01:49:36,909 --> 01:49:41,139
is a very thick thick handmade there's

2544
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:43,210
nettle this is all stinging nettle right

2545
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:45,430
here and so this this probably took

2546
01:49:43,210 --> 01:49:49,899
close to a year for this Baba to make

2547
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:52,840
this bag and hey he he put in bubble bag

2548
01:49:49,899 --> 01:49:55,269
on the back there that's got like the

2549
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:57,670
little it's just a really beautiful bag

2550
01:49:55,270 --> 01:50:00,640
but you go to India and you'll always

2551
01:49:57,670 --> 01:50:02,230
see the big puffer Saudis with one of

2552
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:03,640
these on their shoulder there's always

2553
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:06,939
something good to be had on the inside

2554
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:08,800
of it so I felt like I had to share that

2555
01:50:06,939 --> 01:50:12,639
little thing that I had not seen in a

2556
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:16,180
long time still in great shape nice one

2557
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:18,450
when we were in Rishikesh we were you

2558
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:22,720
know hanging out with assad news and and

2559
01:50:18,449 --> 01:50:25,720
they all had really bad cops and I was

2560
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:28,420
like really kind of like well I could

2561
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:31,659
smoke with them or maybe out of this

2562
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:33,970
like not yeah yeah just have your own

2563
01:50:31,659 --> 01:50:35,689
sorry that you place on the Chilam each

2564
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:38,659
time in your own hand like

2565
01:50:35,689 --> 01:50:40,750
little wet piece of cloth that just you

2566
01:50:38,659 --> 01:50:45,260
know and then obviously it's India so

2567
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:48,859
India style you need a soppy and you you

2568
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:52,070
could share me you can share with Joe um

2569
01:50:48,859 --> 01:50:54,289
with anybody and your lips never touch

2570
01:50:52,069 --> 01:50:57,889
the same place in their lips touching

2571
01:50:54,289 --> 01:51:00,619
Southie keeps you isolated and it's very

2572
01:50:57,890 --> 01:51:02,900
very safe but if the copying is being

2573
01:51:00,619 --> 01:51:05,510
caused by what they're smoking then I

2574
01:51:02,899 --> 01:51:08,089
can understand your fear to smoke with

2575
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:09,829
them yeah well you know coming from my

2576
01:51:08,090 --> 01:51:11,690
health background you know they

2577
01:51:09,829 --> 01:51:13,479
definitely a lot of them did have

2578
01:51:11,689 --> 01:51:16,399
tuberculosis sores on their back so

2579
01:51:13,479 --> 01:51:18,049
tuberculosis is quite rampant there it's

2580
01:51:16,399 --> 01:51:19,789
really easy to get it's something that

2581
01:51:18,050 --> 01:51:22,010
you want to be you know really careful

2582
01:51:19,789 --> 01:51:24,289
of when you're sharing anything and

2583
01:51:22,010 --> 01:51:26,539
we're not afraid of luring travelers by

2584
01:51:24,289 --> 01:51:28,609
18-ounce agree we've taken our son all

2585
01:51:26,539 --> 01:51:31,969
over the world with no vaccines and

2586
01:51:28,609 --> 01:51:35,689
that's I've smoked Jones with not only

2587
01:51:31,969 --> 01:51:42,198
tuberculosis patients but also people

2588
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:45,979
with active elephantitis or or or LMC I

2589
01:51:42,198 --> 01:51:48,349
mean there is if you smoke could show

2590
01:51:45,979 --> 01:51:51,889
them properly with the Safi there there

2591
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:53,660
is no sharing of germs yeah well I

2592
01:51:51,890 --> 01:51:57,619
smoked many a chillins with many a

2593
01:51:53,659 --> 01:51:59,409
people in India and still have nice

2594
01:51:57,619 --> 01:52:01,698
healthy lung so I feel good about that

2595
01:51:59,409 --> 01:52:04,329
sure wouldn't want to get Sumter Burke

2596
01:52:01,698 --> 01:52:07,789
yellow C's

2597
01:52:04,329 --> 01:52:09,890
Jesus no fun although I was pretty

2598
01:52:07,789 --> 01:52:12,079
pissed when buddy cut my leg in India

2599
01:52:09,890 --> 01:52:14,690
breaking the blood skin barrier that's a

2600
01:52:12,079 --> 01:52:16,309
whole other ballgame I was pissed his

2601
01:52:14,689 --> 01:52:19,189
scissors were like sticking out of his

2602
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:20,780
overstuffed bag walking along the Ganges

2603
01:52:19,189 --> 01:52:23,329
all stuffed with people and he just

2604
01:52:20,779 --> 01:52:24,579
opened the side of my leg up like I

2605
01:52:23,329 --> 01:52:28,219
thought it was going to need stitches

2606
01:52:24,579 --> 01:52:30,140
like oh great just kind of should go

2607
01:52:28,219 --> 01:52:34,939
lick some dirty knives while I'm at it

2608
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:38,480
here what do you got there

2609
01:52:34,939 --> 01:52:40,939
little little rosin is that bike [ __ ]

2610
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:44,899
squishing oh you're on you know that's

2611
01:52:40,939 --> 01:52:46,759
the Holy Grail talking about proper try

2612
01:52:44,899 --> 01:52:49,460
crumbs this has grown twelve and a half

2613
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:52,489
weeks it's nice and

2614
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:59,270
and really gassy

2615
01:52:52,489 --> 01:53:01,969
that's beautiful yeah we got like what

2616
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:06,290
did we get about get about 26 percent

2617
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:09,320
return on this Holy Grail so definitely

2618
01:53:06,289 --> 01:53:10,970
one that that started us off right the

2619
01:53:09,319 --> 01:53:11,329
right genetic for a squishing that's for

2620
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:15,619
sure

2621
01:53:11,329 --> 01:53:19,510
when you say 26% is that from manicured

2622
01:53:15,619 --> 01:53:19,510
buds yes it is

2623
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:26,600
hang dried and it's usually hang dried

2624
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:30,079
for about 10 to 14 days than hand

2625
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:32,270
trimmed and then then manicured then

2626
01:53:30,079 --> 01:53:37,699
keep cheered them for about another two

2627
01:53:32,270 --> 01:53:40,940
weeks it's about a month before they

2628
01:53:37,699 --> 01:53:44,750
come out of the room ready to do

2629
01:53:40,939 --> 01:53:48,710
anything what you guys are loving that

2630
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:50,979
m1 yes we are definitely putting a lot

2631
01:53:48,710 --> 01:53:54,539
of use into it that's for sure

2632
01:53:50,979 --> 01:53:56,799
definitely using that lifetime warranty

2633
01:53:54,539 --> 01:53:59,210
[Laughter]

2634
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:01,699
yeah took us three months to go through

2635
01:53:59,210 --> 01:54:04,960
a Chinese one so that's not too bad

2636
01:54:01,699 --> 01:54:08,739
actually okay yeah well you know

2637
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:18,199
swishing a pound a week or so right

2638
01:54:08,739 --> 01:54:20,479
squishing a pound a week there's so many

2639
01:54:18,199 --> 01:54:23,859
people just are not growing the proper

2640
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:25,969
resonance very unfortunate that's I

2641
01:54:23,859 --> 01:54:28,460
guess it'll just be the way it is

2642
01:54:25,970 --> 01:54:33,619
forever just like it is with everything

2643
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:35,480
else I want to do it quicker than others

2644
01:54:33,619 --> 01:54:38,750
and some people are willing to take the

2645
01:54:35,479 --> 01:54:41,089
time and you know you know if you look

2646
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:44,960
at the established industries that

2647
01:54:41,090 --> 01:54:48,949
already exist for example wine that

2648
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:52,909
there are wineries that produce the

2649
01:54:48,949 --> 01:54:55,399
ultimate grape what they do is they they

2650
01:54:52,909 --> 01:54:59,119
never fertilize the plants they don't

2651
01:54:55,399 --> 01:55:02,029
have your plants they prune back their

2652
01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:03,170
plants to get a slower yield of superior

2653
01:55:02,029 --> 01:55:05,329
grapes

2654
01:55:03,170 --> 01:55:08,000
and that's what they make their wine

2655
01:55:05,329 --> 01:55:11,420
with it'll be the same thing with

2656
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:14,090
hashish producers and what you want is

2657
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:16,909
not only the ultimate clone and the

2658
01:55:14,090 --> 01:55:19,429
ultimate variety of resin but you want

2659
01:55:16,909 --> 01:55:24,889
to produce it the ultimate way and then

2660
01:55:19,429 --> 01:55:27,319
extract it the ultimate way no and it's

2661
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:30,050
it's also looking for genetics that that

2662
01:55:27,319 --> 01:55:32,329
not don't necessarily yield as much in

2663
01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:34,190
flower but have more yield and resin and

2664
01:55:32,329 --> 01:55:37,010
better aromas and things like that like

2665
01:55:34,189 --> 01:55:38,928
we we hunter for our fee nose with with

2666
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:40,909
with our nose and with you know quality

2667
01:55:38,929 --> 01:55:42,890
more than with quantity you know we're

2668
01:55:40,909 --> 01:55:44,630
not looking for that genetic that's

2669
01:55:42,890 --> 01:55:45,920
gonna produce three pounds of light we

2670
01:55:44,630 --> 01:55:49,489
want something that it's gonna produce

2671
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:51,199
just good flavors and be really nice to

2672
01:55:49,488 --> 01:55:54,769
squish I mean that's what we're looking

2673
01:55:51,198 --> 01:55:56,988
for nothing crazy just you know well

2674
01:55:54,770 --> 01:55:58,640
that's that's what separates sort of the

2675
01:55:56,988 --> 01:56:00,859
two groups right now the people who are

2676
01:55:58,640 --> 01:56:02,570
willing to put in that work the people

2677
01:56:00,859 --> 01:56:04,130
who are willing to learn from their

2678
01:56:02,569 --> 01:56:06,109
mistakes and acknowledge that what

2679
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:08,600
they're making isn't the best that it

2680
01:56:06,109 --> 01:56:10,250
could be those are the people that are

2681
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:13,219
going to continue to innovate and move

2682
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:16,010
forward and and you know not stop until

2683
01:56:13,219 --> 01:56:18,289
they either create or find that cultivar

2684
01:56:16,010 --> 01:56:20,000
that they want learn all of the

2685
01:56:18,289 --> 01:56:21,800
techniques that are required to allow

2686
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:26,890
that plant to express itself to its

2687
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:29,659
maximum potential it's it's also truly

2688
01:56:26,890 --> 01:56:32,960
two different marketplaces

2689
01:56:29,659 --> 01:56:36,829
there's the quality market and then

2690
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:40,640
there's the quantity market and both the

2691
01:56:36,829 --> 01:56:42,198
growers and sellers that they're focused

2692
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:44,360
on different things sometimes and

2693
01:56:42,198 --> 01:56:47,238
there's nothing wrong with either except

2694
01:56:44,359 --> 01:56:50,869
for that quality is always been hi Holy

2695
01:56:47,238 --> 01:56:52,609
Grail over quantity and I think the

2696
01:56:50,869 --> 01:56:56,000
quantity market is much larger

2697
01:56:52,609 --> 01:56:58,069
unfortunately yes you just look at any

2698
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,350
aspect of any market in the quantity

2699
01:56:58,069 --> 01:57:06,488
market is always the bigger market place

2700
01:57:00,350 --> 01:57:06,489
so you know it's McDonald's versus Lyons

2701
01:57:10,659 --> 01:57:15,849
everybody looking at this rosin press

2702
01:57:12,829 --> 01:57:21,189
right here oh yeah

2703
01:57:15,849 --> 01:57:22,929
Oh beautiful beautiful Wow not talking

2704
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:26,948
around that's probably 30 grams of that

2705
01:57:22,929 --> 01:57:28,840
beautiful hash look at that [ __ ]

2706
01:57:26,948 --> 01:57:32,848
he posted one the other day that was

2707
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:32,849
flowing like he just it was unbelievable

2708
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:38,020
yes very nice

2709
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:38,770
spirit extracts I like the fold I like

2710
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:41,829
the fold

2711
01:57:38,770 --> 01:57:51,599
little directional though what's your

2712
01:57:41,828 --> 01:57:51,599
temp at trade secret can't tell you man

2713
01:57:52,408 --> 01:58:00,009
if you promise not to tell anybody it's

2714
01:57:55,899 --> 01:58:05,348
room temperature he's doing those room

2715
01:58:00,010 --> 01:58:08,260
temperature presses so much more left in

2716
01:58:05,349 --> 01:58:10,210
that puck - it's a 225 right now come on

2717
01:58:08,260 --> 01:58:12,369
Sven so what do you do will you flip

2718
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:16,599
that thing in half at least once and

2719
01:58:12,368 --> 01:58:19,029
press it again the pocket

2720
01:58:16,599 --> 01:58:22,029
absolutely they all go in for a second

2721
01:58:19,029 --> 01:58:24,099
press but on this state its own how many

2722
01:58:22,029 --> 01:58:25,630
times will you fold that screen that you

2723
01:58:24,099 --> 01:58:28,779
just pulled out when you fold it once

2724
01:58:25,630 --> 01:58:30,039
president just one time because if you

2725
01:58:28,779 --> 01:58:31,420
try to do any more than that you're

2726
01:58:30,039 --> 01:58:35,078
gonna end up ripping the [ __ ] paper

2727
01:58:31,420 --> 01:58:37,210
is the president yeah under set it's not

2728
01:58:35,078 --> 01:58:41,380
a good even press anymore once you make

2729
01:58:37,210 --> 01:58:44,739
it too too fast a second press do you do

2730
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:48,039
it at a higher temperature or a higher

2731
01:58:44,738 --> 01:58:52,209
pressure or same temperature same

2732
01:58:48,039 --> 01:58:54,578
pressure and she still squirts if you

2733
01:58:52,210 --> 01:59:00,520
did use a higher temperature or a higher

2734
01:58:54,578 --> 01:59:04,738
pressure would you get more or than the

2735
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:04,739
first or you understand what I'm asking

2736
01:59:05,250 --> 01:59:09,969
yeah you might get a little bit more but

2737
01:59:08,319 --> 01:59:12,368
it'll be a lot more to graze at that

2738
01:59:09,969 --> 01:59:19,118
point you start D carving it'll get dark

2739
01:59:12,368 --> 01:59:20,920
yeah I've done some testing and I've

2740
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:24,929
actually had second presses come back

2741
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:27,719
higher tea seed in the first press hmm I

2742
01:59:24,929 --> 01:59:31,019
don't know why

2743
01:59:27,719 --> 01:59:33,868
it's gonna how happened maybe because

2744
01:59:31,019 --> 01:59:37,710
there's less carbines because they went

2745
01:59:33,868 --> 01:59:38,670
off with the first press yeah yeah that

2746
01:59:37,710 --> 01:59:40,948
makes sense

2747
01:59:38,670 --> 01:59:42,630
what does make sense I love that we've

2748
01:59:40,948 --> 01:59:47,368
got a couple of people squishing rosin

2749
01:59:42,630 --> 01:59:49,559
in the room that's good fun I'm smoking

2750
01:59:47,368 --> 01:59:53,578
some rosin but I don't have a press

2751
01:59:49,559 --> 01:59:58,038
other than one little hair hair curler

2752
01:59:53,578 --> 02:00:01,819
presses that I've had for ever oh yeah

2753
01:59:58,038 --> 02:00:03,960
close work those get the job done

2754
02:00:01,819 --> 02:00:07,469

with he has different fires in the

2767
02:00:47,998 --> 02:00:51,748

02:01:01,559 --> 02:01:05,550
able to use the actual kit that he sent

2774
02:01:03,630 --> 02:01:08,760
me because he lacquered the wood frame

2775
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:10,440
and I don't I won't put resin near the

2776
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:14,969
lacquer it's been off gassing for the

2777
02:01:10,439 --> 02:01:18,988
last year straight so so Marcus as far

2778
02:01:14,969 --> 02:01:21,090
as I know the sad news and the folks up

2779
02:01:18,988 --> 02:01:23,998
in the Himalayas they're not help to

2780
02:01:21,090 --> 02:01:26,569
rosin yet are they they're they're hip

2781
02:01:23,998 --> 02:01:29,460
to a lot of other cannabis products but

2782
02:01:26,569 --> 02:01:32,639
they know Dreyse if they know water hash

2783
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:38,340
I think from you but they don't know

2784
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:40,260
rosin yeah I think rosin in India and

2785
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:41,400
the Himalayas is much like rosin in

2786
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:44,850
Jamaica

2787
02:01:41,399 --> 02:01:48,569
most of the hat if it's hash it comes

2788
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:51,420
out black and it just doesn't seem as

2789
02:01:48,569 --> 02:01:53,609
like of an like it just it just doesn't

2790
02:01:51,420 --> 02:01:55,469
look great it's you know like I pressed

2791
02:01:53,609 --> 02:01:57,210
hash and Jamaica was I was like man I

2792
02:01:55,469 --> 02:01:59,789
didn't want to smoke this but when you

2793
02:01:57,210 --> 02:02:01,170
press the bud and you get that golden

2794
02:01:59,789 --> 02:02:04,198
oil then there's something to be said

2795
02:02:01,170 --> 02:02:07,020
for yeah no that's what I was referring

2796
02:02:04,198 --> 02:02:11,698
to but I didn't even think compressing

2797
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:15,780
there that there ham ham press and rub -

2798
02:02:11,698 --> 02:02:17,879
but yeah I was thinking herb but I

2799
02:02:15,779 --> 02:02:21,359
hadn't heard of anybody doing it or

2800
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:23,219
knowing of it but the knowledge had not

2801
02:02:21,359 --> 02:02:25,859
spread back there yet

2802
02:02:23,219 --> 02:02:29,189
I followed electricity's a problem -

2803
02:02:25,859 --> 02:02:31,920
yeah I follow a guy on Instagram called

2804
02:02:29,189 --> 02:02:34,948
the Himalayan connection and he's

2805
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:39,510
obviously in the homeland looks can be

2806
02:02:34,948 --> 02:02:42,619
deceiving what city he's in yeah like

2807
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:48,300
Himachal Pradesh somewhere you know

2808
02:02:42,619 --> 02:02:50,698
photos range a bunch base camp one

2809
02:02:48,300 --> 02:03:03,449
around 2600 you know that's one of his

2810
02:02:50,698 --> 02:03:07,649
photos well I've seen a lot of hand rub

2811
02:03:03,448 --> 02:03:10,500
hash that was just inferior and this

2812
02:03:07,649 --> 02:03:15,469
seems like if you could get good ganja

2813
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:18,359
in theory you could make great rasam

2814
02:03:15,469 --> 02:03:20,908
right last time we were in the parvati

2815
02:03:18,359 --> 02:03:23,189
valley up in castle we were sitting in

2816
02:03:20,908 --> 02:03:24,960
the restaurant smoking weed cause it's

2817
02:03:23,189 --> 02:03:27,359
like the one place in all of India you

2818
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:31,408
could smoke weed in public and there was

2819
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:34,589
this ball dish guy there from Spain who

2820
02:03:31,408 --> 02:03:36,988
had a backpack on and he'd been there

2821
02:03:34,590 --> 02:03:41,640
for five months just making bubble hash

2822
02:03:36,988 --> 02:03:43,379
up in mallanna and wrassle and he wasn't

2823
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:45,510
doing rosin so it doesn't answer the

2824
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:47,819
rosin question but he was super stoked

2825
02:03:45,510 --> 02:03:50,270
to go up into the villages and make

2826
02:03:47,819 --> 02:03:52,289
bubble hash after they were done

2827
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:55,500
sometimes after they were done with

2828
02:03:52,289 --> 02:03:58,619
rubbing or even before so he was death

2829
02:03:55,500 --> 02:04:01,229
bubble hash man from Spain sitting there

2830
02:03:58,619 --> 02:04:04,349
for months at a time every fall well I

2831
02:04:01,229 --> 02:04:06,929
hope he does it before because after

2832
02:04:04,350 --> 02:04:09,990
they've hand rubbed it they've smeared

2833
02:04:06,930 --> 02:04:11,820
it up pretty bad yeah here's my buddy in

2834
02:04:09,989 --> 02:04:16,609

2835
02:04:11,819 --> 02:04:19,500

with like instead of 30 grams of hash

2865
02:05:34,069 --> 02:05:41,369
put in like three kilos or a big wheel

2866
02:05:38,539 --> 02:05:44,550
where it just as long as you keep

2867
02:05:41,369 --> 02:05:45,979
beating it it keeps squishing it yeah

2868
02:05:44,550 --> 02:05:49,440

02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:58,440
they're looking great I'm really really

2872
02:05:56,310 --> 02:06:00,240
quite enjoying it it's it's hypnotic

2873
02:05:58,439 --> 02:06:01,259
let's see what the chatroom has to say

2874
02:06:00,239 --> 02:06:06,090
about this because I haven't even

2875
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:08,429
checked on them for a while my bad what

2876
02:06:06,090 --> 02:06:10,250
are they saying what a beautiful couple

2877
02:06:08,429 --> 02:06:13,199
I always rinse before picking

2878
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:16,198
acupuncture is the [ __ ] Wow nice damn

2879
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:18,658
yeah that's what I was looking for the

2880
02:06:16,198 --> 02:06:22,698
new Yellow River let's do this the rosin

2881
02:06:18,658 --> 02:06:24,809
fall yeah that's that's pretty beautiful

2882
02:06:22,698 --> 02:06:25,919
that's what we wanted to see right there

2883
02:06:24,810 --> 02:06:28,199
look at that [ __ ] thing it's just

2884
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:31,020
cute that is so good

2885
02:06:28,198 --> 02:06:34,829
you need dabs you just toss here hash

2886
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:41,010
into the pressing the [ __ ] died over

2887
02:06:34,829 --> 02:06:45,140
it she's a squishy and maple butters

2888
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:45,140
like Oh God

2889
02:06:45,439 --> 02:06:53,009
60 grams the most I ever did actually

2890
02:06:48,359 --> 02:06:55,139
was I think 40 grams in one screen and I

2891
02:06:53,010 --> 02:06:57,869
pressed it and got like I don't know

2892
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:59,880
what it was 26 or 27 grams that was like

2893
02:06:57,869 --> 02:07:02,640
I haven't really gone back to doing any

2894
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:04,260
really big big big ones since then but

2895
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:05,699
it's nice to see this thing is how long

2896
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:09,810
will you squish this for three minutes

2897
02:07:05,698 --> 02:07:11,939
two minutes probably go close to four or

2898
02:07:09,810 --> 02:07:13,880
five all right yeah I believe it it's

2899
02:07:11,939 --> 02:07:18,509
just flowing so beautifully and look at

2900
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:23,520
now coming out a lighter color it's

2901
02:07:18,510 --> 02:07:25,500
unreal right that's a medallion right

2902
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:27,510
there it definitely is this is what I've

2903
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:30,689
been waiting for in the sense like BHO

2904
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:33,510
was just never my thing I just never had

2905
02:07:30,689 --> 02:07:42,629
an interest in it you know this is this

2906
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:44,340
is beautiful is wonderful I want to

2907
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:50,429
float down that little River and

2908
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:56,460
waterfall in a tube I want to go right

2909
02:07:50,429 --> 02:07:59,399
in with a snorkel my beard as a plant

2910
02:07:56,460 --> 02:08:02,880
breeder and grower what I think of

2911
02:07:59,399 --> 02:08:05,519
course is how can I make individual

2912
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:08,940
resin heads that are the size of a

2913
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:10,890
watermelon or at least a grape we could

2914
02:08:08,939 --> 02:08:13,859
start with grapes and work up to

2915
02:08:10,890 --> 02:08:17,310
watermelon just picking them off like so

2916
02:08:13,859 --> 02:08:19,739
you just pick one and you squeeze out a

2917
02:08:17,310 --> 02:08:21,840
rip

2918
02:08:19,739 --> 02:08:26,599
you could probably just stick a straw in

2919
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:29,340
it like a juice box that sounds good

2920
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:31,829
look at that medallion that's that's a

2921
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:36,180
nice little disc of rosin right there

2922
02:08:31,829 --> 02:08:38,819
like come on I wouldn't kick it out of

2923
02:08:36,180 --> 02:08:41,610
bed for eating crackers did you say yes

2924
02:08:38,819 --> 02:08:43,619
exactly I also would not kick it out of

2925
02:08:41,609 --> 02:08:52,289
bed for eating crackers that could get

2926
02:08:43,619 --> 02:08:54,930
away with anything I can't believe how

2927
02:08:52,289 --> 02:09:00,600
good yummy that looks just want to scoop

2928
02:08:54,930 --> 02:09:02,820
it and have a red ball rapid fire Ron

2929
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:05,520
Jones Ron Jones said that's bubble man's

2930
02:09:02,819 --> 02:09:06,349
toothpaste man I get cottonmouth just

2931
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:09,780
looking at it

2932
02:09:06,350 --> 02:09:12,539
that's hilarious this book I just want

2933
02:09:09,779 --> 02:09:14,909
to smoke some [ __ ] [ __ ] right now how

2934
02:09:12,539 --> 02:09:18,779
about that I got out of a barn we're

2935
02:09:14,909 --> 02:09:21,119
looking at business yes it looks a lot

2936
02:09:18,779 --> 02:09:23,399
like where's my bike like it really does

2937
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:26,970
look a lot like where's my bike present

2938
02:09:23,399 --> 02:09:35,879
what a color now I'll get pressed that

2939
02:09:26,970 --> 02:09:37,320
stuff and got thca out of it yeah this

2940
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:39,270
is some of this stuff that if I press in

2941
02:09:37,319 --> 02:09:41,189
a lower temp I'll get to th ei around

2942
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:43,740
the paper and will that stay

2943
02:09:41,189 --> 02:09:45,269
consistently like the way it looks or

2944
02:09:43,739 --> 02:09:52,139
will it butter out like does it have

2945
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:55,020
Heimlich D limonene and it'll definitely

2946
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:56,789
butter out but it won't be that fast you

2947
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:59,640
know it will happen like overnight like

2948
02:09:56,789 --> 02:10:01,800
[ __ ] it takes like a good four or five

2949
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:03,390
days sitting out at room temp to start

2950
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:06,930
the butter and then it turns into like a

2951
02:10:03,390 --> 02:10:09,360
sugary consistency you freeze it

2952
02:10:06,930 --> 02:10:11,579
immediately does it prevent it from

2953
02:10:09,359 --> 02:10:15,509
buttering out until you take it into

2954
02:10:11,579 --> 02:10:17,489
room temperature well I do have

2955
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:18,659
something that's in the jar that is in

2956
02:10:17,489 --> 02:10:21,359
the fridge that went right into the

2957
02:10:18,659 --> 02:10:24,510
fridge I mean it kind of keeps it in its

2958
02:10:21,359 --> 02:10:26,009
state but you know by the time you can

2959
02:10:24,510 --> 02:10:28,199
get it soft enough to get it out of the

2960
02:10:26,010 --> 02:10:29,650
jar and actually you know be able to

2961
02:10:28,199 --> 02:10:31,239
dabeh

2962
02:10:29,649 --> 02:10:35,739
we're gonna end up with problems anyway

2963
02:10:31,239 --> 02:10:38,409
cuz it'll pretty much be glass so

2964
02:10:35,739 --> 02:10:39,579
freezin that will not keep it in the

2965
02:10:38,409 --> 02:10:45,729
state it is in

2966
02:10:39,579 --> 02:10:47,470
now damn double pots yeah well it

2967
02:10:45,729 --> 02:10:48,789
definitely will it definitely will keep

2968
02:10:47,470 --> 02:10:51,550
it in the state that it's in right now

2969
02:10:48,789 --> 02:10:52,720
but like I said if you want to dab

2970
02:10:51,550 --> 02:10:55,239
something you're gonna have to let it

2971
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:57,220
thaw just to be able to get some to dab

2972
02:10:55,239 --> 02:10:59,979
so you're gonna go through those

2973
02:10:57,220 --> 02:11:01,090
different you know changes anyway no III

2974
02:10:59,979 --> 02:11:06,299
get it

2975
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:10,140
I'm just trying to understand the flux

2976
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:10,140
that is [ __ ] beautiful

2977
02:11:11,369 --> 02:11:19,960
right it's hilarious though this is what

2978
02:11:18,369 --> 02:11:25,170
I'm working with I gotta do all this

2979
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:25,170
[ __ ] so I've only just begun it's [ __ ]

2980
02:11:27,779 --> 02:11:36,250
yeah you need a continuous operation

2981
02:11:31,899 --> 02:11:39,189
that's a wheel instead of a press so you

2982
02:11:36,250 --> 02:11:41,380
just stick it in and when it takes two

2983
02:11:39,189 --> 02:11:46,750
or three minutes to go around the entire

2984
02:11:41,380 --> 02:11:48,880
wheel and it's done yeah nice collection

2985
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:51,430
like way to collect though like not have

2986
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:59,319
to like peel it off parts [ __ ] just

2987
02:11:51,430 --> 02:12:02,430
let it drip into a pot very nice yeah

2988
02:11:59,319 --> 02:12:08,889
that definitely puts our squish to shame

2989
02:12:02,430 --> 02:12:12,570
let's see you squish those 10 grams of

2990
