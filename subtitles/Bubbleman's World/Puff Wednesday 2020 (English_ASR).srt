of town and we're gonna be meeting up at

18
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:05,969
Cypress so I thought it would be kind of

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,618
a cool idea to you know go both meet up

20
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:10,379
there I got a couple of chairs I don't

21
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:11,849
know if it's raining up there or snowing

22
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,908
fingers crossed that it's snowing

23
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:18,149
otherwise we're gonna get really really

24
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,830
wet fingers crossed on that but yeah

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,189
just super excited to do a little puff

26
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,900
Wednesday with you guys just super

27
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:26,639

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,790
weekly puff Wednesday show both John and

35
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:44,129
I so get ready for an incredible show

36
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,439
today we're going to be puffing up at

37
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:49,188
Cypress Mountain I doubt we're gonna be

38
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,798
hitting the slopes as Johnny B is not

39
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:53,928
in the best shape for such things having

40
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,450
been quite injured in an accident really

41
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:58,609
you know he really is a disabled person

42
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,679
even though he has such energy and moved

43
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:02,059
so incredibly he can't just do

44
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:04,789
everything so today we're going to do as

45
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,100
much fun stuff as we can puff as much as

46
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:09,830

47
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:12,169

day of the year which is hilarious

118

121
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:40,980
first video of 2020 on my channel but

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,189
really it's kind of the last video

123
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,720
filmed in 2019 but I figured [ __ ] Johnny

124
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,540
was willing to come all the way out from

125
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,390
from the the Ford I was willing to come

126
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:54,360
all the way out from the Bay and I'm

127
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,949
gonna deliver you a beautiful on-ramp

128
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,330
you know I've been kind of like looking

129
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:59,069
at some of the new resin and stuff like

130
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:00,329
I like I mean I got something that we're

131
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:04,110
gonna show when we go down

132
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:06,300
yeah yeah of course but I mean it's been

133
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,030
quite a year for resin - oh I feel like

134
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,090
it has like I've seen so much and when

135
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:14,609
we talked about how rosin was going to

136
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:16,288
be the death of BHO if you laughed and

137
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,629
called it it called it you called it you

138
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:20,519
see it how it's really so much done such

139
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:22,680
a full circle over the lines in grams

140
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,538
it's absolutely it's truly the death

141
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,069
made that video I was like well that's

142
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,509
kind of a bold statement and I'll tell

143
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:33,360
you only you could have made that video

144
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:35,070
had I made that video but you made it it

145
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,668
was perfect it got millions of [ __ ]

146
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:41,519
hits tons of people saw it and YouTube

147
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:44,250
ripped it down I don't see too much BHO

148
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,528
I mean there's you know listen the the

149
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,470
og guys guys like Tim from kind

150
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:56,458
selections that's different eyes like

151
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:58,769
exactly just the death of this [ __ ]

152
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:01,049
kind of a bad vibe people blowing

153
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:02,700
themselves up you know fires garages

154
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:04,129
that's what we're talking about we're

155
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,600
not talking about people who are using

156
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:08,730
hydrocarbons responsibly to extract

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,690
cannabis resin with that's not what

158
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,820
we're doing people weren't blowing

159
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,320
[ __ ] butane talking about high school

160
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,490
kids we're talking about people that

161
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,440
were just getting into this [ __ ] and

162
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,079
having a very bad time and the fact is

163
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,720
is that rosin change the game and for

164
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:24,719
that it truly was the death of that

165

195
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,179
just been doing my thing trying to you

196
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,429
know trying to take things pretty

197
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:43,069
seriously you know a little more serious

198
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:44,719
than maybe the the year prior we were

199
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,310
having a lot of fun and [ __ ] did get

200
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,019
pretty serious you know like you know

201
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:51,229
there's been some some pretty big plays

202
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:52,789
there have you look in 2019 some serious

203
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,279
might be throwing at the industry and

204
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:57,259
some big people came in we see some huge

205
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,539
moves with legalization it's mean like

206
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:01,700
game on it's true like everything that

207
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:04,039
we fought for and talked about over the

208
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,440
years the pup Wednesdays and before that

209
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,659
and just the years and years and now

210
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,220
you're like whoa you're kind of numb

211
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:13,490
because it's just kind of you know it's

212
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,340
on its it's like dunkey different but

213
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,060
now it's it's truly on like I think this

214
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:23,480
2.0 2020 mm-hmm

215
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:26,659
4:20 it was like it's pretty beautiful

216
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,490
but we've always had a positive outlook

217
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:31,909
on things and it's funny because you

218
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,500
know you've had every reason to not have

219
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:34,850
a positive outlook on things and that's

220
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,690
one of the things I love about you that

221
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,970
you you take your your your bumps in the

222
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,160
road your you know what would you call

223
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,170
it the

224
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,730
just difficulties you know that that's

225
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:47,679
sort of like things that get tossed at

226
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,269
you and you just you just live right

227
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,709
through them you can turn it into a

228
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:52,389
positive thing cuz everything's for a

229
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,860
reason I mean you and I could easily be

230
00:11:52,389 --> 00:12:02,679
from it we could be complaining about

231
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:03,190
the legalization you know what but you

232
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,620
know what

233
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,850
you're right I have heard so many people

234
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:21,669
complaining and bitching about

235
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:23,620
legalization it is really ok I just came

236
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:32,289
out of a coma I'm in the hospital and

237
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:34,320
they're gonna give me these our peers

238
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:37,959

239
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,820

00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,600
on a side no it's not the plant side

243
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,370
exactly there's no side too big here no

244
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,769
and I think that's really what it comes

245
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:54,789
down to is is is really it since is

246
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:58,259

industry people and I really had a big

258
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,879
look on people's like where's all the

259
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:36,610
money goes it's really easy and simple I

260
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:41,500
said before everybody was growing and

261
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:43,810
they were supplying an industry well now

262
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,539
we have a corporate industry who we do

263
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:47,769
and the money is spent is going into

264
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:49,449
corporate and that money goes into the

265
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:50,860
corporate bank account it's not being

266
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,340
spent in the industry people are going

267
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,889
on

268
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,450
that new powder movies or I knew they're

269
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:57,730
not they're not visiting the stores as

270
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,850
much as what they use thing really see

271
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,620
this I'm like well going their own for

272
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,080
they don't start going back to the shops

273
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:08,500
and find the role he's buying the bags

274
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,570
by the screens find a new pipe rolling

275
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,980
tray getting that new hemp jacket or

276
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,600
whatever you know what I mean yeah

277
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,860
because they need it because they're

278
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,879
gonna need the supplies are gonna need

279
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,250
the nutrients they're gonna need

280
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,720
whatever they need for that for true and

281
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,009
so that's what that was kind of relieved

282
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,899

bubbler people their bubbler buckets do

301
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:06,250
you know my first customer on overgrow

302
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:08,439
calm in 1999 his name was high grade and

303
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,539
what he was famous for was his bubbler

304
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,550
buckets he made those same buckets out

305
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:14,279
of 5-gallon buckets and he taught people

306
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:16,329
how to do it and he grew the most

307
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:21,610
unbelievable cannabis he'd pull out the

308
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:32,320
roots this is how it used to be put a

309
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:33,879
disc in the top and put the rock so it

310
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,700
would like instead of just dripping it

311
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,230
might like spray you know get into that

312
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,750
sort of the different sprays and how

313
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:43,210
that mind made these little emitters in

314
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,740
the boxes so they would spin nice like

315
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,740
the people came up with some pretty cool

316
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,820
stuff industry it is definitely one of

317
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,860
the best things about the cannabis

318
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:54,400
industry and that's why that I hope the

319
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,190
corporate aspect I'm not at my anti the

320
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,870
corporate aspect we need us I joined it

321
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:02,230
in the sense of where part of them

322
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,289
instead of joining an actual big company

323
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,409
like a canopy or an Aurora

324
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:10,409
or a tilray I just started my own I

325
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:12,028
started Embarq health with with my with

326
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:14,308
my two founding partners Michael and

327
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:15,808
Bruce and we just went about it in in

328
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:18,328
the way that like look we don't have to

329
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,889
like sell out to a big company we can

330
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:21,719
become a company and if that company

331
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:24,329
becomes big so be it

332
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,100
our mission is to touch as many people

333
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:28,399
as possible we want to be able to make

334
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,829
hashes and oils and get it out to them

335
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,479
it's so important those extractions and

336
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:36,048
in getting we talked about and I talked

337
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:39,179
about it through - that's why I have

338
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:40,350
talked about your extractions mm-hmm but

339
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:41,458
it really comes down to when you're

340
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,928
growing your own you got to be able to

341
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,918
extract that medicine out of there and

342
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:45,869
be able to be able to store it properly

343
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:47,278
be able to have it a certain time scene

344
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:49,019
and stuff like that and there's so many

345
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,028
different ways from oils to hashes to

346
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,159
sifts I mean these all these little

347
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:54,720
things that that's kind of why I really

348
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,858
being kind of really pushing to get

349
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,278
people to grow their own because I see

350
00:16:55,859 --> 00:17:00,509
how much it helps me every day yeah a

351
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:02,308
little push now don't get us wrong

352
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:05,308
not everyone can grow their own cannabis

353
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:06,838
it's just no realistic but when you have

354
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:09,359
something like John kind of in your

355
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:10,558
corner pushing yeah yeah what do you

356
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,928
need you know helping you with those

357
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,548
little pain points which is what my four

358
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:16,649
plants I got you we got your four

359
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:19,439
appliances we got your four is all about

360
00:17:16,648 --> 00:17:21,739
is reducing those pain points so you can

361
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,819
just access everything in one spot

362
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,798
anyway we've turned this into a bloody

363
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:26,928
commercial no screw this what you know

364
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:29,038
we're talking about here right now

365
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:31,649
everybody's smoking weed yeah yeah

366
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,319
that's true 2020 is about growing it's a

367
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:36,689
book it's about growing into 2020 and I

368
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,908
just think it's like 2020 is just gonna

369
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,590
be this a fantastic thing is where and I

370
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:42,600
talk to people I think like I was at the

371
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:45,119
hydro stores and talk with you it's just

372
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,558
kind of like we had legalization 2019

373
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,869
there is kind of like this but I think

374
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:58,168
2020 is a whole new video that's cuz

375
00:17:48,869 --> 00:18:00,058
you're a positive mother [ __ ] it's

376
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:01,889
just like you know what these dabs they

377
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:02,759
keep getting better people keep getting

378
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:04,740
better resin

379
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,929
I keep seeing better weed you keep

380
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,058
seeing all of this it's true like I

381
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:11,309
don't see pictures of like I say shadows

382
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:14,009
anymore I see pictures of of melty heads

383
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:15,750
we see pictures of all sorts of raw

384
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:18,900
Rosen's and colors and most of that's

385
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,059
all - beautiful isn't it amazing it's

386
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,800
nice I like it and all the great macro

387
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:27,119
photographers that are photographing oh

388
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:29,069
my god trichomes shale and you know I'm

389
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,109
spacing on a lot of their names but I

390
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:32,399
need to do a special video just shouting

391
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:36,059
those guys out because they have taken

392
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,460
it to a level that is so much per

393
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,440
surpassed what we were doing just even

394
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,380
in the last five to ten years that it's

395
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,539
been a real honor and a privilege to be

396
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,360
able to you know watch these guys use

397
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,980
yeah just crush it out so why don't you

398
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,569
and I figure out our next point of

399
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,160
action whether that's to walk through

400
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:55,439
this parking lot whether it's to go eat

401
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,690
some food with all the skiers we are on

402
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,150
Cypress Mountain right now overlooking

403
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,759
Vancouver you can't see anything it's

404
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,290
all clouded out and rainy don't smile I

405
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,089
can't believe people are here

406
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:08,220
snowboarding in Spain it's New Years Eve

407
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:09,899
but it's pouring rain and they're like

408
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,450
diehards you know what when I was 18

409
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,700
years old I took a bus for three hours

410
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,160
and if it was raining how was on that

411
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,930
mountain I feel you I see a lot of

412
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,700
people who see Washington and I'm like

413
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,769
you know what they drove a long way and

414
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,069
they're like we're doing it yeah it's

415
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:27,450
you guys I'm such a snob when it comes

416
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:31,289
to the mountain yeah me too

417
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:35,250
but yeah when it's raining I have a hard

418
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:37,379
time it's I feel that I the snow gets so

419
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,349
heavy and wet that it slows my board

420
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,360
down in a way we call it mashed potatoes

421
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:44,490
my feet don't want to walk it feels like

422
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:46,169
my knees are gonna be injured so in

423
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,150
other words we're gonna kind of leave

424
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,289
the mountains we're probably gonna leave

425
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,180
the mountain we might go to the beach

426
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:54,420
we're gonna bring you with us so

427
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:56,130
wherever we do end up you're coming so I

428
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:00,380
guess for them it's just as simple as a

429
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,380
simple transition it is one of these

430
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:21,519
that's pretty much how that's played out

431
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:25,120
for me every single time right just

432
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:27,220
Rockstar parking when they what is so

433
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,689

434
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,429

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:35,169
stay dry well would this be called

436
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:37,570

437
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:39,669

anywhere you can smoke cigarettes we can

582
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:49,299
dab the thing about John and I is we're

583
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:52,219
not looking to make people uncomfortable

584
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:53,509
yet at the same time we are looking to

585
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,690
push the envelope

586
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:57,890
not so much civil disobedience but just

587
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,390
educating people and sometimes that

588
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,150
education needs to happen through its

589
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:04,580
culture not just being exposed to us

590
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:18,650
sitting on a bench and something a bomb

boundaries though and that's what it's

598
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:37,700
