a little bit of cannabis education to a

291
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,278
a concerned mom and father who were on

292
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,919
the plane and as they were waiting for

293
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:22,200
the bathroom I started talking about the

294
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,600
endoc canabo system and she's mentioning

295
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,120
how her son is on butter and well here

296
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,038
we are picking up our bags and she wants

297
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:30,119
to know more about how and what we're

298
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:31,919
doing with bubble hash and proper

299
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,158
natural extractions knowing that her son

300
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,919
is going to use cannabis for a

301
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:36,440
medication she wanted to find out

302
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,159
cleaner ways and methods well she's

303
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,000
worried about him she's worried that

304
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,400
that that he's inhaling something that's

305
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,960
not safe and she's worried that

306
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,559
potentially GES and stuff like that

307
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,919
potentially the kids that are making it

308
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,000
could could blow up so I mean it's was

309

00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:30,159
overlooking the ocean but really

502
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:30,158

506
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,759

507
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,000
this I hit him pretty

508
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,319
hard but it's like an initial cop it's

509
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,319
not like that followup like I can't

510

control cough was a little bit that t

511
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,000
see this one that uncontrollable thing

512
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,960
seems to be a little bit of a chemical

513
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,599
issue where all of a sudden you've done

514
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,480
some crazy concentration you're

515
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,959

times from D well let's get you on the

517
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,079
Sal off of

518
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,158
that we were just talking to some

519
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:21,879
parents some concerned parents for their

520
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:25,039
son their son was probably 18 or 19 or

521
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,519
20 and and somehow we started talk John

522

524
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:35,200
concentrates and you know not solvent

525

overall and I just said from a parental

529
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,519
