[Music]

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,760
for some of the artifacts and stuff

3
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,518
after too.

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,599
Okay.

5
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,598
Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.

6
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,359
Bubble Man's World currently over at

7
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,558
Chris Bennett. Thanks for having me

8
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,960
over, dude. Hey, always a pleasure,

9
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,439
brother. One of our regular Hashurch

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,719
panelists who was uh lucky enough to or

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,159
we were lucky enough to have you come

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,558
back yesterday and share a little bit of

13
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,199
your historical information on cannabis

14
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,718
and all things cannabis related. Today,

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,920
we're just uh kind of thinking we're

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,920
going to have a little bit more of a

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,520
conversation on uh the knowledge that

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,039
Chris knows. And I thought while we were

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,520
doing it, we would puff some bowls. So,

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,840
I brought a little uh D420K dry sift and

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,120
a little West Coast concentrate bubble

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,920
hash and a little Heavenly Days flour

23
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,599
rosin. So, that's kind of a nice little

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,600
I feel like these three guys right here

25
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,239
are sort of doing it the solventless

26
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,079
quiver as high a quality as it can be

27
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,000
done right now. So, did you press this

28
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,760
yourself or No, no, he they pressed it

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,920
up for me and and brought it as uh

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,320
pressed flower rosin. So, Oh, cool. Very

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,840
nice. Rockstar. I know a cultivar that

32
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:26,158
Remo is uh quite fond of. How how much

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,719
weed would it take to get a press like

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,159
that? You know, it's it's it's a

35
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:34,478
difficult sort of to know, but I'd say

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:37,118
anywhere between 8 and maybe 22%, eight

37
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,560
being pretty low, 22 being pretty high.

38
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:39,879
It's the internet, so there's always

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,400
going to be someone saying, "Well, I get

40
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,158
30%." I get Well, okay, but there might

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,680
be a moisture content.

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,000
But it's pretty simple to literally take

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,720
a hair straightener and squeeze a bud

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,478
that's a g

45
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,039
weigh and you'll get a real quick idea.

46
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,560
I think it's an amazing way for

47
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,320
dispensaries to test cannabis that comes

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,000
through their doors to find out what

49
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,839
kind of canabonoid and tarpine profile

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,599
they have on it. Not necessarily like a

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,759
readout on a GLC or an HLC, but pretty

52
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,159
pretty obvious when you squeeze a bud

53
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,719
and you get a big shot of of resin. Hey,

54
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,359
look at that. That's so awesome. What's

55
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,520
your cat's name again? Shankar. Shankar.

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
Boom. Shankar. Boom. Shank. Dude, I'm

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,959
doing it right now. That is so awesome

58
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,318
that Shankar went and said hi to the

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,719
camera. All right. I wish I remembered

60
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:30,399
one of my uh full

61
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:33,120
boom boom mahadev. Boom shankar. Boom.

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,000
Haranja. Harihanja. The one that I

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,159
learned years ago was like boom shankar.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,239
Alohaka balanth. Yeah. Ombalanth is

65
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,519
definitely one. That's like one that the

66
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,120
crazier they can get pretty loud. We're

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,120
talking about of course Babas in India

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,280
lighting chillums and some of them are

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,840
quite the character and you'll see them

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,919
really say out uh like a prayer or a

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,039
what would you call it? A puja or a Oh,

72
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,559
like a little prayer. Yeah, it's a

73
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,079
prayer. It's a positive vibration put

74
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,560
out to the universe right before we

75
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,480
light up the chillum. So, uh I'll show

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,318
you some antique chillums too later.

77
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,079
Beautiful antique chillums here. You

78
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,399
know, I loved my trip to India. It was

79
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,959
definitely a never to be forgotten

80
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,039
experience, but uh I think Nepal is soon

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,640
to be on the You should go to Nepal with

82
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,079
me. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. We got Mark

83
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,000
Ros. They're probably getting ready to

84
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,519
relegalize the whole hash thing there. I

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,519
bet. And I'm watching the West pretty

86
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,519
seriously. When I started the hash bag

87
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,039
company, bubble bags, and Mark was

88
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,439
manufacturing for me. You could go to

89
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,519
Nepal during Shiva Ratchery, and the

90
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,039
king still released the ornament log

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,799
that they that they came out of the

92
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,400
king's chambers, and the ornament log

93
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,200
was full of puja and flowers and

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,840
incense. and charis. And it was free

95
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,679
Charus for the Babas. Google that. How

96
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,239
far back does that one go? Yeah. Yeah. A

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,239
long time ago. Incredible.

98
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,439
Well, you know, the smoking though of it

99
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,199
and chills and pipes that it's thought

100
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,280
to not come until after the discovery of

101
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,199
the new world and tobacco smoking and

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,919
they would eat the hash, they would burn

103
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,000
it in temples and they would drink bong,

104
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,000
right? But uh or you know other

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
dectibles as well other preparations of

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,080
food but the smoking and chillums and

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,239
stuff like that this general view is is

108
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,239
that that came with tobacco smoking and

109
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,959
then it really took off with weed

110
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,758
smoking you know. Well I'll tell you I

111
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,280
definitely didn't meet too many babas in

112
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,520
India that were smoking pure chillums.

113
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:29,599
Yeah. They were all mixing with tobacco.

114
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,879
Yeah. Yeah. And unfortunately for me,

115
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,320
not the kind of tobacco that I would

116
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,879
have preferred like the Jamaicans when

117
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,399
they mix with tobacco. It's very much

118
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,478
Jamaican tobacco that they grow in the

119
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,478
bush. In India, for some reason, it's

120
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,279
cigarettes. Yeah. And so it's strange

121
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:46,079
because you think cigarettes cost money.

122
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,918
It's an added amount. And Bubbas, for

123
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,839
the most part, you know, at least the

124
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,159
ones that I was hanging out with weren't

125
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,638
really what I would call like monetarily

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,919
well off. Yeah. They don't own a lot of

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,079
things. I mean, some do. You can see

128
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,240
babas with fancy watches and and cars

129
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,399
and the whole nine yards. It's India so

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,400
they have every aspect of availability

131
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,159
that you could possibly imagine. But

132
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,279
most of the Babas that I met were very

133
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,039
much you know humble like a holy man you

134
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,599
know like a guy that's walking

135
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,038
everywhere he goes. They don't often I I

136
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,680
the few babas that I actually made

137
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,918
friends with didn't go in vehicles. They

138
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,600
wouldn't go in in electric vehicles and

139
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,519
planes or anything like that. They were

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,639
walking everywhere they went. And you

141
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,159
talk to these guys and they're telling

142
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,600
you about their trips to Nepal and

143
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,800
they're talking about Tibet and they're

144
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,879
talking about the south of India. That's

145
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,520
a phenomenal amount of traveling on your

146
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,199
feet to really wrap your mind around,

147
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,279
you know. Absolutely. And of course, the

148
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,360
thing that blew me away, it's not like

149
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,359
they're taking roads and stuff. They're

150
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,720
like these babas from Nepal come down

151
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,038
for like a one of these events, a big

152
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,720
holy event like a

153
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:53,279
kumba and you can see dudes literally

154
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,199
with purple legs that have been coming

155
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,519
out of the mountains walking in the snow

156
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,120
for days, right? Wearing just a loin

157
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:03,359
cloth and you're like, "Okay, that seems

158
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,199
like a medical emergency." Yeah. But it

159
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,759
it doesn't become a medical emergency.

160
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,600
They just they just go on with their 6

161
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,199
to 8 months later, their legs turn back

162
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
to the normal color. I was just like,

163
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,120
"Holy shit." Yeah. And some of those

164
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,478
trails are old, man. Like they're like,

165
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,800
you know, people have been walking that

166
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,800
same trail for thousands of years. Thank

167
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,918
you. When you say old, you really need

168
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,360
to define that it is many thousands of

169
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,038
years. Their history goes back far. And

170
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,879
that's you feel that vibe when you're in

171
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,079
India sitting on the Ganes on the banks

172
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,839
and you're hanging out with these holy

173
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,519
men and you're smoking chillums of

174
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,399
charis that was grown in these same

175
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,399
mountains. And for me, you know, like I

176
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,918
don't personally follow any of their

177
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,879
religious beliefs, but I was intrigued

178
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:49,359
by them and uh honored to learn about

179
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,800
them by being immersed in them. Yeah.

180
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,560
Right. You know, cuz people always ask

181
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,560
me, "Oh, are you a Rasta? Are you I'm

182
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,160
like, I don't know what my religious

183
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,000
belief system is. I'm certainly not an

184
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
atheist. I guess I believe in energy."

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,598
Yeah. You know, that's usually what I

186
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,038
say. I believe in energy. Energy comes

187
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,800
and goes. Well, I've studied a lot about

188
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,240
religion. I really like the whole Sheba

189
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,478
thing. you know, there's like so much

190
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,400
cool stuff about it and absolutely uh

191
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,279
some of the texts are really great and

192
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,598
uh well, would you not say that a lot of

193
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:18,399
um some of maybe not a lot of the

194
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,079
Rastaparian belief system comes from

195
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,758
that vein? Yeah. Yeah, definitely. You

196
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,519
know, it would seem from what what we

197
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:29,199
know that uh Rastaparianism is like a a

198
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,680
symbiosis of Bible-fed uh Christian

199
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,598
slaves coming into contact with Indian

200
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,400
migrant workers. And thus you have the

201
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:39,000
chalice chillum and kellyweed and the

202
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:43,519
dreadlocks like the sadus wear. Even

203
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,399
even the flat Jamaican patty I swear to

204
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,758
God is a flattened samosa you know like

205
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,000
it's like a samosa that they just

206
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,360
flattened out and made into patties. I I

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,240
definitely feel that as well. The dreads

208
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,680
for sure all of the the dreads that I

209
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,598
met in Jamaica who always turns like

210
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,478
ganja you know it's definitely Indian

211
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,478
term. Well, for sure. Uh the the longest

212
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,519
dreadlocks that you will see in Jamaica

213
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,360
generally will be on uh a [ __ ] as they

214
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,359
call them, but it's basically a African

215
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,160
Indian uh mix, right?

216
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,120
Very cool. Yeah, my buddy Indian, he's

217
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,400
he was he is a [ __ ] as well. Great

218
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,879
guy. Uh has dreads that are

219
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,038
14 or 15 feet long now. It's got to be

220
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,199
hard on your neck, I'll tell you. He's

221
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,598
only got three or four of them, but wow,

222
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,360
it's amazing that hair could grow that

223
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,958
long. Yeah, I know. For sure. Here's a

224
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,959

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,320
it? Yeah, sure. Yeah, get good there.

228
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,919
There you go. Bubble it up. You're

229
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,120

230
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:52,879
a nice smooth

231
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:56,200
pipe. Boom. Been puffing bowls with this

232
00:08:52,879 --> 00:09:02,039
guy for at least 20

233
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,040
years. At least 20 years. There you go.

234
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,799
Not too shabby. Yeah, definitely. Little

235
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:13,679
bit of flour. The intake, right? Two I

236
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,439
always say two thumbs up for two tears

237
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,838
down. There you go. If you can get a

238
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,880
tear in each eye from your rip, then you

239
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,200
have done almost everything right.

240
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,679
Well, what uh what say we show them some

241
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,959
fun uh art artifacts? Yeah, for sure.

242
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,879
Well, you know, yesterday we were

243
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:32,719
talking about the Cythians and uh

244
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,559
so the Cythians basically did the burn

245
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,120
it in a bowl type of thing. Is that was

246
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:41,039
Yeah, they would have like brazers that

247
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,320
um they would fill with hot rocks,

248
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,958
right? And uh yeah, Ben has an

249
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,278
incredible one at his museum right at

250
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,359
the front door. Oh, wow. In Barcelona

251
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,200
here. Just give me a second. This is

252
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,839
stuck in there. Oh, no problem. Take

253
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,278
your time. Kind of fun to check out. The

254
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,320
uh Chris's place is uh well ripe with uh

255
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,958
artifacts. And so this is like a cy a

256
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,800
diarama of some cythians there. And you

257
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,278
can see the guy's got like the horn cup

258
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,000
in his hand. Oh yeah. And uh um this is

259
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,679
how they looked like. They had full body

260
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
tattoos. Very interesting race. The men

261
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,919
fought uh in battles alongside the

262
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
women. Uh I mean the women fought

263
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:23,519
alongside the men. uh they had a a

264
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,839
transvestite priesthood. Um so they were

265
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,480
a pretty interesting ancient culture.

266
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,600
They were and uh um what's the timeline

267
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,360
for the cyians? Oh, you know Cythians a

268
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,839
blanket term for all these indo-uropean

269
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,759
tribes. Uh um so it's kind of this tribe

270
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,880
but this you know it's like 2700 years

271
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:43,838
ago uh 2500 years ago. Herodotus around

272
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,759
500 BC wrote about the Cythianerary

273
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,519
ritual where they would uh take the

274
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,439
heated rocks in a brazer and put it in a

275
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,839
tent and then throw cannabis and then

276
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,440
howl with pleasure, you know. Um and

277
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,680
then that was later found um to be uh

278
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,279
correct through archaeological finds by

279
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:03,679
uh Sergio Rudenko in Russia and uh um

280
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,120
they found the brazers and the tents

281
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,719
that were doing it. And then more

282
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,440
recently

283
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,959
um there was this find of uh gold cups

284
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,720
and bowls that were used for drinking

285
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,199
cannabis because they were also uh

286
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,680
drinkers of cannabis, right? Um and this

287
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,320
was mistakenly reported as bongs in the

288
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,919
mainstream media. One one paper got it

289
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,399
wrong, one big paper and then everybody

290
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,799
else uh uh got the same mistake wrong.

291
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,320
But the archaeologists involved uh say

292
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,078
that that that was actually used for

293
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,760
drinking hyoma which follows in line

294
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:32,719
with my last book cannabis and soma

295
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,559
solution where I was shown these

296
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,278
indo-uropean tribes were drinking

297
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,599
cannabis and a soma preparation not the

298
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,679
ammonita mascaria has been been widely

299
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,720
suggested right um you know cannabis and

300
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,519
other things and there's been other

301
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,160
archaeological finds like uh uh Victor

302
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,200
Seranadi's find in the bacteria margana

303
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:54,240
archaeological complex of temple sites

304
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,560
where they recovered uh uh residues of

305
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,879
cannabis, poppy, and ephedra, and

306
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,239
fossilized impressions of cannabis seeds

307
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,519
at sites where they were making the

308
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,240
sacred beverage. Uh um and that even

309
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,200
this even fits in with that amazing find

310
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,879
in China of 2,700 year old perfectly

311
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,639
preserved cannabis indica. Uh um and uh

312
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,958
this is female cannabis that was grown

313
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,959
for its psychoactive properties, which I

314
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,799
considered a spiritual thing. And it was

315
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,000
fun found with the mummified remains of

316
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:26,000
a Caucasian man in China. Uh um and this

317
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,559
is the Guushi culture that was living in

318
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,240
uh China from about 2,000 BC to about

319
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:35,359
400 BC. And uh they were known to be in

320
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,600
trade with this uh temple that I was

321
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,240
talking about in Bactria Margiana

322
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,040
because they found items at both sites

323
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,360
that came from either site. And um as

324
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,199
well the cythians that were found with

325
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,959
the gold cups and bowls with the same

326
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,360
preparation, same ingredients that they

327
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,359
found uh in this bacterium margar

328
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,680
complex uh opium and cannabis mixed

329
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,000
together uh um were known as the Helma

330
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:02,479
var gatherers and they would uh transfer

331
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,559
the weed growing up in this region in

332
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,320
China, you know, back into the Bactria

333
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:10,879
Margiana archaeological complex. Can you

334
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,959
imagine the level of knowledge that the

335
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,480
Vatican probably has about all of these

336
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,879
sacraments because it was of course

337
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,039
their mission to replace all of those

338
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,000
sacraments. Yeah. Well, the dark ages,

339
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,759
you know, is like, you know, really the

340
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,720
whole period and the rise of Catholicism

341
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,439
is was basically through the suppression

342
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,278
of pagan and gnostic cults that use

343
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,480
cannabis and other anthogens. Any

344
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,039
plant-based medicine, they were

345
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,120
replacing with the the blood of Christ.

346
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,559
Blood of Christ. Yeah. The wine and

347
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,278
stuff. Although, you know, it's

348
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,518
interesting like uh um there's this

349
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,000
common belief that in 1484, one of the

350
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,399
popes uh decreed cannabis a devil's

351
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,399
sacrament. And uh Tom Hats is a friend

352
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,839
of mine who speaks Latin and wrote a

353
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,958
great book about witches ointments. He

354
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,240
went back and looked at the Latin

355
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,039
documents. Makes no reference to

356
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,278
cannabis at all. Uh um there are some

357
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,599
other papal bulls where they're you know

358
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,838
against elixirs and potions associated

359
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,519
with witchcraft and cannabis may have

360
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,120
fallen into that category but cannabis

361
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,440
isn't specifically mentioned. And

362
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,839
there's even a 12th century pope that

363
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,279
wrote about cannabis wine and prescribed

364
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,600
cannabis for a number of medical

365
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:18,720
ailments in some treaties although this

366
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,920
pope was later accused of witchcraft uh

367
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,360
um after he died you know. So uh um it's

368
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,198
it's an interesting relationship.

369
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,600
There's also this like uh I'm writing

370
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,599
this book right now about uh cannabis in

371
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,000
the occult. It's called cannabis arcanum

372
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,159
liver 420. And one of the interesting

373
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,759
things I found out is there's this whole

374
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,078
in the 10th century in England there was

375
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,679
this holy uh oil comes with all these

376
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,078
prayers and stuff like that and cannabis

377
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:46,239
was one of the ingredients in that and

378
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:49,120
uh um a a 12th century magical text uh

379
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,720
sephar raziel which uh uh came from uh

380
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,198
originally from Jewish sources but was

381
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,560
very popular in in the medieval period

382
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:58,399
in in Europe. It has a uh recipe for a

383
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,559
cannabis ointment that's used for

384
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,240
scrying in a mirror. And so they would

385
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,000
rub this cannabis based ointment with

386
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,639
other herbal ingredients and then they

387
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,919
would look into a darkened mirror until

388
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,240
they saw a vision. Kind of like looking

389
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,759
in a crystal ball. And it's interesting

390
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,919
because right up until uh uh the 19th

391
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:20,319
century there's these guys like Lewis

392
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:23,360
Halons and uh Dr. Pascal Beverly

393
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,839
Randolph and other cultists that were

394
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,480
using cannabis in exactly the same way

395
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,440
as this 12th century reference to this

396
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,159
cannabis ointment in in in the sephur

397
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,560
raziel. And so there's like 8 800 years

398
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,399
of continued use of this magical recipe

399
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,958
of cannabis that we know of that we know

400
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,039
of. And then if you consider that the

401
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,159
ancient references to cannibosum, which

402
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,399
a lot of people have probably heard

403
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,919
about, were in fact Hebrew references to

404
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,399
cannabis. Then Moses becomes like a

405
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,078
shaman who ingests a psychoactive

406
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,639
substance, cannabis in this pray, burns

407
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,479
it on the altar as an oil, you know, and

408
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,879
then he speaks to the Lord in the pillar

409
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,680
of smoke uh over the altar. So this is

410
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,600
an act of catnomy, which means to uh uh

411
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,758
um see visions and smoke. And cannabis

412
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,680
was also used as that. They would burn

413
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,839
lots of cannabis along with frankincense

414
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,838
and myrrh and other substances and

415
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,120
create this smoky atmosphere that was

416
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,440
both psychoactive, but the smoke itself

417
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,360
was the physical element that the demons

418
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,800
and stuff would take form in like where

419
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,480
they'd be able to take shape in where

420
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,958
you'd be able to see them. May have been

421
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,959
just the effects of uh the psychoactive

422
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:33,359
properties mixed with the visuals of

423
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:36,239
candles. It fits so well when you have

424
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,000
experienced psychedelics. Yeah. Yeah. If

425
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,519
you've ever experienced a psychedelic,

426
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,879
and when I say a psychedelic, like for

427
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,278
me, I'm not really talking about like

428
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,600
you took an ecstasy pill, I'm more along

429
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,278
the lines of like uh you know, you

430
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,959
obliterated your ego with Yeah. You

431
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,078
know, you've eaten quarter ounce of

432
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:54,399
mushroom or something. Mushrooms, done

433
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:56,638
some or smoked some DMT or dropped

434
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,799
dropped some powerful LSD or something.

435
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,120
You know what I mean? Any of those.

436
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,278
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you know,

437
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,959
uh, ingested cannabis can be really

438
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,519
strong. And a lot of these people were

439
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,959
taking, uh, uh, ingested amounts that

440
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,119
would knock you out even for a day or

441
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,880
two. And then they'd come back from that

442
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,719
experience with a vision and that would

443
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,959
be considered reality, you know. Breeder

444
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,798
Steve dose. A breeder Steve dose. There

445
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,558
you go. Yeah. He he would take uh him

446
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,400
and do do you remember his friend Wayne

447
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,359
from way back when? Oh, no. I remember

448
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,519
they had a they had a film container

449
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,359
full of just trikes. So it would have

450
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,480
wouldn't have been like 99% heads

451
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,599
because they didn't have access back

452
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,640
then but it probably would have been

453
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,079
like you know at least 30 or 40% heads

454
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,480
and it was a film container so it was

455
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,159
many many grams and he just cooked it

456
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,360
put it into brownies and him and Wayne

457
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,400
shared the whole thing and they

458
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:47,519
definitely like Steve I think lost 36

459
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,880
hours. Oh man. And or one of them was 27

460
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
one of them was 36 like just

461
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,919
unconscious.

462
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,439
I remember Kirsty telling me like she

463
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,280
was like had to check to see if Steve

464
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,840
was breathing cuz he was just like not

465
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:01,200
moving. You know, it's funny. I have

466
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:04,000
read a number of accounts of people

467
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,519
putting into a deathlike coma through

468
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,119
powerful cannabis extracts to the point

469
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,038
that they've been thought dead. There's

470
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,759
this book uh written in the 19th century

471
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:14,079
by this Dr. James Brad and uh it's

472
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,160
trance and human hibernation and he goes

473
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,159
to India and he sees factors and there

474
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,519
say okay I'm going to die and I'm going

475
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,759
to be buried in the ground and I'm going

476
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,240
to be dug up in a few days from now and

477
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,960
I'm going to come back to life and uh he

478
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,880
said that they were doing this by taking

479
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,600
powerful cannabis extracts it was like

480
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,840
this famous

481
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:35,759
faced them out and your body like uh um

482
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,798
William Oshanaugh writes about putting

483
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,480
people into a state of catalpsy and you

484
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,839
can actually move some it'll just stay

485
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,279
like there like they got rigam mortise

486
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:47,038
or something like that. You know what I

487
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:49,359
mean? Uh um and uh um I love that he

488
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:52,640
knows all the terms for these words. The

489
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,719
first the first anesthesia was in fact a

490
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,120
preparation of cannabis and wine in

491
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,519
China about 100 AD. And that guy was

492
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,239
performing operations and stuff uh by

493
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,440
knocking people out and then uh um yeah,

494
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,880
you know, it's it's pretty interesting.

495
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,558
Goes to show you the power of cannabis.

496
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,760
I'll tell you one thing. I had a friend

497
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,918
who ate too much one time and he was in

498
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,119
the bathroom just having a bad trip

499
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,400
trying and he was coming out of the

500
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,558
bathroom. He wasn't even going to the

501
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,400
bathroom. He was just coming out of the

502
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:20,319
bathroom and he got stuck in this

503
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,160
position and he was like, I can't move

504
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,519
my arms. His arms were even up a little

505
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,080
more or something. And I remember him

506
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,038
like not being a like even us trying to

507
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,599
like push his arms down seemed like he

508
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,519
was made of freaking concrete and it was

509
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,359
it was actually really not a good

510
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,639
experience. It terrified him for sure

511
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,399
and it kind of freaked us out for a

512
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,679
while. He was like that I would say for

513
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,160
close to an hour, you know. I'll show

514
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,320
you this video later. It's uh um it's

515
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,080
this video of this kid, Nova's kid,

516
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,558
takes dabs of all his buddies, right?

517
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:51,639
You know what I mean? And he freezes and

518
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,918
they're like he's frozen and he's

519
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,280
like and they go in there and mess with

520
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,840
him and finally they start tugging him.

521
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,119
Then he starts to come and he's like,

522
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:01,279
"Whoa, oh this isn't good, guys. This

523
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,319
isn't good. I was frozen in time." and

524
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,240
he totally uh freaks out and then as

525
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,240
he's freaking out he starts going back

526
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,599
into it again.

527
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,720
They're like, "Hey, he's doing it again.

528
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,480
Stop him." And it's totally legit. Uh um

529
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,079
and you know, it's funny because one of

530
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,240
the most amazing things about cannabis

531
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,639
when you first use it is this sense of

532
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,000
time distortion. You know, a minute

533
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,600
seems like a second. And so they're

534
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,679
literally like freezing in time. You

535
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,678
know, I I kind of think that there may

536
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,600
be some tongue relation with cannabis

537
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,360
and the conception of time because the

538
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,359
grim reaper, he holds a scythe, the

539
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,319
ancient cythian tool used for harvesting

540
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,240
cannabis, right? And uh um time kind of

541
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,240
begins with agricultural time on the

542
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,480
seasons of growing and following that

543
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,079
type of stuff. And then there's this

544
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,319
whole time shift. And the pygmies in

545
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,158
Africa, they say that they've been

546
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,839
cultivating cannabis since the dawn of

547
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,679
time, but it's more likely means their

548
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,839
conception of time. And one of the ways

549
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,600
you could kind of perceive of time is

550
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,439
having the experience of a

551
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,678
differentiation in time where a second

552
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,200
seems like an you know a minute or you

553
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,640
know what I mean or or something like

554
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,600
that and that would kind of help you

555
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,120
conceptualize that's a pretty heavy

556
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:08,879
philosophical um the idea of time you

557
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,319
know just a kind of stone thought you

558
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,480
know what I mean but well I think the

559
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,720
congalles came from the pygmies. Yeah.

560
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,640
Cool. So, we get to smoke that that and

561
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,159
it was and and I also heard the story. I

562
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,640
heard Al the Alchemist tell the story

563
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,799
that it was it was it was meant to be a

564
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,720
gift. But the Congalles was meant to be

565
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:28,000
a gift. That's what it you know. So,

566
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,159
it's uh if you've got it, gift it. Well,

567
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,759
go uh the py say that God gave them

568
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,200
cannabis so that they would be healthy

569
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:37,839
and happy. Wow. And uh I think that

570
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,960
we're all appreciative of that gift.

571
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,720
Would you like to try a dab of the

572
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,720
bubble hat? You know, I'm so high off

573
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,079
that last one. You probably have to wait

574
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,839
a while. Maybe I got pretty high off

575
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,359
that last one. Then I kind of got

576
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,599
mellowed out by the second one. But

577
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,918
here, I'll take this bottle. I puff uh

578
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,678
cannabis all day. Vaporized generally,

579
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,200
but you know, I probably not like what

580
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,280
you call a heavy user. I probably go

581
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,120
through about a gram and a half a day.

582
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,480
Maybe if I'm at work smoking joints, I

583
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,639
smoke a couple of big joints or

584
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,880
something like that. Well, I definitely

585
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,200
see that you puff non-stop throughout

586
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,480
your day. Yeah, I spread it out. You

587
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,960
know what I mean? It's like whatever I

588
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,200
just I like to keep a good kind of

589
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,079
stone. I make my coffee, I get high, and

590
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,000
I kind of keep that level of of stone. I

591
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,000
find the dabs, you know, man, it can

592
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,240
just knock me out of commission. Pretty

593
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,400
good for an in-depth uh conversation

594
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,159
about what you love and what you know,

595
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,919
though, cuz you've been doing some

596
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,600
pretty good rambles. Oh, good. Yeah,

597
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,799
I've been enjoying it myself. I You want

598
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,240
me to show you some other stuff?

599
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:33,679
Absolutely, dude. I always appreciate

600
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,519
all the stuff you show and all the

601
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,038
things you talk about, cuz I I admit I

602
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,599
know a lot about cannabis. It's one of

603
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,519
the things maybe that I know the most

604
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:44,480
about, but I don't know almost anything

605
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,558
about everything you talk about. Like I,

606
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,360
you know, a really interesting thing. I

607
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,879
got this for myself after I completed my

608
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,399
last book, Cannabis and the Soma

609
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,919
Solution. And this is I had it made into

610
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,519
a necklace. Is a about a 3rd century AD

611
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:04,640
gold coin. I like that. Uh um gold coin

612
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:06,960
from northern India. And it's a Cythian

613
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,559
gold coin because the Cythians dominated

614
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,679
in northern India uh um from about uh

615
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:17,359
3rd century 3rd century BC to the 4th

616
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,960
century AD. And uh on this side it's a

617
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,038
Cythian king and he's all dressed up

618
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,519
like Shiva. He's got the trident. He's

619
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,359
got dreadlocks. Got a serpent there. And

620
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,960
he's got his like you know the Shiva

621
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:31,279
carries around his drug jar there. He's

622
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:35,200
got his little uh basket there. And um

623
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:38,399
uh um the Cythians actually embraced

624
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,400
Shiva when they showed up in India and

625
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,000
uh um Shiva of course and they had the

626
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,798
love of cannabis and Shiva of course is

627
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,960
the lord of cannabis right and so it's

628
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,200
hard to say like Shiva is thought to be

629
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,240
an indigenous god to India like Cali as

630
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,038
well the rest of the Indian pantheon

631
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,200
Krishna Brahma uh um Vishnu all these

632
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,119
types of figures came with the Aryans

633
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,440
who came in and wrote the vetta and

634
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,759
brought the religion, right? And then

635
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,360
these guys were adopted is is is the

636
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,960
idea, right? But uh um it's it's

637
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,959
interesting because those stone age

638
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,558
images of Shiva where he's like in lotus

639
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,038
position and all the animals around I

640
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:18,720
forget what it's called. Uh uh um but it

641
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:20,960
like stone age image of Sheba way. Um,

642
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,440
and people have uh there's one scholar

643
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,679
who's been comparing that to the the

644
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,919
Celtic stuff like the goorop cauldron

645
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,000
where there's that sinos figure with the

646
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,679
horns and he's got all the animals

647
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,759
around him and stuff and saying that

648
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,559
this is all part of this same cultural

649
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:40,240
complex. And with this recent news of

650
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,759
the spread of of uh Indo-Uropean spread

651
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,278
of cannabis, which they're, you know,

652
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,599
calling in the press the birth of

653
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,038
Western civilization through cannabis

654
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,678
culture and the first, you know,

655
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,278
agricultural cash crop cannabis and

656
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,120
opening up the whole trade routes that,

657
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,038
you know, saying basically that the Silk

658
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,678
Road was more of a hemp and highway and

659
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:00,000
it goes back thousands of years. If that

660
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,640
is true, then we're talking about

661
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,440
something so old, a religious kind of

662
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,360
sacrament and herb that's just so old it

663
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,278
goes right back, you know, like they're

664
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,839
saying, uh, this spread happened about

665
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,159
5,000 years ago. Uh, Indo-Uropean

666
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:17,119
spread. And we have examples of cannabis

667
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,440
at Celtic and Drewic sites and also up

668
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,639
in China with Indo-Europeans there and

669
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,840
then Afghanistan and the bacteria

670
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,799
margar. have the evidence and then into

671
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:29,918
India with Soma that this is all just so

672
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:32,000
old and it's so special that in this

673
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,679
time we're just kind of figuring it out

674
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,919
as we're finding out about all these

675
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,480
medical benefits of cannabis all of a

676
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,240
sudden this agent history is starting to

677
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,720
rise up and archaeologists and

678
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,319
anthropologists are going that western

679
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,200
civilization grew out of civilization I

680
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:49,038
mean Carl Sean said that uh uh cannabis

681
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,880
was likely our first agricultural crop

682
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,480
and culture grew out of agriculture you

683
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,320
know what I mean absolutely well Dr.

684
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,640
David Allen said that probably the first

685
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,119
human suckling on a brass was induced by

686
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,440
that munchy effect that canabonoids

687
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,678
produce. It's, you know, it's like

688
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,159
everywhere that we went when we started

689
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,440
cultivating this plant, it was growing

690
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,600
in night soil. light soil is human waste

691
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,600
and it literally grew in our piss and

692
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,399
[ __ ] and we were putting oursel back in

693
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,000
that soil and uh um it's growing there

694
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,278
and it's taking in all that stuff that's

695
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,839
been through us and then we're ingesting

696
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,679
it and then putting it back in the soil

697
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,558
and you got to think that there's some

698
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,640
sort of

699
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:30,558
like

700
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,080
biological relationship here that's like

701
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:34,158
you know they're calling them some

702
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,639
modern diseases endocanabonoid

703
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,240
deficiency you know what I mean well

704
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,080
Because it seems like the more you study

705
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,759
pharmaceutical drugs, you realize that

706
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,599
most of them are trying to do the job

707
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,158
that your endockinabonoid system would

708
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,839
do naturally with essential amino acids

709
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,120
and and canabonoids, whether

710
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:53,278
endogenously produced or inhaled through

711
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:56,239
phytoinabonoids. Either way, those those

712
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,480
get the job done. And uh it's it's kind

713
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,839
of I've always said why, you know, when

714
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,120
people are like, "Oh, I saw that little

715
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,480
girl, she was having all these seizures

716
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,119
and then they put the oil under her

717
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,319
tongue. It was a miracle." I always say

718
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,599
it really wasn't a miracle. It was an

719
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:12,399
endockinabonoid deficiency. And then the

720
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:15,359
canabonoids are obviously very I mean

721
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,519
just if if all your system did was put

722
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,240
your immune system and your central

723
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,480
nervous system in homeostasis, if that's

724
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,079
all it did, that would be incredible in

725
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,919
its own right. But everything else

726
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,319
that's going on and all that we will

727
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,159
learn in the next 10 and 20 years of

728
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:33,759
actually being able to study the science

729
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:37,520
of this while simultaneously uncovering

730
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:39,679
the rich historical past. I mean it's a

731
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,359
pretty it's like building a jigsaw

732
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,759
puzzle from our perspectives. Chris

733
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:46,959
Chris and I have been in the cannabis

734
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:50,240
activism world for 20 to 25 years, maybe

735
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,120
Chris longer. Um, and that's uh that's

736
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,038
like a a a better portion of our lives.

737
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,959
It's more than it's more than half of

738
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:59,038
our lives that we've been doing this. So

739
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,278
to see this jigsaw puzzle that almost

740
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,839
started with just one little piece.

741
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,839
Yeah. You know, and we and it was like

742
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,599
whatever it was that made us believe in

743
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,439
that piece that made even through all

744
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,199
the propaganda before Jack's book and

745
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,200
before the learning and when people were

746
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,159
telling us it was bad and believing it.

747
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,440
Yeah. But feeling that it was good. That

748
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,159
feeling that there was something

749
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,919
intrinsically good in this rel I would

750
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,480
go out and hide in my shed in my

751
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,440
backyard in in the freezing cold weather

752
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,599
15 years old and smoke joints and just

753
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,840
be like the feeling that it gave me and

754
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,558
that connection that it gave me was so

755
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,240
important to my well-being and to the

756
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,558
choices that I would later on make in

757
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,000
life that I I can't even uh Yeah. Yeah.

758
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:41,200
Know for sure. It's like the forbidden

759
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,720
fruit syndrome. You know what I mean?

760
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,640
And it's like you're told in the garden,

761
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,558
go eat that and then you go eat it. It's

762
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,520
like wo your eyes become open and you

763
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:52,079
kind of like it's this fruit is so

764
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,918
special. Yeah. It's so It's not like

765
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,759
just any old fruit. No fruit for sure,

766
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,520
man. Not that any old fruit is any

767
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,359
fruit. I love fruit and you know it's

768
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,798
like I've been I guess I started around

769
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:05,599
89 90 and I just have to say like just

770
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:08,759
how much it has proved itself over and

771
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:10,719
over and over. each new like medical

772
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:13,519
discovery, each new, you know,

773
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,278
industrial use and each, you know, and

774
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,278
then all this history kind of starting

775
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:20,319
to rise to the surface and stuff, you

776
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:23,038
know, it's uh uh it's really phenomenal

777
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:25,599
and it's a really uh uh I feel blessed

778
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:28,158
to have been a part of like the whole

779
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,240
whole rising of this this herb up into

780
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,840
the into the mainstream again. You know,

781
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,159
it feels like it's been a one-way

782
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,720
street. No matter what they try to throw

783
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,000
at us to make it look like a 180, like

784
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,679
we're going the other direction, no

785
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,558
matter what they throw at us. From the

786
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,919
from the 14th century Cairo Sufis that

787
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,398
had their teeth ripped out in the

788
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,080
square. Yeah. Right. For eating hashish

789
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:52,079
to, you know, the California grower in

790
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:53,278
1999 who's he got busted three times,

791
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,839
but he's going to keep doing it because

792
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,519
he believes in it. It's it just can't be

793
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,119
stopped. It's like you pour concrete

794
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,639
down and then it grows through the

795
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,319
cracks. That's right. If the highway to

796
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,840
hell is paved, it's one thing that's

797
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:05,200
going to break its way to through the

798
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,158
pavement and that's a plant. You know

799
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,720
what I mean? And it's an opportunity on

800
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,399
so many levels for humanity to go back

801
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,200
that greener route. You know what I

802
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:18,239
mean? Uh uh um because you know we can

803
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,080
replace fossil fuels with hemp fuels and

804
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,319
uh we can even make batteries out of

805
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,759
this plant. We can make all our clothes

806
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,359
out of it and move away from soil

807
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,119
depleting cotton. You know what I mean?

808
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,639
Paints and oils and all these other

809
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,278
stuff. assume that as a whole if we made

810
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,240
more environmentally friendly and

811
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:34,079
biodegradable through the use of this

812
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,159
plastics you know it's endless paper you

813
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,000
know we cut down 50% of our trees for

814
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,080
for paper these days you know what I

815
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,798
mean toilet paper toilet paper wiping

816
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:45,359
our ass with our futures as jello bafra

817
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,679
would say when he gave his hand you know

818
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,599
uh years ago you know and so and then

819
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,960
then it's like this medicinal qualities

820
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,038
of it and everything we're just finding

821
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,038
out about it you know curing these

822
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,798
little poor children of epilepsy you

823
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,319
know that was thought to be demonic

824
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,599
possession ession back in the ancient

825
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:04,240
world and cannabis actually uh uh um

826
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,678
appears in ancient recipes for you know

827
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,759
the the relief of what was believed to

828
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,960
have been the hand of ghost and other

829
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:13,759
things it was called and uh um you know

830
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,919
it's it's just so incredible that you

831
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,240
know to watch that happen and see these

832
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,440
parents who like are losing their kids

833
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,038
you know they're going to die from all

834
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,720
the medications and then they're they're

835
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,240
living and starting to thrive you know

836
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,880
it's heart-wrenching for sure it's nice

837
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,480
to see it happen it's it's also that

838
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,000
then you get to the point where but you

839
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,839
don't only help the sick people, you can

840
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,079
actually use it as a preventative and

841
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:36,558
prevent people from maybe having those

842
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:38,558
seizures or having uh later on in life

843
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:41,278
heart disease, heart heart disease and

844
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:43,519
diabetes and stroke. These are things

845
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:45,200
that consuming canabonoids can help

846
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,120
prevent as well. So then you get into

847
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,120
that aspect of it and then we haven't

848
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,918
even really touched on the spiritual

849
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,000
aspect of how it makes you feel and how

850
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,519
it seems to connect you with something.

851
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,640
And when I when I hear people call

852
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,359
cannabis an escape. Yeah. I just think,

853
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,120
wow, it really isn't. Yeah. It's like a

854
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,639
circle naturally forms when you pass a

855
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,558
joint around. You know what I mean? You

856
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,799
let out the herbs. What What other

857
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:11,599
things do people pass from hand to hand

858
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,038
and that's that takes place? You know, I

859
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:17,278
think there's different ways. you know

860
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:19,839
for for Sufis and uh sadus I think a lot

861
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:22,159
of uh of the drive to using cannabis was

862
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,319
like almost increases your attention to

863
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,840
a level uh that's meditative where you

864
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,678
can start to blow away your ego and just

865
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,839
get down to that common essence of us

866
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,360
all and all the thoughts can drift away

867
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,278
you know you could get lost staring at

868
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:36,000
the wallpaper for 20 minutes that's

869
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:38,079
actually like a form of a trance you

870
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,440
know what I mean and it's all how you

871
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,798
direct that energy though you know what

872
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,880
I mean intense is everything with

873
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,759
cannabis so if you're like, you know,

874
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,000
smoking blunts and dope and listening to

875
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,599
gangster hip-hop, you're not really

876
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,839
going to be getting the same effect as,

877
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:55,119
you know, a sadu who's partaking of his

878
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:57,439
chillum on on the river gan ganis before

879
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:59,759
he sits down to do his yoga katanas. I

880
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,480
can I can definitely say I've done both

881
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,720
and they are very

882
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,000
different now. Not to uh I'm not putting

883
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,759
anything making any judgment. Exactly.

884
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,240
Not putting one over the other. Clearly

885
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,919
saying that you will get very different

886
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,919
experience. It's a magnifier, you know,

887
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,679
it magnifies wherever you're in and set

888
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,240
and setting and intent and all these

889
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,360
things uh pay a role. And I will say

890
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,359
that I think if you take the time to

891
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,519
find out about the religious history of

892
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,240
cannabis and the history of this

893
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,079
incredible plant that that will become

894
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,399
part of your intent because everything

895
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:35,119
you know is what creates your intent.

896
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:39,278
And uh um the more you find out about

897
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:41,678
this incredibly magical spiritual tree

898
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,359
of life, soma

899
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,480
uh you know, the holy ganja sheepa,

900
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:48,000
whatever you want to call it, the plant

901
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,960
of immortality, the Chinese, the more it

902
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,679
cloaks itself in the magic and myth of

903
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,840
our ancestors, you know, dude, [ __ ]

904
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,679
right on, bro. You're you're awesome,

905
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,439
dude. You're a good dude. I'm just

906
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,640
loving it. That's uh that's poetic,

907
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,720
really. You know, I was thinking as

908
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,000
Chris was sort of on that last end of

909
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,360
his his uh his speech there that uh

910
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,599
we're going to be doing some boosted

911
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,719
boarding later right after this

912
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,559
actually. We're going to get on these

913
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,158
boosted boards I guess. Well, or maybe I

914
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,838
don't know. Chris has so many different

915
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,358
ones. But that to me, like to be able to

916
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:20,799
do this, talk about this plant that we

917
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,639
love, the history of it, share it with

918
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,639
you guys, but then go and do a nice

919
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,599
beautiful nature ride on an electric

920
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,878
skateboard. That's my meditation, man.

921
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,559
You know what I mean? It's like I'm

922
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,078
telling you inspire me, dude. I mean, I

923
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:33,838
wouldn't be on these boards if it wasn't

924
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,399
for you. You're definitely Hey, man. I'm

925
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:38,320
I'm glad at 54 I'm still rocking stuff

926
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,159
like this, you know what I mean? It's uh

927
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,079
it's a blessing, you know? And I think

928
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,679
uh Herb keeps you young at heart, you

929
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,039
know what I mean? Yeah, I feel the same

930
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,800
way. People tell me all the time, "Oh,

931
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,398
you look young, you act young. You seem

932
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,280
like a younger person." I'm like, "Well,

933
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,638
it's it's just uh take care of yourself,

934
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,000
you know? Here, I'll show you these

935
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,000
antique chillums and a couple other

936
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,119
things." I would love to see that. Yeah,

937
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,639
I was just going to say take care of

938
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,079
yourself, you know, pay attention to

939
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,440
your diet. Whatever it is, make sure

940
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,599
you're eating the best quality food that

941
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,679
you can.

942
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:10,240
So, these are 19th century chils. And in

943
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:12,399
the center there's a um sadu. And uh um

944
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:15,919
sometimes these sadus will do things to

945
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,320
show uh um I don't know like it's it's

946
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,320
it's kind of sadistic, but they they'll

947
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,160
do things like hold their arm up to show

948
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,160
the power of their will. Dude, I met a

949
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,799
guy like that at the Kumba. Yeah. Yeah.

950
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,480
And so this guy's arm has a has a trophy

951
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,000
in this position, but there he is with a

952
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,838
chillum. You know, it's an old uh

953
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,519
postcard. And how old is that though, do

954
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,679
you think? Uh this is probably like

955
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:38,079
1920s or so. Okay. Yeah, I was going to

956
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,078
say cuz that's insane. I might have to

957
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,800
go through my pictures because the

958
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,280
picture of the guy I met at the Mahakuma

959
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,760
had been holding his arm up for like

960
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,440
some insane amount of years. It was a

961
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,800
stone. His It didn't work

962
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,920
anymore. That would be wild if it was

963
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,000
him. 90 years old. No, he looked like he

964
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,559
was more like 60. But that's that's

965
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,039
India, too. I've got all these really

966
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:05,440
great like 19th century books as well.

967
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:10,480
This is called Keith, a life story in

968
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,159
nine phases. And uh um it's a story of a

969
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,400
uh

970
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:16,480
uh of a guy that astral travels well on

971
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,119
cannabis and starts having an affair

972
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,760
with another man's wife on the astral

973
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,760
plane. Really? Um and the illustrations

974
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,119
from it are just fabulous. I was trust I

975
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,119
know I have a couple of them printed up

976
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:32,240
here but uh I can't can't find it. Very

977
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,760
cool. Uh um yeah. So this guy's this is

978
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,279
really fascinating little book and it's

979
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,240
got great illustrations of people

980
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:42,400
smoking weed and uh uh um like here they

981
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:46,159
are um puffing down before they get off

982
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,480
on the astral plane there.

983
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,559
Um and uh yeah, I've got all sorts of

984
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,400
cool books like that. You know, I'm I've

985
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,199
been researching a lot about magic and

986
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,519
cannabis and stuff. So, uh I'm stuck by

987
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,919
this guy Pascal Beverly Randolph who was

988
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:02,639
the first huge commercial importer of

989
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,400
hashish. And he he was an interesting

990
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,559
guy. That's an impressive title. Say

991
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,039
that again. Uh first commercial big

992
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,880
commercial importer of hashish. And uh

993
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,800
um I've they got all these old

994
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,358
advertisements for his hashish and stuff

995
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,960
like that. Roian, which is a kind of

996
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:20,319
secret society, alchemical occult secret

997
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,159
society. And they were using cannabis

998
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,320
and a lot of those secret societies back

999
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:28,078
then, particularly Rosacruian groups.

1000
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:32,320
And Randolph, he had two extracts he was

1001
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,079
making from really good hash. And uh um

1002
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,240
from the sounds of it, it almost sounds

1003
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,480
like one was more of a CBD type of thing

1004
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,879
and one was more of a THC thing because

1005
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,280
they had uh different properties and

1006
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,480
effects and stuff like that. uh um and

1007
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,040
he spread a lot of uh of cannabis around

1008
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,199
up until about 1875. Really fascinating

1009
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,159
guy. Another guy, Pascal Beverly

1010
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:56,000
Randolph, has this book, Sanctuary of

1011
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:58,559
Spiritualism, and it's got 15 firsthand

1012
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,239
accounts of people ingesting three grams

1013
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,599
of hashish. They do it in like Turkish

1014
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,319
coffee, you know what I mean? Stir it in

1015
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,240
real gooey hashish, drink it down, and

1016
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,599
then they'd have these super powerful

1017
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,439
experiences. And so the person

1018
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,599
afterwards would write down their

1019
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,838
experience. And uh this makes up this

1020
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:18,000
book. It's 15 firsthand accounts and

1021
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:19,920
just really interesting um visions and

1022
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,519
some of the ideas that they're talking

1023
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,920
about that were coming to them in these

1024
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:25,759
states really parallels ideas like

1025
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,519
quantum physics and other things that

1026
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,680
we're we're finding out in science. And

1027
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,159
it's interesting just how deep a

1028
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:34,799
knowledge you can get from that sort of

1029
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,399
uh introspection and even more so

1030
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,599
sometimes with the use of substances

1031
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,119
like cannabis. That's awesome. Well, I'm

1032
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,400
inspired. I'm uh I'm ready to go ride

1033
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,079
Boosted Boards. I think I'm going to

1034
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,680
bring my camera so you guys can catch a

1035
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,359
little bit of the vibes on the board. I

1036
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,919
didn't bring my GoPro, but I'll hold my

1037
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,920
video camera. I can do that. And uh

1038
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,000
yeah, thanks for having me over, dude.

1039
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,599
Always a pleasure, man. It was awesome.

1040
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,440
Thank you guys for watching and stick

1041
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,240
around. We're about to go boosted

1042
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,159
boarding.

1043
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:06,239
Groovy.

1044
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,399
So, you want to go to North? Hey guys.

1045
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,078
So, we are out uh in front of Chris's

1046
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,599
place. We've got the electric boards.

1047
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,720
Which one you got there? This is the

1048
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,559
Evolved Bustin deck. Uh it's great

1049
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,639
board. Uh what I like about these boards

1050
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,639
is they got the double bushing trucks

1051
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,319
like the old G wings, you know. Oh [ __ ]

1052
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,559
look at that. Uh um so they're really

1053
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,079
carvy dual bushings. Um and it's get

1054
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,320
gets a lot of range. This one I get

1055
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,920
about 15 miles on I think, you know, if

1056
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,760
it's uh pretty steady terrain and uh

1057
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,358
yeah, nice flexi deck, you know. And

1058
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,520
then this one beside me is the Boosted.

1059
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:39,119
We've had it on here before. It's a

1060
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,358
really solid build. They got a really

1061
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,720
nice tight electronics and brakes and

1062
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,119
stuff like that. The brakes on this one

1063
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,439
are a little looser. Not as carby, but

1064
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,280
better for high speeds. I I'd say this

1065
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,599
is my main commuter. So, if I'm driving

1066
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,519
in the city, it's it's the board I drive

1067
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,680
to work on and stuff like that cuz it

1068
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,599
could stop really good. It stops legs

1069
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,358
and uh um it's got a lot of torque for

1070
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,039
going up the hill. Real limited range,

1071
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:04,319
so probably about four or five miles for

1072
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:06,960
a guy my weight, 200 lb, you know. Uh um

1073
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,039
so it's it's got its limitations. This

1074
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,480
one it's all about the carve for me. You

1075
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,119
know what I mean? I like to carve it out

1076
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,719
going down a hill or and uh it's really

1077
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,838
nice and light and you can really melt

1078
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,279
some uh range out of it. Downside uh the

1079
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,279
way they got the motor set up. These

1080
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,839
motor plates have a tendency to snap. So

1081
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,440
I've got to take it careful over any uh

1082
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,960
breaks in the cement. You want real

1083
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,800
smooth cement for this one. But they've

1084
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,838
also got an all-terrain setup. And the

1085
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,599
all-terrain setup's great. air tires and

1086
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:35,358
uh handles gravel roads, bumps, and

1087
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,838
stuff like that. I've got their latest

1088
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:39,759
version uh um coming soon. It's got dual

1089
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:41,679
motor, so it'll be a dual motor,

1090
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,359
all-terrain uh skateboard, and it's

1091
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,039
great for driving right over train

1092
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,920
tracks or whatever. And still got a lot

1093
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,279
of speed and uh a lot of range as well.

1094
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,480
Well, I'm ready to hit the road if you

1095
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,720
are. Okay. Me, too, man. All right,

1096
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,719
