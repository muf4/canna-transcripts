the hash Church link up here and share

26

it I don't know if you guys understand

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,719
but usually what I would do is I'd

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,549
create a page on on YouTube for the for

29
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,379
the live show because Google worked

30
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,810
through YouTube now I can't do that I

31
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:30,298
can create the show on YouTube but when

32
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,659
I start the show on zoom it creates it

33
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,720
in a totally different box so not quite

34
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,630
the same as before but that's okay I'm

35
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,269

really have anything in particular to

42
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:57,810

43
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,718

44
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,030

46
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,769

48
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:11,310

49
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,039
talking to you guys and shooting the

50
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,299
[ __ ] once a week and you know that the

51
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:17,370
talking about it with someone else the

52
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:20,670
other day that dialogue that we did at

53
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,530
hash Church over the years really had a

54
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:25,199
profound effect on the community and it

55
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,180
really helped it sort of steer some of

56
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,009
the things some of the dialogues and

57
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,959
conversations that we came up with from

58
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:36,419
you know different you know terpenes and

59
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,759
rosin vape carts and terpenes and rosin

60
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:42,000
itself both of those things were very

61
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:44,459
very rare to see in the world of

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,469
cannabis prior to our talking about it

63
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,030

227
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:02,700

228
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,110

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:11,100
something yeah we went to Mount Rushmore

231
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:14,370
we drove through the Badlands we had to

232
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,470
drive from Illinois to Seattle Slew we

233
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,529
took two days to drive all the way there

234
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,990
so we were able to see you know Mount

235
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:23,850
Rushmore we drove through the Badlands

236
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,399
but it was night so we didn't really get

237
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,470
to see it too much

238
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,970
but we also got to like go see the

239
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,500
geysers and we got to go see Old

240
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,850
Faithful and saw it go off

241
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,980
that's all I was really we've got the

242
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,279
drive through you know Yellowstone Park

243
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,740
so it was really fun and even when we

244
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,750
got to Seattle you know Hempfest was

245
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,960
just absolutely amazing everyone there

246
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:51,000

247
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,120
gonna forget it so that was your first

248
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,620
ham fest that was my first Hempfest so

249
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,360

awesome crew and what people are like

254
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:11,100
holy [ __ ] I recognize that kid

255
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,620
well it was it was really great because

256
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:19,529
I had like I spoke every day during the

257
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,720
ahem fest so I was able to you know talk

258
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:23,939
to patients and talk to you know

259
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,710
everyone about my story and about other

260
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,980
people's stories and I was actually like

261
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:32,340
on uh on a panel you know talking about

262
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,129
you know why it's important for kids to

263
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,509
be able to use cannabis and why it can

264
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:38,779
help you know treat some of their

265
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:41,000
ailments and

266
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:44,250
you know it

267
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,159
part of me it was really important for

268
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,620
me because you know a lot of people you

269
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,480
know even in legal states are you know

270
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,870
also still having shovel you know

271
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,659
fighting the law you know just because

272
00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:00,120
you legalize doesn't really mean that

273
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:01,409
you know the fight is over you know

274
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,889
that's just stepping into the ring

275
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:08,000
there's a lot of work left yeah like

276
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:12,809
just for example in Illinois

277
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:19,100
they accidentally banned RS they banned

278
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:19,099
smokeable for anyone under the age of 21

279
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,439
which they accidentally banned RSO along

280
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:28,948
with that because they classified that

281
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:31,259
or veeko oil because they classified

282
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:34,068
that as a smokeable so that way they can

283
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:36,928
get around the milligram limit and

284
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:40,438
so now that isn't also not allowed for

285
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:42,019
anyone under the age of 21 so that's

286
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:46,649
unacceptable

287
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:48,418
absolutely absolutely so I mean I think

288
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:50,220
it's absolutely unacceptable that the

289
00:12:48,418 --> 00:12:52,438
milligram limit is that low in the first

290
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,928
place that we have to go around to

291
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:58,289
classifying things as smokeable just to

292
00:12:54,928 --> 00:13:00,659
get around there hey honestly kudos to

293
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:02,458
you Colton you know I was you know I'm a

294
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:04,889
patient myself as goal for veteran I

295
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:07,409

296
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,688
use my voice when I was in my early 20s

297
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:11,188

305
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:28,828

314
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:53,428
we've all done a lot of work in the

315
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:55,499
cannabis space but I've said it before

316
00:13:53,428 --> 00:13:59,068
and I'll say it again like I really feel

317
00:13:55,499 --> 00:14:01,168
the last leg of prohibition will be with

318
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:02,969

00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:28,649
take the torch and and crush it it was

330
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:32,289
awesome to see on the stage in in

331
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:34,720
Seattle thank you so much you know I

332
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:36,969
definitely think that you know the Sigma

333
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,940
it a lot of the stigma is definitely

334
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:42,100
ending because you know before I started

335
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,470
cannabis you know the the talk about

336
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,199
marijuana was that it's bad and don't

337
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,970
use you know now people are actually

338
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,659
having conversations with their kids

339
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,579
about cannabis and there are you know

340
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:56,708
people who are actually educated in the

341
00:14:54,578 --> 00:14:59,229
subject so people are getting the right

342
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:01,179
information and people are you know

343
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,959
using it making the right decisions

344
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:08,318
around cannabis and you know the kids

345
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,809
that are you know around today have so

346
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:14,649
much more information than the last

347
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:16,078
generation so just as time goes on those

348
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:18,789
kids are going to get smarter and

349
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:21,250
they're going to be more educated on

350
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:24,299
cannabis and eventually everyone's going

351
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,299
to have knowledge of it

352
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:31,388
well what's nice about it now is that

353
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,980
the kids are learning as before there

354
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,259
was no education for the kids there was

355
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,420
nothing there it was it's wrong it's

356
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:39,278
illegal don't touch it it's bad it's

357
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:41,528
gonna cause you psychosis

358
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,419
I grew up in the 80s were you know what

359
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:46,328
if you were smoking a joint you were

360
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:48,278
hiding you were putting mouse spray on

361
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:50,588
anywhere like making sure even smell

362
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:53,439
like weed so it's it's just fantastic to

363
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:55,690
see we are today in today's uh era that

364
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,610
you know the kids and when I was 16 are

365
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,620
being educated on cannabis are being

366
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,669
told any of this preventive medicine

367
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,379
there's all kinds of different things

368
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,269
and it's just great to see it kind of

369
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,828

cannabis is it it you becomes thing and

380
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:25,480
then you want to teach everybody and

381

that's what cannabis does you become the

382

00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:36,490
able to touch the people that are

387
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:37,870
suffering from the same condition like I

388
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,028
know people then I look at them they're

389
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:43,060
like dude I miss like smoke one of these

390
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:45,458
are take some CBD or you know that's the

391
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:48,329
biggest thing is is it's there for us to

392
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:51,069
just take and learn them on

393
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,740
so many different levels - you know

394
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,300
there are the you know there's my level

395
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,220
I didn't come into it as a patient I

396
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:59,259
came into it as a recreational smoker I

397
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:03,009
was 14 years old puffs in the joint with

398
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:05,170
my buddy and we just grew to have that

399
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:07,259
experience with cannabis without really

400
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:10,060
the you know the more serious

401
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:12,099
kind of like you know the patient story

402
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:14,198
the Colton Turner's the John Breaux

403
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,169
fellows you know the at Tana fountains

404
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,970
that the patient stories are powerful

405
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:21,579
and those people when you have that

406
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,410
patient story well of course you're

407
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:25,509
gonna have to tell every single person

408
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,910
like I mean oh my goodness like you just

409
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:31,029
dealt with this element with this

410
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:33,100
particular herb in a way that is super

411
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:35,200
profound and now you're gonna hear

412
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:38,019
someone be like oh yeah I have that same

413
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,850
thing like but you could not tell that

414
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:41,859
person if your lips were stapled shut

415
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:43,449
you would have to tell them you would

416
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:47,019
make it a point of telling them and that

417
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:50,049
is that is very profound right like I

418
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:53,619
when I you know came out and said hey

419
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:55,839
I'm a Crohn's patient I use cannabis you

420
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:58,299
know I spoke out because Crohn's disease

421
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:02,169
is a very taboo disease people don't

422
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:04,029
like to talk about their poo so you know

423
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,160
it was really important for me to speak

424
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:07,720
out because I felt like you know there

425
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,850
was nobody else because when I first

426
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,009
started cannabis nobody was talking

427
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:16,209
about cannabis and Crohn's disease and

428
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:17,710
then after you know I started to get

429
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,410
more and more out there with my story

430
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,029
you know Crohn's patients would like

431
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,940
come out of the woodwork and go oh I've

432
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:27,970
been smoking for 10 years and you know

433
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:31,019
cannabis does great for me well where

434
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:34,269
were you why didn't you speak up

435
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,650
you know y'all said Colton well said

436
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:38,319
because I'll tell you when you came out

437
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:41,410
with your patient story it was a huge

438
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,990
relief to me because now all the people

439
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:46,990
with Crohn's that were coming to me I

440
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:49,359
was able to just direct over to you

441
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,920
because you actually you know I I don't

442
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,659
have Crohn's I didn't use cannabis for

443
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,360
Crohn's sure I've read stories and I've

444
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,190
heard information from people but you

445
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,439
have a first-hand experience you have

446
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,700
something that goes beyond

447
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,259
you know like well what about clinical

448
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,250
trials you know what about clay how do

449
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:06,490
we know it works what about clinical

450
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:08,378
trials you know tell that to Colton well

451
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,878
Colton is getting eight you've gone even

452
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:12,278
above that and actually set up a

453
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:15,699
foundation so there's a Colton Turner

454
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:18,298
foundation which I actually just sent a

455
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:22,360
friend of mine who has a young daughter

456
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:24,158
who has Crohn's and sent him your

457
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:26,859
directions so that he could talk to your

458
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,570
mom and talk to your support network and

459
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:31,408
have an understanding as a parent

460
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:33,970
because he's in an illegal state and

461
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:36,190
he's trying to figure out if he now has

462
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,409
to do what you did Colton and move to a

463
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,899
legal state with his and be the parent

464
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:42,940
and actually move his family there so he

465
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:44,408
can take care of you know his daughter

466
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,778
so that she can at least have a

467
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:48,519
semblance of a normal life via cannabis

468
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:51,278
she has she hasn't even tried cannabis

469
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:53,980
yet but he's exhausted everything going

470
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:57,490
the legal route that he needed access to

471
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,870
information thankfully Colton guru and

472
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,240
your parents have come up with your own

473
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:03,719
foundation so you can you know educate

474
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,609
people further so thanks again

475
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:10,778
absolutely because you know one of the

476
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:12,729
biggest issues in my opinion you know we

477
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:14,679
can talk about you know what kind of

478
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,349
what kind of method is the best way to

479
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,879
use cannabis or you know what strain you

480
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:21,490
know works better but we're not going to

481
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:24,548
know all of that without research

482
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,500
because really I think that we just hit

483
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:28,509
the tip of the iceberg when it comes to

484
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,388
this plant and I think that we need to

485
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:33,360
really learn more about it because we're

486
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:36,969
gonna be I feel like we're going to

487
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:39,519
over legislate it and make too many

488
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:41,319
regulations over it to the point where

489
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,440
we can't really use it to its full

490
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:47,138
potential so I think that well how can

491
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:51,009
we regulate something that we don't know

492
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:54,459
you know um also whenever I go to a

493
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:56,829
doctor or a politician or a lawyer or

494
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,288
anybody they the one thing that they

495
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:01,829
always tell me to completely discredit

496
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:05,589
my story is oh well there's no research

497
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:07,678
so I got tired and I said well I'm gonna

498
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:10,829
fund my own research

499
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,880
so that way we can actually prove that

500
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:17,309
cannabis does

501
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:20,410
help is is a safe natural alternative

502
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:22,720
well speaking of speaking of cannabis

503
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:25,450
research we look who just came into the

504
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,490
room we got dr. Ethan Rousseau popped in

505
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,309
with the dragonfly earth medicine Josh

506
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,920
and Kelly just came in so we should

507
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:35,259
welcome them to the show and Colin as

508
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,350
well just popped in from Massachusetts

509
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:41,730
from Happy Valley

510
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:41,730
everybody how you guys doing

511
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:50,230
nice to see you Colton so beautiful

512
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,880
seeing you here and talking about things

513
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,230
that are just really important we really

514
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,250
appreciate you on our side

515
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,620
totally

516
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,690
I love the sarcasm lady approaches it

517
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:05,829
with you know this sort of like you know

518
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:09,940
I'd rather be illegally alive than

519
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:12,279
legally dead like the first time I heard

520
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:16,269
that I was kinda like wow that's that's

521
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:21,009
kind of sharp I like it the first time

522
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:23,950
that I said it I was 14 which is you

523
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:25,779
know you'd think that you know an adult

524
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,870
would say that you know somebody who's

525
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:32,470
you know really cool and intimidating

526
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:36,069
and you know people who have like done

527
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:39,940
like done the time you know Colton you

528
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:42,129
did your time and it's okay you're a

529
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,049
hero you've lived through it you're a

530
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,480
survivor like the rest of us you're a

531
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:49,149
man now but you were a man surviving

532
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,180
through that entire time most kids never

533
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:54,550
have to live with the stigma much less

534
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:58,480
the trauma that you and your family had

535
00:22:54,549 --> 00:23:01,349
to experience and that saying comes from

536
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:07,150
the heart from the soul of a survivor

537
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:11,169
mm-hmm at all right and your sarcasm you

538
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:13,480
know what I mean ours like to them to

539
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:15,789
the other side to the right like for us

540
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,950
we loved it but imagine being like in

541
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:20,159
law enforcement or something and hearing

542
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,299
that from a 14 year old boy

543
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,279
14 year old boy that had to move away

544
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:28,019
from his grandparents so that he could

545
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:32,440
know as a medicine

546
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:34,569
yeah I think you're mad cool dude thank

547
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,420
you so much

548
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:40,710
so we're all if it wasn't for you guys

549
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:43,990
then people who

550
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:46,450
people like me wouldn't be able to have

551
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,400
the information that they have today and

552
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:51,370
people wouldn't be as educated as they

553
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,380
you know as they would be today because

554
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:55,899
you guys are pushing the discussion you

555
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,610
guys are pushing the subject and I

556
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,130
really appreciate that and I know that

557
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:02,289
patients all around the world appreciate

558
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,140
it too we're more of shoving it than

559
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:05,490
pushing it

560
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,110
[Laughter]

561
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,759
we're done playing Sisyphus everybody

562
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:13,779
else can catch it going downhill man yes

563
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:16,329
right exactly yes someone on the cats

564
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:20,049
that sounds like something skunk man Sam

565
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:22,869
would say and it really does actually be

566
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:25,589
honest one of the big things pushing the

567
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:30,039
whole reality now is

568
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:33,099
big business big government taxing they

569
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:35,680
smell the money they walk it and I get

570
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:38,469
them who makes the money I just want

571
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,350
cannabis to be legal for every use by

572
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:43,390
everybody everywhere

573
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:47,159
true that you know Sam you've been

574
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:48,690
saying that for 20 years or more

575
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,730
and

576
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:54,130
finally came true about big business

577
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:57,640
they are driving it they're not paying

578
00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:01,740
for as much research into cannabis for

579
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:04,270
beneficial reasons as he and I

580
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,549
that is incredible I mean if you go to

581
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:08,559
the icy RSS I mean Ethan you go to all

582
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:10,990
these events don't you think that you

583
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,549
can see this incredible growth in the

584
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:18,880
money that's coming into in for research

585
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:22,659
yeah I do that problem is a lot of it

586
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,360
it's not in the right direction let's

587
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:28,060
the situation in Canada you've got

588
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:30,759
something like 200 licensed producers

589
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:33,759
but the mean activity with mergers and

590
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:37,769
acquisitions rather than actual research

591
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:41,720
and that's true with two exceptions

592
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:45,599
additionally a lot of what their new

593
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,210
research is just observational studies

594
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,549
which

595
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:55,079
are not helpful from the standpoint of

596
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:58,799
really convincing the physicians or the

597
00:25:55,079 --> 00:26:00,929
regulator's you know it it's nice

598
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,349
corroboration for those of us who

599
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:06,049
already understand the medical benefits

600
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:10,469
of cannabis but

601
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:12,329
you know for up to me a lot of this

602
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,940
money would be aimed in a different

603
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:17,720
direction that I think could advance the

604
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:20,130
cause much more effectively

605
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,890
like much more effectively than paying

606
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:26,850
like 147 million euros for the volcano

607
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:28,040
company or like 224 million foreign and

608
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:30,299
anita labs

609
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:32,279
like those are some pretty bit like I

610
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:34,169
was actually pretty surprised that some

611
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,019
of the Canadian mergers and acquisitions

612
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:39,690
that have occurred no more so than the

613
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:42,089
than the investment of constellation

614
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,190
putting five billion Canadian dollars in

615
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:47,240
I was like now they got to put some of

616
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:50,220
that into research that's a lot of money

617
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,319
it's also the same as any new big

618
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,019
business I mean when the automobile

619
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,269
industry started in America at the turn

620
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:59,839
of the century there were hundreds of

621
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:03,269
companies now

622
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:05,490
yeah it does seem to be the plan is to

623
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:07,980
try and be one of the big four the big

624
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:11,220
five or whatever the big number is going

625
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,529
to be for for the way it is for for so

626
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:17,089
many other things right it's the

627
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:17,089
financial posturing has begun

628
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:25,769
not worry about it you know they'll just

629
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:28,289
be folly you know here and then or maybe

630
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:33,379
someone say they had a question yes this

631
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:33,379
is wait laughter and dr. Russo would you

632
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,069
I imagine you saw the study that was

633
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:41,900
just published by Merrill and others in

634
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:44,279
Israel on whole plant preparations

635
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,269
decarboxylated and on decarboxylated and

636
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,269
their effects on cannabis

637
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,910
not sure maybe you could see what their

638
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,380
premise was of work

639
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:58,269
I'm not sure where the funding was I

640
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:01,960
think it was with Technion University

641
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:04,299
and they were looking at commercially

642
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,850
available products in the Israeli market

643
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:09,669
they got like a hundred and twenty

644
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:12,849
different products they tested all of

645
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:14,800
them for 89 cannabinoids there was

646
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:18,759
clearly a lot of money behind the study

647
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:21,069
but they picked 12 plant preparations

648
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:24,009
whole plant preparations with a whole

649
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:27,159
range of cannabinoids and tested them

650
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:31,349
for efficacy against I think it was 20

651
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:33,340
different cancer cell lines in vitro and

652
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:35,829
far and then of course they kept

653
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:39,250
controls of straight THC and straight

654
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:42,730
CBD and whatnot but they found some of

655
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:45,250
the more unusual cannabinoid mixes had

656
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:47,558
really profoundly good results at low

657
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:51,160
doses against a bunch of different cell

658
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:54,819
lines no I'm with you yeah a lot of this

659
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:57,630
work was done by David Maher II in

660
00:28:54,819 --> 00:29:02,079
Israel at the Technion I

661
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:05,500
know cam I've seen and numerous times

662
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:09,250
and yeah this is a good advance but we

663
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:11,619
have to be careful in interpreting these

664
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:14,799
results what they're doing is testing

665
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:17,649
different concentrations of material

666
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:20,799
either hold cannabis extracts or

667
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:25,630
fractions there were specific molecules

668
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:28,779
in cell culture what we have to remember

669
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:31,960
is that a lot of substances will kill

670
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:36,089
cancer cells in cell culture but that

671
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:40,090
doesn't necessarily translate to do a an

672
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:43,209
effective treatment in humans in this

673
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:46,869
instance yes we know that cannabinoids

674
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:48,660
can kill cancer cells they promote

675
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:52,209
apoptosis

676
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:55,090
apoptosis is programmed cell death but

677
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:58,150
it sounds like a bad thing but cells are

678
00:29:55,089 --> 00:30:00,339
supposed to have a normal lifespan what

679
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:02,740
happens in cancer is that they're not

680
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:04,750
heating the normal signals and they

681
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,450
become immortalized which is a way of

682
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:11,099
saying that they grow forever until

683
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:14,590
something stops up hopefully in medicine

684
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:17,908
but I think that that kind of research

685
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:22,028
can aim us towards what might be

686
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:25,539
effective agents to promote then through

687
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:26,579
selective breeding of various chemo bird

688
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:29,769
lines

689
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:32,168
but ultimately it's going to come down

690
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:34,509
to using these things in humans to see

691
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:36,249
if they really work well I was

692
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:38,970
fascinated by the study because it

693
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:42,940
seemed to suggest that the

694
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:46,589
the old-school traditional way of making

695
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:49,330
cannabis preparations actually

696
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:50,858
it was a study that confirmed our

697
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:53,079
experience which is the right

698
00:30:50,858 --> 00:30:56,528
preparation seemed to have pretty

699
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:58,829
dramatic effect with some cancers a lot

700
00:30:56,528 --> 00:31:01,148
of folks use really high doses but I

701
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:02,489
personally have seen some pretty good

702
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:05,498
results

703
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:08,470
at low doses in folks that don't really

704
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:11,319
like cannabis at all but have cancer and

705
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:14,048
it was it's just a nice confirmation of

706
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:16,778
what I personally have seen and many

707
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:19,089
other folks report that something's

708
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:21,989
going on with cannabis and cancer and

709
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:25,599
many other conditions and

710
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:28,028
we the problem is most of the research

711
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:30,219
in order to be randomized double-blind

712
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:32,950
etc et-cetera et-cetera you having to

713
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,169
use isolates and it misses the whole

714
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:38,048
picture of what the plant can do for us

715
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:40,600
that's what I was like I'm yeah that's

716
00:31:38,048 --> 00:31:43,118
all I got that kind of sounds maybe even

717
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:45,998
if you agree with this like there's the

718
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:48,819
isolating of cannabinoids and isolating

719
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:50,618
of you know medicine for pharmaceutical

720
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:53,980
izing something and it has its

721
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:55,738
limitations and then you know petri dish

722
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,179
and each row

723
00:31:55,739 --> 00:32:01,048
testing has its limitations and really

724
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:04,149
seems to keep coming back to that

725
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:06,788
whole plant medicine I mean that their

726
00:32:04,148 --> 00:32:08,668
reaction with our neurological system

727
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:11,769
being you know it seems to be

728
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:14,769
I say regardless of what you choose make

729
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:18,538
it all available yeah because I don't

730
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:21,069
want my choice to hinder your choice and

731
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:22,900
also welcome me you weren't in the

732
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:25,240
picture earlier right now I want to say

733
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,920
you guys do look like an oil painting

734
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,339
and I think so much take a screen shot

735
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:33,640
and oil paint that picture right there

736
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:36,789
at the DM pier camera because that's uh

737
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,270
that's pretty amazing I'll second that

738
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:42,690
motion am I wrong

739
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:42,690
I'll let her explain

740
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:52,170
Bionic really yeah I

741
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:55,199
don't on my shelf

742
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,199
[Music]

743
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:01,259
people hear me yes John but

744
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,190
what were you gonna say John I'm sorry

745
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:13,169
he just said can people hear me

746
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:15,070
[Laughter]

747
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:18,490
thank you all for the great work that

748
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:22,079
you're doing you know I live in Austin

749
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:24,329
Texas where cannabis

750
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:28,629
basically illegal

751
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:30,669
you have a fairly wimpy CBD law that

752
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,630
serves a very small percentage of the

753
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,460
population

754
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,230
it's

755
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,079
glorified

756
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:40,180
warehouse hemp law really

757
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:42,730
you know while it's super frustrating

758
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:45,880
that we aren't making more progress in

759
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:49,690
my state we're making progress and it's

760
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,550
wonderful to see that through programs

761
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:54,519
like this and the work that all of us

762
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:57,159
are doing collectively we are making

763
00:33:54,519 --> 00:34:01,269
progress even though it seems painfully

764
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:03,190
slow for us it is progress and what's

765
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:07,138
super interesting to me at the moment is

766
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:10,690
the fact that the general public is

767
00:34:07,138 --> 00:34:13,539
finally catching up to where all of us

768
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:16,869
are the problem seems to be that

769
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:21,820
government isn't and you know I think

770
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:26,009
that they're slowly getting there and as

771
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:29,860
they sort of come on board with seeing

772
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:33,800
this is the truth medicine and that it's

773
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:36,619
very safe and effective first with

774
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,210
medicine hopefully we'll start to see

775
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:40,608
better laws around the world that

776
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:42,190
reflect that even though it's painful

777
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:44,659
and I think that all of us have to

778
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:48,440
continue to stay the course and keep

779
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:50,898
talking about it if Thanks when day is

780
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,789
clean when do you think things will

781
00:34:50,898 --> 00:34:54,739
happen at the UN level we've seen the

782
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:56,079
World Health Organization and others

783
00:34:54,739 --> 00:35:00,139
actually

784
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,000
start to go for cannabis medicine but we

785
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:04,039
thought of a potential vote was going to

786
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,719
happen in the spring or potentially in

787
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:07,639
the summer but that has not yet arrived

788
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:10,608
and now we're looking to 2020 at this

789
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:13,699
time what can the individual watching

790
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:17,199
here do to put pressure on so that we

791
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:17,199
can see the results in the end

792
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:26,690
basically because of the work the World

793
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:30,789
Health Organization they really should

794
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:33,440
have to make a vote this next winter

795
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:35,119
the trouble is there's always someone

796
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,159
willing to throw a wrench in the gears

797
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,289
and it looks like the Russians are

798
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:42,500
opposed

799
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:45,259
and it may be that they'll find a way to

800
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,119
put this off yet again but the

801
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,809
foundation is there they've already

802
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,269
recommended that that cannabidiol BD

803
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:56,769
schedule

804
00:35:52,269 --> 00:36:00,259
there there be rescheduling of other

805
00:35:56,769 --> 00:36:03,250
forms of cannabis and THC we'll have to

806
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,450
see I think that at whatever level

807
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:08,239
people need to pressure their

808
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:12,939
politicians particularly on a federal

809
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:16,659
level to try and get this resolved

810
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:20,150
can you understand that

811
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:21,730
ultimately I think it's economics money

812
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,200
is what talks

813
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:27,530
convince people that there's money to be

814
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:30,439
made through cannabis commerce and that

815
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:32,960
the prison industrial complex is not a

816
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,679
benefit to society then there may be

817
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,679
changes

818
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:41,390
yeah ain't that the truth right there I

819
00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:44,180
have a question about Parkinson's for

820
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:48,248
dr. Ethan Rousseau if I could ask the

821
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:51,169
question here Marcus why not sure so

822
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:52,659
it's pleasure asking this question Ethan

823
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:55,068
I

824
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:59,598
had a family member my father's had

825
00:36:55,068 --> 00:37:01,748
Parkinson's for 16 years today and you

826
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,150
know we found a regiment of

827
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:07,458
THC and CBD

828
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:09,439
slightly not quite a one-to-one with

829
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:11,598
specific terpenes that have helped his

830
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:13,670
neurological being and I wanted to know

831
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:17,539
if you'd had had ever seen any profound

832
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:20,479
effects in your time with Parkinson's

833
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:21,979
and cannabinoid based therapies I know

834
00:37:20,478 --> 00:37:24,048
as our family it's been extremely

835
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:26,778
confusing and it's something that has

836
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:28,849
really been a guiding light for us so I

837
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:30,858
just wanted to simply ask the question

838
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:32,869
and see what your thoughts were yeah

839
00:37:30,858 --> 00:37:35,358
yeah it's a good question and it's a

840
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:38,568
tough area it's not like some of the

841
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:40,420
other condition we rapidly can see a

842
00:37:38,568 --> 00:37:43,130
benefit

843
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:45,829
various preparations have been tried in

844
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:48,709
Parkinson's and with mixed results my

845
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:51,410
feeling is that most often a small

846
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:53,768
amount of teets gonna be helpful with a

847
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:57,139
larger amount of CBD

848
00:37:53,768 --> 00:37:59,389
actually the best results that we know

849
00:37:57,139 --> 00:38:02,618
of to date have come in an entirely

850
00:37:59,389 --> 00:38:06,588
different form in

851
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:09,229
about 15 years ago there was a very good

852
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:13,088
survey study that came out of the Czech

853
00:38:09,228 --> 00:38:15,678
Republic on bender OVA

854
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:19,278
what happened there was there was a

855
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:23,209
fellow that was eating what appeared to

856
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:26,688
be raw cannabis um I honestly don't know

857
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:30,318
there is THC predominant or hemp oh that

858
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:33,078
would be CBB predominant THC predominant

859
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:36,679
and over the course of a long period of

860
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:39,380
time he improved his symptoms this

861
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:43,400
fellow was on check TV their equivalent

862
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:46,338
of 60 minutes and apparently a lot of

863
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,639
people started doing this we had some

864
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:52,250
200 odd patients that had done this and

865
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:56,719
what the findings were that almost all

866
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:59,300
aspects would improve but after

867
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,429
prolonged interval that people were

868
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:05,410
giving their best results after three

869
00:39:01,429 --> 00:39:08,739
months of using raw cannabis

870
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:11,750
ingested rather than I'm healed

871
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:15,489
so what that suggests to me is probably

872
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:20,179
it was either a combination of TCA

873
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:22,579
possibly with CBD a but again something

874
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:24,949
is happening very slowly here so it's

875
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:27,380
quite different to someone treating

876
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:31,429
their pain acutely or treating their

877
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:34,400
spasticity acutely I unfortunately there

878
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:37,460
hasn't been real follow-up on that but

879
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,190
um like anything else but particularly

880
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,300
with Parkinson's

881
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:44,650
experimentation is going to be needed

882
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:48,039
and I would really wonder about

883
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:53,000
cannabinoid acids on against

884
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:55,009
TB G a and C right well I've gone

885
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,780
through hundreds of cultivars literally

886
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:58,780
and what I found is after a while

887
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:03,949
the effects of those said cultivars or

888
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:06,289
strains if you will start to taper off

889
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:09,069
and I have to to start looking again and

890
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:12,079
we keep trying and we keep trying

891
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:15,140
it's been a vicious cycle but but to

892
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:19,250
your point we have noticed that in acid

893
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:23,629
form THC a is more profound for him than

894
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:25,940
if we do carboxylate it so she it's just

895
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:29,119
the way he works his body responds

896
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,800
better to that for some reason so really

897
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,179
interesting and really solidifies a lot

898
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,230
of things we've been doing so thank you

899
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,230
very much for sharing that

900
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:44,720
dietary or

901
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,119
microbiome and endocannabinoid tone

902
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,559
building

903
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:51,079
supplementation program well that's a

904
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:53,779
good question I mean I hate my feeling

905
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:56,029
is that so many of the disorders we're

906
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:59,690
seeing in modern society are related to

907
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:02,810
inflammatory and autoimmune processes we

908
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:05,329
know that in the 21st century these

909
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:08,360
things are really whereas in the 19th

910
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:11,199
century they were exceptionally rare and

911
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:15,130
the difference is our diets

912
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:17,079
I'm a big proponent of

913
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:19,910
prebiotics and probiotics

914
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:24,019
getting that gut balance in my feeling

915
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:26,779
is that the gut microbiome is the master

916
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:32,079
regulator of the endocannabinoids system

917
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:34,030
so you can treat things that way

918
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,239
and

919
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:40,250
supplement with cannabinoids

920
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:43,429
subsequently and I think between the two

921
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:46,670
that we've got possible effective

922
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:48,710
treatments for a lot of manziel's and

923
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm taking medicinal mushrooms fit in

924
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,269
there too as well with their

925
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,510
neurological aid with lion's mane and

926
00:41:53,269 --> 00:42:01,159
the other nootropic regenerative so

927
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:03,910
you just said nootropics at the exact

928
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:06,739
same time I did but I was muted

929
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:07,960
it was awesome to hear your voice come

930
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:10,689
out of my

931
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:14,630
that was a trail

932
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:17,059
yeah cosmic I like it I like it you know

933
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,740
it's again we there's a lot of toxins in

934
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:20,679
this world you know nowadays and you

935
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:24,109
know they finding

936
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:26,449
10,000 plastic particles and one liter

937
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:29,690
of snow and in the Arctic right now and

938
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:32,149
you know there's just a lot of overload

939
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:34,400
in our body so you know even things like

940
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,289
activated charcoal you know it's not a

941
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,119
cannabis thing but it's a way of

942
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:40,400
detoxing our system and helping our

943
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,769
microbiome and I think it's a

944
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,360
combination of cannabinoids and turbines

945
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:47,179
but it's also a combination of other

946
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,800
herbal properties and I think it's just

947
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:50,239
touched on something that I think is

948
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,690
really important as well as

949
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:55,789
detoxification and I think that you know

950
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,309
we're always talking about what kind of

951
00:42:55,789 --> 00:43:00,380
we can add to our body to help boost our

952
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:02,179
immune system and I think also it's

953
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:05,900
important to start looking at how we can

954
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:08,379
detoxify you know ourselves our

955
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:13,010
intestinal system

956
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:16,329
so that these other treatments that come

957
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:19,420
after that work better cleanser

958
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:23,619
Bashar I just wanted to add that boots

959
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:26,200
Parkinson's also the medication you take

960
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:30,339
I forget what it's called l-dopa or

961
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:32,460
whatever it causes severe nausea in some

962
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:35,980
patients and

963
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:39,420
that is a real problem and cannabis can

964
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,420
help with severe nausea

965
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:47,739
yeah sure

966
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:50,619
yeah you know so much for my father he

967
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:53,679
was a 101st airborne first the 506 he

968
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:55,929
was directly involved in Vietnam and out

969
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,179
on recon by himself with two other

970
00:43:55,929 --> 00:44:00,549
gentlemen that were a sharpshooter and

971
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:02,529
the other guy was dismantling bombs so

972
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,840
they would just get rained on with deep

973
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:06,400
literally he would tell stories of just

974
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,140
walking through the jungle and all of a

975
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,960
sudden

976
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:15,969
boom and just get nailed with just this

977
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,980
toxic stuff and you know it's it's an

978
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:20,289
it's insane to me that it took so long

979
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,880
for his body to to basically was

980
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:24,670
spending all this stuff off for so long

981
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,730
and then it just it just overcame his

982
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:30,150
neurological being in the self and it

983
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:32,469
really took took our family for a storm

984
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:34,360
and it was very confusing every no one

985
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:36,009
wanted to admit that he had it no

986
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:39,700
doctors wanted to sign him off as that

987
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:41,980
and we were just left confused so it's

988
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:43,199
it's very interesting that is a question

989
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:47,230
how you taking

990
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:49,389
yeah I'm asking are you taking any amino

991
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:54,659
acids by any chance along with his

992
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:54,659
cavities he's doing like tyrosine or

993
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:00,130
as well

994
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:02,440
because I take a lot of amino acids and

995
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,039
of we there was a paper why amino acids

996
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:08,019
work that I worked on with

997
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:10,989
years ago and I just looked it up and it

998
00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:13,170
looks on the carpet in Thailand it says

999
00:45:10,989 --> 00:45:15,399
what we were just researching

1000
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,530
falen that's par for the course the VA

1001
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:20,170
will deny and

1002
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:22,390
yeah they basically give some of the

1003
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:24,730
worst health care possible that's why I

1004
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:26,710
had my own health care because they told

1005
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:29,590
me the blisters on my feet for nine

1006
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:31,059
years were all in my head and all kinds

1007
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:32,980
of other problems and it wasn't until

1008
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:35,320
five years down the line that a brave

1009
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:38,559
doctor actually told me that they were

1010
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:41,440
told to lie to us and then two years

1011
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,779
later I got a nine-page breakdown of

1012
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,840
everything I was actually exposed to due

1013
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:50,350
to over running positions and having all

1014
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:53,309
these bunkers blown up around us so it's

1015
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:57,670
actually modus operandi for the VA to

1016
00:45:53,309 --> 00:46:00,130
deny etc that's why it is diligent upon

1017
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:03,940
you and your family to throw it back in

1018
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:06,700
their face and be blunt honest and

1019
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:09,610
capture as much as your anger to them as

1020
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:12,609
possible and vitriol they did yes I mean

1021
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:13,690
I'm in Philadelphia often I I do work

1022
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:17,260
with the University of Pennsylvania

1023
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:19,559
which is you know there's some smart

1024
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:22,620
people and and great people over there

1025
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:24,579
however it is still confusing so it's uh

1026
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:27,219
it's nice to hear a lot of this stuff

1027
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:30,190
from you all so it really helps better

1028
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:32,139
understand we make copies of everything

1029
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:34,659
they're gonna lose your paperwork make

1030
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:37,359
sure you have your own copies I have had

1031
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:41,589
my paperwork loss from da V American

1032
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:43,180
Legion VFW it's it took me four or five

1033
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,059
different filings just to get my Gulf

1034
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:48,039
War Syndrome stuff

1035
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:49,960
denial is always the thing so it's again

1036
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:52,329
upon you and your family to be as

1037
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,670
educated and throw it back in their face

1038
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:55,989
as possible because majority of these

1039
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:57,670
doctors remember eighty percent of

1040
00:46:55,989 --> 00:47:00,669
physicians go through the VA system

1041
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:02,440
because it's immediate residency so you

1042
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:04,720
get the good the bad and the ugly and

1043
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,190
I've had more than my share of ugly but

1044
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:08,709
there's some good ones out there don't

1045
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:11,289
get me wrong redness I choose to use

1046
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,579
regular physicians in the regular world

1047
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:14,769
which is why I have a business and

1048
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:16,809
insurance and I cover my insurance as

1049
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:19,030
well as you know most of my employers as

1050
00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:21,340
well because health care in America

1051
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:23,470
still sucks and it should be a right but

1052
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:26,470
we still have to take care of our own no

1053
00:47:23,469 --> 00:47:29,679
don't no don't absolutely which is kind

1054
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:33,789
of empowering me you know but not but

1055
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:36,879
you know it kids using you know you kind

1056
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:39,460
of like oh I can't rely on the system

1057
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,890
sometimes I find here in Canada you

1058
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,380
people rely on the system so much that

1059
00:47:41,889 --> 00:47:46,029
they turn off their self-reliance button

1060
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,940
you know and they're like oh I don't

1061
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,769
have to go to the top you know so I mean

1062
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:53,200
that I'm not saying that you know

1063
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:55,929
definitely medical cares is the way to

1064
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:58,419
go but also just continue learning like

1065
00:47:55,929 --> 00:48:02,259
we're doing is really where we're gonna

1066
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:04,920
in pain no doubt man oh yeah question

1067
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:07,570
what is your dad's intake method

1068
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:10,480
his delivery for cannabis is that what

1069
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:13,300
you're asking uh so I make pills i well

1070
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,780
now he buys them but we we started where

1071
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:21,010
I would make pills for him and also

1072
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:22,990
tinctures so that's really the delivery

1073
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:24,540
method of his his preferred delivery

1074
00:48:22,989 --> 00:48:27,939
method

1075
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:29,679
so we would do that three times a day

1076
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,470
two to three times a day that's where we

1077
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,739
started out and now we're just down to

1078
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:37,949
once a day and

1079
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:41,109
that's it that that was the

1080
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:42,659
way that we found was the best way for

1081
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:46,660
him to

1082
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:50,339
in taken ingest cannabis for him so

1083
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:50,339
that's that's what we we chose to do

1084
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:53,909
thank you

1085
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:00,599
so

1086
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,329
they have

1087
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:06,699
they were wildly out of control

1088
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:09,429
you know at one point and now they are

1089
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:12,129
are controlled and he's actually going

1090
00:49:09,429 --> 00:49:14,139
on a trip to Europe and he's feeling

1091
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:15,930
like he's gonna go to Amsterdam he's

1092
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:19,599
going to to Spain

1093
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:21,609
so he's you know he's working out three

1094
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:24,549
times a week which is great I'm really

1095
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:28,120
on him about what she should be doing to

1096
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:29,620
be proactive and it's it's a thing where

1097
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:31,359
it's really it's tough because you want

1098
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:32,739
to be you want to have all this energy

1099
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,140
and you want him to have all this

1100
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:37,299
excitement they that I share and having

1101
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:39,400
all this belief and he it just he

1102
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:42,039
doesn't have it because it's it's this

1103
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,920
the this the disease it's it's causing

1104
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:46,690
him to feel all these things from the

1105
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,309
question all the way to lack of

1106
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:51,250
motivation and all these things that you

1107
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:53,380
have to remind him like hey you're here

1108
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,909
we have a you know I'm here with you you

1109
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,800
know you want to be here with us right I

1110
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,659
want to be here with you and those are

1111
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:02,920
the things that that allow him to

1112
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:05,529
overcome those hard hard tasks so to

1113
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,470
speak so he's you know three times a

1114
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:11,470
week he gets out

1115
00:50:07,469 --> 00:50:13,480
and he walks every day which is great so

1116
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:15,309
you know obviously some days are better

1117
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,070
than others it's just the way that it's

1118
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:20,349
it it's built the disease is really its

1119
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:23,019
own it has its own mind it's really

1120
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:24,639
fascinating how with just when you think

1121
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:28,269
you got it you're like yeah I got this

1122
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:30,879
it totally changes and morphs and and

1123
00:50:28,269 --> 00:50:34,000
does its thing on you and and it really

1124
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,940
it's it's absolutely mind-bending I mean

1125
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,650
it's it's it's really fascinating but it

1126
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,659
makes me work harder it makes me it's

1127
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:43,090
why I'm in mass and why I'm around all

1128
00:50:40,659 --> 00:50:46,389
these these universities and and minds

1129
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:48,610
that I can collaborate with to try to

1130
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:49,839
help better understand not only what I'm

1131
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:53,019
going through but what they're trying to

1132
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:54,880
do with cannabinoid research so we can

1133
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:57,039
all together find a mote profound

1134
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,579
understanding for to make a more

1135
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:02,829
informative choice so that's something I

1136
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:05,139
struggle with all the time but yeah the

1137
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:07,449
the delivery method has been been

1138
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:09,879
tinctures and and I think it's really

1139
00:51:07,449 --> 00:51:13,379
and and pills and those are the two

1140
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:16,570
right now that we found really helpful

1141
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:20,700
that's really fabulous you know we make

1142
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:23,769
a medicinal mushroom hemp oil

1143
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:25,899
combination oil and it's something

1144
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:27,969
that's you know not really very common

1145
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,039
and suddenly be used for long and I

1146
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:31,839
would really love to sends one to you if

1147
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:36,159
you're interested he can give it a try

1148
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:38,559
it has has the lion's mane and the red

1149
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:41,440
belted Konkan and chaga and a lot of the

1150
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:45,670
other medicinal mushrooms and we just

1151
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:47,980
feel very inspired with the mushroom

1152
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:49,659
realm you know as much as the cannabis

1153
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,550
and to bring them together I think you

1154
00:51:49,659 --> 00:51:53,019
know it sometimes it's just the fusion

1155
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:55,830
and you don't know what it is but anyway

1156
00:51:53,019 --> 00:51:58,500
yeah we just be willing to love wood

1157
00:51:55,829 --> 00:52:00,239
what are the active ingredients in those

1158
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,900
mushrooms I'm just curious it's

1159
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,909
obviously not so Simon is it

1160
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:11,250
so we're really would love for it to be

1161
00:52:05,909 --> 00:52:13,619
psilocybin but we're waiting yeah so we

1162
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:15,630
are really actually really actively

1163
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:18,299
looking for you know being able to

1164
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:20,490
define exactly what's in it but so what

1165
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,880
you know it's the polysaccharides and

1166
00:52:20,489 --> 00:52:26,869
the beta gluten

1167
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:30,480
so it's a water-soluble extract from the

1168
00:52:26,869 --> 00:52:33,230
friends of mushroom oil it's an oil ex

1169
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,360
trail oil

1170
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:39,619
the mushrooms are steam extracted and

1171
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:44,099
then it goes into a liquid extraction oh

1172
00:52:39,619 --> 00:52:45,769
cool we also use a combination of fungi

1173
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:49,199
we use live

1174
00:52:45,769 --> 00:52:53,659
poly pores from the tree as well as dual

1175
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,659
extracted Chagas and and different

1176
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:59,789
[Music]

1177
00:52:56,869 --> 00:53:01,920
well in in the name of science guys

1178
00:52:59,789 --> 00:53:03,989
let's do a little analytical chemistry

1179
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,269
and figure out what are the molecules in

1180
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:08,759
there they're they're aromatic molecules

1181
00:53:06,269 --> 00:53:11,449
the the ones from lion's mane are known

1182
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:14,190
as Harrison owns and Erina Singh's

1183
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:16,980
diterpene compounds and they spur

1184
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:19,440
production of ngf and nerve cells this

1185
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:21,599
is what I know that's helping to

1186
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,789
maintain cholinergic system and for

1187
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,440
brain function but that's just me and

1188
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:27,690
there's all sorts of nootropics and Paul

1189
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,289
stam enormous amount of information on

1190
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:33,240
these mushrooms on on his on so they're

1191
00:53:31,289 --> 00:53:35,250
not alkaloids right they're not the

1192
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:37,649
compounds are alkaloids they're terpenes

1193
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:39,719
well in this particular instance the bio

1194
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:41,610
actives in Lions Mane's but there's a

1195
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:43,349
whole bunch of nootropic mushrooms like

1196
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:45,570
he just mentioned Chagga which is

1197
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:48,119
another one you know this there's a

1198
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:51,350
there's a schwack of them memory and

1199
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:54,059
nerve support so we

1200
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:55,319
know pulsed and nourish leading into it

1201
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:58,679
it's the real deal

1202
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:00,030
what's that Kelly um I was just saying

1203
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:02,069
mark we were talking to you a little bit

1204
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:03,870
earlier and we did want to you know get

1205
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:05,789
to the bottom of this we use you know

1206
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:09,139
we've never really separated cannabis

1207
00:54:05,789 --> 00:54:11,659
and mycology in medicine always mixed

1208
00:54:09,139 --> 00:54:13,819
the two and had tremendous results from

1209
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:16,730
the patients who have been taking it but

1210
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:18,830
really there's so much unknown because

1211
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:20,780
we weren't able to test it in a regular

1212
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:22,969
testing facility because it also had

1213
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:25,910
cannabis in it so now we have this

1214
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:28,099
ability to move forward and really find

1215
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:30,889
out what is in this medicine that's been

1216
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:32,299
working so well for people yeah I mean

1217
00:54:30,889 --> 00:54:35,000
now that there's plenty of labs around

1218
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,410
that can do cannabis testing a lot of

1219
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,960
them do have the analytical

1220
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:41,960
instrumentation to figure out what some

1221
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,179
of these other minor compounds might be

1222
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:47,150
that is in there I was reading last week

1223
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:49,219
and a week before the the flavonoids are

1224
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:50,900
800 times more stronger than aspirin and

1225
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:52,339
Tylenol the sir I think that researchers

1226
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,230
just came up with there was a big

1227
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:55,720
article on it I'd like to find it again

1228
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:58,130
day but it read on

1229
00:54:55,719 --> 00:55:00,709
all right beautiful people I love you I

1230
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:03,829
have to head out I want to say a happy

1231
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:05,710
belated birthday d 4/20 as well as

1232
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:08,630
congrats on your business

1233
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:11,059
bubbleman and Ethan risotto thank you

1234
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:12,710
for coming in man many blessings Colton

1235

everybody I think thank you very much

1236
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:18,400
I'm off I'm celebrating my 50th this

1237
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,400
week as well so

1238
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:29,569
Darrin you haven't said it for yeah

1239
00:55:25,699 --> 00:55:32,059
today yeah he said it three minutes ago

1240
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:34,010
yeah you know what I will say it again

1241
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:36,579
it was just such good conversation how

1242
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:39,380
do I interrupt that [ __ ] honestly

1243
00:55:36,579 --> 00:55:41,289
you know so I'll give it I'll give it a

1244
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:45,769
good one here

1245
00:55:41,289 --> 00:55:49,659
bong real oh and we got a we got a this

1246
00:55:45,769 --> 00:55:52,369
is in honor of Brandon vigil

1247
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:54,199
that he's a big fan and if he could get

1248
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:56,210
a shout out it would make his day and

1249
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:58,969
I'm thinking well that's gonna make his

1250
00:55:56,210 --> 00:56:02,210
day then shout out to Brandon Bissell

1251
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:06,608
hey bong rip Brandon let's do this let's

1252
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:09,980
do it put a brand invisible I

1253
00:56:06,608 --> 00:56:12,019
yeah I'm only gonna do a two-hour hash

1254
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:14,070
Church today so we got another hour left

1255
00:56:12,019 --> 00:56:15,960
of dialogue and

1256
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:18,539
happy to take it in whatever direction

1257
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,309
that it goes in just happen how can you

1258
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:22,199
be joining on the Sunday morning with

1259
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:25,079
with all of you wonderful people again

1260
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:28,379
it's been it's been too long

1261
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:29,670
could could I um try to steer this in a

1262
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,230
little direction that's kind of off

1263
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:34,610
topic what we're talking about before

1264
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:38,219
but I would really like what would done

1265
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:40,200
what would be the easy well not easy

1266
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:43,339
start but how would a guy like myself

1267
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:47,419
who hasn't done the living soil before

1268
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:47,420
what would I get started on this

1269
00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:55,199
getting started on learning living soils

1270
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:57,980
well you know that we did do a good hash

1271
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:00,599
search on soils

1272
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:03,440
and if you look back and resource that

1273
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:07,949
it has a lot of information on it and

1274
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:11,400
there are people that analyze soils like

1275
00:57:07,949 --> 00:57:14,699
Leighton Morrison and Scott Scott

1276
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:17,460
granola online and there are people that

1277
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:20,730
do help people with living soil systems

1278
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:22,409
you can look them up but we also work

1279
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:24,619
with people you can hit us up I think

1280
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:27,149
you know we might be seeing you soon

1281
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:29,819
there I wouldn't say that there's like a

1282
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:32,070
book out there that says something on

1283
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:34,470
living soils and this is exactly how to

1284
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:37,110
do it I think it's more linking up with

1285
00:57:34,469 --> 00:57:39,899
farms and that they're doing the work

1286
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:42,930
and doing it testing along with their

1287
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:45,079
soils well what falls books are worth

1288
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:47,279
checking out though his teaming books

1289
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:50,579
Jeff Lowe and Phillips I was teaming

1290
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:53,519
with microbes and I'm teaming with fungi

1291
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:56,690
and teeming with nutrients when and all

1292
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:59,969
of those are incredible scientific tools

1293
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:03,179
another one new one by Michael Phillips

1294
00:57:59,969 --> 00:58:06,049
is really great on soil even I found it

1295
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:09,419
a little technical but if you understand

1296
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:11,850
very detailed it's not specific to

1297
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:15,030
cannibals but it'll give you all the

1298
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:17,099
background information that you need and

1299
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:18,540
I think if we start transitioning the

1300
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:22,019
mind work and what we've been already

1301
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:23,940
taught by big AG is that you know it's

1302
00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:25,440
the soil that's feeding the plants

1303
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,480
rather than the nutrients that you're

1304
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,670
giving so everything that you're putting

1305
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,889
into your soil you have to wonder how is

1306
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:34,680
it affecting your soil what is your soil

1307
00:58:31,889 --> 00:58:37,019
eating and then all of the exudates from

1308
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:38,879
the microbiology within the soil then

1309
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:41,099
transfer over to the feeding of the

1310
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,340
plant so just transferring your mind

1311
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:46,799
over to let the soil feed the plant and

1312
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:49,740
you're feeding the soil that's a super

1313
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:52,380
helpful way to look at it and what kind

1314
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:54,479
of things in nature like soil what kind

1315
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:56,940
of things in nature are digesting soil

1316
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,860
very rapidly and that's you know carbon

1317
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:01,289
that's already happening so if we're

1318
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:02,940
just transitioning our mind it's almost

1319
00:59:01,289 --> 00:59:06,090
like once you start getting into the

1320
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:08,519
microbiology then the microbiology takes

1321
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:10,380
over the education in your mind and then

1322
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:13,469
you're actually being educated by the

1323
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:16,400
microbiology it's the Josh seriously

1324
00:59:13,469 --> 00:59:21,199
just come into the room I know

1325
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:23,849
hey George what your ears burning did

1326
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:25,859
my headphones to work but I'm having

1327
00:59:23,849 --> 00:59:27,659
difficulties it's all good I think this

1328
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,340
platform it works really good even

1329
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:31,079
without headphones but seriously Darrin

1330
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,340
was just like okay I got a question I

1331
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:34,889
want to steer this in a different

1332
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:38,070
direction how do I learn about living

1333
00:59:34,889 --> 00:59:39,449
soils and then literally they started

1334
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:41,720
talking and I was just kind of looking

1335
00:59:39,449 --> 00:59:45,839
around then I looked down and I'm like

1336
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:47,699
come into the room I was trippy welcome

1337
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:49,220
I'm yours too because I kind of want to

1338
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:53,119
start doing the same thing

1339
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:57,659
so we're talking about living soil

1340
00:59:53,119 --> 01:00:00,449
you know living soils is is a term that

1341
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:03,809
that describes an action and the action

1342
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:07,039
of a living soil is decomposing and when

1343
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:09,090
soil is decomposing it's advancing the

1344
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:11,579
microbiology and it's advancing the

1345
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:14,010
nutrients that's going in the roots so

1346
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:15,929
traditionally in cannabis growing a lot

1347
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:18,870
of people bought soil that was finished

1348
01:00:15,929 --> 01:00:21,079
you know it had this may be peat moss or

1349
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:23,909
coca-cola and it was this finished

1350
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:26,279
cooked down soil with all the nutrients

1351
01:00:23,909 --> 01:00:27,929
in it and you bought this finished soil

1352
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,180
and then you added teased to it

1353
01:00:27,929 --> 01:00:32,639
throughout the cycle but and it wasn't

1354
01:00:30,179 --> 01:00:35,039
really alive in the same way so what

1355
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:37,679
we're learning now with living soils is

1356
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:40,559
using you know combinations of raw

1357
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:43,589
materials in the beginning in the making

1358
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:46,799
of the soil like different now Alfa's

1359
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:49,079
and haze and and different carbon

1360
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:52,050
sources along with certain parts of

1361
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:54,269
biochar which is sort of a a charcoal in

1362
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:56,269
the soil which allows microorganisms to

1363
01:00:54,269 --> 01:01:00,719
live but it's also somewhat of a filter

1364
01:00:56,269 --> 01:01:02,849
and then we you add in a nice mulch or

1365
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:06,089
top layer to the soil to continue the

1366
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:08,759
feeding of the microbiology and then you

1367
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:11,789
can use you know fermented plant teas

1368
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:13,980
really really easy from there every once

1369
01:01:11,789 --> 01:01:15,840
in a while every couple weeks or

1370
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:18,449
whatever it is to add to your soil so

1371
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:23,220
adding the and making a really rich soil

1372
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:24,960
is is the really ticket and I think that

1373
01:01:23,219 --> 01:01:26,759
it's a lot like you know when you invite

1374
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,470
friends over to dinners you usually

1375
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,680
write them and say hey what are your

1376
01:01:28,469 --> 01:01:34,579
dietary restriction

1377
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:38,219
what is it that my friends like to eat

1378
01:01:34,579 --> 01:01:39,929
it's really the same what kind of fungi

1379
01:01:38,219 --> 01:01:42,059
do you want in your soil and then you

1380
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:44,339
ask the question oh well what is that

1381
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:46,079
fungi want to eat so if you're going to

1382
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:48,930
be inviting in all these different

1383
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:53,329
beneficial microbiology they have to be

1384
01:01:48,929 --> 01:01:53,329
in in order to colonize they have to be

1385
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:58,590
focused on which I like to eat in order

1386
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:01,880
to stick around and colonize which will

1387
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,880
bring more chirping some work can happen

1388
01:02:02,869 --> 01:02:08,119
the one thing that I sure noticed about

1389
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:10,659
the stuff that was grown in living soil

1390
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:15,949
was the taste and

1391
01:02:10,659 --> 01:02:18,170
the buzz the smell like the stuff and I

1392
01:02:15,949 --> 01:02:20,059
sit in my room the other day doing my

1393
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:22,460
measurements on this and I don't do the

1394
01:02:20,059 --> 01:02:24,799
proper measurements as they say on the

1395
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:26,929
label I do my own measurements as I feel

1396
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:28,640
that the plants can take with my

1397
01:02:26,929 --> 01:02:31,429
nutrient levels and that sort of stuff

1398
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:34,159
so I do my own little tweaking and that

1399
01:02:31,429 --> 01:02:35,839
not is like basically we can teach a

1400
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:37,489
monkey to do that and he can run the

1401
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,590
show no problem if that's what we're

1402
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:41,359
doing and you know it's really nice to

1403
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:44,360
open everything like that but then

1404
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:47,780
there's that living soil where I tasted

1405
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:50,630
in it and was just what the hell is that

1406
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:52,490
that is unbelievable and like you can

1407
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:55,280
almost taste the Earth that it's grown

1408
01:02:52,489 --> 01:02:58,989
in as well and and then the concentrates

1409
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:02,120
from it to mind-blowing earth-moving

1410
01:02:58,989 --> 01:03:04,159
life-changing type situation and then

1411
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:06,559
I'm like whoa you know I'm a pretty good

1412
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:09,250
grower I guess with with with doing

1413
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:13,190
measurements and pH of water and stuff

1414
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:15,019
good for me but if I could take those

1415
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:17,269
strains that I've the cultivars that I

1416
01:03:15,019 --> 01:03:18,590
have and make them better and and how

1417
01:03:17,269 --> 01:03:20,480
they are right now and they could be

1418
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:23,260
better because that living soil next I

1419
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:26,690
need to learn it I need to

1420
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:29,420
one thing I wanted to bring up I get a

1421
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:31,639
lot a lot of indoor growers talking to

1422
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:34,369
me and asking questions on how to do you

1423
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:36,079
know living soil beds indoors and we've

1424
01:03:34,369 --> 01:03:37,940
kind of all seen the model on Instagram

1425
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,190
where it's you know fabric pots you know

1426
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:41,200
8 8 12 inches deep you know these beds

1427
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:44,360
and

1428
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:46,460
as as I've just been learning and able

1429
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:49,160
to talk with different folks and

1430
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:51,070
experience growing outdoors and in a

1431
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:52,879
greenhouse that is connected to the soil

1432
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:56,120
you know because I used to do this

1433
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,010
method for about 10 years and learning

1434
01:03:56,119 --> 01:03:59,750
with Leighton is is we've realized that

1435
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:01,880
if you're not connected to the earth you

1436
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:03,010
have problems number one you know

1437
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,940
there's there's

1438
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:07,010
electrical issues you know you know I

1439
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:08,960
physically grounded to the earth but

1440
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:10,640
also you know a lot of people miss the

1441
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,019
mulch layer and Josh and Kelly you know

1442
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:13,940
the way they do it they do lots of these

1443
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:15,940
layers and the mulch is kind of like a

1444
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:18,130
moisture cap

1445
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:20,230
and it holds all the moisture in and

1446
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:21,730
regulates the moisture and then the

1447
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:24,039
other thing we're really getting into is

1448
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:25,869
you know instead of just having this 12

1449
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:27,880
inch of layer of what we're calling the

1450
01:04:25,869 --> 01:04:30,970
organic horizon you know that people are

1451
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:32,740
making up this the peat Mik mixture you

1452
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:35,230
know third Peter third aeration a third

1453
01:04:32,739 --> 01:04:37,088
compost that's really an organic horizon

1454
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:39,309
in in a natural Earth's setting and

1455
01:04:37,088 --> 01:04:42,099
we're missing the a horizon the alluvial

1456
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:44,589
layer that is made up of sand silt and

1457
01:04:42,099 --> 01:04:46,630
clay and the importance of that is it's

1458
01:04:44,588 --> 01:04:48,699
doing the same thing it's balancing the

1459
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:50,200
moisture throughout so when you you

1460
01:04:48,699 --> 01:04:52,328
water you don't get all this runoff you

1461
01:04:50,199 --> 01:04:54,098
get this this balance of you know

1462
01:04:52,329 --> 01:04:56,349
moisture in the bed and that's where

1463
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:58,630
we're seeing like really long-term

1464
01:04:56,349 --> 01:05:00,640
success in a Norn indoor platform

1465
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:02,559
because then once you establish the

1466
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:04,199
right biology you know vehicle a good

1467
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,490
compost tea

1468
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:08,078
those microbes will actually start

1469
01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:09,578
harvesting the nutrients from that

1470
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,380
alluvial layer the sand silt and clay

1471
01:05:09,579 --> 01:05:13,720
and you won't need to be top dressing

1472
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:15,039
after after a period you know and I just

1473
01:05:13,719 --> 01:05:16,750
want to kind of throw that into this

1474
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,670
discussion I don't know you know if you

1475
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:20,829
Josh and Kelly if you've experienced or

1476
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:23,619
that any of that work with when you

1477
01:05:20,829 --> 01:05:26,230
consult with indoor grows but just

1478
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:29,130
something we're seeing hang alluvial for

1479
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:32,048
one that's a fun word

1480
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:34,599
but yeah I mean you know having those

1481
01:05:32,048 --> 01:05:36,639
are essentially trace minerals too you

1482
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:39,010
know and when it comes into sand and it

1483
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:40,960
comes into clay layers and volcanic you

1484
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:43,119
know ash layers and stuff like that and

1485
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,809
I think that is really smart I think

1486
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:48,400
that there's been like the I

1487
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:50,470
was also another teaching was having the

1488
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:54,400
soil drain out really fast you know and

1489
01:05:50,469 --> 01:05:55,929
then REE you know and then read aerate

1490
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,490
it which is kind of almost like flood

1491
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:59,318
and drain a little bit more so I think

1492
01:05:57,489 --> 01:06:02,048
you're you're totally right and it's

1493
01:05:59,318 --> 01:06:03,429
being able to contain the moisture keeps

1494
01:06:02,048 --> 01:06:05,829
the life alive otherwise the

1495
01:06:03,429 --> 01:06:08,528
microbiology has to sort of die out and

1496
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:11,410
then regrow and then I think you get

1497
01:06:08,528 --> 01:06:13,000
more supple trichomes and in the end and

1498
01:06:11,409 --> 01:06:15,068
I think that's what you're seeing Darren

1499
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,230
and and maybe in Mike and you know the

1500
01:06:15,068 --> 01:06:19,210
extract artists that are taking the

1501
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:21,789
extraction from that you know healthy

1502
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:23,079
sphere and and also I think that you

1503
01:06:21,789 --> 01:06:25,869
know you were saying that you're getting

1504
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:28,269
a better flavor and taste when you put a

1505
01:06:25,869 --> 01:06:31,190
plant in its natural environment because

1506
01:06:28,269 --> 01:06:32,119
plants now environment is soil then

1507
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:34,909
you're gonna bring out the ultimate

1508
01:06:32,119 --> 01:06:37,069
potential at that particular strain and

1509
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:38,960
what we've seen is that we've been able

1510
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:41,180
to take really old strains that have

1511
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,940
been played out for lack of better term

1512
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:47,329
and be able to put them in our deep rich

1513
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:49,579
soil beds for a whole season and totally

1514
01:06:47,329 --> 01:06:52,099
regenerate that plant there's a lot of

1515
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:54,110
regeneration talk with tissue culture

1516
01:06:52,099 --> 01:06:55,819
and I would like to really put in the

1517
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:58,340
Hat regeneration of these strains

1518
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:59,860
through deep soil living soil techniques

1519
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:02,360
as well

1520
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:04,930
yeah I would just add that I've seen

1521
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,930
this work

1522
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:11,869
these guys have documentation of plants

1523
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:15,200
that are approaching three meters in

1524
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:17,929
height now that were this high six weeks

1525
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:20,389
ago just through these techniques and

1526
01:07:17,929 --> 01:07:22,730
it's just with water good soil and water

1527
01:07:20,389 --> 01:07:24,619
and a lot of sunshine and a lot of the

1528
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:26,510
big Lisa you know we had that big leaf

1529
01:07:24,619 --> 01:07:28,429
picture on there I mean we have lots of

1530
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:30,560
plants with big Leafs like that and

1531
01:07:28,429 --> 01:07:32,839
anyway it's and it's not strain

1532
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,789
dependent so you know I really want to

1533
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:36,470
encourage people that have a played-out

1534
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:38,570
strain that they've really loved and

1535
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:40,730
they've held on to for a whole long time

1536
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:43,580
you know give it to somebody else or

1537
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:45,740
start doing living soil techniques on

1538
01:07:43,579 --> 01:07:47,630
their own to rejuvenate this strain and

1539
01:07:45,739 --> 01:07:50,209
I think that that's going to be really

1540
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:52,820
helpful in the industry into the future

1541
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:55,010
I'd also add that when it when you carry

1542
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:57,920
that out living soils give a structure

1543
01:07:55,010 --> 01:08:00,710
to the trichome that allows your the

1544
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:04,579
plant better afterwards and it gives a

1545
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:08,269
longevity to the Civic flowers there's a

1546
01:08:04,579 --> 01:08:10,849
you know another thing thanks John we

1547
01:08:08,269 --> 01:08:12,800
have you know this thing where you you

1548
01:08:10,849 --> 01:08:14,599
know you have to sell your your flowers

1549
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,640
within two weeks of harvesting it you

1550
01:08:14,599 --> 01:08:18,050
know a lot of times a lot of people in

1551
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,430
your there's a lot of people up here in

1552
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:21,640
British Columbia and stuff they'll be

1553
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:25,640
like two weeks later it's on the market

1554
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:27,650
but you know you lose out on curing your

1555
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:30,320
cannabinoids and we were talking about

1556
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:32,569
this the other night and just CDN or

1557
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,789
something newer cannabinoid that can

1558
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:36,739
happen after time you know one year in

1559
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:40,699
two years so I think that living soils

1560
01:08:36,739 --> 01:08:42,979
also allows you to have better medicine

1561
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:44,059
and you can cure a longer which allows

1562
01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:45,679
you do different things with your

1563
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:49,130
medicine and hopefully people like

1564
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:53,020
Colton or other you know patients can

1565
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:57,048
get different kinds of cures out of it

1566
01:08:53,020 --> 01:09:00,770
so about living soil is you have the

1567
01:08:57,048 --> 01:09:05,359
opportunity to control what things you

1568
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:07,549
are actually in your soil and by finding

1569
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,500
the inputs that you need on your

1570
01:09:07,548 --> 01:09:11,630
property

1571
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:14,659
it's the biology that works on your

1572
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:19,000
property and you buy by concentrating

1573
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:21,858
and enhancing it in your soil you start

1574
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,109
one not only increasing the quality of

1575
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:26,870
the material you're producing but you

1576
01:09:24,109 --> 01:09:29,359
decrease your costs you're not having to

1577
01:09:26,869 --> 01:09:32,180
go buy things and meantime every time

1578
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:36,009
you go and buy something you're trusting

1579
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:39,588
that what the bag or bag or box or

1580
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:41,509
whatever that packaging is is actually

1581
01:09:39,588 --> 01:09:43,369
what is in there what it says is

1582
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:45,920
actually what's in the bag and nothing

1583
01:09:43,369 --> 01:09:50,448
else is in that bag all of that's a

1584
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:51,920
trust that I don't know if especially if

1585
01:09:50,448 --> 01:09:53,988
you're making something you know if

1586
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,239
you're growing your own or doing for

1587
01:09:53,988 --> 01:09:58,218
commercial production

1588
01:09:55,238 --> 01:10:00,468
if you want the highest quality you need

1589
01:09:58,219 --> 01:10:02,569
to know what's in the soil because it's

1590
01:10:00,469 --> 01:10:04,670
a bio accumulator it'll pull out

1591
01:10:02,569 --> 01:10:08,469
whatever it needs and wants in the soil

1592
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:11,529
I'm not I love the idea of

1593
01:10:08,469 --> 01:10:15,859
live soil and water

1594
01:10:11,529 --> 01:10:17,229
it just really it's it's what it's what

1595
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:18,969
nature does

1596
01:10:17,229 --> 01:10:23,718
and

1597
01:10:18,969 --> 01:10:25,939
and what's true is most soils are not

1598
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:27,380
live anymore they've been killed off

1599
01:10:25,939 --> 01:10:31,269
with too many different things

1600
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:31,270
everything from glyphosate to

1601
01:10:32,409 --> 01:10:37,219
yeah

1602
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:40,670
it just seems really important to

1603
01:10:37,219 --> 01:10:42,859
recognize that especially for anyone

1604
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:46,069
that's going to work with cannabis by

1605
01:10:42,859 --> 01:10:49,369
reducing your costs and increasing your

1606
01:10:46,069 --> 01:10:52,039
quality regenerative practices and

1607
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:54,019
living soil is the way to go you're

1608
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:57,079
going to get the best medicine at the

1609
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:59,420
best result and meantime it's a form of

1610
01:10:57,079 --> 01:11:01,609
environmental stewardship because the

1611
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:03,920
soil is the foundation of everything it

1612
01:11:01,609 --> 01:11:06,829
goes on when we are killing off our

1613
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:11,000
soils all over the world we're killing

1614
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:12,618
off our opportunity to survive in the in

1615
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,060
the cold climate thing that's going on

1616
01:11:12,618 --> 01:11:16,309
which is a whole conversation I don't

1617
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:18,469
even want to start but we all know

1618
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:20,869
what's happening there and yes

1619
01:11:18,469 --> 01:11:24,139
regenerative agriculture and practices

1620
01:11:20,868 --> 01:11:26,809
is a way of healing your own little

1621
01:11:24,139 --> 01:11:29,868
garden and then maybe your community and

1622
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:32,300
maybe someday our world mm-hmm no of

1623
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:34,729
course it's amazing it's you know when

1624
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:37,639
when Canadians accidentally discovered

1625
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:39,919
that heme removes radioactive

1626
01:11:37,639 --> 01:11:42,500
nucleotides out of the soil when Joe

1627
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:45,500
Strobel a tobacco farmer got the first

1628
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:47,448
hemp license in Canada and grew hid grew

1629
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:49,488
a crop and then of course because he's a

1630
01:11:47,448 --> 01:11:53,569
tobacco farmer he's actively spraying

1631
01:11:49,488 --> 01:11:55,669
radium-226 on his field and so they have

1632
01:11:53,569 --> 01:11:57,828
to monitor the radioactivity levels of

1633
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:59,810
this of the soil and the soil was too

1634
01:11:57,828 --> 01:12:02,149
low after hemp and they were just like

1635
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:04,130
what the heck and tested the hemp and

1636
01:12:02,149 --> 01:12:06,649
we're kind of like oh geez this has

1637
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:08,810
actually been pulled into this plant

1638
01:12:06,649 --> 01:12:11,029
over here that's how that's how the

1639
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:12,800
Chernobyl hemp growing project got

1640
01:12:11,029 --> 01:12:14,539
started but you know I like the way

1641
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,730
Wayde put that you know you know it's a

1642
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:18,289
good it's a good thing you see someone

1643
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:20,178
was telling me yesterday in Kentucky all

1644
01:12:18,289 --> 01:12:22,189
these tobacco plots want to grow

1645
01:12:20,179 --> 01:12:24,770
cannabis now and I'm like well they're

1646
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:28,428
gonna be growing like many many seasons

1647
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:32,090
of just remediate of crops because the

1648
01:12:28,429 --> 01:12:34,368
soils in those tobacco regions are so

1649
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:37,489
beyond contaminated with like really

1650
01:12:34,368 --> 01:12:39,019
really like forget about David and

1651
01:12:37,488 --> 01:12:40,578
Michael butanol and these guys are

1652
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:43,159
taking it to a whole other level where

1653
01:12:40,578 --> 01:12:44,509
you have to wear full hazmat suits to to

1654
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:47,299
spray that [ __ ] on the plants it's

1655
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:50,360
frightening marcus do they um

1656
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:52,579
take that material and combust it or

1657
01:12:50,359 --> 01:12:54,828
incinerate it or do they put it back

1658
01:12:52,578 --> 01:12:58,099
into the soil and remediate it through

1659
01:12:54,828 --> 01:13:00,319
time no no definitely back in the day

1660
01:12:58,099 --> 01:13:03,110
originally there was two methods there

1661
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:05,328
was the archaic burning and classifying

1662
01:13:03,109 --> 01:13:07,328
of the ash and then there was the

1663
01:13:05,328 --> 01:13:09,799
Russian Elektron

1664
01:13:07,328 --> 01:13:13,988
scientist who was using electron

1665
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:18,789
clusters to manipulate and basically

1666
01:13:13,988 --> 01:13:18,789
take apart radioactive molecules

1667
01:13:19,699 --> 01:13:25,929
they Reax tracked it that's valuable huh

1668
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:30,230
I think that that would have to be

1669
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:32,089
Neutron right if you're doing radio

1670
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:34,459
chemistry you're dealing with neutrons

1671
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:38,960
you're not doing necessarily with

1672
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:40,819
electrons I'm not a radio chemist yeah

1673
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,270
the hemp that they grew in Chernobyl

1674
01:13:40,819 --> 01:13:47,119
they just made it in a hempcrete just to

1675
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:50,120
encase it but if they did save some of

1676
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:51,979
it and look at it was sure a fair amount

1677
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:54,199
of it found its way in the Eastern

1678
01:13:51,979 --> 01:13:56,359
Europe so was the company that did that

1679
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:59,619
I don't know if you knew that but that

1680
01:13:56,359 --> 01:13:59,619
was our our company did that

1681
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:07,940
all right I was gonna say I wouldn't be

1682
01:14:05,029 --> 01:14:10,489
surprised if any of that hemp was

1683
01:14:07,939 --> 01:14:13,099
actually used somewhere in Eastern

1684
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:15,800
Europe for CBD oil production yeah it's

1685
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:17,560
sold at gas stations in Florida now for

1686
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,810
in pens

1687
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:22,970
it's really all he bucks a pen happy B

1688
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:25,010
forget Florida even in cannabis on

1689
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:25,720
friendly states like Illinois and

1690
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:29,600
Indiana

1691
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:31,869
yeah you could the truck stop two bucks

1692
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,870
the pen

1693
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:43,550
it was very interesting Wow yeah so the

1694
01:14:41,779 --> 01:14:45,529
state trooper that pulls you over and

1695
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:48,940
bust you for cannabis is all jacked up

1696
01:14:45,529 --> 01:14:50,908
on CBD from the gas station

1697
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:53,379
I'll take that

1698
01:14:50,908 --> 01:14:55,210
radioactive CBD though wolf I don't know

1699
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:57,760
they don't know what to do with it it's

1700
01:14:55,210 --> 01:15:00,609
uh it's kinda humorous like I have a

1701
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:02,860
hemp license an ax and a th cannabis you

1702
01:15:00,609 --> 01:15:05,219
know recreational license and my

1703
01:15:02,859 --> 01:15:07,389
neighbor finally complained and my

1704
01:15:05,219 --> 01:15:10,329
enforcement officer for the RAC came not

1705
01:15:07,389 --> 01:15:12,310
to visit and he's like hey man how do

1706
01:15:10,329 --> 01:15:13,988
you tell the difference I was like you

1707
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:17,110
don't do it until you test them you know

1708
01:15:13,988 --> 01:15:19,448
and brew that true that it's the same

1709
01:15:17,109 --> 01:15:20,889
plant oh yeah I mean that's what I you

1710
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:22,059
know I'm ten explaining it to him and

1711
01:15:20,889 --> 01:15:23,529
he's just like going well how do we

1712
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,789
regulate this when someone's driving

1713
01:15:23,529 --> 01:15:27,969
down the road and they got a bag full of

1714
01:15:24,789 --> 01:15:30,340
CBD buds you know and I'm like you don't

1715
01:15:27,969 --> 01:15:31,630
do it it's a plant like we're the way

1716
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:33,699
we're doing it now doesn't make any

1717
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:37,060
sense we got to go back to letting it be

1718
01:15:33,698 --> 01:15:39,669
a plant and and you know I actually am

1719
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:42,219
very in in some twisted way I'm very

1720
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:45,690
thankful to you know the AG companies

1721
01:15:42,219 --> 01:15:48,550
Monsanto and them for creating such

1722
01:15:45,689 --> 01:15:50,469
such freedoms it for it for farmers and

1723
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:51,969
in the may and you know the us we have a

1724
01:15:50,469 --> 01:15:53,529
lot of freedoms and so under the hemp

1725
01:15:51,969 --> 01:15:55,689
bill we don't have to do any of the

1726
01:15:53,529 --> 01:15:57,369
regulatory [ __ ] that I've had to do

1727
01:15:55,689 --> 01:16:01,738
on the on the REC side and it's it's

1728
01:15:57,369 --> 01:16:01,738
amazing you know and so are they

1729
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:15,819
worth noting Wade when you created the

1730
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:18,880
Harlequin that you were grounding your

1731
01:16:15,819 --> 01:16:22,349
pots at the time is that correct with

1732
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:27,219
copper wire into the grounds uh

1733
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:29,400
yes yes that's true I was growing

1734
01:16:27,219 --> 01:16:32,219
indoors in those days and

1735
01:16:29,399 --> 01:16:38,079
all of the plants were in

1736
01:16:32,219 --> 01:16:40,420
shallow ten gallon pots that and were

1737
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:43,149
bone side and whatnot I've done a lot of

1738
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:46,359
work on making sure the water and the

1739
01:16:43,149 --> 01:16:49,349
soil they were in and the what nutrients

1740
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:52,000
I was given them were things I liked and

1741
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:55,030
had the best lighting I could find on

1742
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:58,649
and on and on but in sitting with them

1743
01:16:55,029 --> 01:17:02,569
one evening asking them why they were

1744
01:16:58,649 --> 01:17:05,599
not I could tell it wasn't there they

1745
01:17:02,569 --> 01:17:08,269
weren't totally happy and they and what

1746
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:10,130
I heard was they were lonely and I had

1747
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:12,980
to think about what that meant and and

1748
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:17,000
so I realized that plants evolved in the

1749
01:17:12,979 --> 01:17:19,909
ground and so I had a copper water pipe

1750
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,710
in the room that I had installed and

1751
01:17:19,909 --> 01:17:27,079
knew it was good to ground and so I

1752
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:30,859
hooked up some row max10 three so four

1753
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:32,689
connectors put them into a grounding bar

1754
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:35,449
that I strapped to the copper pipe and

1755
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:38,149
then put the other into the romex into

1756
01:17:35,449 --> 01:17:40,189
four of the first seven plants that

1757
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:42,699
became Harlequin it's part of how

1758
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:45,699
Harlequin got the name it has

1759
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:48,800
because the four plants that got ground

1760
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:50,750
were identical to three other plants

1761
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,170
that didn't get ground that had the

1762
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:56,779
identical environmental conditions and

1763
01:17:53,170 --> 01:18:00,020
the four that had ground not only grew

1764
01:17:56,779 --> 01:18:02,389
much quicker had bigger leaves there

1765
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:06,500
flowers two weeks into flowering were

1766
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:09,050
fifty percent larger and at eight weeks

1767
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:12,979
into flowering the plants that had

1768
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:18,560
ground had four or five different colors

1769
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:21,289
vegetation red purple orange a little

1770
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,990
bit of green a little bit of yellow but

1771
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:27,920
just they were fluorescent coloration in

1772
01:18:23,989 --> 01:18:32,109
this whole room of green plants and I

1773
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:34,609
realized that yeah plants need ground so

1774
01:18:32,109 --> 01:18:37,339
after that I got busy running a bunch of

1775
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:40,219
wires that were not connected to any

1776
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:42,640
form of electricity other than the six

1777
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:46,190
to seven cycles a second that the earth

1778
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,950
actually produces that we call ground

1779
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:51,949
and

1780
01:18:47,949 --> 01:18:54,139
and now working outdoors where I can put

1781
01:18:51,949 --> 01:18:55,639
plants in the ground you don't have to

1782
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:58,789
do wires you don't have to do anything

1783
01:18:55,640 --> 01:19:00,980
and I really think it's a huge part of

1784
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:04,819
the living soil thing when everything

1785
01:19:00,979 --> 01:19:06,799
else is right in your indoor room if you

1786
01:19:04,819 --> 01:19:10,340
haven't provided them a connection to

1787
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:12,260
the earth give them earth do it a few at

1788
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:14,630
a time just to check out to see how it

1789
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:17,090
works I think you'll be amazed at the

1790
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:19,579
difference in the sults you see the

1791
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:21,970
plants love being in connection with the

1792
01:19:19,579 --> 01:19:24,890
mother if you will

1793
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:28,039
you know neasha well I was just gonna

1794
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:30,530
say that actually visited being here

1795
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:33,260
with Josh and Kelly this is the first

1796
01:19:30,529 --> 01:19:36,649
time that I have actually toured an

1797
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:39,860
outdoor grow and I have to tell you that

1798
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:43,069
what they're doing is so phenomenal and

1799
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:47,329
relieved when Ethan and I drove up it

1800
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:51,170
was immediately obvious that this place

1801
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:53,750
was so is so alive and producing

1802
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:56,659
extraordinary medicine I think it makes

1803
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:58,670
a tremendous difference not only for all

1804
01:19:56,659 --> 01:20:01,189
of us but most especially for those who

1805
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:02,949
are trying to restore their bodies with

1806
01:20:01,189 --> 01:20:06,229
cannabis and

1807
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:08,720
you know I would say for anybody that is

1808
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:11,659
out there thinking about growing

1809
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:13,340
cannabis please look at what Josh and

1810
01:20:11,659 --> 01:20:15,590
Kelly and all the other regenerative

1811
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:18,050
farmers are doing because you know the

1812
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:20,539
the soil I would argue is really our

1813
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:22,430
greatest resource some people would

1814
01:20:20,539 --> 01:20:24,229
argue the point that water is but I

1815
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:26,600
think that the soil is far more

1816
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:28,369
important because if you don't have

1817
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:31,490
living soil you can't use your water

1818
01:20:28,369 --> 01:20:33,800
properly and then you can lose nutrients

1819
01:20:31,489 --> 01:20:37,219
that go into the rivers and they can

1820
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:39,500
contaminate waterways and you work with

1821
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:41,650
you you know land Trust's and different

1822
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:43,699
things in the world and so that's

1823
01:20:41,649 --> 01:20:46,069
something you're really interested in

1824
01:20:43,699 --> 01:20:49,809
right yeah it's been 10 years working in

1825
01:20:46,069 --> 01:20:52,840
the land trust community in Texas and

1826
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:55,940
you know with without

1827
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:57,800
well-managed soil even no matter what

1828
01:20:55,939 --> 01:21:01,939
we're talking about whether it's growing

1829
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:06,039
medicine or food or just open pasture

1830
01:21:01,939 --> 01:21:10,579
the land should have the capacity to

1831
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:13,039
capture and clean our water supply just

1832
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:16,430
for cannabis users and growers but for

1833
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:20,269
everyone and so healthy having healthy

1834
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:22,280
soil is really kind of a gift to the

1835
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:24,650
world that we can all participate in and

1836
01:21:22,279 --> 01:21:29,179
I think that it's interesting too if you

1837
01:21:24,649 --> 01:21:32,619
really look at what the main number one

1838
01:21:29,179 --> 01:21:37,369
of nature it's making soil that's

1839
01:21:32,619 --> 01:21:38,349
nature's number one job yeah and and

1840
01:21:37,369 --> 01:21:41,559
without

1841
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:45,530
healthy soil we don't have clean water

1842
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:47,300
in to drink mm-hmm and then with without

1843
01:21:45,529 --> 01:21:49,309
the healthy soil we don't have the

1844
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:52,730
healthy microbiology that comes from the

1845
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:55,909
soil to help boost our own microbiome

1846
01:21:52,729 --> 01:21:58,158
yep I would just add a last minute

1847
01:21:55,908 --> 01:22:01,908
statement to that which is hemp farming

1848
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:04,399
is a really big deal right now and it's

1849
01:22:01,908 --> 01:22:07,250
alarming to me and it looks to me like

1850
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:10,460
an environmental disaster is happening

1851
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:14,539
with all of the plastic mulch please

1852
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:18,020
stop using plastic mulch it's not okay

1853
01:22:14,539 --> 01:22:22,579
it's not biodegradable and I don't know

1854
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:24,260
of a 100% plant-based plastic and and

1855
01:22:22,579 --> 01:22:27,890
even if there was a hundred percent

1856
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:32,650
plant-based plastic I still wouldn't use

1857
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:36,170
it because hey and and cover cropping is

1858
01:22:32,649 --> 01:22:38,089
essential to a regenerative hemp farm if

1859
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:40,880
you have the ability to grow a cover

1860
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:44,029
crop over the winter that's chest-high

1861
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:47,359
and then you till in that whole thing

1862
01:22:44,029 --> 01:22:50,179
along with another batch of cover crop

1863
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:53,210
and then mound that up you're having all

1864
01:22:50,179 --> 01:22:56,090
this microbiology being created with the

1865
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:58,760
cover crop and then you layer in huge

1866
01:22:56,090 --> 01:23:00,679
amounts of hay and don't tell me it's

1867
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:03,829
too much work because it's what you have

1868
01:23:00,679 --> 01:23:06,859
to do so maybe don't do twenty acres do

1869
01:23:03,829 --> 01:23:09,679
five and do it right and go get your

1870
01:23:06,859 --> 01:23:14,119
uncle Ted and all the other guys to go

1871
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:17,690
through five acres to and just do it

1872
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:20,929
right so they you're building your soil

1873
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:23,899
over the course of the year and you're

1874
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:25,550
creating it so I said aphids because

1875
01:23:23,899 --> 01:23:28,849
they're around and you can't control

1876
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:30,860
aphids very well and people are realized

1877
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:33,400
in that everywhere right now so

1878
01:23:30,859 --> 01:23:35,809
pollinators can take care of very well

1879
01:23:33,399 --> 01:23:37,729
wasps and different things so creating

1880
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:39,679
habitat within your pharmacist seneschal

1881
01:23:37,729 --> 01:23:42,079
and living soils living soil

1882
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:44,270
regenerative hem farms plastic mulch

1883
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:47,569
environmental disaster you heard it here

1884
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:49,550
for the first time on hash Church you

1885
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:51,439
just do it right the title of the

1886
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:53,810
forthcoming book on living soil from

1887
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:55,429
dragonfly earth medicine we're not

1888
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:57,560
impressed with all your acreage we're

1889
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:59,470
impressed with the quality of what you

1890
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:02,300
come out with

1891
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:04,100
amen to that as honestly I'm constantly

1892
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:06,140
having conversations with people all

1893
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:07,820
over the world and they're like yeah

1894
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:10,670
we're we're looking at ten thousand

1895
01:24:07,819 --> 01:24:14,059
acres in Manitoba we're doing 7700

1896
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:15,230
hectares in in Columbia and I'm like I'm

1897
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:17,390
like do you understand how much biomass

1898
01:24:15,229 --> 01:24:18,919
can be growing on an acre like with

1899
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:20,480
cannabis you know like if you ship the

1900
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,770
bed a couple thousand pounds but if you

1901
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:24,079
do pretty good you're gonna probably get

1902
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:26,690
four thousand pounds off an acre I mean

1903
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:28,430
seven thousand hectares I did the math

1904
01:24:26,689 --> 01:24:30,199
for this guy without even multiplying

1905
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:32,930
his field by four because he's easily

1906
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:35,210
gonna get four crops and a yield and in

1907
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:37,340
a year in columbia but just with one

1908
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:40,670
year on this guy seventy seven hundred

1909
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:43,010
hectares it ended up being like sixty

1910
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:45,230
million pounds of biomass and if he was

1911
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:47,750
able to extract a hundred thousand

1912
01:24:45,229 --> 01:24:49,759
pounds of that biomass a day which let's

1913
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:52,100
be honest very few ER anywhere near that

1914
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:56,840
it was gonna take him nine point seven

1915
01:24:52,100 --> 01:25:00,500
years to extract his first crop if he

1916
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:03,020
only grew one crop so I know like I

1917
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:04,850
thought in Switzerland in 2000 2001

1918
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:08,330
everyone got greedy they start planting

1919
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:10,190
big acreages and all the herb rotted in

1920
01:25:08,329 --> 01:25:12,109
barns there's nowhere that they didn't

1921
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:15,169
understand the SOPs of cutting that much

1922
01:25:12,109 --> 01:25:17,839
cannabis down and curing it and you know

1923
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:20,659
having a space to properly dry it in and

1924
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:23,319
know anything enough to field just hang

1925
01:25:20,659 --> 01:25:23,319
it off the field

1926
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:29,450
yeah I saw that in Kentucky in two

1927
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:32,360
thousand nine and ten where I went out

1928
01:25:29,449 --> 01:25:33,859
to to a massive I mean six hundred acres

1929
01:25:32,359 --> 01:25:36,739
and for two thousand nine ten in the

1930
01:25:33,859 --> 01:25:37,880
United States owes a lot and I'd you

1931
01:25:36,739 --> 01:25:40,279
know they were just like how do we get

1932
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:43,130
this off the field and you know we had

1933
01:25:40,279 --> 01:25:44,449
to we I had to design this this crazy

1934
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:46,159
system for him and it was really

1935
01:25:44,449 --> 01:25:48,889
interesting and now fast forward today

1936
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:51,170
there's I'm a part of the small farmers

1937
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:53,660
Network in in New York State and it's

1938
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:55,850
all organic and we're we're we're

1939
01:25:53,659 --> 01:25:58,309
forging and finding everything on the

1940
01:25:55,850 --> 01:26:00,440
land to the crops and it's just a

1941
01:25:58,310 --> 01:26:04,310
completely different way of doing things

1942
01:26:00,439 --> 01:26:06,769
and it's it's sustainable it's it's a

1943
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:08,690
it's a much nicer way to be entire

1944
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:11,060
shopping and bucking right on the field

1945
01:26:08,689 --> 01:26:12,789
like you're out in the field shucking

1946
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:15,650
and bucking yeah yeah

1947
01:26:12,789 --> 01:26:19,069
that's what the Amish are doing here in

1948
01:26:15,649 --> 01:26:20,619
Pennsylvania that's very manual I can't

1949
01:26:19,069 --> 01:26:24,769
wait to see it

1950
01:26:20,619 --> 01:26:26,630
happen in just a few weeks here all the

1951
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:27,730
Amish farms around us or growing have

1952
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:31,279
and

1953
01:26:27,729 --> 01:26:33,859
it's just it's it's great if you ask me

1954
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:36,920
I don't know I mean you were mentioning

1955
01:26:33,859 --> 01:26:39,799
the use of plastic mulch I know the

1956
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:41,960
Amish don't use any mulch at all they do

1957
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:44,090
cover crops and they do certainly rotate

1958
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:45,980
their fields but I don't think there's

1959
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:47,600
use of plastic mulch at all and I

1960
01:26:45,979 --> 01:26:52,479
believe it's all certified as organic

1961
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:55,789
too so I can't wait to watch the Amish

1962
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:57,559
do their hemp harvesters sure definitely

1963
01:26:55,789 --> 01:27:02,380
the exception I think he's talking about

1964
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:02,380
like everyone else yeah

1965
01:27:04,539 --> 01:27:09,949
strawberries but nobody grows among

1966
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,770
straw they all grow them underneath

1967
01:27:09,949 --> 01:27:13,630
black mulch

1968
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:16,630
plastic mulch

1969
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:19,520
and they taste like wood

1970
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:22,250
well it depends I mean you can get that

1971
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:25,480
strawberries grown that way but in

1972
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:29,270
general I lead towards your direction

1973
01:27:25,479 --> 01:27:31,729
well one of all marks of the Amish is

1974
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:34,730
that they do peacefully coexist in

1975
01:27:31,729 --> 01:27:37,369
today's a Greek ultra production and do

1976
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:39,579
have a significant agricultural output

1977
01:27:37,369 --> 01:27:41,930
at least in this area of Pennsylvania

1978
01:27:39,579 --> 01:27:45,350
and certainly in other areas of the

1979
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:46,489
country so be that as it may yeah

1980
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:48,890
they're different and they have

1981
01:27:46,488 --> 01:27:51,289
different farming methods they're here

1982
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:53,030
and they're producing and I think

1983
01:27:51,289 --> 01:27:55,369
they're gonna have a profound impact on

1984
01:27:53,029 --> 01:27:57,439
the hemp supply at least this season

1985
01:27:55,369 --> 01:28:01,279
that we hadn't seen in previous seasons

1986
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:04,189
to your point they're very advanced in

1987
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:05,479
farming I grew up around Amish and I've

1988
01:28:04,189 --> 01:28:08,149
learned quite a lot as a young guy

1989
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:11,250
working on Armus farms being around it

1990
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:12,629
and their varying too and they have a

1991
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:14,850
much different head on their shoulders

1992
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:17,609
in terms of how to accomplish something

1993
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:18,920
in terms of tasks orientations it's very

1994
01:28:17,609 --> 01:28:22,109
interesting

1995
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:24,750
you know we could look at the scaling of

1996
01:28:22,109 --> 01:28:27,389
Amish and the reason why it is so

1997
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:29,699
successful in the way that the Amish are

1998
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:33,329
doing agriculture is because it's many

1999
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:35,970
families per large acreage it's not one

2000
01:28:33,329 --> 01:28:39,149
company that's running in 70,000 acres

2001
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:41,789
you know a lot of people ask us can you

2002
01:28:39,149 --> 01:28:43,649
successfully scalp Annabeth's can you

2003
01:28:41,789 --> 01:28:46,380
successfully scale cannabis and my

2004
01:28:43,649 --> 01:28:49,589
question back to them is showing a big

2005
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:52,619
scaling in big AG that's actually

2006
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:55,260
successful because my you know my

2007
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:57,840
feelings is is that the big scaling and

2008
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:59,850
big AG is not successful but the way

2009
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,039
that we can successfully scale in

2010
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:04,740
cannabis is taking large acreage and

2011
01:29:02,039 --> 01:29:06,750
having many families or many growers or

2012
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:09,420
you know many farmers take over that

2013
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:11,750
a-and that's the way to successfully

2014
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,750
scale

2015
01:29:13,970 --> 01:29:20,190
we have five acres not of straight

2016
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:22,470
cannabis but five acres that we take

2017
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:26,819
care of them probably about three acres

2018
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:29,280
of it is crops and the reason because

2019
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:31,409
we're still under medical license here

2020
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:35,069
in Canada Canada trying to enter into

2021
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:37,260
the CTLs and we have plant numbers so

2022
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:39,239
that's really the reason why we we have

2023
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:41,550
five acres that could be cultivated but

2024
01:29:39,239 --> 01:29:44,760
we're not utilizing the whole amount so

2025
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:47,579
how many plants does that is that the

2026
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:49,310
plant license know how many plants do

2027
01:29:47,579 --> 01:29:52,529
you grow

2028
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:55,140
it's changes every year because it's you

2029
01:29:52,529 --> 01:29:58,109
know depending on what medical license

2030
01:29:55,140 --> 01:30:01,079
we have it at the time or whatnot so

2031
01:29:58,109 --> 01:30:03,449
yeah it's really we just like to stay

2032
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:07,220
underneath any numbers that are licensed

2033
01:30:03,449 --> 01:30:07,220
to us so right now we're

2034
01:30:12,649 --> 01:30:18,149
definitely not no it's no we're looking

2035
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:20,430
at more like two two thousand and our

2036
01:30:18,149 --> 01:30:22,920
plant license is for fifteen hundred so

2037
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:23,800
by the time we call and we ruthlessly

2038
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:25,868
call

2039
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:28,809
because we are breeders so we go through

2040
01:30:25,868 --> 01:30:30,908
and do a ruthless call are not only

2041
01:30:28,809 --> 01:30:33,489
males but ones that you know maybe

2042
01:30:30,908 --> 01:30:37,589
aren't showing you know high immune

2043
01:30:33,488 --> 01:30:37,589
response I know we'll get

2044
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:44,380
well so we start our seeds on April 20th

2045
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:48,699
around there and then we'll do another

2046
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:51,279
wave maybe a month later of seeds and I

2047
01:30:48,698 --> 01:30:55,058
mean it's definitely a variation but I'd

2048
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:58,479
say about 8 feet to 10 feet tall well

2049
01:30:55,059 --> 01:31:01,559
yeah yeah 8 to 12 right now our family

2050
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:04,988
are Himachal Pradesh plants that we have

2051
01:31:01,559 --> 01:31:07,750
that were not light tapping are probably

2052
01:31:04,988 --> 01:31:09,039
about 13 14 feet up and also we start

2053
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:10,750
our seeds then and then they grow

2054
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:13,179
naturally and we aren't worried don't

2055
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:15,960
use any trellising or anything so the

2056
01:31:13,179 --> 01:31:18,960
plants are naturally just being able to

2057
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,960
support

2058
01:31:22,529 --> 01:31:27,750
almost 50 years and

2059
01:31:25,948 --> 01:31:31,388
but I think

2060
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:35,939
one of the biggest differences you see

2061
01:31:31,389 --> 01:31:40,449
is the amount of roots I mean you've got

2062
01:31:35,939 --> 01:31:43,598
fuzz over everything and roots on roots

2063
01:31:40,448 --> 01:31:46,000
on roots on roots you know from the big

2064
01:31:43,599 --> 01:31:49,510
ones to the little tiny ones and when

2065
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,460
you pull the root out it it takes a

2066
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:54,400
massive

2067
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:55,948
with it it's really really plugged into

2068
01:31:54,399 --> 01:32:00,129
here

2069
01:31:55,948 --> 01:32:02,859
that's clones from seeds they are even a

2070
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:05,760
bit more of a tap root with seeds but

2071
01:32:02,859 --> 01:32:05,759
clones

2072
01:32:07,139 --> 01:32:12,429
you know one of the coolest things I

2073
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:15,189
ever did in our first Hempfield in 1995

2074
01:32:12,429 --> 01:32:17,828
is I we were collecting a few of the

2075
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:19,868
plants they were tall I pulled it out

2076
01:32:17,828 --> 01:32:21,250
just the plant it pulled out pretty easy

2077
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:23,859
it was just a hemp plant but it had a

2078
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:25,779
nice long tap root on it and we ended up

2079
01:32:23,859 --> 01:32:27,399
pulling out like five or six of them and

2080
01:32:25,779 --> 01:32:30,670
when they were laying on this like

2081
01:32:27,399 --> 01:32:33,339
trailer I was looking at the roots and

2082
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:35,139
on a couple of them the root it went

2083
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:37,659
down it was twisty and then right at the

2084
01:32:35,139 --> 01:32:41,170
bottom of the root was the the Hass of

2085
01:32:37,659 --> 01:32:43,329
the the seed shell like you could see

2086
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:46,810
the the whole plant coming out of it I'd

2087
01:32:43,329 --> 01:32:49,600
never seen that in my life prior to 1995

2088
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:51,310
in all the plants that I had grown I had

2089
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,870
never seen anything like that we start

2090
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:54,700
we pulled up a few more and was like it

2091
01:32:52,869 --> 01:32:56,800
was fairly common we were like that's

2092
01:32:54,699 --> 01:32:59,139
incredible oh I'd love to let Ethan

2093
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,909
maybe tell us some you know a brief

2094
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:03,460
thing on how to use the roots because

2095
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:05,769
it's an often-overlooked medicine and

2096
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:07,300
beef just really quickly be flora one of

2097
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:09,460
the coolest things I've seen with roots

2098
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:11,890
is putting a crystal right underneath

2099
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:13,600
the seed and then the whole entire plant

2100
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:16,060
grows around the crystal and at the end

2101
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,640
of the year you can pull the plant up

2102
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:20,020
and it's like a staff and and all the

2103
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:22,060
roots have grown around the crystal and

2104
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:23,350
it's really beautiful and we had a

2105
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:25,210
friend do that but what are some of the

2106
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:27,850
properties in cannabis roots how do we

2107
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:29,649
use that sure so I became interested in

2108
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:32,670
this because a lot of the old literature

2109
01:33:29,649 --> 01:33:37,539
referred to medical use of the roots and

2110
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:39,720
typically the indications were to treat

2111
01:33:37,539 --> 01:33:43,119
inflammation

2112
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:46,860
things like granulomas fibrous tissues

2113
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:50,199
and also for cancer interestingly the

2114
01:33:46,859 --> 01:33:52,750
chemical makeup of the roots is totally

2115
01:33:50,199 --> 01:33:55,210
different than what's in the tops and

2116
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:56,489
although oftentimes their use for the

2117
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:59,949
same things

2118
01:33:56,489 --> 01:34:02,559
so in the tops as everybody knows we

2119
01:33:59,949 --> 01:34:04,229
have cannabinoids and terpenoids in the

2120
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,610
roots in

2121
01:34:04,229 --> 01:34:10,829
contrast what we've got hurt Reiter

2122
01:34:06,609 --> 01:34:15,789
pinoys which actually the most abundant

2123
01:34:10,829 --> 01:34:19,000
biochemical chemicals in plants and they

2124
01:34:15,789 --> 01:34:24,420
are well known for having a protective

2125
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:25,960
effect on plant growth and for us again

2126
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:29,680
anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer

2127
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:31,869
properties and there are also alkaloids

2128
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:35,770
in the roots which you don't find in the

2129
01:34:31,869 --> 01:34:36,899
tops at all so how you use them a lot of

2130
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:40,270
people are

2131
01:34:36,899 --> 01:34:43,599
incorporating these into dermatological

2132
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:46,300
preparations so very helpful for skin

2133
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:49,240
conditions and some people are cooking

2134
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:50,610
them and in eating the roots we really

2135
01:34:49,239 --> 01:34:54,170
know less

2136
01:34:50,609 --> 01:34:57,420
about what the effects are there but

2137
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:58,970
I'll just finish by saying I was really

2138
01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:01,680
surprised

2139
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:04,890
some months ago I was in Santiago Chile

2140
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:06,720
and a guy was selling cannabis products

2141
01:35:04,890 --> 01:35:10,680
on the street and one of them was the

2142
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:13,800
tincture of cannabis roots so the dis

2143
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:16,100
nah llege is spreading Natacha risen I

2144
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:20,909
have an article that's I believe

2145
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:23,550
available online on cannabis roots it's

2146
01:35:20,909 --> 01:35:25,559
also available on DM peer farms comm

2147
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:28,550
site we posted it on Reiter when you

2148
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:31,740
sent it to us huh yeah

2149
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:34,230
yeah so that's that's really super

2150
01:35:31,739 --> 01:35:36,539
interesting yeah I heard about this

2151
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:39,089
before from the roots and triterpene no

2152
01:35:36,539 --> 01:35:41,189
it's not a whole lot but it always made

2153
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:42,750
me realize that you knowed it wouldn't

2154
01:35:41,189 --> 01:35:44,909
surprise me if cannabis had some

2155
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:47,210
powerful root systems particularly went

2156
01:35:44,909 --> 01:35:51,180
back in the day when we learned about

2157
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:54,210
producing ayahuasca using like a like a

2158
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:56,460
plant containing tryptamine and then to

2159
01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:58,020
try and find plants that had the harming

2160
01:35:56,460 --> 01:36:00,720
and the harm alene that would sort of

2161
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:02,460
potentiate those those tryptamines and

2162
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:04,050
we learned about Syrian room which was

2163
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:06,510
sold at like Middle Eastern grocery

2164
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:08,640
stores in North Vancouver and stuff you

2165
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:10,409
could get this the seed that you could

2166
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:12,150
consume with mushrooms and it was sort

2167
01:36:10,409 --> 01:36:14,340
of like an ayahuasca but then we

2168
01:36:12,149 --> 01:36:16,469
actually got like the rule of Rudess for

2169
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:18,110
the leaf from the DMT and then we got

2170
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:21,960
banisteriopsis caapi

2171
01:36:18,109 --> 01:36:23,489
root bark and for years my friend and my

2172
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:27,029
friends and I had access to this root

2173
01:36:23,489 --> 01:36:29,579
bark and I remember when we first met a

2174
01:36:27,029 --> 01:36:31,979
card there of shaman from Peru from

2175
01:36:29,579 --> 01:36:33,809
Iquitos he came up he was also a medical

2176
01:36:31,979 --> 01:36:38,339
doctor brilliant man by the name of Jose

2177
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:40,410
and he was tripping out that we had

2178
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:43,079
access to the root bark he was like whoa

2179
01:36:40,409 --> 01:36:46,710
like the first 20 times you only use

2180
01:36:43,079 --> 01:36:48,359
like the smallest leaves and you said he

2181
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:51,000
said there was sort of a buildup and

2182
01:36:48,359 --> 01:36:53,099
only that the hardcore shamans were

2183
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,720
doing the the root bark with their

2184
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:57,030
preparations he was actually kind of

2185
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:58,829
like he was blown away and then actually

2186
01:36:57,029 --> 01:37:01,050
kind of pissed off about it too he was

2187
01:36:58,829 --> 01:37:03,640
like you guys shouldn't be shouldn't be

2188
01:37:01,050 --> 01:37:08,239
doing that like should be using a

2189
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:09,250
lesser and and to his you know effect it

2190
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:11,689
was

2191
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:14,060
extremely powerful everyone that had

2192
01:37:11,689 --> 01:37:17,000
those concoctions were just like that is

2193
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:19,520
something else in make you know root

2194
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,829
tonics are really popular you know

2195
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:24,350
fermented root tonic sir all over the

2196
01:37:21,829 --> 01:37:26,269
island and every Rasta makes a different

2197
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:28,070
you know not everybody you know just to

2198
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:30,110
say a lot of them make a lot of really

2199
01:37:28,069 --> 01:37:33,049
great root tonics and cannabis roots are

2200
01:37:30,109 --> 01:37:36,429
often a part of that and an herbal

2201
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:39,610
Chinese herbal medicine traditional TCM

2202
01:37:36,430 --> 01:37:43,400
decoctions are made out of

2203
01:37:39,609 --> 01:37:44,960
roots alcohol decoction so like t-shirts

2204
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:46,899
and stuff so I think you get different

2205
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:50,329
properties out of

2206
01:37:46,899 --> 01:37:52,159
tincture extractions from roost and you

2207
01:37:50,329 --> 01:37:55,399
would get out and say a liquid

2208
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:56,659
extraction or an oil extraction so it's

2209
01:37:55,399 --> 01:37:58,369
nice to learn some of those different

2210
01:37:56,659 --> 01:38:02,210
compounds and what know what your target

2211
01:37:58,369 --> 01:38:04,010
is yeah for sure got a welcome Alex

2212

Rogers into the room I just popped in

2213
01:38:04,010 --> 01:38:08,750
you kind of tripped me out because from

2214
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:12,800
the corner of my eye you reminded me of

2215

waiting for other people to use it I'm

2299
01:41:41,059 --> 01:41:45,650
like it's been a year since I since

2300
01:41:43,609 --> 01:41:48,439
since that title has been in existence

2301
01:41:45,649 --> 01:41:50,808
and now I'm like I've seen like TV news

2302
01:41:48,439 --> 01:41:52,009
I saw chief ganja officer in Jamaica

2303
01:41:50,809 --> 01:41:54,519
which made me smile

2304
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:58,519
[Laughter]

2305
01:41:54,519 --> 01:42:00,889
Marcus what's that in Pinsky is that I

2306
01:41:58,519 --> 01:42:03,050
don't know I've never I've never maybe

2307
01:42:00,889 --> 01:42:05,380
maybe Pinsky is also a chief cannabinoid

2308
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:07,840
officer I thought school

2309
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:12,199
he surprised me in

2310
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:13,940
theory yeah no no I I don't know what I

2311
01:42:12,198 --> 01:42:15,888

2314
01:42:17,929 --> 01:42:22,969
difficult like that's basically what I'm

2315
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:25,248
looking forward to with since starting

2316
01:42:22,969 --> 01:42:26,538
embark it's been literally a year of

2317
01:42:25,248 --> 01:42:28,099
like jumping through hoops oh you

2318
01:42:26,538 --> 01:42:30,738
getting building permits and getting all

2319
01:42:28,099 --> 01:42:32,630
of this stuff lined up so that we can

2320
01:42:30,738 --> 01:42:34,279
literally just do what there's never

2321
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:36,139
been an industry like this where it's

2322
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:37,518
just like oh you want to do you want to

2323
01:42:36,139 --> 01:42:41,118
open up a business you want to do

2324
01:42:37,519 --> 01:42:43,219
something okay well here you go just

2325
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:45,198
like binders of like hoops to jump

2326
01:42:43,219 --> 01:42:47,420
through some of them are like flaming

2327
01:42:45,198 --> 01:42:49,069
some of them are spinning with like acid

2328
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:50,840
flying off of them every type of hoop

2329
01:42:49,069 --> 01:42:52,788
you need you could possibly [ __ ]

2330
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:54,650
imagine jumping through I'll tell you

2331
01:42:52,788 --> 01:42:56,050
one thing it does show that only the

2332
01:42:54,649 --> 01:42:58,759
most hardcore

2333
01:42:56,050 --> 01:43:01,190
are willing to push through with with

2334
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:03,829
with any of this because it is exactly I

2335
01:43:01,189 --> 01:43:06,558
will also say simultaneously it totally

2336
01:43:03,828 --> 01:43:08,808
beats them kicking our doors down and

2337
01:43:06,559 --> 01:43:10,429
arrest us in prison for 10 years at a

2338
01:43:08,809 --> 01:43:11,958
time shooting our dogs and breaking up

2339
01:43:10,429 --> 01:43:14,809
our families and taking our kids into

2340
01:43:11,958 --> 01:43:16,578
child Family Protective Services some

2341
01:43:14,809 --> 01:43:19,340
people have forgotten how shitty that

2342
01:43:16,578 --> 01:43:22,698
was everybody's forgotten bubble

2343
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:25,150
everyone that was I'm telling you I can

2344
01:43:22,698 --> 01:43:25,149
put up with

2345
01:43:25,868 --> 01:43:31,698
it is right now happening in Northern

2346
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:34,549
California it's happening in Mendocino I

2347
01:43:31,698 --> 01:43:36,888
just heard a horrible story of a farmers

2348
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:38,719
in Santa Cruz that they put an 8 year

2349
01:43:36,889 --> 01:43:41,300
old and a 9 year old on their belly with

2350
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:43,189
guns to their heads and they didn't just

2351
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:45,739
take down there cannabis they took down

2352
01:43:43,189 --> 01:43:48,289
you know all of their greenhouses they

2353
01:43:45,739 --> 01:43:50,599
went in and ransacked their house they

2354
01:43:48,289 --> 01:43:52,640
took personal items they even took their

2355
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:54,710
four-wheel drive machines that they had

2356
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:56,930
and they drove them out into the woods

2357
01:43:54,710 --> 01:44:00,020
and threw away the keys this is

2358
01:43:56,930 --> 01:44:02,750
happening this is last week Jesus Christ

2359
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:04,250
back it's a bigger problem that's not

2360
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:06,409
even having to do cannabis that's just

2361
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:08,989
the authoritarian federal government of

2362
01:44:06,409 --> 01:44:11,269
the United States and civil forfeiture

2363
01:44:08,989 --> 01:44:13,729
and all that all this added leeway there

2364
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:15,140
they they want to take it they can do

2365
01:44:13,729 --> 01:44:16,729
whatever they want to do they don't have

2366
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:19,700
to charge you and they can take all your

2367
01:44:16,729 --> 01:44:21,409
[ __ ] and that goes way beyond canvas man

2368
01:44:19,699 --> 01:44:24,529
that's just a straight-up civil liberty

2369
01:44:21,409 --> 01:44:26,420
issue and the feds coming in like that

2370
01:44:24,529 --> 01:44:29,210
it's always been a problem people know

2371
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:32,750
it's a problem and or you know those who

2372
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:34,210
know no but then the whole industry has

2373
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:39,260
kind of become

2374
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:40,970
anesthetized from from all that and and

2375
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:42,470
I think a lot most people on this call

2376
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:43,329
right now it's like we're kind of the

2377
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:46,070
roots

2378
01:44:43,329 --> 01:44:47,869
crew that's still reminding people that

2379
01:44:46,069 --> 01:44:49,699
ain't we're here for a reason you know

2380
01:44:47,869 --> 01:44:51,529
you see the big Canadian finance guys

2381
01:44:49,699 --> 01:44:54,319
come into the room and how they talk and

2382
01:44:51,529 --> 01:44:57,050
whatever and I'm not dissing any one

2383
01:44:54,319 --> 01:44:58,819
group of all I'm saying is that we this

2384
01:44:57,050 --> 01:45:00,980
[ __ ] was built on the blood sweat and

2385
01:44:58,819 --> 01:45:03,439
tears on the backs of lives being ruined

2386
01:45:00,979 --> 01:45:06,889
and so it's always a great topic to

2387
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:08,269
bring up and mention because because I

2388
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:09,829
think most people are tripping that's

2389
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:13,190
what we do in the ICBC that's the first

2390
01:45:09,829 --> 01:45:14,600
thing I said I said there's two [ __ ]

2391
01:45:13,189 --> 01:45:17,659
government's gonna [ __ ] everything up

2392
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:19,370
administer the regulators gonna mess

2393
01:45:17,659 --> 01:45:21,829
everything up and so what's really

2394
01:45:19,369 --> 01:45:23,359
important is that all criminal penalties

2395
01:45:21,829 --> 01:45:25,010
are ended towards cannabis and that

2396
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:28,159
everybody has the right to a home card

2397
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:30,530
right so everything else doesn't really

2398
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:33,050
matter you know as long as all come if

2399
01:45:30,529 --> 01:45:35,509
you go sell ten pounds the weeds not the

2400
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:36,860
crime it's the you don't play your tax I

2401
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:39,289
guess that's always going to be a crime

2402
01:45:36,859 --> 01:45:40,880
okay but that's a different crime people

2403
01:45:39,289 --> 01:45:42,560
could deal with that the weed all the

2404
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,940
criminal things I don't like jack hair

2405
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:45,950
you know he used to be like oh it's like

2406
01:45:43,939 --> 01:45:49,279
tomatoes and some people like Oh Jack

2407
01:45:45,949 --> 01:45:51,979
that's a little crazy you know but [ __ ]

2408
01:45:49,279 --> 01:45:54,199
no it's not but you know with so but

2409
01:45:51,979 --> 01:45:56,509
that's never gonna happen so what we can

2410
01:45:54,199 --> 01:45:58,279
do to mitigate that is just say oh let's

2411
01:45:56,510 --> 01:46:00,619
keep ending the criminal penalties you

2412
01:45:58,279 --> 01:46:02,420
know the battles just begun everyone's

2413
01:46:00,619 --> 01:46:05,420
gotta have their home guard you know

2414
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:07,810
around the world I don't know how much

2415
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:09,949
grow pretty good Tomatoes

2416
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:11,990
let those [ __ ] start growing

2417
01:46:09,949 --> 01:46:14,109
some weed and watch what happens you

2418
01:46:11,989 --> 01:46:14,109
know

2419
01:46:14,859 --> 01:46:21,099
oh

2420
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:21,100
yeah I've been doing it for decades man

2421
01:46:22,899 --> 01:46:28,729
masters of the game

2422
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:29,989
Wow yeah that's right someone just

2423
01:46:28,729 --> 01:46:32,449
pointed out this is the first church

2424
01:46:29,989 --> 01:46:36,679
with 12 people we were always limited to

2425
01:46:32,449 --> 01:46:38,569
10 people 9 invitees and myself with the

2426
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,619
Google platform but someone asked me the

2427
01:46:38,569 --> 01:46:40,969

2428

2430
01:46:44,479 --> 01:46:50,649
hundred people in this live chat with

2431
01:46:47,869 --> 01:46:54,099
cameras how ridiculous is that

2432
01:46:50,649 --> 01:46:56,389
harm reduction Club

01:46:58,130 --> 01:47:01,329
ton of Education we'd love to be

2436
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:05,119
involved in the ICBC

2437
01:47:01,329 --> 01:47:07,100
will hit me up and we can we can talk

2438

about it the schedule for Vancouver is

2439
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:11,360
packed but maybe we could do some little

2440
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:14,029
few minute like get up Rara and just

2441
01:47:11,359 --> 01:47:15,949
make everyone the [ __ ] aware of what the

2442
01:47:14,029 --> 01:47:18,250
hell is going on and why we're here just

2443
01:47:15,949 --> 01:47:21,949
hit me up and we'll do something okay

2444
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:25,069
yeah we definitely will thank you sweet

2445
01:47:21,949 --> 01:47:28,550
I definitely have to get there too hey I

2446
01:47:25,069 --> 01:47:31,069
got a question for dr. Lisa I have a

2447
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:32,930
question for dr. Russo if I could Ethan

2448
01:47:31,069 --> 01:47:38,630
do you know what the latest and greatest

2449
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:41,270
is on the FDA's position on CBD do you

2450
01:47:38,630 --> 01:47:44,029
have any update on that at all yeah so

2451
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:46,000
the situation is with the farm bill the

2452
01:47:44,029 --> 01:47:48,050
hemp bill

2453
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:51,590
supposedly a lot of these preparations

2454
01:47:48,050 --> 01:47:54,409
with less than 0.2 percent THC are legal

2455
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:57,440
however that is not the position of the

2456
01:47:54,409 --> 01:48:02,649
Food and Drug Administration or the DEA

2457
01:47:57,439 --> 01:48:05,319
okay so from the the position of the FDA

2458
01:48:02,649 --> 01:48:09,289
the

2459
01:48:05,319 --> 01:48:13,369
preperation epi dial which is 98% pure

2460
01:48:09,289 --> 01:48:16,310
CBD is a Schedule five substance that's

2461
01:48:13,369 --> 01:48:19,369
the lowest level of control but that

2462
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:21,770
only applies to epi dialogues and it

2463
01:48:19,369 --> 01:48:24,409
does not apply to any other former

2464
01:48:21,770 --> 01:48:27,380
cannabidiol which remains in schedule

2465
01:48:24,409 --> 01:48:29,479
one and I point out that cannabidiol has

2466
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:34,210
not been scheduled in most countries

2467
01:48:29,479 --> 01:48:38,899
extra USA with the DEA it's

2468
01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:40,939
again to them it's all illegal and they

2469
01:48:38,899 --> 01:48:44,239
will tell you they reserve the right to

2470
01:48:40,939 --> 01:48:47,000
arrest anybody engaged in this kind of

2471
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:50,389
commerce so it's great that we've made

2472
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:53,090
progress in the states however and no

2473
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:55,310
one should suffer the illusion that it

2474
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:58,940
could all disappear tomorrow if the

2475
01:48:55,310 --> 01:49:02,090
political will were there to do it now

2476
01:48:58,939 --> 01:49:05,299
it would be a stupid idea and contrary

2477
01:49:02,090 --> 01:49:07,840
to everything that we'd like to to have

2478
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:11,329
happen but that is still possible

2479
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:13,449
because of these discrepancies in the

2480
01:49:11,329 --> 01:49:16,340
law and what the

2481
01:49:13,449 --> 01:49:19,489
administration's feel the situation

2482
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:22,989
still is couldn't there be an exception

2483
01:49:19,489 --> 01:49:25,969
an exception to that rule though if the

2484
01:49:22,989 --> 01:49:28,699
Department of the Secretary of the

2485
01:49:25,970 --> 01:49:31,420
Health and Human Services issues an

2486
01:49:28,699 --> 01:49:36,889
exception to the FD&amp;C

2487
01:49:31,420 --> 01:49:38,960
Act to put CBD into foods and whatnot so

2488
01:49:36,890 --> 01:49:42,350
is that there always that loophole that

2489
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:46,279
it is just really up to one person in

2490
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:50,110
the Trump administration right now his I

2491
01:49:46,279 --> 01:49:52,909
think person isn't acting

2492
01:49:50,109 --> 01:49:55,759
HHS secretary I don't even think it's a

2493
01:49:52,909 --> 01:49:57,829
fully you know Senate appointed one but

2494
01:49:55,760 --> 01:50:01,300
isn't it just true that there is a

2495
01:49:57,829 --> 01:50:06,260
loophole for an exception to that law uh

2496
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:08,029
you know as far as that goes the truth

2497
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:10,699
doesn't matter it's the semblance of

2498
01:50:08,029 --> 01:50:15,289
truth that you can create and they bury

2499
01:50:10,699 --> 01:50:17,179
anyone under a tangle of legalese to

2500
01:50:15,289 --> 01:50:20,659
make their point so I wouldn't count on

2501
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:22,460
that at all the Attorney general could

2502
01:50:20,659 --> 01:50:25,550
do something if he were so inclined

2503
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:28,640
don't hold your breath what we really

2504
01:50:25,550 --> 01:50:30,529
need is Congress to tackle this and

2505
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:33,860
there are available bills they're just

2506
01:50:30,529 --> 01:50:37,579
not moving at the sign so the potential

2507
01:50:33,859 --> 01:50:41,619
is clearly there for this to be

2508
01:50:37,579 --> 01:50:44,689
rectified but it hasn't happened yet

2509
01:50:41,619 --> 01:50:47,359
and really to change the laws we really

2510
01:50:44,689 --> 01:50:49,399
need change in the Senate because I

2511
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:52,399
think Mitch McConnell even though he's

2512
01:50:49,399 --> 01:50:55,309
so-called Pro hab is dead Santa pants

2513
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:59,679
moving any cannabis legislation to the

2514
01:50:55,310 --> 01:50:59,680
floor for vote so he just needs to go

2515
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:05,899
gotta go hey I have there was a question

2516
01:51:03,949 --> 01:51:08,149
that I missed like three times now from

2517
01:51:05,899 --> 01:51:10,219
Kenna Biss in the chat room and he

2518
01:51:08,149 --> 01:51:15,759
wanted to know if anyone knew anything

2519
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:15,760
about cannabis hyperemesis syndrome

2520
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:21,730
do we have another hour

2521
01:51:19,810 --> 01:51:26,840
okay

2522
01:51:21,729 --> 01:51:28,539
this is a real syndrome um this is not

2523
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:33,170
someone's imagination

2524
01:51:28,539 --> 01:51:37,369
it is not related to me as you will hear

2525
01:51:33,170 --> 01:51:40,779
in in some quarters this only occurs in

2526
01:51:37,369 --> 01:51:44,710
people who do very heavy

2527
01:51:40,779 --> 01:51:48,130
chronic doses of THC

2528
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:52,250
what is going on we don't know precisely

2529
01:51:48,130 --> 01:51:55,520
but my theories on this would be one of

2530
01:51:52,250 --> 01:51:58,119
two things all one is that we're seeing

2531
01:51:55,520 --> 01:52:01,100
an expression of the the

2532
01:51:58,119 --> 01:52:03,649
biphasic effect it's well known that

2533
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:07,280
cannabinoids can do have opposite

2534
01:52:03,649 --> 01:52:09,469
effects at different dose ranges so it

2535
01:52:07,279 --> 01:52:13,369
may be that so it may be that what

2536
01:52:09,470 --> 01:52:16,610
usually treat nausea produces nausea and

2537
01:52:13,369 --> 01:52:20,149
vomiting at these elevated doses but at

2538
01:52:16,609 --> 01:52:23,119
the same time the THC is still lowering

2539
01:52:20,149 --> 01:52:27,379
the set point in the hypothalamus and

2540
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:30,710
producing hypothermia which explains the

2541
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:32,840
pot bathing phenomenon the other thing

2542
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:35,948
that could be happening is because of

2543
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:39,079
chronic exposure to THC

2544
01:52:35,948 --> 01:52:42,738
that we're getting a downregulation of

2545
01:52:39,079 --> 01:52:45,948
the cb1 receptors in the brain and this

2546
01:52:42,738 --> 01:52:48,948
will cause a change in the way that THC

2547
01:52:45,948 --> 01:52:51,408
acts it will become an antagonist at

2548
01:52:48,948 --> 01:52:54,109
that receptor instead of an agonist so

2549
01:52:51,408 --> 01:52:57,349
it will reverse the normal state of

2550
01:52:54,109 --> 01:53:00,769
affairs the solution to cannabinoid

2551
01:52:57,350 --> 01:53:05,000
hyperemesis which produces the vomiting

2552
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:08,060
nausea abdominal pain and this bathing

2553
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:10,750
behavior the solution is that stanchion

2554
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:15,289
from cannabis for a period of time

2555
01:53:10,750 --> 01:53:18,050
and people will get better however most

2556
01:53:15,289 --> 01:53:21,350
will suffer recurrence if they go back

2557
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:25,070
to their prior use patterns I think the

2558
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:27,949
solution is twofold one is use the

2559
01:53:25,069 --> 01:53:31,399
lowest dose that produces a desired

2560
01:53:27,948 --> 01:53:33,829
effect I also think that cannabidiol may

2561
01:53:31,399 --> 01:53:37,069
be protected so certainly people should

2562
01:53:33,829 --> 01:53:40,100
be using type 2 or even type 3 cannabis

2563
01:53:37,069 --> 01:53:42,340
preparations with a good quota of

2564
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:46,010
cannabidiol

2565
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:49,270
even does this happen to people who eat

2566
01:53:46,010 --> 01:53:52,310
cannabis or only smoking

2567
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:55,340
well there aren't there many people that

2568
01:53:52,310 --> 01:53:59,179
are ingesting Teague's seeing type

2569
01:53:55,340 --> 01:54:02,659
cannabis orally I'm not it's a good

2570
01:53:59,179 --> 01:54:04,250
question I'm just not sure that it

2571
01:54:02,658 --> 01:54:07,129
generally were seeing it with people

2572
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:09,158
that are smoking and especially doing

2573
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:12,199
vapes all day long

2574
01:54:09,158 --> 01:54:15,250
it's the cannabis concentrate seem to be

2575
01:54:12,198 --> 01:54:17,118
strongly associated with this

2576
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:19,850
interesting there must be something else

2577
01:54:17,118 --> 01:54:21,710
going on obviously because you know

2578
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:24,800
there's a lot of people who use a lot of

2579
01:54:21,710 --> 01:54:26,989
THC daily that don't get this it would

2580
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:29,300
be interesting to find what needs to be

2581
01:54:26,988 --> 01:54:31,459
lined up for this to occur people are

2582
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:33,529
saying oh why does he say it couldn't be

2583
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:35,149
me my think it could be it could be neem

2584
01:54:33,529 --> 01:54:38,509
and I've heard the argument as well for

2585
01:54:35,149 --> 01:54:40,368
me it's not a huge leap of faith for me

2586
01:54:38,510 --> 01:54:42,110
to think that a substance like cannabis

2587
01:54:40,368 --> 01:54:43,789
that works through the endocannabinoid

2588
01:54:42,109 --> 01:54:45,948
system and creates all these different

2589
01:54:43,789 --> 01:54:48,149
effects and regulates all these

2590
01:54:45,948 --> 01:54:51,839
biological function but there there

2591
01:54:48,149 --> 01:54:53,698
couldn't be systems where it flips where

2592
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:55,110
that you know where get we're just

2593
01:54:53,698 --> 01:54:56,729
something's happening in the system and

2594
01:54:55,109 --> 01:54:58,859
it's getting it wrong it's you know it's

2595
01:54:56,729 --> 01:55:01,349
like you said I've seen enough people

2596
01:54:58,859 --> 01:55:03,299
back in the day take a big hit a bubble

2597
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:05,190
hash for the first time and literally

2598
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:07,529
either go white and pass out or turn

2599
01:55:05,189 --> 01:55:10,109
green and throw up like it was it was

2600
01:55:07,529 --> 01:55:12,599
something that I saw a multitude of

2601
01:55:10,109 --> 01:55:15,089
times and for my own self - have I ever

2602
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:17,789
taken a big enough rip that I felt like

2603
01:55:15,090 --> 01:55:20,190
I was going to puke definitely at skunk

2604
01:55:17,789 --> 01:55:21,289
man Sam's house I felt that a couple of

2605
01:55:20,189 --> 01:55:25,729
times

2606
01:55:21,289 --> 01:55:29,698
yeah unfortunately I'm guilty for being

2607
01:55:25,729 --> 01:55:33,000
but yeah I I have a theory on this I

2608
01:55:29,698 --> 01:55:35,698
really can't share at this point but I

2609
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:38,850
think in the future we may be able to

2610
01:55:35,698 --> 01:55:40,639
identify people who were at risk of this

2611
01:55:38,850 --> 01:55:45,210
syndrome and

2612
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:49,380
as they they say watch this space we

2613
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:54,980
have to find a single person gets it

2614
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:59,219
from orally eating too much candidate

2615
01:55:54,979 --> 01:56:02,789
that's possible again generally it's

2616
01:55:59,219 --> 01:56:07,380
been association with with high intake

2617
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:08,789
of smoked high THC material and I think

2618
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:10,800
there's actually a couple different

2619
01:56:08,789 --> 01:56:13,260
things that are creating this

2620
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:16,650
hyperemesis and it being a hot topic you

2621
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:19,469
have obviously on the previous hashed

2622
01:56:16,649 --> 01:56:22,979
churches we discussed potential risks

2623
01:56:19,469 --> 01:56:26,340
associated with pest amination there are

2624
01:56:22,979 --> 01:56:29,039
some labs or some products being

2625
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:32,130
consumed in the Midwest and non non

2626
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:33,689
regulated states that could that are

2627
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:36,359
exhibiting signs that pesticide

2628
01:56:33,689 --> 01:56:38,389
poisoning but with cannabis hyperemesis

2629
01:56:36,359 --> 01:56:42,259
syndrome I think it's just a

2630
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:44,460
supersaturation within the cb1 receptors

2631
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:46,890
because a lot of the patients that are

2632
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:48,480
exhibiting it are consuming more greater

2633
01:56:46,890 --> 01:56:50,510
amount of cannabinoids than previously

2634
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:53,339
available in the market and

2635
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:54,989
do you think in terms of the conversion

2636
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:58,230
of delta-9 when you ingest something

2637
01:56:54,988 --> 01:57:01,019
there's something to that you know would

2638
01:56:58,229 --> 01:57:02,669
you also believe that we you know I

2639
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:04,410
I say to myself all the time we need to

2640
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:08,550
better understand what happens inside

2641
01:57:04,409 --> 01:57:10,319
the body to the coton the conversion and

2642
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:14,210
I'd like to hear if anyone has actually

2643
01:57:10,319 --> 01:57:16,949
done any studies or looked into that ah

2644
01:57:14,210 --> 01:57:18,480
well I could address this again I mean

2645
01:57:16,949 --> 01:57:22,380
it's still a bit of a controversial

2646
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:27,000
topic there were um experiments done by

2647
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:30,690
Leo Hollister back in the 70s on him dad

2648
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:34,319
alleged that eleven hydroxy THC which is

2649
01:57:30,689 --> 01:57:37,469
what THC gets converted to in the liver

2650
01:57:34,319 --> 01:57:39,139
on the first pass that that was four to

2651
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:42,990
ten times more

2652
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:48,240
psychoactive than THC however there was

2653
01:57:42,989 --> 01:57:50,699
a lot of work at GW on sativex um and a

2654
01:57:48,239 --> 01:57:54,840
lot of this was not published but the

2655
01:57:50,699 --> 01:57:57,109
bottom line was they looked at THC

2656
01:57:54,840 --> 01:58:00,300
levels in the blood

2657
01:57:57,109 --> 01:58:03,899
eleven hydroxy THC levels in the blood

2658
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:06,920
and had patients talk about how high

2659
01:58:03,899 --> 01:58:09,659
they were on a hundred point scale and

2660
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:12,180
there were just no good correlations

2661
01:58:09,659 --> 01:58:16,260
that showed that there seemed to be any

2662
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:19,520
difference in the psychoactivity of THC

2663
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:23,570
and 11 mode roxie THC

2664
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:25,830
so it it's not a settled issue

2665
01:58:23,569 --> 01:58:28,229
unfortunately the experiments that you

2666
01:58:25,829 --> 01:58:30,539
need to do to prove this would involve

2667
01:58:28,229 --> 01:58:32,629
putting a radioactive label on the

2668
01:58:30,539 --> 01:58:34,920
molecules and injecting them

2669
01:58:32,630 --> 01:58:36,869
intravenously I think you're gonna have

2670
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:40,980
trouble getting that through an ethics

2671
01:58:36,869 --> 01:58:43,409
committee so I'm not sure this is one we

2672
01:58:40,979 --> 01:58:45,659
can settle but bottom line is it's

2673
01:58:43,409 --> 01:58:48,689
unclear that there's a big difference in

2674
01:58:45,659 --> 01:58:52,109
the psychoactive effects of THC and 11

2675
01:58:48,689 --> 01:58:53,689
hydroxy and I just wanted one really

2676
01:58:52,109 --> 01:58:56,399
quick thing is that I'm seeing a lot of

2677
01:58:53,689 --> 01:58:59,039
misdiagnosis with this as well so

2678
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:00,929
doctors who don't necessarily have the

2679
01:58:59,039 --> 01:59:02,430
education they'll ask the patient you

2680
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:04,530
know are you smoking and then they'll

2681
01:59:02,430 --> 01:59:05,940
just give a diagnosis of that when the

2682
01:59:04,529 --> 01:59:08,460
person is actually having a Goldwater

2683
01:59:05,939 --> 01:59:11,819
attack or or something that is showing

2684
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:13,920
the same symptoms so I believe that you

2685
01:59:11,819 --> 01:59:16,250
know pushing this education forward so

2686
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:19,739
more clean and people and physicians

2687
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:21,720
have been educated you know knowing of

2688
01:59:19,739 --> 01:59:24,630
what the symptoms are and how to test

2689
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:27,810
for it we have a friend who has the

2690
01:59:24,630 --> 01:59:30,090
issue and when you know they smoke our

2691
01:59:27,810 --> 01:59:32,370
cannabis is she doesn't have it at all

2692
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:34,319
so I mean I don't I'm not gonna say that

2693
01:59:32,369 --> 01:59:36,840
am I gonna make a statement on the other

2694
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:39,239
nothing that that happens well it's

2695
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:42,270
gotta be righteous right I I have a

2696
01:59:39,239 --> 01:59:45,619
friend who can smoke cannabis but if she

2697
01:59:42,270 --> 01:59:48,720
smokes hash she passes out unconscious

2698
01:59:45,619 --> 01:59:50,460
like very badly like to the point where

2699
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:52,530
she knocked out teeth the last time we

2700
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:54,390
don't even let her smoke it anymore you

2701
01:59:52,529 --> 01:59:56,899
know the like not even sitting down

2702
01:59:54,390 --> 02:00:00,500
she's fallen out of Tears like

2703
01:59:56,899 --> 02:00:04,679
I I just wanted to mention the ethernet

2704
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:06,800
we have received approval to do a radio

2705
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:08,850
labeled study of our hydrogenated

2706
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:11,039
cannabinoids through international

2707
02:00:08,850 --> 02:00:13,920
delivery so it was an arduous process

2708
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:15,659
but we fought were finally there and so

2709
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:17,420
we're at the front end of basically

2710
02:00:15,659 --> 02:00:20,189
commissioning a study to look at

2711
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:23,069
internal delivery using radioactivity

2712
02:00:20,189 --> 02:00:26,029
just as a way to follow how it goes into

2713
02:00:23,069 --> 02:00:26,029
the animals brain

2714
02:00:26,329 --> 02:00:34,019
on this one back on the psychoactive

2715
02:00:30,149 --> 02:00:36,539
levels and unless we've got a rodent

2716
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:39,410
Whisperer out there I don't know that

2717
02:00:36,539 --> 02:00:42,890
we're gonna get fully answers

2718
02:00:39,409 --> 02:00:45,689
animals first rate

2719
02:00:42,890 --> 02:00:47,550
and the most first the bat phone is

2720
02:00:45,689 --> 02:00:50,449
going I'm not sure I didn't know Batman

2721
02:00:47,550 --> 02:00:53,610
was in the room but Batman

2722
02:00:50,449 --> 02:00:56,639
that's my new phone make it sorry about

2723
02:00:53,609 --> 02:00:59,359
that markets that's dr. Batman to you

2724
02:00:56,640 --> 02:01:02,760
yeah the bat to bat phone

2725
02:00:59,359 --> 02:01:04,619
and don't be sorry whatsoever we're

2726
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:06,480
chill were chill past church was a

2727
02:01:04,619 --> 02:01:08,189
little intense in the beginning as we

2728
02:01:06,479 --> 02:01:10,859
were doing it every single Sunday from

2729
02:01:08,189 --> 02:01:12,809
wherever I was in the world and I built

2730
02:01:10,859 --> 02:01:15,420
this incredible like it was it was

2731
02:01:12,810 --> 02:01:18,150
stressful I'm not even saying I'm gonna

2732
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:19,649
say how stressful it was but now it's

2733
02:01:18,149 --> 02:01:21,929
nice and loose you know we have a

2734
02:01:19,649 --> 02:01:23,759
dialogue we have our conversation it's

2735
02:01:21,930 --> 02:01:25,530
great that everyone was able to come in

2736
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:28,560
I said I was going to do two hours today

2737
02:01:25,529 --> 02:01:31,289
and we are at two hours and one minute

2738
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:33,539
so as always let me just change the

2739
02:01:31,289 --> 02:01:35,250
screen so everyone can be seen this is a

2740
02:01:33,539 --> 02:01:38,340
nice way to go through things I can

2741
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:40,469
thank everyone for coming and yeah if

2742
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:42,119
anyone wants to say anything oh there's

2743
02:01:40,469 --> 02:01:43,739
a really cool function not that we're

2744
02:01:42,118 --> 02:01:46,920
going to use it now but for future

2745
02:01:43,738 --> 02:01:48,718
references there's a there's a function

2746
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:50,849
where you can like put your hand up like

2747
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:52,828
it's it's it's a little like thing on

2748
02:01:50,849 --> 02:01:54,360
the box where it says like you know if

2749
02:01:52,828 --> 02:01:57,059
someone's saying something and you want

2750
02:01:54,359 --> 02:01:58,979
