45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,640
like uh it's not the beginning of our

46
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:54,599
story but it's certainly I'll never

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,759
forget the day you got the sort of like

48
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,478
you got to have a show at the Cannabis

49
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,680
cop and High Times was sort of giving

50
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:04,879
you a chance to move into a new field

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,399
you know you were already writing for

52
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,399
them and you had done the whole Adam's

53
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,840
garden and all of that awesome stuff but

54
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,159
then it was like you would you had this

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,239
opportunity and I remember you were

56
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:18,680
taking it pretty seriously and I was one

57
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,959
of your first guests yeah they they but

58
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,840
you know they didn't give me like an

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,159
opportunity basically it was like it was

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,360
okay you're going to Amsterdam again

61
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,400
you're going to do the same old thing

62
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,160
you know you're going to do a grow

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,640
seminar and I'd been there two times

64
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:32,280
before and I'm like I want to do

65
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,238
something different and they were like

66
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,680
what I said I'm going to put on a show

67
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,800
like what kind of show I said I don't

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,800
know I'll come up with something and so

69
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,840
literally I went and had cards printed

70
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,760
like the Jerry Springer like blue cards

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,560
that said The Grow Show on the back and

72
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:50,959
uh and and and this is true story it's

73
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,000
so funny you brought this up because I

74
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,439
didn't think of this I was going to

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
start the show with another story I

76
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:01,439
showed up in Amsterdam without any plan

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,680
I figured I can you know I didn't I

78
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,400
forgot how hectic it was and literally

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,719
the night before I stayed up with Steve

80
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,360
Bloom we wrote the outline for the show

81
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,080
and the morning of I woke up early and

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,120
went to what's the name of that Pancake

83
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,959
House it's right in the D plots there

84
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,759
hul um the it's it's a tourist place

85
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,199
right and so we sat there and ate and

86
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:26,840
Cosmo wrote out the chicken scratch of

87
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,079
all the notes that I had written for the

88
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,200
show that you couldn't read onto my Grow

89
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,000
Show Cards so that I could actually do

90
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:39,158
the show and yeah and that led to uh a

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,878
historic uh controversy didn't it yes

92
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:43,878
yes it absolutely did that was uh it was

93
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,318
a whole wild experience the way it

94
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:50,679
actually played out because of course

95
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:52,679
you know it it played back to S and S

96
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,040
who was we you know friends with both of

97
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,200
us at that time and Som you know was

98
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,000
also friends with Mila and Mila was of

99
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,719
course not overly excited that I was

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,840
doing my own bags and I was doing it

101
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,840
from a different perspective than she

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,079
chose to do it from and so I was having

103
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,840
some pretty good success and obviously

104
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:15,879
you doing the article in High Times

105
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,798
prior to your Grow Show um was a big

106
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:20,279
help it was a big exposure I had been

107
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,959
already sort of popularized on overgrow

108
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,959
and cannabis world and cannabis

109
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,160
culture.com but High Times was like a

110
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,478
whole different level you're like yeah

111
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,199
I'm gonna write an article about you

112
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:32,120
dude after we met in in Switzerland and

113
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,639
I guess instead of getting some photos

114
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,000
from me you were like I'll get some

115
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,439
photos from s and you're like hey hooked

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,079
me up with some bubble has photos and he

117
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,199
gave you some really beautiful ones but

118
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,240
the problem was was that you know and

119
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,280
the reason it got taken out on you was

120
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,879
that s knew to deflect that energy by

121
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,319
telling when I was over at his house he

122
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,120
had bubble bags out on his thing right

123
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,038
he's like I love these bags there's more

124
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,120
control there's instead of just two bags

125
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:59,800
I can make higher quality resin but if

126
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,879
Mila went over to his house he would

127
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,639
take the Bubble Bags off the the little

128
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:07,079
hanger and he'd put isolator bags on so

129
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,639
she was under the full assumption with

130
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,359
you know and you could you kind of can't

131
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,960
blame her that those photos were

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,280
isolator hash not bubble

133
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:17,879
hash and that's what she was that's

134
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,399
that's what she ended up blowing up on

135
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,719
you in front like at your show like it

136
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,519
was like literally during the filming of

137
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,479
your

138
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,639
show yeah I literally I put on a whole

139
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,800
show right I had I had the bong babes

140
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,319
rolling joints and I told the audience

141
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,600
if if they clapped really loud that

142
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,280
they'd throw a lot of joints out into

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,039
the audience we're having a good time

144
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,038
rocker T came on and did a song and

145
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,159
closed the show and it was really I

146
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:43,519
couldn't believe it it actually was

147
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,840
coming on really well and so I'm out in

148
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,879
the audience like Jerry Springer and

149
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,079
there's a there's a time between between

150
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,519
skits where I'm taking questions I

151
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,279
interviewed you and then I'm out there

152
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:58,399
and I'm taking questions and this woman

153
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,439
comes up to me and I honestly didn't

154
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,399
even know who she was wasn't until after

155
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,639
the show that somebody told me who that

156
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,038
was and I didn't even know who it was

157
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,598
when it was

158
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:10,120
happening so we're both learning we're

159
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:12,719
both learning new things about this

160
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,160
story isn't this great and so I'm up

161
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,639
there just in the show like really I

162
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,319
mean like I'm like in another whole

163
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,280
world I'm for the first time I'm putting

164
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,560
on a show like a show in front of people

165
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,758
and I'm concerned with what I'm doing

166
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,038
and and I asked she asked the question

167
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,598
it was something

168
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:34,519
about do you realize that I made the

169
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:36,800
first bubble bags and I I didn't know I

170
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:40,879
had no idea and I basically brushed her

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,160
off and but to finish this in context I

172
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,439
actually spoke because I had done a

173
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,680
story about you Mila called me at the

174
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,478
offices in High Times just a couple of

175
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,959
weeks before I went to Amsterdam right

176
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,279
and she had mentioned to me she she

177
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,000
brought me up to speed that you know I

178
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:59,519
came out with these isolator bags a long

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,240
time ago and it would be nice if you

180
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:05,359
gave me some some press too right and I

181
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,598
made this Pro I said oh absolutely I

182
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,598
promise but I didn't know what she I'd

183
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:09,759
never seen a picture of her I didn't the

184
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:12,719
only thing I talked to her on the

185
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,080
telephone so even after that promise of

186
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,919
what I was going to do and and then she

187
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,279
came up and I had no idea how to handle

188
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:20,079
it and I was like thank you very much

189
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,638
thank you very much cuz I I didn't even

190
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,758
know it was her so I couldn't even

191
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,199
legitimately follow through on the it

192
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,560
was just it was really funny and I I had

193
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,199
left I wasn't even in the room anymore

194
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,759
right like after you interviewed me I

195
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,560
bounced I I should have stuck around for

196
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:41,400
the uh for the hilarity to ensue but uh

197
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,680
I did not that was fun I was going to

198
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:47,878
start off the show with uh Switzerland

199
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,280
when we met in can you can you remember

200
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:54,520
what year that

201
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:57,119
was I want to say it was

202
00:07:54,519 --> 00:08:00,680
2001 and the reason I want to say I want

203
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,519
to say that because

204
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:08,360
Steve breeder Steve myself and Scott

205
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:12,878
Blakey I.E Shanti Baba who were all in

206
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Lugano at the time uh had all just had

207
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:20,599
baby daughters born that year uh really

208
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,598
all within like uh 20 20 days of of one

209
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:24,598
another like his daughter was born on

210
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:26,759
the 31st of March I know that because

211
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,918
that's my birthday my daughter was born

212
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,960
on the 13th of April and then I I can't

213
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,000
remember which one Shanti baba but so

214
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,958
that was kind of this weird sort of

215
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,799
coincidence that was occurring and and

216
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,439
of course it was sort of Steve that

217
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,240
brought me out to Switzerland he was

218
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,919
like you know come make a bunch of hash

219
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,680
um he had owed me some money too that I

220
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,639
was going to sort of collect on it made

221
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,639
sense and then you know bumping into you

222
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,439
guys was just uh

223
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,759
serendipitous yeah and and no

224
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,200
coincidence that was my the first time

225
00:08:54,759 --> 00:09:00,078
that I ever

226
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,600
saw bubblehash do you remember remember

227
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:08,439
you made a batch and then before we went

228
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,079
to dinner you in your hands you made a

229
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,360
chunk of hash that looked like a little

230
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:15,919
piece of bid honey you remember those

231
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,839
old candies bid honey and and and I'd

232
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,919
never seen that before that was that was

233
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,480
the very first time and it was

234
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:25,479
fresh and we weren't going to try it

235
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,879
until we let it dry or cure at least

236
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,079
some or something or and and then we

237
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:33,838
came back from dinner and that when we

238
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:37,078
indulged and uh and went on with a a

239
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,360
very amazing trip to uh to Switzerland

240
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:41,239

241
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,000
definitely 25 years ago yeah yeah no it

242
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,360

243
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,200
our daughters had just been born Steve

244
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,120
uh wasn't out there really long at all

245
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,560
prior

246
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,078
to prior to his daughter being born so

247
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,159

have been following you that that you

276
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,200

Canada I love it you said that yeah I

283
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,319
did not know that I probably probably

284
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,319
told me that a while back but that's

285
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,160
really interesting and and then how old

286
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,480
were you when you uh

287
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:44,879
migrated uh I believe I was about

288
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,000
23 years old so it was your

289
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,439
decision yeah we were just like of

290
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,039
course both my wife and I were like

291
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,240
let's go out there let's start a life

292
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,599
out there in fact how it happened was I

293
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,440
had my mentor Ron hickey who's just an

294
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,600
absolute Savage Maniac this is an

295
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,519
amazing man who's just will he'll bend

296
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,200
over backwards to teach anyone how to

297
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,440
grow cannabis he had one of the first uh

298
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,000
hydroponic stores in Winnipeg and he

299
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,399
taught an enormous amount of people he

300
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,320
developed that 32 pipe system that

301
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,360
you've probably seen since the 80s it

302
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,399
white pipes with the black plugs on yes

303
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,720
with the yeah yeah so he designed that

304
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,639
system the waterfall Reservoir like 25

305
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,519
to 30 years ago uh like unequivocally

306
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,320
that was him so he did all sorts of wild

307
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:33,278
stuff like that and he um

308
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,000
he I rented a a house in a fairly

309
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,879
affluent part of Manitoba and I was

310
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,958
pretty young with his help and he was

311
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,320

313
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,079

building it the landlord called and said

327
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,759
oh I just want to have someone to come

328
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,078
in and do some

329
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,319
uh oh I can't remember what she called

330
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,039
it it was like some sort of like um

331
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,720
basically where they come in and measure

332
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:28,078
the [ __ ]

333
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,920
house and so the guy's in the basement

334
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,519
he's going like he's like dude a huge

335
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,120
section of your basement is missing and

336
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,720
I had to basically get all the lights

337
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,440
out of the grow room put a couple of

338
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,920
trees like way in the back with my two

339
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,600
iguanas and try to convince this guy

340
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:45,479
this is my iguana room with the Secret

341
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,720
Door Under the Staircase that I had to

342
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,159
bring him under so he told the landlord

343
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,320
and the landlord was like yeah you're

344
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:53,039
evicted so after we built this

345
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,920
incredible

346
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,360
room I wasn't expecting that well this

347
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,838
is how I ended up moving to British

348
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,440
Columbia I was so pissed off I was like

349
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,560
okay you know what [ __ ] this this is so

350
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,959
ridiculous I'm you know it's time for us

351
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,198
to go to BC and so it really was the big

352
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:12,919
push putting all that time and energy in

353
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:15,198
a you know two months of buildout into

354
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,838
finally just being told you you know it

355
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,519
was a beautiful house and it was

356
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,720
comfortable and it was off the beaten

357
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,720
path it was just perfect and so did you

358
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,839
did you move out did did did you have

359
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,160
contacts or did you just move out into

360
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:31,399
you know another country on your own

361
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,519
just well another

362
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,480
Province well been another country it

363
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,278
was super trippy dude trust me like for

364
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,639
all these years I've known you I haven't

365
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,639
been able to get into Canada I I had a c

366
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,159
I had a company for 10 years that made

367
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,919
my that my nutrients that were made in

368
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:46,958
Canada and I still couldn't get into

369
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:49,198
Canada yeah it's bizarre the whole

370
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,479
Canadian American relationship with

371
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,919
trying to keep each other out you know

372
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,079
it is look I look with the way things

373
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,240
are now you know you guys are kind of

374
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:01,198
lucky because you have the this awesome

375
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,440
border right you have you have the

376
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:08,000
Arctic Circle and then you have us so

377
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,079
you know it's like uh we you can control

378
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,078
that it's like we got we got we got

379
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:15,278
idiot to a degree but if you look at our

380
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:18,000
country 90% of the country lives like

381
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:20,600
right at the US border within like an

382
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,120
hour to two hours all of our cities are

383
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,399
like right down there so if if anything

384
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,879
ever goes down that's really serious in

385
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,198
America like we'll be yeah of course

386
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,679
like we'll have to go wait we'll have

387
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:33,838
don't get me wrong we'll have a lot of

388
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,958
space to go north but there's nothing up

389
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,040
there but until then you have Healthcare

390
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,318
and we

391
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,000
don't kind of it's gotten worse and

392
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:42,879
worse here I I won't get into the

393
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,318
politics of the country but it was it

394
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,838
was the Canada your thinking about

395
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:50,078
definitely existed like 20 to 25 years

396
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,240
ago and since we got this sort of new

397
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,519
prime minister it's gotten a lot

398
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,759
different yeah but isn't it relative to

399
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,959
how much worse that the US has gotten

400
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,039
too I mean we're just living in l i feel

401
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,559
I wake up and I feel like I'm living in

402
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,958
a Mel Brooks movie like he did Space

403
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:09,758
Balls part two the United States you

404
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,879
know yeah I know it's wild it definitely

405
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,159
is I mean and we're not too far off to

406
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:17,240
be honest it's like we're not too far

407
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,919
off we're we're your your your brothers

408
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,959
from the north kind of thing you know

409
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,919
like when people are like Canadians

410
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,838
always want to like disassociate

411
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:27,919
themselves with Americans but like the

412
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,240
whole thing that makes Canada Canada is

413
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,278
that we have

414
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,000
you you guys are a huge influence on

415
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,679
every aspect of our culture it would be

416
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,399
like I mean not only that like you're a

417
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:40,359
Hu you guys are a huge influence on

418
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,000
every aspect of everyone's culture

419
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,120
nobody exports culture the way the US

420
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,879
does that's interesting but because

421
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,839
because I I the America does United

422
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,879
States doesn't really have any culture

423
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,959
we don't have any we don't have you're

424
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,879
the storytellers you have Hollywood

425
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,518
you're the storytellers and those

426
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,360
stories are the culture that you're

427
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,879
exporting we have entertainment and we

428
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,600
have Silicon Valley that's what we do

429
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:06,838
better or as good as anybody in the

430
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,160
world but we don't have tradition or um

431
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:10,000
we don't have a holiday that's

432
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,199
distinctly the United States that we P

433
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,480
well okay we do let's right I'm G to get

434
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,679
off of that I'm G to ask you so you're

435
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,640
in CA Canada now you've been there

436
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:22,640
forever and you know what you know it's

437
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:27,360
it's it it's hard to deny that um you've

438
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,759
become a luminary in our community um

439
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:33,319
and to me I'll Define that a little bit

440
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:36,519
you know it uh a luminary it it doesn't

441
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:39,798
happen by accident it happens by

442
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:42,798
deliberate um intention and the

443
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:46,319
intention that you had was to uh make a

444
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:51,240
mark in this world and you certainly

445
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:55,519
have with uh bubble has and uh hash

446
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,759
church and Whistler Tech and um you know

447
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,359
I don't know how many other uh

448
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,839
successful companies you've got going on

449
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,918
but I want you to tell me a little bit

450
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,798
about that so we can get caught up about

451
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:10,000
the the shop talk what's going on with

452
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,558
uh your new tech these

453
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,880
days well all sorts of things in that

454
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,519
sense I mean I've definitely been

455
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,240
working with Whistler Technologies for

456
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,839
you know building out sort of an

457
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,159
industrial commercial equipment that

458
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:26,000
doesn't sacrifice the Purity and the

459
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,360
quality that's there for the scaling up

460
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,640
because generally people are always

461
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,599
afraid to scale especially in the can

462
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,640
industry you've already said it all

463
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:36,959
because and and and that and because

464
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,000
there's nothing like that here you you

465
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,640
know that right

466
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,759
so nobody thinks like that you cannot

467
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,240
get anybody with millions of dollars to

468
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,839
invest to think like that so go on

469
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,679
please yeah so we're just uh you know

470
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,000
pushing the boundaries and the sort of

471
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,320
innovating in regards to that equipment

472
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,480
we've got some pretty awesome Engineers

473
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:01,918
that are really just like engineers at

474
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,120
their core and they've been getting into

475
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,799
hash and cannabis more and more and more

476
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,959
over the years as they develop this

477
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:10,319
equipment with the help of you know hey

478
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,120
hash makers like myself and we've got a

479
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,839
sales guy by the name of Tyler and one

480
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:16,798
of the engineers Andrew is also uh uh

481
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:18,519
into the heady culture so that always

482
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,038
helps when you're building this kind of

483
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:22,279
equipment there's a lot of people doing

484
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,679
the equipment on the commercial side now

485
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:28,399
but they come from manufacturing and

486
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,120
Fabrication which is great you need that

487
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,400
side of the puzzle uh but you also need

488
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,798
the grower the hash maker you know the

489
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,519
guy who's going to be putting the

490
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,879
product into these pieces of equipment

491
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,038
who will understand the pain points much

492
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,880
differently than the person it's just

493
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:46,119
like anything in cannabis right you've

494
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,080
got all these sort of big money guys

495
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:50,279
that came in and sort of they have this

496
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,038
corporate culture uh and they didn't

497
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:55,119
really respect the people who were from

498
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:56,319
the Legacy and vice versa the Legacy

499
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,079
people were like oh these corporate

500
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,240
douchebags we don't but if they

501
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,240
understand that you need each other to

502
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,919
sort of operate in that corporate

503
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,480
landscape but still bring in that actual

504
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,440
culture of the grower hash maker the

505
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,558
heady culture you always need those two

506
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,000
I've always said it like both sides

507
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,359
always think that they're kind of the

508
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,519
best kind of like Mick Jagger and Keith

509
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:21,000
Richards but really alone they suck

510
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:23,038
balls but when you put them together and

511
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,359
you create that third little entity in

512
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,279
the middle the the Rolling Stones that's

513
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:30,719
the that's the magic right where you can

514
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,798
create that Synergy so and it isn't even

515
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,279
just the ideas it has to be the right

516
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,158
people right because I've gotten in and

517
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:38,440
out of you know you got to have the

518
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,600
right people at the right time in their

519
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,440
lives everybody's got to have the right

520
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:44,240
amount of ego the right amount of

521
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,600
self-confidence but the right amount of

522
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,279
lack of ego too right totally man it's

523
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,439
not an easy it's literally like like

524
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,759
winning a lottery if you can if you can

525
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,120
nail it but uh it's what entrepreneurs

526
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:59,558
love and it's fun and I'm having fun

527
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,719
with the company I would was uh you know

528
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:04,200
pretty exclusive for The Last 5 Years my

529
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,400
contract with them just just ended my

530
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,159
exclusive contract so now I'm able in my

531
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,919
consulting which I'm doing a lot of

532
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,240
these

533
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,600
days able to access different calibers

534
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,240
of equipment because there's no doubt

535
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,000
about it that Whistler technology is at

536
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,079
the very very top beautiful I've seen it

537
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,200
I I I've looked I've studied it as much

538
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,558
as you can you know online and stuff and

539
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,159
absolutely beautiful and yeah it's

540
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:31,399
completely like it's really for eug GMP

541
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,240
and gpp like be more so than like trap

542
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,360
Labs not that I don't have utter and

543
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,919
complete respect for trap Labs but you

544
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,038
don't need to over engineer the

545
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:42,200
equipment to that level for that kind of

546
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:44,278
lab if you're not you know highly

547
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,600
regulated so this equipment is highly

548
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:48,919
regulated the way it's designed is for

549
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:51,158
highly regulated markets I dare say that

550
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,080
you have not smoked any particulate

551
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:56,400
matter in 30

552
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:59,399
years it's been at least 24 to 25 you're

553
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,480
not wrong on that sense that means leaf

554
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,960
for you neop fites out there that that

555
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,839
basically means leaf leaf or stem or or

556
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,840
uh uh cellulose or I'm not I'm not going

557
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:13,480
to go on because I'm not that

558
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:17,879
smart but you're not wrong thank

559
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,159
you so man um so in fact let me say one

560
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,600
thing on that point before you go on I

561
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,039
would love to design in my brand I have

562
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:26,399
the bubble man brand and it's

563
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:29,519
operational in some states I would love

564
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,480
to create the product where I do an

565
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:36,359
extract and it's in the jar and then I

566
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,558
take the flour that I extracted it from

567
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,599
and I dry that out and I create

568
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:44,839
cardboard boxes out of

569
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:47,839
it the resin itself goes into the budm

570
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:49,759
made box which is basically cellulose

571
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,678
and fiber which is exactly what

572
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,119
cardboard is cellulose and fiber so

573
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:58,400
flower isn't too far off it it would be

574
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,319
very easy to turn buds into a cardboard

575
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,320
is this is this the first time you've

576
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,079
spit that that that little idea or have

577
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:07,558
cuz manifestation I believe in

578
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,278
wholeheartedly so I'm already I already

579
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:11,599
think you're GNA have it done

580
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:14,119
somehow yeah I've mentioned it just a

581
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,439
few times to sort of friends in passing

582
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:17,639
I don't think I've ever mentioned it on

583
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,759
a podcast or anything so this will be

584
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,120
the uh this will be the test I think it

585
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:25,000
would just be amazing to get that Tech

586
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:27,278
down take all your dried your wet flour

587
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,558
and dry it out and get it pressed and

588
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:32,119
card F and C printed on like how sick

589
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,759
would that be if you probably could

590
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,359
manage to get a little scratch and sniff

591
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,879
on the back too it's basically like

592
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,879
resin

593
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:46,879
deconstructed that's awesome man um so

594
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,959
you know um I got a you know I do have a

595
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,840
few questions here that I did want to

596
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,519
make sure because I want this to be

597
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:54,720
informative to people not just

598
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:57,038
entertaining I think I'm having a great

599
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,278
time usually if I'm having a good time

600
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:01,319
then everybody else is too so since

601
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:05,679
we're on the the the the the subject of

602
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:08,200
bubble hash um you know usually I ask

603
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,759
like people what's give me a couple of

604
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,240
tips on you know growing at home what I

605
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:17,038
want you to do is give me a couple of

606
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,640
piece of advice for you know uh

607
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:23,000
home bubblers we'll call them home

608
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,919
bubblers well I will say this you know

609
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,480
everyone how deep do you have to get

610
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,159
right cuz I know you know you can get

611
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,319
freezers for this you can work in a

612
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,440
freeze room you can get really really

613
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:35,119
deep but we're going to we're going to

614
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,600
lay it out here for the home guy couple

615
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:41,678
of tips that are above all GNA improve

616
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:43,959
his General work well I mean number one

617
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,320
tip is that the bags are the word of God

618
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,440
when it comes to the quality of your

619
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:49,558
resin and although cognitive dissonance

620
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,360
will allow you to delude yourself into

621
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:53,158
thinking you have better quality flour

622
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,000
than you may have and we've all been

623
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:58,919
subject to that me

624
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,038
included um the resin will not allow

625
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,559
that it's very difficult for the resin

626
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,319
to allow that so and what I mean by that

627
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:07,720
is they're they're the word of God when

628
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:10,519
you countless people when I release

629
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:14,200
these bags would message me and say Hey

630
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:16,798
how do I get my hash to melt like yours

631
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,240
is melting and I'm like oo now that's

632
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,759
not actually a technique in the hash

633
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,278
making that is actually something to do

634
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,440
with a the caliber of genetics that

635
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:28,240
you're running so that basically means

636
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,038
what are the gene synthes that are

637
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,319
present in those in that genetic code

638
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:36,278
and which ones are on Gene synthes so

639
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:40,038
that's like you know if you have a th a

640
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:42,798
cbda gene synthes that plant can produce

641
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:45,798
cbda if it doesn't have the gene synthes

642
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,240
in its genetic code it's it's unable to

643
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:49,839
to produce that so this is where

644
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,079
breeders will figure out what's present

645
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,519
in a plant even if it's not dominant and

646
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:57,079
then they can be like oh this thing has

647
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:59,720
some it has the thcv a gene synthes we

648
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,599
can use that is breeding stock to bump

649
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,679
those numbers up and then I won't get

650
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,959
into you know breeding is that what we

651
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,600
would just call

652
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,960
dumpers well I mean if if they were the

653
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:13,359
gene syntheses of of resin and they they

654
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,278
could be dumpers and then if they were

655
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,959
also the gene synthesis of volatile

656
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:20,440
organic compounds they could also be

657
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,159
like super flavorful and tasty dumpers

658
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,798
right it all depends on what Gene

659
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,760
syntheses are present and so that's the

660
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:30,319
genetics right what genetics are there

661
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,720
then it comes down to are you able to

662
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,678
create an environment that allows that

663
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,798
plant to sequester the components that

664
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:40,120
it requires when it requires where it

665
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:41,679
requires and how it requires you know

666
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,798
which I'm always you know when people

667
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,919
say what's the what's the best way to

668
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:47,798
get great resin I'm a big proponent of

669
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,600
living soils it doesn't mean it's the

670
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:52,240
only way and I've smoked

671
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,278
incredible material resins from

672
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,200
non-living soils that have that have

673
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:57,839
blown me away completely so I'm not

674
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,159
saying it's the be all end all I'm

675
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:03,000
saying that the intelligence that the

676
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,480
fungi has the micro rizosphere that is

677
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,159
coding your root system in a living soil

678
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,519
uh environment is an intelligence that

679
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,240
we cannot quite understand it has a

680
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,558
direct link of communication with the

681
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,159
plant where it's like I need some of

682
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:19,119
this boom it gets it it sequesters it It

683
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,120
prepares it and then it delivers it

684
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,278
right to where it needs to be in a way

685
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,359
that I mean sure there's probably some

686
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:28,440
phds out there that are very intelligent

687
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,439
and have somewhat of an understanding

688
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,000
but I can almost unequivocally say that

689
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:37,200
until we have like some super level of

690
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
sentient AI Singularity type [ __ ] um

691
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,679
nothing is going to be stronger or

692
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,919
smarter than so I'm going to take you

693
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:47,120
forward so we we've got the material

694
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,440
okay and give us a give me a little bit

695
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,278
in the technique of how to handle it

696
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,240
that's what people need to

697
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,798
know well I mean I like hash never

698
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,159
touched as a macro photographer I prefer

699
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:59,679
that the plants don't don't get touched

700
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,919
I don't want people rubbing up against

701
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,120
them with t-shirts or hoodies because

702
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,960
then these big fibers stick in there um

703
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,158
it's the same from the hash perspective

704
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,159
when I start macro photographing resin

705
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:12,799
and I see when there's buds just leaning

706
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,960
over that people are brushing as they

707
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:17,398
walk by and I get under my re my my

708
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,000
macroscope and I realize the resin

709
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:21,000
glands have been torn off they've been

710
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,200
stretched and pulled and contaminated

711
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,519
and I'm like uh don't do that so I like

712
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:31,080
never touched I love I I I I don't mind

713
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:33,440
running dry material or fresh Frozen um

714
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:36,240
the best of the best materials even

715
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,960
dried out will produce incredible

716
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:44,038
quality hashes now the fresh frozen

717
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:46,880
pathway really became a thing for people

718
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:49,679
to have more of a chance of acquiring

719
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,320
full melt so whereas old school Growers

720
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,480
like yourself and people that we know

721
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:59,240
have been curing these monot Turpin

722
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,278
these very costic rough sort of tpin out

723
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,798
of the plant that's what that's why we

724
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,839
cure flour we get rid of that harsh

725
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:09,278
stuff well in the world of fresh frozen

726
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:11,759
both BHO and wet wash we're trapping all

727
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,880
of those monot Turpin now as you raise

728
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:17,759
the turpine profile

729
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:21,080
percentage you increase the likeliness

730
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:23,960
of a of a shimmering melty glow as you

731
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:26,879
hit that hash that's not necessarily the

732
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,200
same thing as a perfectly grown resin

733
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,799
gland that will melt into a liquid and

734
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,000
boil upon Heat Going near it those are

735
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,278
those are different things pick up what

736
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,960
you're laying down I I am picking up

737
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:39,640
what you're laying down well there

738
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,558
there's even another way so not only

739
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,080
will they use fresh frozen for that

740
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:46,639
they'll then take the hash afterwards

741
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,278
and this is you know with with water

742
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,399
hash even for home guys listen the

743
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:52,759
recipe is super simple if you follow the

744
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:55,518
very simple recipe of mixing and

745
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:58,038
settling and pulling you end up getting

746
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,759
what is there very effective

747
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:03,519
the only very difficult part that enjo

748
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:06,000
involves subtle nuances is the drying of

749
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,798
the hash that's the trick that's the

750
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,640
trick drying it no I have I have

751
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:15,480
questions before then so so Step One is

752
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,759
dry your

753
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,519
flour and cure it with the with the with

754
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:25,359
the Sugar Leaf with with the sugar leaf

755
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:27,919
on it right whole plant dry it and cure

756
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,959
it and then and so you're going to dry

757
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,038
it you're going to Buck it down you're

758
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,519
going to put it in containers and cure

759
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:37,879
it the way an expert or or the way the

760
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,159
best but and that would be the before

761
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,640
you would prefer taking away all the

762
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,960
other Perfections and

763
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,120
Imperfections you're in your home you

764
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,640
grow it in your closet you grew a really

765
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:50,599
great batch you're going to dry it

766
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,880
slowly you're going to Buck and you're

767
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,798
not you're going to leave all the sugar

768
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,760
leaf on it and then you're going to Buck

769
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:59,158
it down and you're going to cure it is

770
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:00,759
is this what I'm taking from you well

771
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,159
this is what you're taking from you but

772
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,720
the guy next to you could have said so

773
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,320
what you're saying is you want me to cut

774
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,120
it down all fresh freeze it flash freeze

775
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,918
it and then run it fresh what I would

776
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,558
suggest is both to find out what you

777
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,440
like and you'll see that the old school

778
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:17,678
guys prefer the cured resin and the

779
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,080
younger guys they're more now like

780
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:23,600
addicted to that just that crazy grab by

781
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:25,798
the neck so good answer fresh is what's

782
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,879
most popular right now good answer so

783
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:29,398
now okay so I'm going to I'm going to

784
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,360
I'm going to hang it whole and I'm going

785
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:33,119
to put it into jars and I'm going to

786
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,599
cure it for a couple of weeks and then

787
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,599
I'm going to trim those I'm going to put

788
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:38,278
them in jars Loosely and then I'm going

789
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,918
to trim off all the sugar and that's

790
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:41,599
what I'm going to make no wait there's

791
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,720
no trimming anymore we're using the

792
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,558
whole buds so you're going to clean that

793
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,960
off of all the stem correct you're going

794
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:50,558
to really break it down small now that

795
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,558
you got cured

796
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,200
Buds and this is where I'm going to

797
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:57,278
start my process okay anybody can do

798
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,278
this at home we haven't we haven't we

799
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:02,480
haven't broken anything made anything

800
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:05,319
too heady right like that that is non

801
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,960
understanding so am I is this is this a

802
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:12,240
good am I am I you with me so

803
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:15,240
far yeah yeah okay so now so now I got

804
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,359
my my five or my 10 or my 20 gallon

805
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,638
bubble bags and of course you don't want

806
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:22,638
to use top water because water is a

807
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:25,319
source of contaminants

808
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:27,879
correct it absolutely can be now keep in

809
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:30,798
mind from the perspective of the home

810
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,840
User it's not the end of the world you

811
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:36,119
know from the perspective of the

812
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:37,959
commercial producer well there's

813
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:41,398
regulations to follow and you want to

814
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:44,159
just make sure your product if if you

815
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:46,798
follow me I'm just following a simple

816
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,919
path I'm still a simple man I'm

817
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:52,558
domesticated I don't have a factory I

818
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,000
don't have a growroom I have a grow tent

819
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,638
so it's real simple for me so I'm just

820
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,038
bringing it along at a real simple pace

821
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:03,199
but from the man who's done it all so so

822
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:06,440
now we got our we got our bubble bags

823
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,919
and so I'm going to use either filtered

824
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,960
water or I'm going to go out and buy

825
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,679
some purified water I mean that's worth

826
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,399
the money right yeah yeah it's not too

827
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:20,200
difficult to do for sure okay same thing

828
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:23,798
with the ice right so you know I've

829
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,759
exactly soce with the water that you got

830
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:27,200
exactly back in the day I started buying

831
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,119
clean ice but what you couldn't just buy

832
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,639
it anywhere you wanted to buy filtered

833
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:34,359
clean ice so now you've got clean water

834
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:39,278
in most ice what's that do you know

835
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:42,158
what's in most ice water fluoride fluide

836
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:46,880
water water water is in all ice

837
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:48,320
exclusively fluide is only in some ice

838
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,039
but yeah you buy it and you're like why

839
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:53,319
the [ __ ] are these [ __ ] putting

840
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:55,720
fluide in this this is not even sensible

841
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:58,759
and they don't even have to list

842
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,278
it yeah it's often LED though so so

843
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:03,558
we're so so look I'm just hammering the

844
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,440
basics really quick so you got your

845
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:09,398
material that's how you do it you got

846
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,559
clean water clean ice and so now to me

847
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:15,039
the next important step

848
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,000
is cold water you got to be patient in

849
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,960
between the steps right you got to you

850
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,239
got to be patient in between the steps

851
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,440
you you got to put the ice in the water

852
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,598
and let it sit for a certain amount of

853
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,838
time you got to be patient you're not

854
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,800
wrong um this is one of the things that

855
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:32,398
the fresh frozen people will say when

856
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,079
you freeze the flour putting the flour

857
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:37,199
into the water allows you to use less

858
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:39,159
ice because the flow is so cold it

859
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,319
reduces the heat of the water you're

860
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:45,159
just proving it's all about expedience

861
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:50,800
and or uh expense what I'm talking about

862
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:53,280
is simple and pragmatic so so uh um so

863
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,320
again bubble man says I'm not wrong so

864
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,519
you're going to sit and you're going to

865
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,079
wait good 10 15 20 minutes maybe 30

866
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:02,480
minutes be patient to get your water as

867
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,960
cold nearly as cold as the ice right

868
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,159
before you take your material out of the

869
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,720
freezer and put it into the

870
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:10,159
bucket well also there's a second part

871
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:12,559
to that that you want to pay attention

872
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,639
to which is even the more important part

873
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,799
which

874
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:18,000
is first of all you want the temperature

875
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,480
to be basically you know 32 degrees

876
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,119
Fahrenheit 0 degrees CS um you want to

877
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,519
make sure that when you're putting dry

878
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,960
material in that you allow it to absorb

879
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:29,519
water and that's going to take at least

880
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,480
15 minutes because if you just start

881
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:34,880
mixing some bone dry material that goes

882
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,000
in there it'll start breaking off pieces

883
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,400
of contaminant and the the magic of

884
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,719
water hash is that everything floats in

885
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,838
the water while the resin glands which

886
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:46,039
are still affected by gravity uh due to

887
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:48,599
their density they sink in the water and

888
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:51,400
that's why the whole process works um if

889
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:55,079
you break the material up too small and

890
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,960
it loses its surface area size there's a

891
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,880
a threshold where small particulate will

892
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,519
will will sink yes see I'm bringing them

893
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,400
I'm bringing you down to the really the

894
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,519
really silly small granular stuff yeah

895
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,480
and that that was the next thing I was

896
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,920
going to say is after patience for

897
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,519
allowing the water to get cold then when

898
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,639
you do introduce the material to the

899
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,039
water you need patience again correct

900
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:18,960
because you have to let the material not

901
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,400
only get saturated but you want to make

902
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,800
sure the material now comes down in

903
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,720
temperature to the same temperature as

904
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,480
the water before you start

905
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:30,959
mixing yep yeah exactly and it's fun

906
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,559
it's like you can geek out on this when

907
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,838
you're at home I mean really the the the

908
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:37,318
process is fairly simple I know it's

909
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:38,880
scary especially for people that have

910
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:41,599
never done it before to just put you

911
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,079
know water and ice over their flowers or

912
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,200
their trim but um when you see what

913
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,519
comes out you'll just never look back

914
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:51,118
it's just this beautiful Sandy material

915
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:52,519
you can press it the whole Rosen world

916
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,640
we haven't even really gotten into that

917
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:57,039
but that's that's huge you know when I

918
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:59,559
first released Bubble Bags all all those

919
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:01,960
people that ask me hey how do you I get

920
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:03,119
my hash to melt like yours and you know

921
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,679
when you hear the answer it's like well

922
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,519
you have two options you can go down a

923
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,519
20-year rabbit hole and learn about the

924
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,599
symbiotic relationships of plants and

925
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,519
micro risos speres and all of the things

926
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,960
that they require when they require them

927
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:16,480
and how they require them you can learn

928
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,119
about light spectrums you can learn

929
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,358
about green houses and literally like a

930
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,000
multi-decade pathway or you could just

931
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:27,559
Jam that weed into a PVC pipe and get a

932
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,639
can of mutane and just like blast that

933
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:33,880
[ __ ] into a golden honey and it'll dab

934
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:37,358
perfectly and so unfortunately 98% of

935
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,039
people took that pathway and I was

936
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:41,639
scared for those people because a lot of

937
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:44,800
them blew up and burnt themselves and

938
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:47,239
whatnot so when I saw rosin come out I

939
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,280
saw that it was the same same like most

940
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:51,719
people's rosin is made from mediocre

941
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,480
bubble like if you get full melt bubble

942
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:54,959
there's almost no reason to press it

943
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,559
into rosin because you're going to get

944
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,159
like a 95% return or mediocre weed

945
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,799
you're pressing mediocre well that's it

946
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:04,399
you know like I don't know too many

947
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,519
people that do flower rosin anymore but

948
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,720
I know that a lot of the live hash rosin

949
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:11,079
it's very little of it is made from the

950
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:13,039
most exceptional hash and that's why the

951
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:16,200
people who have it will never have the

952
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:19,599
hash that they pressed the rosin from

953
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:22,039
and the rosin can look Triple A but if

954
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,760
you know it was pressed into rosin it

955
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:27,079
the hash probably wasn't uh I'm not

956
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,720
saying there's not anomalies but

957
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:31,720
um I just I love the fact that rosin

958
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:33,358
exists and now instead of people you

959
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:35,480
know like imagine being a young guy in

960
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,119
high school and just buying like a

961
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,559
little bag of weed and with a hair

962
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,200
straightener you could access dabs like

963
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:45,119
solventless dabs that you could just

964
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:47,199
drop into a little like that is huge man

965
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,760
it is you you can carry around a little

966
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:51,318
thing in your pocket now they actually

967
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,240
work that'll tell you the potency of the

968
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:58,599
weed you know you can bring it you know

969
00:38:54,239 --> 00:39:01,078
it's really amazing and and and and bubs

970
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:06,559
may I call you cuz we're old friends

971
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:10,640
bubs you you you um you exist at a level

972
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:13,119
of cannabis um production and

973
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:16,440
consumption that all of us I don't know

974
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,519
how to liken it to anything else um

975
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,119
without demeaning it because you know I

976
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,679
have I do have an ultimate respect for

977
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:25,640
cannabis and it's really

978
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:28,199
unlike anything else more than it's like

979
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:32,239
and what what I'm trying to say is that

980
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:37,719
uh the discussions are

981
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:41,078
um they're very heady and uh uh I I

982
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:43,239
admire how far you've taken something

983
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:45,240
that like you said you know you just you

984
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:48,279
know even before pressing and resin you

985
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:50,318
know you just what was the old uh uh you

986
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,960
know if it don't if it don't it ain't

987
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:55,400
worth the trouble if it don't bubble if

988
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,159
it don't bubble it ain't worth the

989
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,240
trouble

990
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:00,920
and that was listen that was Rob Clark

991
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:03,078
who I first ever heard that from and

992
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,559
that's literally how I met skunkman Sam

993
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:08,760
by using that logo I got to give props

994
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:10,880
to Sam because it really was Sam's sort

995
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,560
of quote that he had

996
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,599
said well it was pre the wizard that was

997
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:17,279
my guy right the bubble bag guy but so

998
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,440
when I started the Bubble Bag Company

999
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,200
because Hillary black had introduced me

1000
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:27,159
to Rob Clark I had met him in 95 at the

1001
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:28,879
Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam maybe 98 too

1002
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:30,679
but I bumped into him I don't know if

1003
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,280
you remember that Thai food restaurant

1004
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:35,480
behind uh aran's Greenhouse off the dam

1005
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,920
rack it was all like the katoy

1006
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,358
waitresses like it was all it all lady

1007
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,720
boys who were the waitress it was hard

1008
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:43,838
to forget this place because it was

1009
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:45,559
pretty trippy back then um but they

1010
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,039
allowed you to Puff they were super

1011
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:50,159
open-minded they so I remember walking

1012
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:53,039
up the stairs to get into that place and

1013
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:56,159
it was like John Conroy was there and

1014
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,759
Rob Clark had the rure and he laid me

1015
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:00,000
out out with a a hit of the most

1016
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,680
spectacular bubbly hash and he he looked

1017
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,039
me right in the eye he lit it and then

1018
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,838
he looked at me and he said if it don't

1019
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,318
bubble it ain't worth the trouble and I

1020
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,719
was just like that's stuck with me for

1021
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:11,599
the rest of the cup you know I was like

1022
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:14,239
I'll tell you you got to give Amsterdam

1023
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,400
and High Times a mad shout out because

1024
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:18,759
uh that really was the birth of of our I

1025
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,800
mean listen of course this has been

1026
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,240
going on for a thousand plus years and

1027
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,920
there's been people that have been

1028
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,719
involved in the prohibition and the

1029
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,760
fight for you know cannabis versus evil

1030
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:33,838
for a long long time but for our scene

1031
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:37,040
that whole Cannabis Cup uh you know 1989

1032

founder or a Trailblazer in our

1036
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:52,440

West Coast time I made it I mean I

1086
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,280
traveled through a blizzard in Brampton

1087
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:57,679
Ontario with two Rastafarians after

1088
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,559
landing from King Kingston Jamaica while

1089
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,919
they were driving in the blizzard to get

1090
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:05,640
me to this house so I could turn on and

1091
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,318
and make the 9:00 a.m. hash Church um

1092
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:10,679
you know host it was absolutely mental I

1093
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:13,679
don't know what was driving me to be

1094
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,358
honest um but I still do it now and then

1095
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,558
and I've got some good friends that I

1096
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,838
would like to bring forward I I forget

1097
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:21,040
about the importance of that

1098
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:23,519
conversation and then it wasn't it

1099
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,519
wasn't a business it wasn't um to

1100
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:28,599
compete with anything it was something

1101
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:31,318
that was Standalone on it on its own we

1102
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:34,640
never took sponsors we never you know we

1103
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:36,279
never monetized the the the content

1104
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,719
because I was

1105
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:42,040
afraid um that it would affect the

1106
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:44,358
Integrity of the content and so we just

1107
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:47,119
never monetized it but oh man did I turn

1108
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:48,318
down a lot of sponsorship offers for as

1109
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,838
you know even though you know we are

1110
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:51,960
obviously I'm here because of homegrown

1111
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:55,440
and I've been working with homegrown

1112
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,880
cannabis Co now for eight years eight

1113
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,960
plus years

1114
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,480
and um but uh I just think it's all

1115
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,559
about perspective and I just try to

1116
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,639
bring on people that have unique

1117
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:08,000
perspectives you know something that has

1118
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:10,400
to do with cannabis of course you know

1119
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,838
or or or our community and and then we

1120
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,318
just chitchat and uh you know um

1121
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:16,920
sometimes people have products that they

1122
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:18,440
like to talk about you know companies

1123
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,039
that they've made they're entrepreneurs

1124
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,440
and sometimes they're not um but like

1125
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:26,679
you said it's it's it's unfiltered as

1126
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,639
far as um nobody's brought on for the

1127
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:32,639
sole re for for the main reason of

1128
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:34,318
presenting a product no and I'm I'm

1129
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:36,199
coming around a lot more I mean listen

1130
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:38,880
you remember my party back in the day

1131
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:41,519
Legends of hashish that was very much

1132
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,240
the same thing I've refused to monetize

1133
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,039
it I gave away any money that we made

1134
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:47,519
from ticket sales over the cost of

1135
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:48,920
throwing the party I would give it to

1136
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,239
like the Cannabis college or the

1137
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,480
Cannabis Compassion Club and Amsterdam

1138
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:54,959
or whoever was wherever the country was

1139
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,039
we were throwing it we would donate that

1140
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,960
money away I was somehow like oh I just

1141
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,440
can't monetize this Legends was always

1142
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,920
about celebrating hash not talking

1143
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,960
business not not like you know promoting

1144
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,639
oneself or one's products and now

1145
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,440
because it's it's a different world you

1146
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,078
know back then we had Smugglers and

1147
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,119
people that were under the the radar of

1148
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,440
Johnny law that didn't want to be

1149
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,559
photographed so there was no cameras you

1150
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,440
know now

1151
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,839
Legends yeah now it's like there's

1152
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,920
multiple film Crews filming everything

1153
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:30,440
recording everything like there's drone

1154
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:33,240
shots there's you know full sponsorships

1155
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:35,519
there's the young guys you know that's

1156
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,838
that's you know you know the young guys

1157
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,599
don't need me to teach them how to grow

1158
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:41,318
anymore there's so many good Growers out

1159
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:42,920
there man and certainly I can't I can't

1160
00:46:41,318 --> 00:46:44,358
keep up on my Instagram with all the

1161
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,200
production value everybody's got

1162
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:47,480
learning how to press the buttons and

1163
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:50,639
make it look like they have all these

1164
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:53,559
videographers but it's about perspective

1165
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:57,759
and unique perspectives are still

1166
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:59,160
valuable um and uh you know so that's

1167
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,359
why we're here and I'm enjoying this

1168
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:02,719
little chat with you and you know I

1169
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:05,279
really hope that someday the last time

1171

after hours where I decided to have my

1173

1196
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:13,519
my sons my my older son who was around

1197
00:48:10,838 --> 00:48:16,599

1198
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:20,039

1199
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:23,519
there yeah I that was a great trip and

1200
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:26,199
um man I just I I keep thinking how I

1201
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:29,920
can find a way to uh to bring us

1202
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:33,639
together again for a uh a reunion who

1203
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:36,240
knows how that'll happen um it's a must

1204
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:41,318
I would enjoy that a great deal I would

1205
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:43,439
I would as well um you know uh I have a

1206
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:47,679
I have a I have a well-worded question

1207
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:50,000
here I think is worth asking it says as

1208
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:53,358
a respected figure in the Cannabis

1209
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,119
Community what industry issues or Trends

1210
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:56,119
do you feel are important for us to

1211
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,599
address

1212
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:03,318
or discuss what's on your

1213
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:05,240
mind well I guess you know right off the

1214
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:07,440
bat the industry is happening in a lot

1215
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:09,399
of different places simultaneously so I

1216
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,119
guess I could speak to both kind of

1217
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,358
Canada and the US obviously the big

1218
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,880
issue in the in the US is that it's not

1219
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:20,078
fair to Brands and companies to have to

1220
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,358
operate in every single state uh when

1221
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,880
with the amount of states that are

1222
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:26,400
allowing cannabis now at this point

1223
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:30,079
federal law should pretty much kick in

1224
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,720
so that uh you know the US can

1225
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:35,079
can export their product around the

1226
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,879
world potentially I would love to see

1227
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:39,960
the US Hopscotch right to the top of the

1228
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,680
game again by literally allowing the

1229
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,559
importation of hash from other countries

1230
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:46,558
and flower from other countries to bring

1231
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,559
that sort of old school Vibe back but

1232
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,720
also to create their own Federal you

1233
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,760
know but not overregulation like the

1234
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:56,318
Canadian one but created something where

1235
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,480
it's like you know kind of of between

1236
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:00,159
where we're at and where we came from

1237
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,000
because I know a lot of people think

1238
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,838
it's the old days were the dream days

1239
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,159
but that was monetizing Prohibition the

1240
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:08,920
the money was based on people doing jail

1241
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:10,679
time and there's a karmic debt that

1242
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,039
comes with that and that's why you

1243
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:16,399
always saw these amazing like just kind

1244
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:18,880
beautiful families Growers like just

1245
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,838
awesome people getting robbed and then

1246
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,519
getting busted and then getting just

1247
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:24,519
like one thing after another there's

1248
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,000
always this sort of karmic debt what do

1249
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:28,759
you think about selling

1250
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,798
what do you think about um you know the

1251
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,040
uh the Psychedelic Community more

1252
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:35,358
specific like the the psilocybin the

1253
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,519
musroom mushroom Community is trying to

1254
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:40,719
approach it um where uh they've learned

1255
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:44,838
from Cannabis and you know they don't

1256
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:47,239
want uh uh decriminalization or or

1257
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:49,679
anything like that I mean do do you see

1258
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:52,679
anything positive in in that do you have

1259
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:55,199
any uh reach or friends in that

1260
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:58,399
Community oh absolutely I was just with

1261
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,159
actually Dennis McKenna uh in uh

1262
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,599
Vancouver I was with my youngest son and

1263
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:06,639
I bumped into Dennis at um this mushroom

1264
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:09,880
event I think it was like the 43rd

1265
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:12,000
annual van duen mushroom uh event which

1266
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,640
was just spectacular and they did he

1267
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,760
they did a whole talk on psychedelic

1268
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:20,318
mushrooms and so at the core at least of

1269
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:22,799
the psychedelic mushroom Community it's

1270
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:24,358
um it's always been an incredible core

1271
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:26,280
of people and I've been going to those

1272
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:28,119
sort of psychedelic Gatherings for 20

1273
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,680
plus years where you could go and meet

1274
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:33,400
you know Ralph mner and Jonathan a and

1275
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:35,000
Paul stamitz and and Terren and sort of

1276
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,798
all of these guys that were writing

1277
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,760
these books about these these compounds

1278
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:42,079
back in the day that's sort of my

1279
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,440
psychedelic Community you know now

1280
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:47,519
there's a newer group that will expand I

1281
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,960
always do welcome the newer group and

1282
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,639
focus on the good of that but also

1283
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,318
realize that there will be some wolves

1284
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:56,318
and sheep's clothing uh that make their

1285
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:57,960
way into the psych delc Community as

1286
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,239
they always have you know even if you

1287
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,838
look at rainbow gatherings uh there's

1288
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:04,679
always been these sort of small percent

1289
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:06,719
seeing as you you you you are kind of

1290
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:09,199
plugged in you know to the that kind of

1291
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:12,078
do you think that there is any chance

1292
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:16,279
you know specifically in the states here

1293
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:20,640
that there'll be a

1294
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:23,000
um uh a recollection of the experiences

1295
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:25,318
and the the actual relative danger as

1296
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,880
opposed to the benefits and that

1297
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:29,480
legalization will look more like you

1298
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,880
know it should or is it going to get

1299
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,240
wound up

1300
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,240
in something red Bure bureaucratic do is

1301
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:36,959
there a chance that they're going to

1302
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:39,959
find a different

1303
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,519
route I mean I surely hope so I always

1304
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,119
have faith you know keep in mind it's

1305
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:45,199
always the people [ __ ] this [ __ ] up

1306
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:48,280
not the plant medicines themselves

1307
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:50,439
they're good to go um it's the people

1308
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,880
who think that they know what's best if

1309
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:55,720
we just listen to these plants and you

1310
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,318
know I I'm not for instance I'm not

1311
00:52:55,719 --> 00:53:00,639
against there being some

1312
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:03,079
regulations for producing a medicine

1313
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:05,679
like cannabis I I think it's fine to

1314
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:06,920
have regulations now don't make them

1315
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:09,798
insane and

1316
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,920
impossible but definitely like have

1317
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:14,159
levels that you won't accept for heavy

1318
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,559
metals and pesticides and anything like

1319
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:19,838
that molds yeast mildew like these are

1320
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:22,040
important things to know what the what

1321
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,838
the potency of the product is can't sell

1322
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:25,679
to Children can't have a dispensary on

1323
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:26,798
the corner behind a school

1324
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:29,279
blah blah

1325
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:30,880
blah yeah I mean there's some crazy ones

1326
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,519
in Canada where you couldn't even see

1327
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,480
inside they made you cover up the

1328
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:35,838
windows which made it very dangerous for

1329
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,480
the people who work there for people

1330
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,440
that would want to go in and Rob the

1331
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,519
place because you could just go in lock

1332
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,960
the door and then be like Rob the place

1333
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,358
and no one from outside could see you

1334
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,679
that was just Chang you made me think of

1335
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:50,639
something do you think that uh uh do you

1336
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:53,838
think it would make a big difference if

1337
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:58,039
the Le the people are trying to legalize

1338
00:53:53,838 --> 00:54:01,838
mushrooms for personal use if we simply

1339
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:05,838
separated any type of commercial

1340
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:07,719
activity from first just legalizing it

1341
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,798
for personal use without any

1342
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:12,439
restrictions in other words you hurt

1343
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:14,079
somebody you you then you there are laws

1344
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,318
if you hurt somebody generally you're

1345
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,880
allowed to hurt yourself if you're at

1346
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:18,239
home and you chop your finger off you

1347
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,039
don't get charged with mutilating

1348
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,078
another person you did it by accident

1349
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:23,318
you chopped your finger off so you know

1350
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,079
what I'm

1351
00:54:23,318 --> 00:54:27,358
saying I mean do you think that we'll

1352
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,000
that that would be a good idea to just

1353
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:31,759
simply try to legalize without the idea

1354
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,639
of giving anybody the right listen in a

1355
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,119
sense it is so that's where mushrooms

1356
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:38,199
are at least here they're you know it's

1357
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:41,318
only in once you dry them that it

1358
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:42,919
somehow becomes an issue and I wouldn't

1359
00:54:41,318 --> 00:54:45,480
say there's a police force in British

1360
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:47,280
Columbia actively enforcing is that your

1361
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,039
distinction that you've come up

1362
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,880
with no no here in Canada they're

1363
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:54,000
they're they're they're illegal once

1364
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,720
they're dried and I guess it's because

1365
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,960
when they're fresh

1366
00:54:55,719 --> 00:55:01,279
they're so diluted of their drug

1367
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,960
compound that it's it's just I don't

1368
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,640
know what the numbers are but it might

1369
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,920
even be that way in some of the states I

1370
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,960
don't know but it's definitely that way

1371
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,798
I I understand it it's pretty silly but

1372
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,280
it's kind of like I pick them every year

1373
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:15,159
I I picked a bunch of psilocybin

1374
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,798
mushrooms this year cyan essin and aly's

1375
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:19,598
and maybe some stunes I think the big

1376
00:55:17,798 --> 00:55:21,719
ones out here in La which are like

1377
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:26,280
replacing all the housewives uh

1378
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:29,959
anti-depressants are uh albino Avery

1379
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:32,039
yeah so those are potent staria cubensis

1380
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,119
cultivar and everybody's doing them in

1381
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:36,480
gummies and micro doing and I do I do

1382
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:38,039
now and then you know I even I I I tried

1383
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,000
to find out if it would be a good thing

1384
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:42,039
for me to do on a

1385
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,159
regular

1386
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:49,440
and I you know without uh stereotyping

1387
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:53,639
it or without even putting in a negative

1388
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:57,200
I just I couldn't find a regular dose

1389
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:59,000
from me that was helpful there was

1390
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:01,078
always some kind of a cown so it's a

1391
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,719
regular it's it's an irregular use thing

1392
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:06,599
for me how much where you're like

1393
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,318
because generally a micro do of cocy and

1394
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:11,440
you shouldn't even feel it it's so

1395
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:13,000
subtle sure sure but uh what I found was

1396
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:17,240
that after you

1397
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,880
know if I even got up to 150 mics that

1398
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:20,798
at the end of that day it was still

1399
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,880
there was still some kind of a cown and

1400
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:25,960
that's my own physiology and so yeah you

1401
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:30,280
were feeling it I couldn't find a

1402
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:31,599
neutrality where I only got that you

1403
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,839
know where you take it you forget you

1404
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,079
took it and three four hours later you

1405
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:37,558
that's why I had such a good time that's

1406
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,079
what it was that's a great thing that I

1407
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:40,519
would love to be able to do and take

1408
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:42,839
every day really depends on your

1409
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:45,159
definition of the micro do because there

1410
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:47,358
there are definitely different def

1411
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:48,679
definitions of micro do and some people

1412
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:50,719
they'll be like oh I take like a third

1413
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:53,519
of a gram or a half a gram I'm like whoa

1414
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:56,239
that's like really like to like what I

1415
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:58,280
talk about as a micro do is an is a true

1416
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:00,519
micro do it's such a small amount

1417
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:02,160
there's no psychedelic effect to it it

1418
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:06,038
doesn't affect like your appetite or

1419
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:09,000
your it's just this super super slight

1420
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:11,640
nudging of your overall being and how

1421
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,199
you feel and it's very subtle uh that's

1422
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:18,358
how I like it myself which is very very

1423
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:20,358
very small amounts um I don't have a way

1424
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:22,239
to test my psilocybin so I don't know

1425
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:25,400
exactly what I'm taking but I know with

1426
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:27,519
the dry mushroom that if I eat like a

1427
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,680
stem and they're very thin stems a

1428
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:33,358
little thicker than semin catas these

1429
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:35,838
are the wavy caps the cyan Essence um

1430
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:38,239
one small little stem is a perfect micro

1431
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:40,558
do where maybe I might feel something

1432
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:43,038
for five minutes like a little bit like

1433
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,480
oh I feel like I took a dab or something

1434
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:45,960
uh but it'll just dissipate in five

1435
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,119
minutes I like to keep it below the

1436
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:51,159
threshold of feeling it and then I can

1437
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:55,480
do it every day and after like 20 or 30

1438
00:57:51,159 --> 00:57:57,679
days of that it's uh it's a it builds up

1439
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,199
the effects of how good you

1440
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:01,318
feel

1441
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:04,199
interesting interesting I'm so glad we

1442
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:07,079
got into that it's a crushing depression

1443
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:09,399
actually it's an important um thing

1444
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:11,640
nowadays for just people to have options

1445
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:14,280
other than going to the to the doctor of

1446
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:17,480
course yeah man absolutely and

1447
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:20,480
particularly the psychiatric and mental

1448
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:22,639
health problems those types of medicines

1449
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,400
are you know ssris and whatnot they're

1450
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:27,239
fairly harsh so to at least have

1451
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,039
something else on the table I'm not

1452
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:30,719
saying that every single person

1453
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,599
shouldn't take those drugs because maybe

1454
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:34,598
some people get helped by them but

1455
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:37,359
there's a lot of people that don't and

1456
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:41,200
when you take a drug for depression or

1457
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:43,798
suicidal ideations and the top um side

1458
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:46,399
effect is may cause suicidal

1459
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:48,358
ideation that does not line up to me

1460
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,960
that's insane no and they and they they

1461
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,759
can get away with saying it right on the

1462
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,519
television you listen you're not paying

1463
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,400
attention the TV's running in the

1464
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:59,318
background and you hear may cause

1465
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,599
death I know what the [ __ ] kind of side

1466
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:03,358
effect is that that's a seriously har

1467
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,119
side effect actually because but because

1468
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:09,279
they LIF listed it it they're no longer

1469
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:11,318
liable and America runs on liability so

1470
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:14,680
that's all you got to worry about God

1471
00:59:11,318 --> 00:59:18,838
Bless America God Bless America we love

1472
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:21,719
it here you know so uh other than us uh

1473
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:23,798
getting together we talked about the the

1474
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:25,639
bubble has and we talked about how we

1475
00:59:23,798 --> 00:59:29,639
met and we talked about how much we want

1476
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:31,798
to see each other again and uh we gave

1477
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:35,118
respect to the old days of high times

1478
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:37,519
and I think before we before we signed

1479
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:41,119
on we we gave a little respect to some

1480
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:43,079
of our missing soldiers you know we miss

1481
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,079

1482
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:49,960

1485
00:59:53,880 --> 01:00:00,240
people you know that uh were taken from

1486
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:01,798
us and but we remember them and we smoke

1487
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:03,838
in their honor and we mention their

1488
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:05,960
names often and we we we recite the

1489
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:10,000
stories and the things that they taught

1490
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:14,119
us and um that's what it is being a uh

1491
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:18,199
an OG an Oldtimer old school

1492
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:20,160
industry an old school C uh culture type

1493
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:21,480
person you know it was like like you

1494
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:23,798
said you know sure there's plenty of

1495
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:26,240
people that came before us we didn't

1496
01:00:23,798 --> 01:00:29,480
invent cannabis culture but boy was it

1497
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:31,798
rocking when we when we were early and

1498
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,559
High Times was still an icon of America

1499
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:37,199
and every stoner in the world bought it

1500
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:40,599
or or stole it off the news

1501
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:44,399
rack back when the Dutch were still

1502
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:48,119
open-minded right before they went

1503
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:50,280
right-wing holy [ __ ] just like closing

1504
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:51,599
down the red light trying to shut down

1505
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,559
like making you know the Dutch

1506
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,119
experiment where it's like 10 coffee

1507
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:58,160
shops and 10 companies that will

1508
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:00,720
represent and produce all the flour and

1509
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:03,480
the hash for each of those C coffee

1510
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:06,159
shops it's uh they want to lose the

1511
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,400
value which is the importation right and

1512
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:09,798
I get it they want that that coin for

1513
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,000
themselves but if they were smart they

1514
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:15,159
would go to those countries and say look

1515
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,358
we pretty much [ __ ] your country over

1516
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:18,879
uh for a long time especially back in

1517
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:20,960
the day because the Dutch were the the

1518
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,079
original Sailors they taught the

1519
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,798
Russians how to sail and Russia damn

1520
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:27,920
near took over the world so like the

1521
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:32,199
Dutch they were out there sailing before

1522
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:33,599
many and they um yeah they they they

1523
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:36,078
could go to these countries and make

1524
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:38,000
deals where if they legalized it you

1525
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,079
could import it into it would just be a

1526
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,400
special thing when you don't try to

1527
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,480
control it and you still in my opinion

1528
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,798
the perfect world will be when cannabis

1529
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:50,599
is legal everywhere but I can get

1530
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:52,519
Lebanese hash or California OG kush or

1531
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:54,599
you know whatever you you need to be

1532
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:56,838
able to get it from that spot where

1533
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:58,960
Monsanto Lebanese

1534
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:01,199

1539
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:11,798

people don't have a pallet for

01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:23,798
culture but it's important for people to

1544
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:26,400
get together and just pay a little

1545
