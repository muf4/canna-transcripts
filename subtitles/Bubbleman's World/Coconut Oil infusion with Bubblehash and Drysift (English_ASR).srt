00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,720
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,439
today we're going to do a coconut oil

4
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:31,000
extraction I had planned on using um the

5
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,439
Cannabis leftovers from my wet washing

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,439
which I still plan on doing um but what

7
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,599
I'm going to do today is we're going to

8
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:42,599
run um a couple of grams of some

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,439
beautiful Barbara dry sift and a couple

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,439
of grams of some full melt OG cush

11
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,439
bubble hash uh so I've basically pulled

12
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,640
off the recipe from one of the websites

13
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,000
it's real simple we've got our crockpot

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,039
we've got our two cups of water we've

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,558
got our organic coconut

16
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,558
oil we have our hash

17
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,679
a spoon and one cup to measure out the

18
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:10,679
coconut oil so basically um what it's

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,960
saying we want to do is um put a put a a

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,000
cup of coconut oil into the crock pot so

21
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,919
that's the

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,280
start and I guess we'll turn it on low

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,560
once we do that just move this over

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:28,359
here all right so lift up the [ __ ]

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,359
prop crock poot

26
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:33,078
lid get some of this yummy coconut oil

27
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,359
out oh look at that it went right into

28
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:37,399
where it needs to go

29
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:41,560
bonus because that would have been a bit

30
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:44,040
messy this is a little bit melted not

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,040
completely uh as solid as I've seen it

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,880
get so it's probably not going to take

33
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,600
too long

34
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:54,438
to to melt in the crock pot and so

35
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,839
because coconut is such a great fat uh

36
00:01:54,438 --> 00:02:00,199
100% almost fat um what it does is it

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,920
does an incredible efficient job job

38
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,840
it's literally like the efficiency of

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,159
water extraction for pulling out resin

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,360
with water and ice this is the

41
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,480
equivalent with the coconut and it's my

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,840
preferred oil to work with I find it to

43
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,598
be the healthier of most uh it's one

44
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,640
that doesn't get affected too negatively

45
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:20,518
once you when you heat it up and just

46
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,639
generally coconut oil is awesome who

47
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,560
doesn't love coconut oil so we'll get

48
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,559
that into the crock

49
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,959
pot

50
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,840
[Music]

51
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,560
I had a tiny little bit of extra in

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,080
there so it would uh the little bit I

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:46,199
lost in the cup

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,200
piece will be um not too

55
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,480
detrimental coconut oil got to love it

56
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,120
so we get that on the in the crock

57
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,919
pot we turn the crock poot

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,080
on this is an old crock poot I borrowed

59
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,639
from a friend of mine it's probably from

60
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,840
the 70s which is also kind of

61
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:09,919
cool um so yeah we're going to uh we

62
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,280
turn that on low actually why turn it on

63
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,479
high when you can turn it on low so

64
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,799
that's important and they're asking to

65
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,318
use dried uh

66
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,120
material um plant matter I'm personally

67
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:23,318
using bubble and sift so we'll put that

68
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,239
in direct after that um once the um

69
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:27,280
coconut oil has melted we're going to

70
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,000
put the resin into the coconut oil mix

71
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,759
it up a little bit get it get it

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,239
somewhat melted and

73
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:38,759
then then they want us to add many cups

74
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,280
of AR water so yeah 5 to six cups of

75
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,719
water and like I said you don't have to

76
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,400
worry about the water um not all boiling

77
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,400
out because what's going to happen is

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,519
that water when we freeze this whole

79
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,000
thing at the end the oil and the water

80
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
separate and usually you can just

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,759
puncture a hole through the top and drip

82
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,120
out the water so we're going to show all

83
00:03:54,759 --> 00:04:00,318
this whole process so we've got our

84
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,400
coconut oil on

85
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:07,919
low simmering away

86
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:10,000
here and uh yeah I guess what I'll do is

87
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,238
I'll come back once the coconut oil is

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,639
liquefied and we will put in the hash

89
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,959
we'll watch that melt and and dissipate

90
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,039
and then we will add our water and at

91
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,199
that point it's just a matter of

92
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,800
flicking it on to high closing the lid

93
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,919
and pretty much leaving it for about 6

94
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,199
hours so I hope this uh is going to

95
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,959
teach you guys something that you didn't

96
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,560
know before and uh we'll get back to it

97
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:33,560
pretty soon here see you in a

98
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,120
bit all right the coconut oil has

99
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,879
liquefied there's one little bump left

100
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,879
we'll wait for

101
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:51,529
that there's our Barber dry sift and our

102
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,579
bubble

103
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:54,579
[Music]

104
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
hash

105
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,000
all right welcome back guys we've got

106
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:09,719
our coconut oil turned into a nice

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,759
liquid on the crock pot on low took

108
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,680
about 40 minutes um and now we're going

109
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,680
to I thought about how I was going to do

110
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,079
this um you know a lot of the recipes

111
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,639
call for cheesecloth a lot of the

112
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,079
recipes are using plant matter cannabis

113
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,079
leaf stock trim Etc um I'm using

114
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,079
Straight hash I called my good buddy

115
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,800
d420 K who's already done a little bit

116
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,198
of this with herb as well sift and he

117
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,720
said the sift just melted so beautifully

118
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,520
as he dropped it into the crock pot I'm

119
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,199
hoping I can get a similar uh effect

120
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,240
with uh the hash that I've got here

121
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,800
breaking up the bubble uh a little bit

122
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,160
smaller it's in kind of turd size pieces

123
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,879
right now like a a a mouse turd type of

124
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,960
thing just trying to break it up a

125
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,038
little bit nicer it is melty and it

126
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,038
should literally you know there's very

127
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:58,478
little to any plant matter whatsoever in

128
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,199
this hash uh it's just pretty much

129
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,159
glandular heads

130
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,960
so I think it's going to melt quite

131
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,840
nicely in the

132
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,879
oil and that's what the filters are for

133
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,638
if not I've got a 25 micron uh bubble

134
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:15,918
bag that I'll be filtering all of this

135
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,478
through to capture any wax membranes or

136
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,598
small amounts of plant matter that

137
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:25,159
somehow make it into the material and

138
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:25,159
we'll filter that out so for

139
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,959
now I

140
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:34,800
guess the recipe says to add the um

141
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:37,799
plant matter first add it up in there

142
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,400
and then pour the water in so that's

143
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,400
what we're going to

144
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,639
do all right

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,800
so show you guys this with the camera if

146
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,800
you

147
00:06:53,918 --> 00:07:00,359
like okay so I'm going to take this

148
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:03,120
hash we're going to put it in here here

149
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,000
into this beautiful crock pot with

150
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,000
coconut oil so we'll start with the

151
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,120
sift all right so there's the

152
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,199
sift and now we will throw the rest in I

153
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,199
got my pressing screen

154
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,360
here little piece of bubbl stuck there

155
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,598
little bit of sift on

156
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,639
there a little there we go and there is

157
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:42,560
our product inside the

158
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,759
oil so I guess we could stir that around

159
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,560
a little

160
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,800
bit I'll get a spoon and I'll stir that

161
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,399
around a little bit and then um we will

162
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,800
add the water and we will steep for

163
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:59,758
about o I want to

164
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,840
say 6 to 8 hours that's this is going to

165
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,000
be going for so I'm going to go get a

166
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:08,079
spoon give this a little bit of a mix um

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,759
we'll add our water in r o or distilled

168
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,359
water and we'll let this steep for the

169
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,720
next 6 to 8 hours and we'll see what

170
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,720
we've got going on okay see you in a

171
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,960
bit all

172
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,519
right

173
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:38,120
so four G of hash really really clean

174
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,120
hash like pure as pure can

175
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:42,838
be in the crock

176
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:55,239
pot and we'll turn that on to

177
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,240
high and we will also add our

178
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
water

179
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:12,759
[Music]

180
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:15,000
okay all right so we've got our water

181
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:18,159
we've got our coconut oil melted down

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,480
we've got our sift and bubble um melting

183
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,639
into the coconut oil we've added that

184
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,399
couple of cups of water um you can use

185
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,480
four to five cups of water depending on

186
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,240
how long you're going to be steeping for

187
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,159
uh I've put in a couple for now and we

188
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,799
we will probably put in a couple of more

189
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,000
Let It steep for 6 to 8 hours we're

190
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:37,559
going to open this up and we're going to

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,399
show you what we got so stay tuned hey

192
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,159
guys so the crock pot's just been

193
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,958
simmering for a couple of hours now I

194
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,199
haven't opened it yet uh I'm going to

195
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,479
open it and give it a little bit of a

196
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,519
stir just for the sedentary uh bubble

197
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,839
hash and sift that's still sitting there

198
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,440
um if you're using cannabis uh it's good

199
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,440
to definitely stir once every hour or so

200
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,760
but you don't have to to each their own

201
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm not saying one way is better than

202
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,559
the other this is the first time I've

203
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,959
ever done it so I'm just going to lift

204
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:07,278
this up

205
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,278
gently give that coconut oil a

206
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,720
stir oh

207
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:14,039
yeah that felt right a lot of the

208
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,160
material that was in there just

209
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,159
dissolved right away so I'm going to let

210
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,519
this steep for a couple more hours we'll

211
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,120
come back and stir it and after that I

212
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,959
believe we're going to freeze it up in

213
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,560
the fridge cool it off takes a few hours

214
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,559
as well and we'll uh po poke a hole

215
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,319
through the top

216
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:35,000
filter out the water and we'll see what

217
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:38,320
we're left with okay okay welcome back

218
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,240
guys we have uh reached the 4-Hour point

219
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,040
and it was it was going pretty good it

220
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,399
was actually seemingly boiling and uh I

221
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:47,399
just started doing that hopefully I

222
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:51,159
didn't take it too long but uh I'm now

223
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:55,159
going to filter through a a a bubble bag

224
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:59,319
light 25 micron bag into a glass Pyrex

225
00:10:55,159 --> 00:11:00,480
dish we'll just gently pour this

226
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,959
extremely

227
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,959
hot coconut

228
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,040
oil into the

229
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,720
bag all

230
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:17,319
right just filter that

231
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,320
out through that

232
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,600
screen and see how it just comes out

233
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,179
it's extremely hot

234
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,360
still very

235
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:29,759
[Music]

236
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,440
warm but with the helm of this I should

237
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:36,078
be able to squeeze it all right

238
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,040
out very glad to have this bag helping

239
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:42,159
me with this

240
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:46,120
job this is very hot coconut oil and

241
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,120
water the two are mixed

242
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,759
together

243
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,319
okay

244
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,278
another way which I do with when I'm

245
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,320
making bubble is you can fill the bag up

246
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:11,399
with air from the

247
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,040
top and slide your hand

248
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:17,078
down use the air to

249
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:20,639
force the material

250
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:23,120
out it's not water hash so you can be a

251
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,039
little bit more rough with it not too

252
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,759
worried about the squeezing aspect just

253
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,120
be careful you don't touch the oil cuz

254
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,679
at this point it's still very warm I

255
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,799
didn't want to let it congeal and turn

256
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:37,278
into a hardened material cuz that would

257
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,679
make it really hard to go through the

258
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:45,000
screen all right

259
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:45,000
so pretty much there on that little bit

260
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,519
left little hair keep that out let's see

261
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,240
what we got in there yeah that's just

262
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,120
the bubble that's left in there with a

263
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,839
little bit of

264
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,839
oil have to wash that

265
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
out

266
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,639
okay one last good squeeze and we'll

267
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,639
call it a

268
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:18,399
day all right so I'm throw that back

269
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,240
into the crock pot um this we now let

270
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,240
cool and I believe it's going to be a

271
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,399
solid uh couple of hours that we'll be

272
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,360
putting it in the refrigerator for and

273
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,799
the water that's still left over here

274
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,480
will separate from the coconut oil the

275
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,120
the oil will be on top the water will be

276
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,199
on the bottom and uh we'll show that on

277
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,120
film what we do with that when it's done

278
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:40,799
looks

279
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,000
good thanks for

280
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:47,958
watching safely tucked away in the

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,958
fridge cover for any

282
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:59,440
contaminants I'll give you the proper

283
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,800
light

284
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,600
there we go right

285
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,599
there it's the proper

286
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:12,039
color all right so there's the coconut

287
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,199
oil starting to solidify on

288
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:17,159
top and you've got

289
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:20,559
the

290
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,559
water on the

291
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,079
bottom all right guys we're back um it's

292
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,839
a little bit later tonight it's been

293
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,638
about 8 hours of sitting in the fridge

294
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,800
and the coconut oil has hardened you can

295
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,278
see on the top layer there that's

296
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:41,799
coconut oil and on the bottom is the

297
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:45,600
water so simply put we're going to put a

298
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:45,599
hole in the Coconut

299
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:54,198
layer cut a little bit

300
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,198
out and we'll pour this water

301
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,359
out

302
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,479
oo release the little faster than I

303
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,919
expected but it's okay it wasn't a

304
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,399
nightmare the coconut oil released with

305
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:12,078
all the water almost slid right in so

306
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:15,240
now we're going to slide the coconut oil

307
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:19,559
out and onto a paper

308
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,560
towel um if you've used uh cannabis

309
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,000
material uh you'll have some plant

310
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,638
matter stuck in the bottom mine as clean

311
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,399
as can

312
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:34,079
be there it is you L clean cup of

313
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,879
coconut oil and you can just lightly

314
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,479
dampen the paper towel and this will

315
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:41,519
absorb the water from below we're left

316
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,800
with quite an interesting color

317
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,679
water I'll have to give that a shot a

318
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:50,479
little bit later on and I'll be melting

319
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:53,278
this back down and getting it into my

320
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,199
containers so I'll get back to you and

321
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,078
show you the final product in the

322
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,078
containers with a nice view in the

323
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:02,159
background and uh hope hopefully you've

324
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:05,838
learned something from this coconut oil

325
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:08,919
infused extraction concentrate thanks

picture of it um I took that piece and I

332
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,838
broke it down and I put it into a

333
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,680
smaller

334
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,920
container and um it didn't quite look as

335
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,239
nice cuz it was all just broken bits and

336
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,559
pieces so what I did is I actually set

337
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,600
it on top of my amp for my stereo and it

338
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:48,879
just it just heated it up just perfectly

339
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,440
enough to melt it down and create a nice

340
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,600
even

341
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,920
flow of

342
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:59,240
coconut isn't that

343
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:01,278
nice nice nice access right there

344
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,359
beautiful color that I got out of it

345
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,798
because I didn't use the um the green

346
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,838
plant matter although a lot of you have

347
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:11,160
asked me why the water so I want to add

348
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:12,838
the water has a few uses um it's very

349
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,360
helpful if you are using plant matter

350
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:17,000
green material um the water ax is a bit

351
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,639
of a filter for the chlorophyll and

352
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,838
keeps some of it from going into your

353
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,160
final product but what it also does is

354
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:25,958
it cools the batch down and it allows

355
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,120
for a slow steep without boiling over

356
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,519
those canabo so the water is definitely

357
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,079
key you don't have to use it if you

358
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,679
don't want to but I'm calling it key and

359
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,199
I'm definitely using it if you want to

360
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,679
get a product like what I got here and

361
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,440
you can sell see my color isn't too too

362
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,679
far off I've got a bit of a golden

363
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,480
almost a yellow color compared to the

364
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,240
white that is the coconut so not too bad

365
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,000
at all definitely didn't get the green

366
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,679
tinge that many have have gotten I'm

367
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
really happy I took uh a tiny little bit

368
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,600
last night and slept like a baby um

369
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,240
depending on how strong you make it I

370
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:03,119
would suggest if this is new to you that

371
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,159
you try very small amounts um just a

372
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,399
little finger tip you know just a a

373
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,600
little the tip of a knife type of thing

374
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,240
and sort of build up your um your

375
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,359
tolerance I guess you don't want to

376
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,000
be uh getting too high taking too much

377
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,558
at a time the the the real point of this

378
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,319
I mean if it is for you to get get

379
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,798
really high then you can eat a lot of it

380
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,000
but the real point for me and for

381
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,879
sharing this with you today is to get on

382
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,679
feeding your endoc canabo system daily

383
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,640
feeding it a little bit at a time not

384
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:36,360
destroying yourself not being so you

385
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,559
can't um do your daily day-to-day uh

386
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:39,959
things the important things that you

387
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:42,678
need to do your work and whatnot but at

388
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,558
the same time feeding that endoc canabo

389
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,840
system bringing those levels up and and

390
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,038
removing any uh ECS deficiency that

391
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,918
could be going on in your body so thanks

392
