haven't made a video in a couple of days

6
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:18,278
because I was blessed with the birth of

7
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:20,640
my second son I'm very very very uh

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:25,719

to sort of let you guys know why I

14
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:39,959

38
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,599
son I don't often share these things I

39
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,319
do have two two other kids I've kept

40
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,839
them quite private out of uh the social

41
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,599
media

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,878
Limelight I just thought it would be

43
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,159
nice because I shared one photo on my

44
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:14,759
Facebook page about him I figured I

45
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,560
would also do a little YouTube video to

46
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,639
let you guys know my YouTube fam that

47
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,280
are out there that uh you know not the

48
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,878
haters or the critics or the negative

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,159
commenters but the people that seem to

50
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,039
really enjoy the show the reason I

51
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,079
haven't made an episode is is a very

52
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:33,759
valid reason and uh jeez I don't know

53
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,719
what's to do now puff more have one more

54
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,759
puff let's have another puff Astro Boy

55
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,598
was absolutely spectacular maybe I'll

56
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,799
hit some of this seven years in the Cure

57
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:46,598
right there seven years in the Cure just

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,280
found this the other day little older

59
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:52,439
than my 6 and A2 which I have right

60
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,800
here and quite different in how this

61
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,800
one's

62
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,680
stabilized that's the sound of me

63
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:01,878
smacking up up against the side of my

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,640
Keef box and this one here just stayed

65
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:05,639
pure grease its entire

66
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:15,479
life really really greasy uh you can

67
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,480
take a little piece of this and

68
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:23,199
just kind of Squish it up pretty good

69
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,919
it's greasy so it leaves the tiniest

70
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,798
little

71
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:31,119
film once you get all the hash off your

72
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,760
thumb you get this kind of little clear

73
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,840
film so I think we'll dab up one of

74
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:40,158
those dab up a little I'm going to

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,598
