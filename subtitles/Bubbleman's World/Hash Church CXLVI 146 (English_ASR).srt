what and where they're getting their

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,290

yeah-yo hippie so that goes back to

144
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:40,610
Morgantown West Virginia back in the

145
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:44,489
early 90s folks yeah yeah yeah they

146
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,080
brought culture there was a place called

147
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,030
the Underground Railroad which was

148
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,800
basically if you ever look on the old

149
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:51,748
Black Flag album who's got the ten and a

150
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,400
half at ten and a half inches is

151
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:55,409
Morgantown West Virginia because Marcia

152
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:56,370
who used to run the old Underground

153
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,248
Railroad

154
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,300
he used to hook all the artists up when

155
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:02,639
they would come through because she paid

156
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,468
them you know back in the early late 80s

157
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,430
early 90s nobody was paying for [ __ ] but

158
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:09,538
she paid and so a lot of people came and

159
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,788
unfortunately she disappeared to do

160
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:13,498
whatever actually happened a bad coke

161
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:15,449
deal we don't really know but she's

162
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:18,389
never been found but that's right yeah

163
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:21,270
he Underground Railroad set quiet quite

164
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:23,158
dormant for a while and then you guys

165
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:25,318
came in and picked up the reins and

166
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:27,000
really really restarted the fire there

167
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:34,740
and Morgantown so thanks for kicking in

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:37,408
the culture we appreciate it yeah the

169
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,930
tradition continues and yeah they end up

170
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:41,819
buying up the machine shop and made that

171
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,918
not part of the one two three so now

172
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,570
it's a rather large venue it was pretty

173
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,269
large as it was before when you guys had

174
00:08:45,570 --> 00:09:02,160
it but yeah good to see you still there

175
00:08:48,269 --> 00:09:04,289
good just you know worlds collide right

176
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,750
here we are now in California and you

177
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:08,689
know you're providing that the good

178
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,708
information because as we know good grow

179
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,380
information was hard to find especially

180
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:15,359
back in the day you know I told people I

181
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,309
used to have to go to when I first

182
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,829
started growing back in the late 80s

183
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:22,500
there in West Virginia I had to go to

184
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:25,649
Ohio to actually I grow equipment out of

185
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,539
fear because one yeah yeah I had to go

186
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,339
to Columbus and we even parked like two

187
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:31,259
or three blocks away out of fear you

188
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,269
know that's how heavy the the green

189
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:35,669
merchant fear was back then and then we

190
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:38,100
would yeah I remember my friend Nathan I

191
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:39,569
we had to you know I'd look around as we

192
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,070
would try not to leave we had to look

193
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,649
all paranoid walking out of there with

194
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,269
just a little 400 water that we ended up

195
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,549
putting in a closet and growing through

196
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:49,500
the closet but you know it was

197
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:51,750
yeah the heavy fear back then and you

198
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,860
couldn't ask anybody for information you

199
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,589
know the best you could come up with

200
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,009
those uh Tomatoes right you know and

201
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:58,420
even since then you know

202
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:00,759
depending on who you talk to you they

203
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:03,219
look at you funny about your tomato so

204
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:06,610
how bigger your Tomatoes and where are

205
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,740
they in season and you know just there

206
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,830
was brutal questions you know everybody

207
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,330
remember this right right do we ever you

208
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,940
know I didn't grow up in West Virginia

209
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,840
but Winnipeg Manitoba is definitely in

210
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,420
the Bible Belt

211
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,820
it was definitely harsh and if you can

212
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:23,740
imagine when I was 17 years old I went

213
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,530
to the local hydroponics store and I met

214
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,389
my mentor Ron Hickey and this guy he's

215
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,009
talking to a 17 year old first of all

216
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:33,129
imagine this and he takes me to his

217
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:35,740
basement he says look you you and I both

218
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:37,299
know we're not talking about tomatoes so

219
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,690
why don't we just talk about what we're

220
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:43,240
talking about we're talking about we

221
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:45,010
talking about ganja and he just was

222
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,590
basically like from that every single

223
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:49,659
day forward that I knew him he paid the

224
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:52,420
price with 11 years of his freedom and

225
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:54,309
he never stopped giving away all the

226
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:57,939
information in the way that it should be

227
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:59,799
given away he even put two thousand watt

228
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,870
light bulbs in the front window of his

229
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,549
hydroponics store that he opened after

230
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,009
he got out the first time showing

231
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:07,599
everyone how to grow weed and that the

232
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:09,250
cops actually made him turn those lights

233
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,470
off because they were so bright out on

234
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:15,399
the main front street it was causing

235
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:17,769
problems with traffic so shout out to

236
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,120
all the mentors all the all the giants

237
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:21,730
that we've been able to stand on the

238
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,070
shoulders of I mean for sure it's gonna

239
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,600
bonus and all those low key people in

240
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,190
those hydroponic stores that knew were

241
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,300
talking about that didn't say [ __ ] but

242
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,300
gave us information we needed

243
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,440
first-first

244
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:38,879
crap I ever grew up back there in

245
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,650
Morgantown West Virginia was 1988 and

246
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,139
just been learning and trying to gain

247
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:46,360
knowledge ever since and you know you

248
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:48,340
could keep it clean and organic raus

249
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,110
raus johnny was the first person that

250
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:53,110
turned me on to kind but in West

251
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,149
Virginia and I never forgot that I'll

252
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,860
never forget it because he was one of

253
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,269
those things where back then you gotta

254
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,519
understand I was really ignorant about

255
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:02,769
cannabis people so I was slinging Mac's

256
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,299
and I had a little bit of Mac's and we

257
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:05,710
were in the back of my club and I was

258
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:06,849
like you want to smoke a bowl and he's

259
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,709
like hell yeah

260
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:13,149
and I pull out a pipe he's like no no no

261
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:14,708
close that this little green thing and

262
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,808
I'm like what is that he's like oh this

263
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,068
is weed I'm like no not any weed I'm

264
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:21,100
gonna need more than that to get high

265
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:23,378
and you know just all embarrassing you

266
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,028
know and green as hell and man I hit

267
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:27,819
that weed and it changed my life forever

268
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:30,129
and then I was like Johnny he's like oh

269
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:31,958
about I can't get you anyway but you

270
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:33,369
know this shit's good you know you

271
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:39,308
should try throwing it it's a weed you

272
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:41,528
know mega thanks I wouldn't have weed

273
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:42,219
without what you guys are doing no

274
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:44,708
problem

275
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,899
so I was thinking of maybe asking Brian

276
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:48,849
to kind of introduce himself to the hash

277
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,649
church group here let it let him let

278
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,509
everyone know what vital garden supplies

279
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:53,918
is up to and what they're doing and sort

280
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:56,678
of the groups that you guys are working

281
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:58,269
for cuz I know who you are and I know

282
00:12:56,678 --> 00:13:01,600
what you're up to but maybe some of the

283
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:03,609
audience doesn't yeah vital garden

284
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,689
supplies a purveyor of high-quality

285
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:09,699
organic farming garden products we cater

286
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:11,858
to the cannabis industry especially I

287
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:15,038
think we're going on our 11th or 12th

288
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:18,249
season now every year we try to gain

289
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:21,298
more and more high-end products under

290
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:23,709
our own label we searched high and far

291
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:25,149
throughout the world to get the best

292
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:29,378
that we can to bring it to people so

293
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:32,589
they could have clean successful gardens

294
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:34,778
without the nasty stuff that a lot of

295
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:38,079
people are pushing that those same hydro

296
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:41,019
stores that we started going to way back

297
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,388
in the day they yeah some of them have

298
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:45,298
evolved and learned how to teach people

299
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:48,788
about the organic side of things and

300
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:51,068
some have it so I've taken it upon

301
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:53,048
myself to make sure that our products

302
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:55,868
are as accessible as possible for people

303
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:59,318
for sure very cool very cool it seems to

304
00:13:55,869 --> 00:14:03,249
be always the smaller group choosing the

305
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:05,019
more righteous higher integrity process

306
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:06,759
you know like to not grow with chemicals

307
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:09,759
it just seems like less people grow

308
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,959
organically than the not would you would

309
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,239
you kind of agree with that or do you

310
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:16,868
see a lot of people picking up organics

311
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:19,059
I do see a shift for sure like nice I'm

312
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:20,769
really excited about that and that is

313
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:23,049
one good thing about all

314
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:25,389
one of many good things about all this

315
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:28,329
legalization and things coming

316
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:31,269
aboveboard there is going to be some you

317
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:34,540
know testing and some you know regiments

318
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:37,028
that people are gonna have to get rid of

319
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:39,370
that they used to use get rid of things

320
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:41,799
such as powdery mildew and mice and

321
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,560
things like that where now that are

322
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:47,169
gonna have to use organic solutions so

323
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,629
that their product is sellable and

324
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:51,219
considered medicine and even actually

325
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:54,039
now that we're gonna have rec even like

326
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,080
smokeable material so like there's been

327
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:58,838
a lot of hiding behind closed doors all

328
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,759
these years so it's gonna be nice to see

329
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,630
everybody you know really have to like

330
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,830
show the proof and the paperwork behind

331
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:08,889
what they what they produce

332
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:12,778
where were you located right we're in

333
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:12,778
Nevada City California we also have

334
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,620
where are you I'm in Nevada City

335
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:23,679
oh no I've been into your store Bryan

336
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,110
and yes one of the one of the complaints

337
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,838
I have about a lot of gross stores when

338
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,839
I go into them they the sales people

339
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:35,080
seem most interested in selling products

340
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,820
as versus informing and helping the

341
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,790
person that's standing in front of them

342
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:43,210
and my experience in your store has been

343
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:45,579
that your employees actually try to

344
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,769
educate me on the various products that

345
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,650
you've got and what implications that

346
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:53,559
they'll have in the final products that

347
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:56,169
I make well that's really good yeah no

348
00:15:53,559 --> 00:16:00,459
you you're you're sterling example of

349
00:15:56,169 --> 00:16:03,819
how in my opinion a cultivation provider

350
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:06,310
should be in terms like I said you're

351
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,620
not really pushing product so much as

352
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:11,379
trying to help educate people and that's

353
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:16,600
a really thing I think is a huge need in

354
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:18,759
the cannabis industry thank you yeah we

355
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,589
definitely obviously our business is the

356
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,958
sell products but we also really do

357
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:24,310
appreciate those farmers or take things

358
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,289
upon themselves and make their own

359
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:28,719
compost and they're self-sufficient and

360
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:31,149
they're building their own you know

361
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,410
microorganisms in their flora and in

362
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:35,358
their soil yes on the other hand

363
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:39,019
we have products if they need aid in

364
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:41,509
that and you know though as our industry

365
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:43,339
is growing there's going to be many

366
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,979
different paths that people choose and

367
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:47,299
the way I see it is you know the people

368
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:49,729
who are trying to go a larger scale and

369
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:52,938
want to stay organic they're gonna have

370
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:55,369
to source products and I want to make

371
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:56,988
sure that where they are for them so

372
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:58,729
they could actually source things that

373
00:16:56,989 --> 00:17:00,798
are safe and that are gonna actually

374
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:03,019
have success so they don't like it

375
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:04,220
scared that oh no this organic thing

376
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:08,689
isn't working we're gonna have to go

377
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:10,100
back to synthetic style and I think

378
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,990
that's one thing vitals been really good

379
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,000
about and my employees especially are

380
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,099
all super passionate about Guerlain

381
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,679
cannabis and they all love it so much

382
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:20,778
and they've taken on this thing that

383
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,528
we've like inside we call it a vital

384
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:27,859
pride and you know I didn't even realize

385
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:30,558
it until several years into it that like

386
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:32,928
some people really take it upon

387
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:35,058
themselves to really appreciate what it

388
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:37,278
is that we've done and then then take

389
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:39,378
that knowledge and take that like

390
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:41,509
specialization and put it into their

391
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:43,428
garden and put their little twist on it

392
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:46,190
and it makes it so that they're able to

393
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,870
have like that little success mm-hmm

394
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,399
well you're raising everybody up you

395
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:51,319
know that's the gift and when you're

396
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:52,849
passing out knowledge it's one of the

397
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,428
things or earlier on when Y was the

398
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:57,619
buyer there at DPG I realized that I

399
00:17:55,429 --> 00:18:01,070
could just send somebody away with their

400
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:02,959
cannabis or I could actually you know

401
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:05,269
you can tell you can look at a plant now

402
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,190
after you've looked at you know tons of

403
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:09,048
it as a lot of us have you know you can

404
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,700
look at a bud and tell exactly what's

405
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:12,528
going on with the nutrient issues are

406
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,350
and so I would actually tell that to

407
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:18,288
them and then the mind would blow but I

408
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:20,449
always would say okay well here's the

409
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:22,128
problem and they'd be like oh my god

410
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,750
were you in my garden I'm like no the

411
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:25,339
bud is the truth teller no matter what

412
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,288
you tell me you're locked to me

413
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:29,388
the plant is telling me the truth so as

414
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:31,220
I look at the truth here you've got heat

415
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:34,128
issues it's picked too early you know

416
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:37,220
and etc go through the standards and I

417
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:39,980
would say you fail this time but next

418
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,629
time you know come back to me and let's

419
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,000
see if you've applied these things and

420
00:18:41,628 --> 00:18:46,128
what you could have gotten this for you

421
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,298
can get this for if it's at this quality

422
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:48,558
I had to take a bud out

423
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:50,989
something that I haven't shown and say

424
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:53,720
this is of this quality and this is what

425
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:56,269
I expect and if you can deliver that

426
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,739
then I can give you this price and then

427
00:18:56,269 --> 00:19:00,019
people would go home with that knowledge

428
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:01,610
and apply it as you know dry and you

429
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:03,649
know people really are searching on a

430
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:05,418
thirst for information because a lot of

431
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:07,278
the earlier grow books were so full of

432
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:10,519
miss well not misinformation they're so

433
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:11,839
technically confusing to a lot of people

434
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,909
that people just want it simple

435
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,798
information what does my pH need to be

436
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:18,889
you know what is my you know what's the

437
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:21,589
best nutrients I need to grow etc and so

438
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:24,439
it's been a wonderful shift with you

439
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:26,089
know prohibition collapsing from you

440
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,278
know to 15 to where you could start to

441
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:29,959
talk about it now with legalization you

442
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:32,179
don't have the fear anymore you know you

443
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,769
actually have suppliers aren't worried

444
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:35,749
that you're selling to cannabis people

445
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:38,028
anymore so the whole paradigm is shift

446
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:39,230
for you whereas back when you know back

447
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:41,179
in the day with green merch and

448
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,980
everything else you know you had to act

449
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:45,649
like an undercover agent just going into

450
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,450
us you know a hydroponics store just to

451
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:50,178
buy your stuff much less ask for

452
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,970
information or get real information or

453
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:54,499
information you could actually use so

454
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,239
thank you Brian for taking it and

455
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:57,739
raising the standards and you know

456
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:59,899
raising everybody up together because

457
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:03,108
that's why I still have suppliers at PPG

458
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:04,638
is because you know 1718 years ago we

459
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:06,019
decide you know we need to educate these

460
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:07,608
farmers so that they can make better

461
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:09,528
cannabis because we're reliant on our

462
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:11,239
patient cultivars we'll give you the

463
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:12,888
clone but it's what you do with that

464
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:15,108
clone and we know people can ruin a

465
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:18,019
clone and ruin every aspect of growing a

466
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:19,489
plant but by putting good genetics out

467
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:21,019
there we knew that good genetics would

468
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:23,389
come back if people would get to grow

469
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,190
grow information and now with that it's

470
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,319
spawned into good information so now

471
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,210
everybody is benefitting from it you

472
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:30,378
know the local regional you know people

473
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,239
are making more money which means they

474
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:34,009
can now spend more stuff at the

475
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:35,749
hydroponic store the grow stores so that

476
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:37,608
they can actually you know make bigger

477
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:39,829
and better crops for them themselves the

478
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:41,778
next time so that sustainability and

479
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:44,118
they learn from that each time and that

480
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:46,220
they only help everybody get better so

481
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:48,558
thank you for taking that philosophy

482
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,919
because back 20 years ago you know we

483
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,418
all were thirsting and craving for that

484
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:56,629
no doubt and that is something that we

485
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:58,460
take upon ourselves to like be the first

486
00:20:56,628 --> 00:21:00,919
most important thing knowledge is power

487
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,769
for sure we always sponsor

488
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:06,740
in classes and special people like

489
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:09,139
Laningham to like educate our clientele

490
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:12,230
of how the right thing to go about you

491
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:16,300
know using beneficial microbes organic

492
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:19,279
fertilizer and not feeling this thing

493
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:21,289
that you gotta use a synthetic or like

494
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:24,950
scared to like get away from there

495
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:26,690
three-part nutrients so yeah education

496
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,220
is everything and once people get

497
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,720
comfortable with what they're doing

498
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,850
it makes them enjoy what they're doing

499
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,089
even better and feel a little bit more

500
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:37,099
you know confident in all aspects of

501
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:39,879
gardening and finding and growing

502
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:43,099
cannabis and taking it to the next level

503
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,200
that's it you know it's 20 20 years ago

504
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:46,849
plus it was vegetative growth let's see

505
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,380
how much we can grow let's see how fast

506
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:52,730
we can get it and slowly but surely

507
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:54,290
thing yeah that's changed by people

508
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,180
becoming more focused on the actual

509
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:57,619
medicinal components that are growing on

510
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,930
these plants these small little

511
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:02,089
glandular trichomes whether capitate

512
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:04,310
stalked or sessile stalked or bulbous

513
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:07,579
all three of them contain the profiles

514
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:09,259
that we seek and desire and as we learn

515
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:11,119
that we start growing a little bit

516
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:13,089
differently focused maybe more on the

517
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,069
actual medicinal components of the plant

518
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:18,199
at least as much as the vegetative

519
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:19,819
growth in the and the vegetative plant

520
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,690
matter that we're going to be yielding I

521
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:27,730
gave up on vegetative yields maybe 10 or

522
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:30,019
15 years ago now hey I'd like to welcome

523
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,569
injure to the room and I'd like to

524
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:35,359
welcome dr. Marsh aldohn to the room and

525
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:36,679
we've got Peter back from soil balance

526
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,139
Pro I thought he would make a wonderful

527
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,900
addition to the conversation along with

528
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,610
Wade and along with Brian I'm not sure

529
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,310
if you guys are all familiar with one

530
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:48,319
another but you're all kind of doing

531
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:50,869
really wonderful [ __ ]

532
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,789
in different ways you're all little

533
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:55,879
pieces of the puzzle that I just see as

534
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:59,420
making a wonderful panel here today so

535
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,940
welcome all of you to the room thank you

536
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,490
very much nice to meet you gentlemen

537
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,950
okay I'm gonna go back to you for a

538
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:08,809
second what are the most common problems

539
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,789
that people are coming in to you that

540
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:13,579
are vexed they're looking for solutions

541
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,629
that you're be that you're able to find

542
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:17,019
or that are new

543
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:21,290
Lucian's that you found to assist people

544
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:23,629
good question there 18 back to what you

545
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:25,879
were saying a little bit earlier to like

546
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,830
a year and a half ago give or take I

547
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,480
approached the Marone company they make

548
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:33,549
a couple of organic bio pesticide

549
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,380
insecticide pesticides in fungicides and

550
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:39,349
they're all certified organic and made

551
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,000
from by microbes and I had been using

552
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:43,789
them for quite some time but unable to

553
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,369
really obtain them for distribution and

554
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:48,460
they were definitely scared of the

555
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:51,169
cannabis industry and it took quite some

556
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:54,289
arm-twisting to get them to you've know

557
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,720
considerate and you know I really thank

558
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:58,309
them for finally coming around and some

559
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,589
of these products are definitely helping

560
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:05,329
buy great great proportions on powdery

561
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:08,240
mildew that's one of the most common

562
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:11,059
problems and then broad mites and

563
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,339
Russert mites I'd say are like right

564
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:15,470
behind the powdery mildew as much as an

565
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:18,889
issue and then for serían we're seeing a

566
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:20,960
lot also and all these products are all

567
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,270
these issues have organic solutions

568
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,210
which in the past a lot of people didn't

569
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:28,519
realize and anything from using a

570
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,980
Trichoderma which can kill all the

571
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:32,869
microbes that are in your root zone and

572
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,089
then you obviously have to reenact you

573
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:38,089
late the beneficials but it will kill

574
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:40,189
that fuss area and help your plant

575
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:42,619
bounce back so you don't completely lose

576
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:44,750
it the broad mite thing we've definitely

577
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:46,849
seen a lot of people have infestations

578
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,309
and with a couple products like the

579
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:51,559
grande evo and the venerate been able to

580
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:54,079
like knock it out and actually harvest

581
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:56,149
their crop Wow

582
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,409
that's kind of incredible when you think

583
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,269
about it because man every time I've

584
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:02,480
ever seen those little things come into

585
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:05,240
a garden it's like okay we need to set

586
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,599
off a nuclear bomb we're gonna be

587
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,250
rebuilding in a different zone yeah well

588
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:11,480
that's the reality right before you had

589
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,400
those solutions if you want to do

590
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,319
organically basically if you had those

591
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,060
type situations it was just cut and

592
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,549
start all over again so at least there's

593
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:22,009
at least as beneficial solutions now as

594
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:24,139
opposed to the having to restart all

595
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:26,000
over again all together I mean the best

596
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,310
the best solution was trying to have a

597
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,730
healthy flora in your soil

598
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:33,710
have a healthy beneficial microorganisms

599
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:35,630
population so your plants are able to

600
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,480
fight off anything that does come their

601
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:40,670
way but unfortunately it was so much

602
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,110
interaction and people trading plants

603
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,019
and people go into different Gardens

604
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:47,389
these pasts are like innovative and they

605
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:50,299
figure out ways to get from one Garden

606
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:52,460
to another and before you know it that

607
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:54,740
garden that you were sure of was clean

608
00:25:52,460 --> 00:26:00,860
and past three could have been

609
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:03,049
contaminated by you know one of the one

610
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:05,859
of the biggest disease you're talking

611
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:09,230
about is powdery and downy mildew right

612
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:11,689
yes for sure okay so a lot of people

613
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:14,660
don't know this but it's actually the

614
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:17,720
scientific name for like downy mildew

615
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:22,670
this paranhos burrow and so what happens

616
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:27,589
Perez it actually comes in the form of

617
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:31,070
what's called an oo spore that yes okay

618
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:33,199
so so these oo spores they're like tiny

619
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:35,240
little bowling balls right like if you

620
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,610
think about where earthworms come from

621
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,910
right where do we reforms come with how

622
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:42,139
do they just kind of colonize the soil

623
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:44,150
okay when they're not there before

624
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,400
where do birth worms come from in a

625
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:49,070
healthy soil they come from from little

626
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,230
eggs and that's kind of how powdery and

627
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:54,679
downy mildew come they they're in this

628
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:57,380
little tiny ol spore which is like a

629
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,810
bowling ball very very small very

630
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:04,520
microscopic and these guys can travel in

631
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:07,359
from different soil mediums anaerobic

632
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:07,359
pockets within

633
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:18,990
well somebody needs to fight there Mike

634
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:22,848
[Music]

635
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:35,460
oh that's fine line and me back okay

636
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:37,349
that was injured injury you need to work

637
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,909
on your mic there buddy oh my gosh I

638
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:43,788
thought it was me I was like what is

639
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:47,850
going on continue on Peter continued on

640
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:50,509
so about like these low scores that are

641
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:53,730
in let's say an anaerobic pocket of

642
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:56,399
undecomposed compost right so you're

643
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:59,339
making your slope mixture and and these

644
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:01,229
little o scores are only going to you

645
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:03,000
make when obviously the temperature is

646
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,940
perfect and the moisture is perfect and

647
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,210
that's how you're going to get the

648
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:12,870
increase in colonization within the soil

649
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:15,058
aggregates that could actually gain

650
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:16,798
competency and then hit the root of the

651
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:18,808
plant and then boom and it's going to

652
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:22,589
spread to maybe one plant but as it as

653
00:28:18,808 --> 00:28:25,740
that para nós pura colonizes the plant

654
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:27,898
itself it'll jump it will jump to other

655
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,659
plants so you know the universities will

656
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:33,119
come out until you hate molds and

657
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:35,159
mildews are just there in the air in

658
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,808
it's an environmental factor you know

659
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,360
you're going to get it whether whether

660
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:41,759
you want it or not but well what what a

661
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:45,000
lot of science sustainable agriculture

662
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:48,808
scientists are finding is that the these

663
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,750
oo scores are in oil in high amounts and

664
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:53,278
there's really nothing that because

665
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,659
again they're these little like bowling

666
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,638
balls they're one of the hardest things

667
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:59,129
even with like a fumigant like methyl

668
00:28:56,638 --> 00:29:00,959
bromide or or or ahora systemic

669
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:04,288
fungicides these little low scores are

670
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:08,509
are super tough to destroy they're

671
00:29:04,288 --> 00:29:12,388
almost impossible to destroy so like

672
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:16,110
Brian was saying the only way to to kind

673
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:17,398
of inhibit the colonization of powdery

674
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:20,819
and downy mildew which are two of the

675
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:23,099
most predominant diseases in your

676
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:24,829
industry as well as linked your sick and

677
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:27,240
I think verticillium Fusarium

678
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:30,628
rhizoctonia try this and Pythium all

679
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:33,269
those guys are pretty big problems too

680
00:29:30,628 --> 00:29:35,529
but I don't know your product but

681
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:39,099
soluble humans concentrate if you can

682
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:41,019
humans which contains 100% aerobic

683
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:43,509
beneficial microorganisms you can get

684
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:47,079
that diversity and and colonize nation

685
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:50,529
up it's going to limit the impact or

686
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:53,919
colonization space on a microscopic

687
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:56,609
level that that that para nós burrow or

688
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,710
pottery and downy mildew can actually

689
00:29:56,609 --> 00:30:02,289
have in your soil but but but an

690
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:05,140
important thing to know is that they are

691
00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:08,259
coming from the so low those those those

692
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,120
microorganisms are developing in what

693
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:11,379
you're bringing in your soil medium so

694
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:14,229
you just have to be really careful on

695
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,480
what you guys can use say yeah I totally

696
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:19,420
agree and I think a lot of people are

697
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,700
like do to like the huge emergence of

698
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:24,640
our industry you know a lot of soil

699
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,529
companies are like not necessarily doing

700
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,759
their quality control on the compost

701
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:30,240
that they're using and they're using

702
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,799
lower and ingredients in their soil to

703
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,410
bring something to market that may be

704
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,659
more affordable than others but may not

705
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:40,240
necessarily be helping the farmer

706
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:43,779
because it's a bunch of composted

707
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,150
product or low end or has ingredients in

708
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:49,599
it that are more susceptible to these

709
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:52,330
spores like Peter said yeah yeah totally

710
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,579
Brian life even in vermiculite or peat

711
00:30:52,329 --> 00:30:56,470
moss or something like that you know and

712
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:59,199
again especially in the green waste a

713
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,610
lot of these guys what they do is you

714
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,190
know they take the green peas from the

715
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:05,289
community environments and they let it

716
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,809
sit in these huge anaerobic piles and

717
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:09,129
just rot for about nine months and so

718
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:10,869
you know they feel like all the

719
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:13,180
pathogens have been killed because it

720
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,859
gets so high but that's not always the

721
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,799
case when you're looking at microscopic

722
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:21,849
pockets where these like these little

723
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:23,589
balls of RO spores are are sometimes

724
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:28,059
smaller than a microorganism they're

725
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:34,000
really small and they contain colonies

726
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:35,559
of powdery and mildew absolutely

727
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,420
absolutely and that's one of the reasons

728
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:39,359
why we like pride ourselves on using the

729
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,560
highest quality ingredients and

730
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,509
encouraging people to like not cut

731
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:45,609
corners just because they may have some

732
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:48,700
local soil and has some mushroom compost

733
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:51,849
from the local mushroom farm that hasn't

734
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:55,420
really been properly composted but is a

735
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:57,000
giant waste stream so basically a lot of

736
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,560
these waste streams just need to be

737
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,900
educated on how to manage them properly

738
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:05,169
and the world could have a lot more

739
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,940
higher end compost and that's one thing

740
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,110
that we have coming down the pipe we

741
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,480
have a project that we're going to work

742
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:12,219
on this canal where we'll be in charge

743
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,610
of all the ingredients and the inputs

744
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:17,019
and how the compost is actually made so

745
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:19,719
we're looking forward to that project

746
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:21,940
for sure I make compost for a lot of

747
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,120
years and I I made a loop key compost

748
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:27,820
and that's out of Germany and and what

749
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,799
it is is it's been insoluble huge

750
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:33,429
compost and it's composted we don't let

751
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:35,349
it get past 140 degrees that way we can

752
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:38,740
essentially just keep all the aerobic

753
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:41,409
microbes so we do and static yeah

754
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:44,170
totally you know that turned you know

755
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:45,400
that that process when you was compost

756
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:50,200
so we would turn it every day for the

757
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:52,810
first four weeks but but even with that

758
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,420
compost when you don't microbial essay

759
00:32:52,809 --> 00:33:00,190
on it you know again it almost

760
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:02,289
impossible to eliminate 100% of the of

761
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,269
the pathogenic organisms in any type of

762
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:07,029
an organic material because it's the

763
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:09,190
natural balance there there are good and

764
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:11,950
bad organisms within any type of outdoor

765
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:14,830
ecosystem so so with that being said

766
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:17,380
what we've done with skill balance is we

767
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:19,240
isolated specie strains of your

768
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:23,590
beneficial microorganisms so that we

769
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:26,380
don't have any inkling of a pathogenic

770
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:31,019
in there so we're making micro team that

771
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:33,790
is 100% pure beneficial aerobic

772
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:36,400
saprophytic organisms that actually work

773
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:38,649
to help decompose some of the material

774
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,180
in a in a compost that hasn't been fully

775
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,220
decomposed yet because even if you're a

776
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:46,029
master composter you're never gonna get

777
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:49,029
100 percent of the bad guys out in in in

778
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:51,789
a compost it's it's it's naturally

779
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:54,579
impossible to get out all of the the bad

780
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:56,349
guys so you have to be careful any any

781
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:59,409
organic material you're bringing into

782
00:33:56,349 --> 00:34:01,329
your grow room you know with those

783
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:02,259
pockets and like you said the thing that

784
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:05,740
you said Brian it makes

785
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:08,110
much sense is that if you inundate your

786
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:11,849
environment with tons of beneficial

787
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:15,610
organisms a lot of the health a lot of

788
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:19,029
the the things that people that growers

789
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:21,659
trying to grow organic who are reactive

790
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:24,130
to the health issues that they're facing

791
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:26,169
they just naturally won't have them any

792
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:28,648
kind of like a human healthy body once

793
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:31,898
your your your community is diversified

794
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:33,638
you're gonna have just plant health

795
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:36,130
vigor and you're gonna have

796
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:38,200
nutrient-dense product because those

797
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:40,898
those beneficials will act almost as as

798
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,549
let as like a chelating agent for the

799
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:50,529
macro micro nutrients in the soil

800
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:54,130
I love the go ahead go ahead wait I just

801
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:55,360
have to mute Peters because you were

802
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,610
getting a little bit of feedback and

803
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,880
welcome to Tony to the room as well hey

804
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,880
Tony

805
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,090
yeah I wanted to talk a little more

806
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:09,220
about what you were just speaking on

807
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:11,559
feeder right I I think it's really

808
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:14,169
important to recognize that they're

809
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:16,299
these pathogenic organisms are

810
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:20,110
everywhere and it's really very

811
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:24,789
difficult to create a scenario that is

812
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:27,640
free of pathogens but my experience has

813
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:29,769
been from when I worked indoors it was

814
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:32,559
important to make sure everything was as

815
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:34,659
clean as possible and as many beneficial

816
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,130
organisms as possible now that I'm

817
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:38,440
fortunate enough to be able to work

818
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,420
outdoors on a farm where in the last

819
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,519
coming on eight years now

820
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:45,760
I've been able to build the beneficial

821
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:48,250
organisms in the soil learn how to make

822
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,710
proper compost and source the materials

823
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:53,320
that are going into that compost and I'm

824
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:55,510
finding that different cultivars

825
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,000
different versions of cannabis have

826
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,860
better resistance than others to these

827
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,769
various pathogens particularly the

828
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:04,900
mildews I'm really finding that some of

829
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:08,920
the things that are high in CBD low in

830
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:12,430
THC which is primarily the focus of my

831
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:15,970
interest I'm really finding that there's

832
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:17,379
so many different versions of this plant

833
00:36:15,969 --> 00:36:19,598
and some of them are actually quite

834
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,280
susceptible to mildews and others don't

835
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,440
seem to be bothered by it at all and

836
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,330
they have identical situation in my

837
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,130
garden so one of the things is the

838
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:30,969
nurseryman I'm trying to learn more

839
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:33,309
about is what cultivars flourish in

840
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:34,899
different scenarios and then to try and

841
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:36,279
make that information available to as

842
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,809
many people as possible

843
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,210
so we can reduce some of the

844
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:41,769
environmental impacts and increase the

845
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,869
quality of the medicine that people are

846
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:45,519
producing I really think this thing

847
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:47,440
you're talking about is really important

848
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,239
the way you're saying and from a

849
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,800
biological standpoint you have a

850
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:53,500
question that you just asked why are

851
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,630
certain cultivars more or less resistant

852
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,789
and and again addressing that from a

853
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:01,320
biological standpoint I think it has a

854
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:03,639
lot to do with the tree that each

855
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:07,440
individual plant is producing you know

856
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:09,969
think about a natural agro-ecosystem

857
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,740
period really right you're gonna have

858
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:14,108
different biodiversity and different

859
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:16,750
thresholds of for instance powdery or

860
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:19,000
downy mildew so that plant over time

861
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:23,050
just naturally has Co involved with its

862
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,480
natural system to be able to inhibit the

863
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:29,260
colonization of certain diseases so yes

864
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:31,300
naturally survive so when taking these

865
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,030
strengths and where mono cropping them

866
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:36,510
or reproduced in our own environment and

867
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:39,790
we don't have those exact strains

868
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:41,410
aligned with that particular plant then

869
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:43,539
what's gonna happen is the plants not

870
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:45,069
going to have its natural organisms that

871
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:48,009
it co-evolved with in nature

872
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:53,109
it'll just terpenes and it is necessary

873
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:57,040
to inhibit pathogen colonization yes yes

874
00:37:53,108 --> 00:37:59,529
yes yes interesting that's good stuff

875
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:02,230
that is good stuff great panel today I

876
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:04,210
love I love the diversity some new folks

877
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,490
in the room some old schoolers we got

878
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,858
marks caldo looking slightly like a

879
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:12,399
Simpsons character with his with his

880
00:38:08,858 --> 00:38:15,848
green hue but welcome dr. mark oh well

881
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,160
really a little bit a little bit oh I

882
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:19,900
could fix that I'm not you kind of

883
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:22,679
looked out the window and it almost went

884
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:27,420
away a little bit there especially right

885
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:33,699
no no no we love the green here bro you

886
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:36,159
yes green as you like my friends so

887
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:38,739
Brian are any guys working with the

888
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,539
state of California regarding the new

889
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:42,279
regulations and others start starting to

890
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:44,469
talk about organic certification or

891
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,300
working on that sort of ideas so that

892
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:48,579
you know people can actually take that

893
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,920
full shift in the future so that they

894
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:53,259
can actually get organic certification

895
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,250
for their cannabis in in the future in

896
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:59,380
California well indirectly yes I mean

897
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,599
we've taken the proactive approach of

898
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,950
getting all of our products certified

899
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:06,789
CDFA which is California Department of

900
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:08,919
Ag in for seeing that the future is

901
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:11,800
going to be that you know going to go

902
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,510
that route it's much easier for a farmer

903
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:18,310
to use product that's already certified

904
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:21,190
organic to get his own farm certified so

905
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:22,840
we did go that route for sure and we're

906
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:26,200
definitely working with a lot of farms

907
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:29,470
in the Monterey County and just some of

908
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:32,739
the more friendly counties that are

909
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:35,919
allowing permitting to using our

910
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:38,649
products and providing MSDS sheets and

911
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,409
providing you know derivation statements

912
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:45,160
so that they can get their approval for

913
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:47,980
organic certification so we had a

914
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:51,159
question from the chat room here a lot

915
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,750
of people asking about neem oil and it

916
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:54,579
seems like half the chat rooms kind of

917
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,989
like oh that's yeah I use that it's

918
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:58,420
great and the other half is like oh it's

919
00:39:55,989 --> 00:39:59,649
poison you shouldn't use it so it many

920
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:03,159
people have asked the question what the

921
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:05,349
panel thinks about yeah maybe start with

922
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:08,529
Brian what do you think about me email

923
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:10,839
well neem is definitely the Mac t'v

924
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:16,240
ingredient neem is acid action and as a

925
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:19,059
bactrim is a pesticide so amine kills

926
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,979
things and you know it has its time in

927
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:23,559
place you know so a lot of people been

928
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,840
putting neem cake and soil and neem seed

929
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:28,659
meal and soil for quite some time and

930
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:31,930
I've always been like perplexed by this

931
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:35,679
whole concept and it's starting to come

932
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:37,839
out that the neem seed meal is actually

933
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:40,750
killing microorganisms in the soil and

934
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:44,740
causing or anaerobic conditions so

935
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:47,199
doesn't surprise me I'm not a scientist

936
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:50,589
but I have you know a lot of experience

937
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:53,319
being a farmer and I just I kind of like

938
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:55,320
think of a plant like a human and I like

939
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,000
try to think what does this plant need

940
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:01,440
similar to like how I would think how a

941
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,489
human would need nutrient and by giving

942
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,130
putting memes something that's going to

943
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:08,379
kill microorganisms in the soil has

944
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,940
always been counterintuitive for me so

945
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:13,300
something I've always stayed away from

946
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:15,789
and now that the information is more and

947
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:18,430
more is coming out it totally makes

948
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:20,500
sense to me you know we want to keep as

949
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:23,639
much microbial life in the soil as

950
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,269
possible much oxygen we want those

951
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:29,108
microorganisms to be able to breathe

952
00:41:25,269 --> 00:41:31,449
down there great answer I am the best

953
00:41:29,108 --> 00:41:33,279
use I've ever seen of neem the most

954
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:35,199
natural use I've ever seen of it was not

955
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,930
you know extracting the oil the plant

956
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:40,089
oil and spraying it it was in Jamaica

957
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:41,889
where my friend had a giant neem tree in

958
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:45,220
his garden I'd never even seen one it

959
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:47,170
was like 40 feet tall big huge leaves on

960
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:48,338
the thing and the leaves would fall and

961
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,380
then he would just put them in the

962
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:53,170
pathways he was growing in you know

963
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,690
classic Jamaica style inside tires so

964
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:57,430
well that all the earth was in the tire

965
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,960
so it was like even the neem that was

966
00:41:57,429 --> 00:42:00,549
falling on the ground wasn't probably

967
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,470
really affecting the soil that the

968
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:06,339
plants were in although the rubber from

969
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:08,049
the tires probably were but I thought it

970
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:09,519
was a neat use of neem in the sense that

971
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:11,019
because I was like what are all these

972
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,150
leaves that you've got that we're

973
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:15,250
walking on over the pathways through the

974
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:18,190
plants and he's like that's neem on and

975
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,989
I looked up and I was like damn Jamaica

976
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:22,300
style you don't go buy a bottle of neem

977
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:24,639
you just use the entire plant it seems

978
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,950
more natural to me I'm on grow to tree

979
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,989
month grow to tree but I like your

980
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:31,689
answer with this you know affecting the

981
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:33,489
microbials that's clearly if you're not

982
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,619
thinking about the microbials in your

983
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:37,449
soil then maybe me might seem like a

984
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:39,250
great idea to you but coming to the

985
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:41,769
understanding that it's it's it's

986
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:44,800
potentially killing those or affecting

987
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:48,190
their colony then maybe it's not such a

988
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:52,240
good idea I have similar feelings about

989
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:54,250
me my particular objection to name is

990
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,500
that it's a hormone disruptor it

991
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:58,840
it's one of the methods that one of the

992
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:01,360
ways it works on insects is by

993
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,269
disrupting their breeding cycle and I

994
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,620
think we're putting way too many

995
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:09,309
materials like that into the environment

996
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:11,019
hormone disruptors you can look at all

997
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:13,409
the weirdness that amphibians are

998
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:16,710
showing in the environment from

999
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:20,469
everything from birth control pills to

1000
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:22,420
soaps and whatnot who knows but with

1001
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:25,209
cannabis particularly if you're

1002
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,280
cultivating cannabis as medicine

1003
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:29,800
it seems really essential to me that you

1004
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,560
wouldn't add anything to the plant

1005
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:36,430
either systemically or as a foliar spray

1006
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:38,759
that eventually could compromise the

1007
00:43:36,429 --> 00:43:41,079
well-being of your end user and

1008
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,660
particularly in the context of calabria

1009
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:46,509
snake I've really had to focus on the

1010
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:48,909
cleanest purest version of cannabis

1011
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:51,040
medicine that is possible to create and

1012
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:53,319
so neem is one of the things that I

1013
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:56,199
asked the folks who cultivate for

1014
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:59,320
caladrius Network - if they use it to

1015
00:43:56,199 --> 00:44:02,079
tell us all about when and how they used

1016
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,059
it I don't want to take a chance on hurt

1017
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,090
and one of these kids that's using grams

1018
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:08,320
of oil a day and we end up concentrating

1019
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:11,590
something like neem into their

1020
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:14,320
bloodstream and who knows because again

1021
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:16,809
I'm not a scientist I tend to take a

1022
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:19,090
conservative position I don't want to

1023
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:28,690
take any chance at all of hurting that

1024
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:29,350
end user well I don't like name oh sorry

1025
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,869
I was on mute

1026
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:35,710
go ahead I know people like Tony

1027
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:39,009
probably don't doesn't like affects the

1028
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:42,429
oil flavor and components and overall

1029
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:44,950
profile of it so as more and more

1030
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:47,589
extractions been coming into play nîmes

1031
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:48,759
losing its place in cannabis if you ask

1032
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:50,530
me mm-hmm

1033
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,990
I've some information on the plant

1034
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:56,860
parasitic nematodes that I could share

1035
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:59,429
if you guys wanna from so I work with

1036
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:03,640
quite a few different scientists and

1037
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:06,940
with regards to like alloy design or

1038
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:09,670
which is root-knot or forests or skiing

1039
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,380
there's lanced nematodes so there's

1040
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:15,010
there's quite a few different um plant

1041
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:18,579
parasitic nematodes and the plant

1042
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:21,339
parasitics are our carbon feeders right

1043
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:23,140
so so if you have a lot of plant

1044
00:45:21,338 --> 00:45:25,509
parasitic nematodes what they're gonna

1045
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:26,409
do is they're gonna cruise in and

1046
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,450
they're gonna go and they're gonna

1047
00:45:26,409 --> 00:45:30,489
you're fine root hairs the the root

1048
00:45:28,449 --> 00:45:33,699
hairs that actually absorb most of your

1049
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:36,669
your your micro nutrients those

1050
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:39,578
nematodes especially like lance and

1051
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:41,380
sting are gonna eat those those fine

1052
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:48,519
root hairs first before they attack a

1053
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:49,510
meeting root because those are you hear

1054
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:52,119
me okay oh man

1055
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:53,589
very they're like aesthetic it's a

1056
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:58,000
little bit of a delay but we can hear

1057
00:45:53,588 --> 00:45:59,108
you okay okay so so those those fine

1058
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,429
root hairs are the ones that the

1059
00:45:59,108 --> 00:46:01,719
nematodes eat first they got these

1060
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:05,139
little mouths they go and they just

1061
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:06,699
gobble up cuz they're very like fibrous

1062
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:09,940
fine right here so that's the first

1063
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:11,980
thing that they eat so so that's the

1064
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:14,980
plant parasitic now beneficial nematodes

1065
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:20,858
and soil what those guys will do is they

1066
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:24,159
actually feed on humans so think about

1067
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:26,558
that so those beneficial nematodes won't

1068
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:30,038
eat your roots it will actually feed on

1069
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:33,490
humans or like mineralized carbon in the

1070
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:35,049
soil so so there's a big difference on

1071
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:36,909
the beneficial and the plant parasitic

1072
00:46:35,048 --> 00:46:40,480
kind of like the bad guys of the bugs

1073
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:45,940
the good guys of the bugs and flow so so

1074
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:50,048
if you have a very healthy human rich

1075
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:53,528
soil you're going to counterbalance the

1076
00:46:50,048 --> 00:46:55,630
nematode essentially you know

1077
00:46:53,528 --> 00:46:58,389
multi-celled organisms that are in that

1078
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:01,059
soil if you can really increase your

1079
00:46:58,389 --> 00:47:04,900
earthworm castings your your

1080
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:06,130
communication of that soil the plant

1081
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,019
parasitics will still be there and

1082
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:11,920
there's there's other things that you

1083
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:13,659
can do to inhibit you know those but

1084
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,130
that's a whole nother conversation i'm

1085
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:16,838
just talking about the types really i

1086
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,880
just wanted to let brian know that i

1087
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:20,469
muted his mic so when he goes to talk to

1088
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,390
unmuted it was the thing

1089
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:26,079
that was causing the tiniest little bit

1090
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:27,339
of feedback on Peters microphone so I

1091
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,079
know you're on a phone and it might be a

1092
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,329
little bit harder but just try to click

1093
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:35,460
your mute button to unmute yourself when

1094
00:47:31,329 --> 00:47:40,000
you talk and yeah there we go

1095
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:43,570
I'm just figured I'd let him know oh we

1096
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,869
might have lost him now I don't know so

1097
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:48,340
how did oh there he is he's back but I

1098
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:50,079
don't know if he can unmute his mic now

1099
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:52,358
sometimes when I mute people's mics it

1100
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,489
messes things up but let me see if I can

1101
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:59,590
unmute you Brian all right let's try it

1102
00:47:54,489 --> 00:48:02,049
out no it's still muted weird lets me

1103
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:04,358
mute him but not unmute him always been

1104
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:06,460
controlled air you're unmuted now all

1105
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:08,170
right sorry if I'm causing any issues no

1106
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:10,000
no you're fine just I guess when you

1107
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:12,400
don't speak it's best if you can mute

1108
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,170
your mic on your phone there if I can

1109
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,250
figure out how to do it I think I see it

1110
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,639
yeah no problem

1111
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:19,630
I know it's trippy right yeah I'm

1112
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:23,049
technologically challenged I'm a plant

1113
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:24,940
guy not a computer guy hey I'm glad you

1114
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:26,740
made it in today anyway to share to

1115
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,088
share with us and I'm glad that say it's

1116
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:33,250
because I wanted to hook you up with

1117
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:35,170
Peter any yeah and then and then Wade

1118
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:37,480
was like oh I got to bring wade into

1119
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:39,460
because he's just like he's exactly what

1120
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,920
all of you guys are talking about put

1121
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:43,329
into three dimensional reality for the

1122
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,519
last I don't know how many years of his

1123
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:47,608
life so just he sounds like he's the

1124
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:50,259
neighbor - yeah wait I'd like to get

1125
00:48:47,608 --> 00:48:54,519
look forward to it man I'll come in and

1126
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:56,140
ask for you please do yeah next time I'm

1127
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:57,400
up there an incline I have a dispensary

1128
00:48:56,139 --> 00:49:01,588
an incline I'm I have to swing over in

1129
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,588
Nevada City and come say hi yeah

1130
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:08,440
absolutely we must sesh I was also gonna

1131
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:10,150
say earlier when Brian was talking about

1132
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,159
or sorry it was Wade who was just

1133
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,480
talking about not wanting this this

1134
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,250
responsibility of dealing with

1135
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,619
catastrophic lis ill children who are

1136
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:20,650
extremely hypersensitive to anything

1137
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:24,309
let's just be honest our confidence our

1138
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:25,690
faith what we believe in is cannabis we

1139
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:27,429
believe in cannabis we believe in the

1140
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:28,838
profile we believe in the terpenes we

1141
00:49:27,429 --> 00:49:31,960
believe in the cannabinoids what we

1142
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:34,179
maybe don't believe in is you know a

1143
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,269
whole [ __ ] ton of

1144
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:38,558
like sprays and you know I'm with Wade

1145
00:49:37,268 --> 00:49:41,498
on that where it's just sort of like

1146
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,539
when in doubt throw it out stick with

1147
00:49:41,498 --> 00:49:45,608
the stick with the most popular best

1148
00:49:43,539 --> 00:49:50,140
sort of way of going about it which is

1149
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:52,259
maybe by breeding plants that are you

1150
00:49:50,139 --> 00:49:55,150
know going to be maybe a little bit more

1151
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:56,769
pushing away these these certain pests

1152
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,690
and mildews and whatnot I've definitely

1153
00:49:56,768 --> 00:50:00,699
seen it in a room I've gone into a room

1154
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:02,559
and I've seen all the cush is just

1155
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:03,730
covered in powdery mildew and then

1156
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,778
there's one in the background I was like

1157
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,730
what's that over there it's like oh

1158
00:50:04,778 --> 00:50:09,130
that's like a Congolese you know one of

1159
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,778
these kind of exotic cultivars and I'm

1160
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:12,519
like yeah but it doesn't have any

1161
00:50:10,778 --> 00:50:15,608
powdery mildew why do you have one

1162
00:50:12,518 --> 00:50:17,528
Congolese in your room and a 400 cush

1163
00:50:15,608 --> 00:50:19,980
when you grow in the Pacific Northwest

1164
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:24,190
I'm just curious

1165
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:26,108
no I think it's a huge thing there is a

1166
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:29,559
wide range of different cultivars

1167
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:32,710
available and what I think we're missing

1168
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:35,410
is sharing information with each other

1169
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:39,608
about cultivars that flourish in the

1170
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:41,649
different environments we're in just in

1171
00:50:39,608 --> 00:50:43,828
the folks that I've worked with in the

1172
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:46,778
last few years

1173
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:49,420
folk on the Central Coast or even the

1174
00:50:46,778 --> 00:50:52,329
north coast have a really different set

1175
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:55,440
of problems if you will and a different

1176
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:57,999
group of cultivars seem to flourish

1177
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,499
between those two areas and an area like

1178
00:50:57,998 --> 00:51:05,379
Nevada County where I'm at we have

1179
00:51:01,498 --> 00:51:08,919
incredibly hot very low humidity summers

1180
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:11,789
and meanwhile along the coast you've got

1181
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,710
high humidity from the marine layer and

1182
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:18,809
rarely do you get high temperatures in

1183
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:22,028
the day because the fog gets drawn in so

1184
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:24,548
my sense is that what I've tried to do

1185
00:51:22,028 --> 00:51:27,130
is learn more about like you were

1186
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:31,028
mentioning the congolese it seems to me

1187
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:33,400
that that's a radically different set of

1188
00:51:31,028 --> 00:51:35,679
conditions that that plant evolved in

1189
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:39,910
than what some of the other cultivars

1190
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:41,798
from the the cush area of India might

1191
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:43,929
have evolved in and I think the trick

1192
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:45,880
for us is sorting out what are the

1193
00:51:43,929 --> 00:51:47,250
genetics of the plants were working with

1194
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,829
and what are the environmental kin

1195
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:57,480
those plants are seeking so that they

1196
00:51:49,829 --> 00:52:00,289
can flourish the one thing I've noticed

1197
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:05,159
is seems like people aren't necessarily

1198
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:07,980
growing what is the most proper plant to

1199
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:10,819
grow for their region yes people people

1200
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:14,059
are growing for all sorts of purposes

1201
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:18,269
somewhat financially driven somewhat

1202
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:21,210
terpene driven so that's the one thing

1203
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:25,190
that like cannabis is like has such a

1204
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:29,159
like broad spectrum of types of types of

1205
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:31,740
cultivars and you know where where

1206
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:33,960
plants may be more appropriate may not

1207
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:36,209
be as desirable to some people as others

1208
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,039
and so on and so forth so mm-hmm

1209
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:41,159
that makes things really complicated as

1210
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:43,050
far as like a cannabis grower choosing a

1211
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:45,059
cultivar it would be nice to be able to

1212
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:47,670
just grow the things like our best in

1213
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:51,029
your region but we all like a little

1214
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:53,400
variety in life and people you know have

1215
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:56,910
options so that's one thing that like

1216
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:59,820
greenhouses and indoor and treatment is

1217
00:52:56,909 --> 00:53:02,368
making making uh taking advantage of

1218
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:03,359
your environment environmental controls

1219
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:07,079
and things like that

1220
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:10,009
are you go do but in general it I think

1221
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:12,750
providing the most natural at

1222
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:15,510
environment for your plant from the soil

1223
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:18,239
to the air to everything else has to

1224
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,950
always be taken into consideration so if

1225
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,199
you are growing something that is out of

1226
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:26,279
your region that has to provide a

1227
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:28,549
greenhouse for some sort of different

1228
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:32,220
environment and it's normally used to

1229
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:33,780
just take into consideration that give

1230
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:38,250
it what it wants and it'll give you what

1231
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:40,019
what you want to get from it yes I would

1232
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:43,769
share a little story if you want to hear

1233
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:46,500
it I've worked with a CDC which is a

1234
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:50,940
cultivar that produces c/bb

1235
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:53,670
about 25 or 30 times the amount of CBD

1236
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:56,789
and in the plant material as there is

1237
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:58,880
THC and particularly for some of the

1238
00:53:56,789 --> 00:54:02,170
kids that I work with that's really a

1239
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:05,559
desirable characteristic

1240
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:08,200
but I believe ac/dc was first identified

1241
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:10,359
as a plant of interest along the north

1242
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:13,989
coast of California

1243
00:54:10,358 --> 00:54:15,940
and over there it seems to flourish and

1244
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:17,649
I've met people who work with it indoors

1245
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:20,099
and the beauty of indoors of course is

1246
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:23,740
you can create the climate you want and

1247
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:25,660
ac/dc the first two years I worked with

1248
00:54:23,739 --> 00:54:28,479
it outdoors in my garden here in Nevada

1249
00:54:25,659 --> 00:54:32,139
County it grew like a fawn it could

1250
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,730
barely hold its own weight up and and

1251
00:54:32,139 --> 00:54:36,429
then I met folk who were working with it

1252
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:40,838
indoors and said no it was a very much

1253
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:43,449
of a typical heavy bearing strong plant

1254
00:54:40,838 --> 00:54:45,279
and when I discussed how that could be

1255
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:47,789
when I was growing it outdoors and

1256
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,740
seeing something that acted like a fern

1257
00:54:47,789 --> 00:54:56,318
we got to talking about temperature and

1258
00:54:50,739 --> 00:54:58,328
humidity and so last year I had four

1259
00:54:56,318 --> 00:54:58,719
little plants of ac/dc that I put in the

1260
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:01,780
ground

1261
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:03,489
under a shade structure where the shade

1262
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:06,220
structure would allow 60 percent

1263
00:55:03,489 --> 00:55:09,399
transmittance of light and the fabric

1264
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:12,669
was white and meantime I used wood chips

1265
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:15,970
in abundance with various types of grass

1266
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:19,690
types for mulch and I keep the mulch

1267
00:55:15,969 --> 00:55:22,449
moist for evaporative cooling and the

1268
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:24,579
ac/dc last summer instead of growing

1269
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:27,159
like a fern very much grew like a more

1270
00:55:24,579 --> 00:55:28,568
conventional plant and from those four

1271
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:33,489
little plants that I didn't put out

1272
00:55:28,568 --> 00:55:36,730
until June 20th I got almost just a hair

1273
00:55:33,489 --> 00:55:41,949
over 6,000 grams from four little plants

1274
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:44,079
put out June 20th and from those plants

1275
00:55:41,949 --> 00:55:48,389
the medicine mate besides working within

1276
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:51,068
they got eleven hundred grams of oil

1277
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:56,500
which is extraordinarily twenty-two

1278
00:55:51,068 --> 00:55:59,349
percent yield so on their extraction Wow

1279
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:01,838
clearly did really well and that house

1280
00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:03,460
is way more plant material than it ever

1281
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:05,078
produced in my garden in the two

1282
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,389
previous years I've worked with it and I

1283
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:09,609
had more plants but then but they

1284
00:56:07,389 --> 00:56:13,539
struggled to repeat how didn't do the

1285
00:56:09,608 --> 00:56:14,949
operation the hexane it's a hexane

1286
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:21,338
extraction with a saw

1287
00:56:14,949 --> 00:56:23,289
phlex machine not socks yes and brought

1288
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:25,630
it back to draw the hexane off and

1289
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:28,539
terpene separation at the final stages

1290
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:31,570
of extraction of the solvent and was

1291
00:56:28,539 --> 00:56:34,059
this a high CBD cultivar yes okay so

1292
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:35,769
here's a question for you now this is my

1293
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:38,170
own theory and it may hold no water

1294
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:41,019
whatsoever but what I notice is when I

1295
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:43,659
do extractions with mechanical screen

1296
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:46,000
separation whether dry or wet bubble

1297
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:47,799
hash or dry sifting but I'm able to get

1298
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,630
the sessile and the capitate stock to

1299
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,660
trichomes but the bulbous stay behind

1300
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:55,180
you get a very very small yield when you

1301
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:57,578
when I work with high CBD cultivars and

1302
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:59,500
I my theory is is that the majority of

1303
00:56:57,579 --> 00:57:01,930
the profile is inside those bulbous

1304
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:04,150
heads and they need to be melted off or

1305
00:57:01,929 --> 00:57:06,279
heated off steam distilled solvent

1306
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:08,170
extraction whatever in order for you to

1307
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,480
actually get that yield have you seen

1308
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:12,608
1/2 of a yield coming out of this

1309
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,338
material when you run it through sifting

1310
00:57:12,608 --> 00:57:19,440
or wet washing back in the day when I

1311
00:57:15,338 --> 00:57:22,539
was first working with Harlequin I

1312
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:26,800
enjoyed smoking hash in those days as

1313
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:31,389
well and yeah Harlequin is not a great

1314
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:34,380
producer in the hash realm is my

1315
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:36,578
experience and I think it's part of why

1316
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:39,400
my medicine makers were working with

1317
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:42,010
hexane is they got such good results for

1318
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,869
extractions I'd be interested in hearing

1319
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:46,060
what Tony had to say about this because

1320
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:48,068
I've heard something similar to what you

1321
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:51,460
were just asking about Brian or but I

1322
00:57:48,068 --> 00:57:53,650
don't really know Margaret yeah yeah I

1323
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:55,599
know John John BIRT fellow who's not

1324
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:57,068
here today I'm just gonna let Tony's

1325
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,318
eaten right now so I'll answer and then

1326
00:57:57,068 --> 00:58:01,989
he got yours he can chime in right after

1327
00:57:59,318 --> 00:58:03,550
me just that John Breaux fellow has also

1328
00:58:01,989 --> 00:58:04,269
seen the same thing with the Halley's

1329
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:07,060
Comet

1330
00:58:04,269 --> 00:58:09,280
Cheryl T Rose whose daughter Hayley has

1331
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:10,659
a form of epilepsy that they came up

1332
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,750
with this high CBD cultivar called

1333
00:58:10,659 --> 00:58:15,608
Halley's Comet and it was the same way

1334
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:17,588
like when we ran it through screens when

1335
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:20,529
we ran it through water hash that yields

1336
00:58:17,588 --> 00:58:22,659
were just so low that it you know and

1337
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:24,760
it's it's really hard when you're trying

1338
00:58:22,659 --> 00:58:26,920
to produce an actual medicine for

1339
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,430
someone now the interesting thing was is

1340
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,858
that

1341
00:58:27,429 --> 00:58:32,318
the much higher yields were gotten

1342
00:58:29,858 --> 00:58:34,179
through oil extractions but hey and I

1343
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:35,769
wish Cheryl was here to share this

1344
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:38,528
because it's really her information more

1345
00:58:35,769 --> 00:58:40,690
than anyone's but she Haley had been on

1346
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:43,389
this oil for some for some time and her

1347
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:45,068
seizures went down 80 80 percent some

1348
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:47,710
massive number she was still having

1349
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:51,449
seizures but it wasn't until she started

1350
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:55,990
making bubble hash with this particular

1351
00:58:51,449 --> 00:58:58,210
cultivar that she went like she stopped

1352
00:58:55,989 --> 00:59:00,278
all her seizures now I'm sure that they

1353
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:02,260
have come back because I think that they

1354
00:59:00,278 --> 00:59:04,690
maybe lost the cultivar or something had

1355
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:07,180
it happens but she went for hundreds of

1356
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:09,760
days maybe over 200 I'd have to once

1357
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:12,489
again get Cheryl T rose and any of you

1358
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,010
want to Google Sheryl rose as well as

1359
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:16,509
Haley you can find out all about them

1360
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:18,160
and go support them because they're

1361
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:19,690
really good people but just some

1362
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:21,909
interesting thing that I found wouldn't

1363
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:23,798
it be interesting if Stevie Dee was

1364
00:59:21,909 --> 00:59:28,778
being produced in higher amounts in

1365
00:59:23,798 --> 00:59:33,519
bulbous trichomes and if so why did they

1366
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:34,869
winterized the hexane extract I it was

1367
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:39,038
all done

1368
00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:40,750
yeah with temperature and vacuum I'm not

1369
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:42,369
sure exactly what you mean by winter ice

1370
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:44,710
but no the plant material would get

1371
00:59:42,369 --> 00:59:50,309
dried to one or two percent of moisture

1372
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:54,068
content and it'll dissolve why facts and

1373
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:56,140
lipids right you're gonna dissolve those

1374
00:59:54,068 --> 00:59:58,269
components they have to be removed and

1375
00:59:56,139 --> 01:00:00,848
winterization is the process by which

1376
00:59:58,269 --> 01:00:03,269
they're removed I was just wondering if

1377
01:00:00,849 --> 01:00:05,920
they winterize their hexane extract

1378
01:00:03,269 --> 01:00:07,690
because you're gonna get oil from that

1379
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,960
like you said they're getting CBD oil

1380
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:12,818
well purified CBD we all know is a quite

1381
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,159
crystalline solids so what are the other

1382
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:19,088
components that are in there and what's

1383
01:00:15,159 --> 01:00:23,409
the CBD concentration in the oil that

1384
01:00:19,088 --> 01:00:26,139
they extracted we've seen as much as I

1385
01:00:23,409 --> 01:00:29,980
don't remember the specific variety but

1386
01:00:26,139 --> 01:00:35,500
we had a seventy some percent CBD and

1387
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:38,949
two percent THC oil in abundance right

1388
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:41,309
so there's about 25 26 28 percent other

1389
01:00:38,949 --> 01:00:45,939
stuff in there right yes

1390
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:47,980
other extracted fats and waxes is my

1391
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:51,730
take on it yeah it's a heavy oil

1392
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:54,010
tari not clear at all but again because

1393
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:56,769
I don't know I'm really trying for a

1394
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:59,680
whole plant extract I want all of it

1395
01:00:56,769 --> 01:01:02,460
I ask the guys to mix the terpenes back

1396
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:05,669
into the oil when they give it to us

1397
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:08,679
they did be in the in the sock slips

1398
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:11,230
extraction oh no most of the oil is

1399
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:12,730
still in the acid form the class just

1400
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:17,440
think that that's really kind of cool

1401
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:19,690
because you would think in the so I saw

1402
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,940
I'll explain what it is Sox list so Sox

1403
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:25,420
lid is kind of like a little cup that

1404
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:28,030
sits in the reflux zone of a solvent

1405
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:30,789
that's being boiled and so in this case

1406
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:35,080
it's xane so what happens is the hexane

1407
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:38,110
vapor sort of reconned ences on the on

1408
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:39,969
the whole ankles cocoa finger or

1409
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,559
whatever it is that's the cold surface

1410
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:44,259
in there some people like I've gone

1411
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:47,199
typically called a reflux condenser and

1412
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:49,300
so from the condenser then the the fresh

1413
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:51,339
solvent drops over the plant material

1414
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:53,500
and then goes back into the pot and it

1415
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:56,829
just does that it's kind of making

1416
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:59,590
coffee right yes you know coffee

1417
01:01:56,829 --> 01:02:01,750
percolator not a single you know past

1418
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:03,910
curing or something this is like the

1419
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:07,030
coffee circulator that you put coffees

1420
01:02:03,909 --> 01:02:10,059
to water into boil it like the Cowboys

1421
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:13,030
did you know on the you know stove or

1422
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:15,969
something so and yeah so the sock slit

1423
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:19,240
is basically interesting because again

1424
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:23,079
you're passing through hexane after it's

1425
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:26,409
condensed so it's no longer hot but it's

1426
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:29,259
typically in a hot zone of a condenser

1427
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:32,889
in that you're it's kind of below where

1428
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:34,810
the where the reflux condenser is which

1429
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:36,909
again is stuff that's being condensed

1430
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:38,320
back at you know room temperature so

1431
01:02:36,909 --> 01:02:40,960
it's basically just running through

1432
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:43,300
there but you're going to concentrate in

1433
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,190
the hexane pot down below which then

1434
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:47,170
they strip on the road of that and again

1435
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:49,090
you can probably strip hexane without

1436
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:51,210
doing much D carb I'm just surprised

1437
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:55,640
that in that whole sock slow extraction

1438
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:57,858
process they can't they can't just them

1439
01:02:55,639 --> 01:03:00,858
any carbon another interesting thing is

1440
01:02:57,858 --> 01:03:04,130
a good recrystallization solvent for the

1441
01:03:00,858 --> 01:03:06,139
cannabinoid acids are things like hexane

1442
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:08,329
and pentane they're very very nonpolar

1443
01:03:06,139 --> 01:03:11,480
and if you could stature eight that

1444
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:14,059
solution on your road evaporator might

1445
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:18,139
be able to kill it down cryogenically

1446
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:19,789
and actually crash out cbda crystals so

1447
01:03:18,139 --> 01:03:22,969
it would be cool if you could actually

1448
01:03:19,789 --> 01:03:26,089
concentrate and make a CBD a isolate

1449
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:29,838
that's that concentrated you can just

1450
01:03:26,088 --> 01:03:31,670
crash out the crystals CVD a is somewhat

1451
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:34,009
of an elusive thing again just because

1452
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:36,139
of decarboxylation so if you take like

1453
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:37,789
an ethanol extract or if you do anything

1454
01:03:36,139 --> 01:03:39,588
where you have to do multiple

1455
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:41,329
stripping's on route of apps you figure

1456
01:03:39,588 --> 01:03:43,578
that you're going to end up heating it

1457
01:03:41,329 --> 01:03:46,309
up to some point that you may get some

1458
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:49,670
haven't issues decarboxylation but being

1459
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:52,670
able to get CBD a as a crystalline solid

1460
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:54,369
would be really [ __ ] cool because

1461
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:58,400
then you could just you know

1462
01:03:54,369 --> 01:04:00,619
decarboxylate that to be activated CVD

1463
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:03,470
without having all the other fats waxes

1464
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:06,920
and lipids and those are the often the

1465
01:04:03,469 --> 01:04:09,649
culprits for giving those purified

1466
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:13,099
cannabinoids off flavors because when

1467
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:16,960
the fats waxes and lipids are heated up

1468
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:24,710
they thermally degrade and to noxious

1469
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:27,019
smelling compounds well thanks for that

1470
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:30,679
knowledge drop-in welcome skunkman Sam

1471
01:04:27,018 --> 01:04:32,298
and Alec from SC labs to the room I

1472
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:35,179
think we got a full panel gentlemen

1473
01:04:32,298 --> 01:04:40,309
almost 700 people on the live viewing

1474
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:44,538
and the check is bumping testing good

1475
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:46,400
morning you are tested I passed this

1476
01:04:44,539 --> 01:04:48,109
time I found out what was wrong with the

1477
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:52,849
microphone it was plugged in two

1478
01:04:48,108 --> 01:04:55,848
different places and I'd like to ask a

1479
01:04:52,849 --> 01:04:57,430
question I I'm sorry the kind I've

1480
01:04:55,849 --> 01:05:02,599
forgotten your name

1481
01:04:57,429 --> 01:05:05,419
Peter Peter you know I sent off for some

1482
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:07,160
of your stuff and then I was talking to

1483
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:08,610
my friend who still lives in

1484
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:11,969
Phillipsburg campus

1485
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:17,849
and he volunteered to go over to where

1486
01:05:11,969 --> 01:05:19,619
the largest 7080 church plants growing

1487
01:05:17,849 --> 01:05:22,650
that I've ever seen in a long time

1488
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:24,119
besides in Rishikesh India but he

1489
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:29,010
volunteered to go over and dig around

1490
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:30,900
amongst the roots and then me a sample

1491
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:32,610
of the stuff he came back with and I

1492
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:35,130
thought maybe you might be interested in

1493
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:37,289
having that sample to have a look at

1494
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:41,940
because it's just marijuana plants

1495
01:05:37,289 --> 01:05:46,860
growing there yeah we can do is we can

1496
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:49,980
actually test the colonies that are

1497
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:53,720
actually conducive to a cannabis plant

1498
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:56,340
growth in the rhizosphere so we do

1499
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:59,279
microbial analysis basically and we look

1500
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:03,059
at all the different beneficials

1501
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,130
that we know are going to be conducive

1502
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:06,869
to all of the things that we're talking

1503
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:09,420
about and we can actually isolate and

1504
01:06:06,869 --> 01:06:13,049
tell you how many what are called colony

1505
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:16,289
forming units or microorganisms per gram

1506
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:19,140
of soil that you contain not only in the

1507
01:06:16,289 --> 01:06:21,029
soil aggregates but in the in the

1508
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:26,159
rhizosphere so if you wanted to send us

1509
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:29,540
a sample I could pretty much analyze you

1510
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:32,489
know the beneficials that are there and

1511
01:06:29,539 --> 01:06:34,199
and then you can start to do that's

1512
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:38,339
something that our company hopefully

1513
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:41,309
will be in to do in future is is help

1514
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:44,400
people become microbe farmers you know

1515
01:06:41,309 --> 01:06:47,809
and and actually have a precedence on

1516
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:50,880
the amount of colony forming units or

1517
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:52,769
microorganisms per gram of soil that are

1518
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,570
conducive to the results that you guys

1519
01:06:52,769 --> 01:06:57,900
are all talking about which which in a

1520
01:06:54,570 --> 01:07:02,910
relay to every aspect of what those

1521
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:05,400
plants genetic capability I really love

1522
01:07:02,909 --> 01:07:08,159
the panel right now I gotta say just

1523
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:11,220
looking at you know master breeder

1524
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:14,519
skunkman Sam and the work that Wade's

1525
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:17,939
done with the ACDC and the Harlequin you

1526
01:07:14,519 --> 01:07:19,940
got Brian in from vital like trying to

1527
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:22,940
share the good soil information

1528
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:26,030
Alex from Alec from SC labs coming in

1529
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:28,340
who's testing everything Peter with the

1530
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:30,650
soil balance the living bacterias to

1531
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:32,840
symbiotically live on the roots and up

1532
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:35,809
you know and then you've got our

1533
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:38,769
scientist Marx shalt shall dawn in the

1534
01:07:35,809 --> 01:07:41,119
house laying it down Roger what yeah and

1535
01:07:38,769 --> 01:07:44,119
congratulations on your new patent bro

1536
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:45,920
like seriously congratulations and then

1537
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:48,920
listen it doesn't even end there because

1538
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:51,230
then we have Indra old school you know

1539
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:54,710
storyteller extraordinaire with like the

1540
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:57,289
oil history that goes back 30 plus years

1541
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:59,809
and then the future we got Tony vers

1542
01:07:57,289 --> 01:08:02,059
aura who's pumping out products like you

1543
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:04,940
can't even believe xylitol sugars and

1544
01:08:02,059 --> 01:08:06,559
turps syrups and blow in my mind even

1545
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:08,539
dude I'm the bubble man and you all

1546
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:10,940
humble me thank you all for sharing your

1547
01:08:08,539 --> 01:08:13,460
time today and I know the panel or the

1548
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:16,670
chat room right now is absolutely loving

1549
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:19,039
this so thank you everybody for putting

1550
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:21,050
this to all the beautiful synergy man

1551
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:22,970
that you've created so you are an

1552
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:27,190
eclectic human being who's brought some

1553
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:30,289
I'm using in there those years thank you

1554
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:32,869
so I guess what's to talk about maybe a

1555
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:34,430
little bit about chalice I think what

1556
01:08:32,869 --> 01:08:43,130
did they give you a backpack for all

1557
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:45,940
those trophies Tony yeah you know it was

1558
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:49,130
a pretty was a pretty interesting

1559
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:52,809
there's a pretty interesting event still

1560
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:57,369
going on today but I felt kind of geeky

1561
01:08:52,810 --> 01:09:00,650
I think so did Joe but when Alex was

1562
01:08:57,369 --> 01:09:03,819
kind of telling people on did he

1563
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:06,469
disappear from this panel come here oh

1564
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:11,239
it's just such a big pale I see you have

1565
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:13,280
to move yeah so you know I think that

1566
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:14,809
what you guys are talking about it's

1567
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:16,699
really important they have all coming

1568
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:19,610
down to responsibility and also

1569
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:22,099
education you know if you're gonna be in

1570
01:09:19,609 --> 01:09:23,689
the industry you have to take some

1571
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:26,390
responsibility and if we had a

1572
01:09:23,689 --> 01:09:29,869
commission like there's NFL commission

1573
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:31,990
or there's different industries and

1574
01:09:29,869 --> 01:09:33,769
organizations out there that have to

1575
01:09:31,989 --> 01:09:36,500
abide by come

1576
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:38,060
missions and those Commission's haven't

1577
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:41,449
been set up yet

1578
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:43,839
for for cannabis yet we're still still

1579
01:09:41,449 --> 01:09:46,909
working on trying to regulate this and

1580
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:50,210
monitor every gram and make sure people

1581
01:09:46,909 --> 01:09:51,798
are you know in these regulated states

1582
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:53,239
they're not using pesticides and

1583
01:09:51,798 --> 01:09:56,510
concentrating them and putting them into

1584
01:09:53,239 --> 01:10:01,510
edibles and into public which is harm's

1585
01:09:56,510 --> 01:10:04,520
way but there's no real repercussions of

1586
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:06,650
responsibility and so when you look at

1587
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,630
when you look at that and you say okay

1588
01:10:06,649 --> 01:10:10,519
what does that really mean

1589
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:13,609
well there's things that I would like to

1590
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:15,500
say that are what we need to create the

1591
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:18,889
ten commandments if you will the things

1592
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:21,050
that are not acceptable if you're gonna

1593
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:22,700
be in the industry then if you're gonna

1594
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:26,360
be in the industry you need to be held

1595
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:27,590
accountable you know there's things

1596
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:31,339
there's things that are out there that

1597
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:33,949
existed even blow my mind so a lot of

1598
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:38,210
people with the prohibition base

1599
01:10:33,949 --> 01:10:41,329
mentality think that Pacific in the

1600
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:45,279
distillate hold that somehow you can

1601
01:10:41,329 --> 01:10:49,930
make some kind of shitty contaminated

1602
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:54,380
BHO and clean it up into some magical

1603
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:56,659
golden oil that that is that will test

1604
01:10:54,380 --> 01:11:00,020
clean of all contaminants pesticides

1605
01:10:56,659 --> 01:11:03,260
residuals and things and maybe once upon

1606
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:05,150
a time that was like a thing to do like

1607
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:09,409
take somebody's really nasty dirty oil

1608
01:11:05,149 --> 01:11:12,170
and do that but I think that the

1609
01:11:09,409 --> 01:11:16,369
competition that that was held a chalice

1610
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:18,680
and the standards that the labs are

1611
01:11:16,369 --> 01:11:20,779
trying to be preaching to everyone out

1612
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:23,119
there isn't necessarily just about

1613
01:11:20,779 --> 01:11:25,880
pesticides but it's a responsibility as

1614
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:29,390
the grower and the extractor come

1615
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:32,600
together to produce a product that is

1616
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:34,100
acceptable for public consumption since

1617
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,910
there's no Commission and no one's

1618
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:38,960
really regulating that right now

1619
01:11:36,909 --> 01:11:40,670
especially in California where that's

1620
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,980
the biggest you know one of the biggest

1621
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:47,270
markets in the country if not the world

1622
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:51,139
and so in the in

1623
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:54,170
the categories that we had you know with

1624
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:58,520
distillation is we're now we're not

1625
01:11:54,170 --> 01:12:00,829
taking some kind of contaminated shitty

1626
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:03,800
pho and turning it into magic you know

1627
01:12:00,829 --> 01:12:07,609
we're doing the whole clan extractions

1628
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:09,920
on flowers that were grown by

1629
01:12:07,609 --> 01:12:12,859
unbelievable growers with you know

1630
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,359
greenhouse growers like lemon tree all

1631
01:12:12,859 --> 01:12:17,929
organic and what Brian was talking about

1632
01:12:14,359 --> 01:12:19,399
with certified green growers these are

1633
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:22,520
growers that go to particular

1634
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:24,769
certification processes in which they

1635
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:27,080
don't spray their plants they have

1636
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:30,020
healthy genetics then they have a

1637
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:32,720
healthy way of sustaining those genetics

1638
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:36,500
and what I mean by that responsibility

1639
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:38,180
is you know you've got to be able to

1640
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:40,430
have the right starting material so

1641
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:42,260
we're we're starting with the best

1642
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:43,990
material making the best particularly

1643
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:47,090
well that we can make and then a

1644
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:49,599
distillation there's just a final

1645
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:52,369
refinement of cleaning it up to the most

1646
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:55,190
highest concentration so if you have any

1647
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:57,619
any hiccups along the way you're just

1648
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:59,419
going to concentrate your mistakes so

1649
01:12:57,619 --> 01:13:02,869
really when somebody says distillation

1650
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:05,600
think microscope very very very very

1651
01:13:02,869 --> 01:13:08,689
very very strong microscope into what

1652
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:11,870
you're doing and so it's not it's not a

1653
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:14,960
process in which you should do to fix a

1654
01:13:11,869 --> 01:13:16,939
mistake but rather refine your process

1655
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:19,640
to the highest quality and standards

1656
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:22,699
that could be if that's the desired

1657
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:26,900
product and now I'm gonna put some

1658
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:29,479
people on glass so I told some people

1659
01:13:26,899 --> 01:13:31,329
are long I'm gonna go a little further I

1660
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:35,029
hate to do this to people

1661
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:36,109
I'm not gonna call any names out but

1662
01:13:35,029 --> 01:13:39,559
I'll show you some of the things that

1663
01:13:36,109 --> 01:13:42,559
are not acceptable in our industry and

1664
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:45,470
if there was a commission I would find

1665
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:49,160
this person $500,000 in 10 years about

1666
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:53,240
10 years to be alse from the industry

1667
01:13:49,159 --> 01:13:55,639
without without review so if we had a

1668
01:13:53,239 --> 01:13:58,429
commission with cannabis and you saw

1669
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:00,170
what I'm about to show you this person

1670
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:01,210
this these types of people should be

1671
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:03,039
fined

1672
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:04,779
minimum half a million two million

1673
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:07,689
dollars for the damage in which they're

1674
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:09,369
causing and they don't know and we're

1675
01:14:07,689 --> 01:14:12,279
gonna talk about why they got here so

1676
01:14:09,369 --> 01:14:18,988
let's look let's look at this phone and

1677
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:18,988
you will be seeing something oh Jesus

1678
01:14:20,729 --> 01:14:27,218
that's crazy dude

1679
01:14:24,579 --> 01:14:29,649
watch it what you're looking at people

1680
01:14:27,219 --> 01:14:31,510
is so spider mites covered buds come on

1681
01:14:29,649 --> 01:14:34,809
that's what it's like worst case

1682
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:36,190
scenario Oh as bad as it gets if you see

1683
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:42,060
a buddy completely covered like that

1684
01:14:36,189 --> 01:14:46,389
burn it with fire it's not extractable

1685
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:52,000
that made me feel sick exactly made my

1686
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:54,579
heart beat really fast when you get to

1687
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,119
this stage except pull out a [ __ ]

1688
01:14:54,579 --> 01:15:00,729
blowtorch and torture entire garden

1689
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:03,309
that's a negligence at that point maybe

1690
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:06,309
the property that's beyond negligence

1691
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:13,630
that's just outright denial I thought it

1692
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:26,289
was those are crystals I mean not to

1693
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:28,989
smoke ash with mark there was you know I

1694
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:32,500
think there was like 80 or 90% this year

1695
01:15:28,988 --> 01:15:34,359
knowing that put you on blast actually I

1696
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:37,390
feel like there was some change that

1697
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:39,009
happened because there's about 50% even

1698
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:41,980
though even though they knew they were

1699
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:50,409
going into competition mode and they all

1700
01:15:41,979 --> 01:15:53,109
of their stuff so you know you're going

1701
01:15:50,408 --> 01:15:59,559
in the comic and you know they're gonna

1702
01:15:53,109 --> 01:16:01,479
put you they're gonna put you and in

1703
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:03,670
some categories 20% so I was happy to

1704
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:05,829
see the numbers change substantially

1705
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:08,140
down because people would be coming more

1706
01:16:05,829 --> 01:16:16,448
and more where and when they talk about

1707
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:18,780
pesticides something aside

1708
01:16:16,448 --> 01:16:22,288
there's there's the word is death

1709
01:16:18,779 --> 01:16:25,929
there's there's catastrophic human

1710
01:16:22,288 --> 01:16:29,768
change that can happen when you are

1711
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:31,090
consuming pesticides or combinations of

1712
01:16:29,769 --> 01:16:33,329
pesticides which we're going to talk

1713
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:37,300
about it and concentrate some of them

1714
01:16:33,328 --> 01:16:43,090
and tape them directly to your brain but

1715
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:46,150
yeah we talked about if you take lung

1716
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:49,150
from say a mothering room and they use

1717
01:16:46,149 --> 01:16:51,578
equal 20 and its stomach and it's in the

1718
01:16:49,149 --> 01:16:53,078
plant and they clone it and then they're

1719
01:16:51,578 --> 01:16:55,710
like okay we've got tons of these clones

1720
01:16:53,078 --> 01:17:00,279
and that grower never uses pesticides

1721
01:16:55,710 --> 01:17:03,189
tough titty you just you're growing with

1722
01:17:00,279 --> 01:17:05,229
contaminated genetics and so the

1723
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:08,500
genetics is extremely important if we

1724
01:17:05,229 --> 01:17:10,569
all started from seed if we all started

1725
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:13,569
from seed we have a very fair shot of

1726
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:15,759
having something and that's clean but if

1727
01:17:13,569 --> 01:17:17,828
you start from a clone you need to have

1728
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,099
a clean room so when you walk when I

1729
01:17:17,828 --> 01:17:22,179
walked into other people's grows and

1730
01:17:20,099 --> 01:17:24,309
trust me there's examples of the

1731
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:26,739
opposite of what I showed you like when

1732
01:17:24,309 --> 01:17:29,440
we talk about you know we're working

1733
01:17:26,738 --> 01:17:34,299
with green dragon food is the complete

1734
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:36,669
opposite of a girl like that who's

1735
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:38,739
monitoring all of these things so if you

1736
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:40,449
have if you see a grow and somebody's

1737
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:41,468
like oh yeah where do you get your

1738
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:44,408
clothes from where do you get your

1739
01:17:41,469 --> 01:17:47,469
mothers from and in there is no mother

1740
01:17:44,408 --> 01:17:50,288
row okay and your cloning from your

1741
01:17:47,469 --> 01:17:52,779
garden so if your cloning from your

1742
01:17:50,288 --> 01:17:55,750
garden you better be the best [ __ ]

1743
01:17:52,779 --> 01:17:56,920
grower and have all of these points in

1744
01:17:55,750 --> 01:18:01,689
place and all these checks in place

1745
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:05,139
because imagine you're this is how this

1746
01:18:01,689 --> 01:18:07,448
garden got this way okay at one point

1747
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:10,029
they had to grow their first polar their

1748
01:18:07,448 --> 01:18:11,558
second pole was pretty decent and all of

1749
01:18:10,029 --> 01:18:15,368
a sudden some of the girls got a little

1750
01:18:11,559 --> 01:18:16,809
caught the weather changed right they

1751
01:18:15,368 --> 01:18:19,328
get a little bit of a condition you get

1752
01:18:16,809 --> 01:18:22,420
a little scratchy throat oh let's uh

1753
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:25,840
let's use a little uh let's use this

1754
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:28,760
remedy here and it might be a pesticide

1755
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:31,940
or it might be some kind of chemical

1756
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:34,369
that will try to help this car so

1757
01:18:31,939 --> 01:18:36,049
instead of this instead of you know

1758
01:18:34,369 --> 01:18:37,880
there being a cough once a week there's

1759
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:41,989
a little scratch a little cough then

1760
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:44,000
they clone it so now you cloned your

1761
01:18:41,989 --> 01:18:46,760
first condition and you've passed it

1762
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:51,260
along the chain then let's say if there

1763
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:54,650
was humans let's say that that

1764
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:56,060
particular batch now has cancer okay and

1765
01:18:54,649 --> 01:18:58,909
then you clone it now you've got the

1766
01:18:56,060 --> 01:19:00,980
coughing got cancer then the next time

1767
01:18:58,909 --> 01:19:02,510
well let's just throw aids at it let's

1768
01:19:00,979 --> 01:19:04,519
throw a mess at it let's just start

1769
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:07,760
throwing every possible health condition

1770
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:09,920
you could possibly throw into this into

1771
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:12,530
this gene mix and keep mixing and keep

1772
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:17,079
cloning and click cloning so eventually

1773
01:19:12,529 --> 01:19:20,210
where you get is you've got cocktails of

1774
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:21,979
pesticides and different chemicals that

1775
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:23,659
you're fighting well I've got thrifts

1776
01:19:21,979 --> 01:19:27,859
I've got spider mites I've got green

1777
01:19:23,659 --> 01:19:32,899
moss that produces more heart and having

1778
01:19:27,859 --> 01:19:36,500
topside spiders full-on webs around your

1779
01:19:32,899 --> 01:19:40,179
buds it's not acceptable vacuuming them

1780
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:47,359
up washing them in hydrogen peroxide

1781
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:49,310
vacuuming them off I would drop a

1782
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:51,019
nuclear bomb on that facility I would

1783
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:52,640
first go and apologize to all my

1784
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:54,650
neighbors and let them punch me in the

1785
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:57,350
face as many times as they wanted to

1786
01:19:54,649 --> 01:19:59,689
because I'm seriously sick to my stomach

1787
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:03,829
for their neighbors I'm not even joking

1788
01:19:59,689 --> 01:20:08,509
that is I can honestly say Tony but I've

1789
01:20:03,829 --> 01:20:12,319
seen much worse we're visiting visiting

1790
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:16,520
somewhere in your own garden a people's

1791
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:19,429
greenhouse especially novice growers who

1792
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:21,440
just have no experience yeah I had to

1793
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:24,980
say I saw the similar situation in Los

1794
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:27,589
Angeles back in the late 90s and the

1795
01:20:24,979 --> 01:20:31,009
entire the entire garden which was

1796
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:32,750
probably 8 by 8 and everybody looked

1797
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:38,449
just like that and the guy was like

1798
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:41,149
what's wrong thing yeah fire fire I was

1799
01:20:38,449 --> 01:20:42,649
like well you know you could produce a

1800
01:20:41,149 --> 01:20:46,488
special product that we

1801
01:20:42,649 --> 01:20:48,769
to produce coke mighty weed yeah well if

1802
01:20:46,488 --> 01:20:52,189
you were yeah exactly if you were

1803
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:53,270
growing for the bugs what I said I said

1804
01:20:52,189 --> 01:20:56,000
I don't know if you're just in the

1805
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:58,370
business for baiting spider mites

1806
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,920
mutated spider mites for our generations

1807
01:20:58,369 --> 01:21:03,140
to come because you've done an excellent

1808
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:05,359
job with cocktail bombs of every type of

1809
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:07,610
pesticide you could possibly throw at

1810
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:10,729
this thing and you've got a topside

1811
01:21:07,609 --> 01:21:15,500
party I mean these are these this is

1812
01:21:10,729 --> 01:21:24,079
like two pots come back and nothing but

1813
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:26,359
again okay if you use pesticides your

1814
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:29,960
plants would have looked a lot better it

1815
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:32,059
just would be terrible for you listen

1816
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:36,500
since you started talking Tony the look

1817
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:38,150
on Brian and Wade and Peter's face has

1818
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:42,100
just been because we started this

1819
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:42,099
conversation with the highest integrity

1820
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:47,750
children's alike this is why we're doing

1821
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:50,510
this it is kind of crazy to see just

1822
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:52,550
metaphorically how ridiculous Li's some

1823
01:21:50,510 --> 01:22:06,380
of these contests are man like what are

1824
01:21:52,550 --> 01:22:08,480
people thinking we as a group need to

1825
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:11,210
take people like that and do the game of

1826
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:13,968
thrones strip em naked walk platinum

1827
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:15,170
with bills shame shame that's what you'd

1828
01:22:13,969 --> 01:22:16,789
be doing at shallots you should be

1829
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:21,050
walking we'd have those bastards walk

1830
01:22:16,789 --> 01:22:22,850
around naked yelling [ __ ] it's one thing

1831
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:24,800
for a contest it's one thing for a

1832
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:26,750
recreational market the fact that it

1833
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,449
could be leeching over into this

1834
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:31,069
medicinal component and to this like for

1835
01:22:29,448 --> 01:22:33,799
people who are really sick like it

1836
01:22:31,069 --> 01:22:35,929
becomes it becomes really not funny and

1837
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:38,239
on a side note and I'm gonna get right

1838
01:22:35,929 --> 01:22:40,940
back to you Tony I have to shout out a

1839
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:42,619
chant because I forgot at Ken how could

1840
01:22:40,939 --> 01:22:44,658
you forget Etienne he's been first in

1841
01:22:42,619 --> 01:22:47,539
the room every day for the last hundred

1842
01:22:44,658 --> 01:22:49,698
and forty six episodes the guy's been an

1843
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:51,619
activist longer than I've been into

1844
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:53,388
cannabis he's definitely one of the

1845
01:22:51,619 --> 01:22:55,010
pioneers and he's one of the kindest

1846
01:22:53,389 --> 01:22:55,529
Souls I've ever met so I do want to

1847
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:57,869
shout

1848
01:22:55,529 --> 01:23:00,840
as well as I already did the rest of the

1849
01:22:57,869 --> 01:23:01,489
panel my good friend Betty thanks for

1850
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:04,319
being you

1851
01:23:01,489 --> 01:23:06,719
thank you kindly and I want to give a

1852
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:07,309
shout out to my biological father he

1853
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:10,199
passed away

1854
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:11,760
day before yesterday so thank you very

1855
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:13,739
much for the love and support everybody

1856
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,480
have shown and I'm doing my best

1857
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,859
everything's good and I appreciate the

1858
01:23:15,479 --> 01:23:21,750
love they're both mine mm-hmm

1859
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:23,489
much love and you know and just just

1860
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:25,529
just to kind of throw in you know just

1861
01:23:23,489 --> 01:23:27,689
from what onion you know everybody was

1862
01:23:25,529 --> 01:23:29,189
just kind of discussing with regards you

1863
01:23:27,689 --> 01:23:31,679
know kind of some nasty you know

1864
01:23:29,189 --> 01:23:33,419
practices oftentimes unknowingly nice

1865
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,920
and practices completely ignorant

1866
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,779
you know practices that are being made

1867
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,460
you know especially around using a lot

1868
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:39,779
of these systemic pesticides you know

1869
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:41,640
one of the something that just

1870
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:43,649
complicates the whole topic that much

1871
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:45,690
more also is you know the difference of

1872
01:23:43,649 --> 01:23:49,049
whether or not plants were grown under

1873
01:23:45,689 --> 01:23:50,879
the Sun exposed UV a B and C versus any

1874
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:53,369
type of indoor lighting which is

1875
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,260
completely void any type of UV a V or C

1876
01:23:53,369 --> 01:23:58,079
which is one of the biggest thing that

1877
01:23:55,260 --> 01:24:01,230
is what's breaking down systemic

1878
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:02,609
residual pesticides you know and so for

1879
01:24:01,229 --> 01:24:04,859
so long you know working with in the

1880
01:24:02,609 --> 01:24:06,569
hydroponic industry you Hydra stores you

1881
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:08,819
know so much information was passed out

1882
01:24:06,569 --> 01:24:10,799
to the community and you know on forums

1883
01:24:08,819 --> 01:24:14,130
everybody thought you know oh the you

1884
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:16,170
know eagle 20 lasts 60 days or 40 days

1885
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:17,789
residually on the plant and you know

1886
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:20,460
it's just this kind of like ignorantly

1887
01:24:17,789 --> 01:24:23,010
agreed-upon kind of thought you know to

1888
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:25,230
justify you know somewhat unscrupulous

1889
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:27,210
actions you know people just getting

1890
01:24:25,229 --> 01:24:28,979
away with spraying whenever they spray

1891
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:31,050
because they didn't preventively take

1892
01:24:28,979 --> 01:24:34,349
care of their issues instead they're

1893
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:36,360
reacting to full web mode you know so

1894
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:39,450
and so you know with that being said

1895
01:24:36,359 --> 01:24:41,099
it's like once moms are treated or

1896
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:43,500
what-have-you and then grown and you

1897
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:46,590
know indoor lighting mom runs you know

1898
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:48,569
I'm you know I will I'm very curious I'm

1899
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:51,779
how much longer the you know kind of

1900
01:24:48,569 --> 01:24:53,369
systemic residue is compared to you know

1901
01:24:51,779 --> 01:24:55,259
something that might be thrown under the

1902
01:24:53,369 --> 01:24:56,369
Sun you know which in its own is gonna

1903
01:24:55,260 --> 01:25:01,079
have a really long residue residue

1904
01:24:56,369 --> 01:25:04,199
effect but mom in the whole situation to

1905
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:07,710
you bring up a good point because the

1906
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:09,349
ego 20 belongs to the class of easels

1907
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:11,810
and all easels

1908
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:14,240
acquire biological degradation to

1909
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:17,240
basically degrade those in the

1910
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:19,069
environment and again in an indoor

1911
01:25:17,239 --> 01:25:23,149
environment where you have a different

1912
01:25:19,069 --> 01:25:25,399
microbiome than you outside and like you

1913
01:25:23,149 --> 01:25:28,099
bring up a good point with photolytic

1914
01:25:25,399 --> 01:25:30,019
degradation but the microbes the

1915
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:31,190
Pseudomonas that live in the soil are

1916
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:32,930
basically the things that are

1917
01:25:31,189 --> 01:25:37,129
responsible for most of the degradation

1918
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:39,380
of those things and most hazal

1919
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:41,420
fungicides like Mike on azole and stuff

1920
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:43,369
like that are very low mammalian

1921
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:44,960
toxicity you know they don't really have

1922
01:25:43,369 --> 01:25:47,989
much I mean they're used for athlete's

1923
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:51,590
foot and you know you know those types

1924
01:25:47,989 --> 01:25:53,659
of you know topical applications for you

1925
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:55,640
you know yeast infections and stuff like

1926
01:25:53,659 --> 01:25:58,250
that because they're very broad spectrum

1927
01:25:55,640 --> 01:26:00,619
and they're typically low toxicity what

1928
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:02,239
is the issue is wonder when they're heat

1929
01:26:00,619 --> 01:26:04,489
it will concentrate it and when they're

1930
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:06,739
heated up because most of those are

1931
01:26:04,489 --> 01:26:08,050
chock-full of nitrogen's and a lot of

1932
01:26:06,739 --> 01:26:11,960
those nitrogen containing compounds

1933
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:13,850
degrade to all kinds of nitro so and

1934
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:16,100
oxides and all kinds of Hofmann

1935
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:20,840
degradation products that you don't want

1936
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:25,520
to be inhaling into your into your lungs

1937
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:28,220
isn't formaldehyde one of those mountain

1938
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:30,620
is used in jarred ation product that's

1939
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:32,480
just almost ubiquitous in the

1940
01:26:30,619 --> 01:26:35,390
environment right now because it's used

1941
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:38,179
in so many different applications as a

1942
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:40,880
monomer in plastics the monomer of big

1943
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:43,880
plot of big lighters which is basically

1944
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,949
formalin just poly formaldehyde is

1945
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:47,900
formaldehyde itself and so yeah when

1946
01:26:45,949 --> 01:26:49,819
those things thermally degrade they

1947
01:26:47,899 --> 01:26:52,279
released formaldehyde what they're

1948
01:26:49,819 --> 01:26:54,439
finding now is paraffin based candles

1949
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:56,659
like I don't want to call them thrown

1950
01:26:54,439 --> 01:26:59,839
under the bus but like Yankee Candle

1951
01:26:56,659 --> 01:27:03,109
brand and most popular brand candles

1952
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:06,730
that are paraffin based have a lot of

1953
01:27:03,109 --> 01:27:09,229
residual formaldehyde and formaldehyde

1954
01:27:06,729 --> 01:27:11,239
components and degradation crap that's

1955
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:13,819
left behind and they don't know if

1956
01:27:11,239 --> 01:27:15,380
that's you know responsible for you know

1957
01:27:13,819 --> 01:27:18,289
cancer or anything but it's just

1958
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:20,600
exposing people more to formaldehyde and

1959
01:27:18,289 --> 01:27:22,100
yeah formaldehyde is typically a thing

1960
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,620
you don't want to be exposed to if you

1961
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:26,660
can help

1962
01:27:23,619 --> 01:27:28,579
you know what to get back the easels for

1963
01:27:26,659 --> 01:27:32,809
a second the thing with you who you call

1964
01:27:28,579 --> 01:27:34,909
it a nasal hey there Connie Connie those

1965
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:37,910
are man there's like Teddy Coty's all

1966
01:27:34,909 --> 01:27:42,019
propiconazole flu Silas all there's so

1967
01:27:37,909 --> 01:27:45,920
many ones it's just amazing somehow that

1968
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:48,260
the one that one thermally heats you

1969
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:50,899
know can degrade and give off cyanide

1970
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:52,850
it's the one in Eagle 20 right it's just

1971
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:56,089
amazing that that's the one that's so

1972
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:58,010
widely used there's so many other ones

1973
01:27:56,090 --> 01:28:00,199
that you don't have the cyanide issue

1974
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:01,670
with it all and that's the only one

1975
01:28:00,199 --> 01:28:03,529
really that I could think of that it's

1976
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:05,420
cut that you know you heat this up and

1977
01:28:03,529 --> 01:28:08,649
basically it degrades the hydrogen

1978
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:10,670
cyanide well it's at a much lower

1979
01:28:08,649 --> 01:28:12,710
concentration typically but again when

1980
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:14,510
you concentrate these things into

1981
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:16,789
concentrates God knows if you have

1982
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:19,400
something that's in high concentration

1983
01:28:16,789 --> 01:28:22,369
could you actually get enough cyanide to

1984
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:24,339
basically get the dab that will

1985
01:28:22,369 --> 01:28:26,869
essentially kill you because you're

1986
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:29,930
overwhelmed by cyanide I don't think

1987
01:28:26,869 --> 01:28:33,170
that that's actually possible unless

1988
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:35,720
it's there in like super super high

1989
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:38,359
levels because if it's based on the

1990
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:41,210
actual toxic dose of hydrogen cyanide

1991
01:28:38,359 --> 01:28:43,670
you would need that a lotta evil 20 in

1992
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:46,039
your dab to basically kill over from it

1993
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:48,470
well importantly let me for scute my

1994
01:28:46,039 --> 01:28:54,380
white rose those those that the

1995
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:56,570
synthetics over time with the different

1996
01:28:54,380 --> 01:29:00,409
extractions let's let's stick the bubble

1997
01:28:56,569 --> 01:29:04,479
hash for one moment and pesticide what

1998
01:29:00,409 --> 01:29:07,039
we do now is we work for different farms

1999
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:09,109
particularly for whether it's prana or

2000
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:11,090
bubbleman no but let's let's stick to

2001
01:29:09,109 --> 01:29:15,319
prana because that's the one that I

2002
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:17,360
usually taking in take on CV material

2003
01:29:15,319 --> 01:29:21,199
and I've bought material from from Wade

2004
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:23,329
before and from from Brian so on the

2005
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:25,909
opposite note hats off to the people

2006
01:29:23,329 --> 01:29:28,609
that actually know how to grow and

2007
01:29:25,909 --> 01:29:31,159
understand that from the second Billy is

2008
01:29:28,609 --> 01:29:33,139
out of the plan there's there's resin

2009
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:35,420
there and what you put into the plan is

2010
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:36,240
what you're going to get out of it every

2011
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:37,800
time and

2012
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:39,149
so my hats are off to the people that

2013
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:41,940
are actually doing a good job because

2014
01:29:39,149 --> 01:29:44,219
those are the ones that I seek out but

2015
01:29:41,939 --> 01:29:47,189
we have a account with se in a bulk

2016
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:50,909
testing and now what we do is as soon as

2017
01:29:47,189 --> 01:29:54,569
we get flowers we we say okay well is

2018
01:29:50,909 --> 01:29:56,309
there pesticide tests done at the lab if

2019
01:29:54,569 --> 01:29:57,899
the answer is no then we send the

2020
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:59,610
flowers off we take 10 grams of the

2021
01:29:57,899 --> 01:30:03,329
flowers we press those flowers off we

2022
01:29:59,609 --> 01:30:05,789
take that flower oil and we send that

2023
01:30:03,329 --> 01:30:08,550
off we clean the plates and clean

2024
01:30:05,789 --> 01:30:12,810
everything and sterilized nuv between

2025
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:14,130
each one of those runs and flowers and

2026
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:15,600
we have one particular we have three

2027
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:18,390
presses so we have one particular press

2028
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:21,630
we can dedicate to that so we get a

2029
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:26,850
constant trick we get a the plant might

2030
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:28,440
test under the the pesticide level but

2031
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:30,030
then if you make a flower oil and this

2032
01:30:28,439 --> 01:30:33,089
is why I would say a lot of people are

2033
01:30:30,029 --> 01:30:34,739
kind of against flower rosin because you

2034
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:36,029
have to have extremely clean flowers

2035
01:30:34,739 --> 01:30:38,699
because then you're just you're

2036
01:30:36,029 --> 01:30:40,590
concentrating all of these oils and

2037
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:45,090
anything that's on the plant right there

2038
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:46,680
without any kind of first second pass or

2039
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:49,829
any kind of refinement like what Indra

2040
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:51,900
does you know with a hydrocarbon or

2041
01:30:49,829 --> 01:30:53,550
anyone else that would use a solvent

2042
01:30:51,899 --> 01:30:55,739
they've got different passes and

2043
01:30:53,550 --> 01:31:00,869
refinements that they can get a lot of

2044
01:30:55,739 --> 01:31:02,909
things out so we a lot of crazy failures

2045
01:31:00,869 --> 01:31:04,470
so to the point where I actually called

2046
01:31:02,909 --> 01:31:05,639
my manager to tell IC Labs hey by the

2047
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:08,220
way we're not making this we're just

2048
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:10,289
testing batches for different people

2049
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:13,050
that want us to buy and it's failing

2050
01:31:10,289 --> 01:31:15,689
pretty poorly but in the water hash

2051
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:17,940
though with flowers you might not see it

2052
01:31:15,689 --> 01:31:19,529
until it's concentrated and then it's

2053
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:20,969
too late and then you're down the road

2054
01:31:19,529 --> 01:31:24,569
with all of your medicine and your lab

2055
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:26,159
contaminated so there's a step there but

2056
01:31:24,569 --> 01:31:30,479
with with particular water hash what I

2057
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:32,729
see I've seen this twice now not saying

2058
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:34,379
anyone's names or anything like that but

2059
01:31:32,729 --> 01:31:39,149
these are different farmers that are

2060
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:41,310
growing outdoors in greenhouse and the

2061
01:31:39,149 --> 01:31:43,250
trim itself maybe they said oh well we

2062
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:46,440
don't use any pesticides we're clean

2063
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:47,760
okay that might be fair but some of my

2064
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:50,219
friends that said hey do you want to buy

2065
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,350
you know this full-spectrum bubble hash

2066
01:31:50,219 --> 01:31:56,029
and the bubble hash was testing in the

2067
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:59,579
parts / carts for million like 2 to 4 so

2068
01:31:56,029 --> 01:32:01,409
washing the residue separating the resin

2069
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:08,399
might have might have got why what was

2070
01:32:01,409 --> 01:32:10,319
the dominant Tony oh it was micro micro

2071
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:13,769
butanol or whatever my club you know

2072
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:16,049
company yeah I was like bro we'd sent

2073
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:18,120
something to you it was like 4 part it

2074
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:22,890
was like a 4 not point for not pointing

2075
01:32:18,119 --> 01:32:25,738
on the one point or it was 4 and that

2076
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:27,449
was any rosin concentration they thought

2077
01:32:25,738 --> 01:32:30,059
that maybe the hash didn't have it so

2078
01:32:27,448 --> 01:32:33,539
they tested the bubble and then they

2079
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:36,390
tested the hash rosin when both both of

2080
01:32:33,539 --> 01:32:38,488
them tested highly positive so what I'm

2081
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:40,829
getting at is that for whatever reason

2082
01:32:38,488 --> 01:32:42,809
even if you're washing and separating

2083
01:32:40,829 --> 01:32:44,550
the resin there might you might be able

2084
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:46,350
to not see any PM because we talked

2085
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:48,360
about this before we're actually around

2086
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:52,110
the resin heads you might not actually

2087
01:32:48,359 --> 01:32:54,569
see any p.m. but the pesticides are

2088
01:32:52,109 --> 01:32:56,609
getting in that are attaching themselves

2089
01:32:54,569 --> 01:33:01,319
are getting into that resin in some

2090
01:32:56,609 --> 01:33:03,539
capacity and ester flour the resin not

2091
01:33:01,319 --> 01:33:05,549
the plant material but you didn't test

2092
01:33:03,539 --> 01:33:06,988
the plant material I didn't have the

2093
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:10,199
plant material to test they were trying

2094
01:33:06,988 --> 01:33:11,488
to sell Oh bad news really they're gonna

2095
01:33:10,198 --> 01:33:15,539
give us bubble and then they were trying

2096
01:33:11,488 --> 01:33:17,698
to give us hash rosin and both of them

2097
01:33:15,539 --> 01:33:19,380
would test positive but what I'm getting

2098
01:33:17,698 --> 01:33:23,669
at is the resin so somebody washed it

2099
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:26,670
separated dried it went through that

2100
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:27,710
process it's still in the resin is what

2101
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:32,130
I'm getting at

2102
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:34,590
so it's not just in its inherently in

2103
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:36,300
just that in the actual resident so so

2104
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:38,850
what I'm hearing is going on a lot is

2105
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:40,890
people are even like testing their flour

2106
01:33:38,850 --> 01:33:42,719
and it's coming in clean and then when

2107
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:45,300
it concentrates then they're seeing

2108
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:48,329
signs of some of these other toxic

2109
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:49,110
pesticides that was in reason why I was

2110
01:33:48,329 --> 01:33:51,510
asking

2111
01:33:49,109 --> 01:33:53,819
that's what we're seeing here is you're

2112
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:57,960
not seeing in the flour you think the

2113
01:33:53,819 --> 01:34:00,569
flowers process the flour into a hash or

2114
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:02,010
a rosin in this case and now the rosin

2115
01:34:00,569 --> 01:34:04,019
is probably out hot is that was that

2116
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:05,730
what I'm hearing the Trinity

2117
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:09,270
that's one of the things that's like

2118
01:34:05,729 --> 01:34:11,039
really scary to me because here are all

2119
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:14,730
these people stores in plants from all

2120
01:34:11,039 --> 01:34:16,469
over the place and that who knows how

2121
01:34:14,729 --> 01:34:19,589
many generations down the line there

2122
01:34:16,469 --> 01:34:21,329
could have been this you know toxic

2123
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:23,069
chemical use where it's still going to

2124
01:34:21,329 --> 01:34:27,090
show up so that's something that well

2125
01:34:23,069 --> 01:34:29,219
vital and working with yeah yeah I was

2126
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:32,430
just to say here's worth sample

2127
01:34:29,219 --> 01:34:34,560
preparation and sample collection you're

2128
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:36,480
processing a whole lot of material but

2129
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:40,260
you're only taking a bud from this

2130
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:42,269
branch over here well again you need to

2131
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:44,610
be able to represent the entirety of the

2132
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:47,580
material if you're going to be doing a

2133
01:34:44,609 --> 01:34:48,988
statistically significant measurement

2134
01:34:47,579 --> 01:34:51,119
well I think we got to take a more

2135
01:34:48,988 --> 01:34:54,689
proactive approach on the other end of

2136
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:57,930
things and provide clean plants so

2137
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:59,729
farmers can be assured that they're

2138
01:34:57,930 --> 01:35:05,640
gonna make medicine that is acceptable

2139
01:34:59,729 --> 01:35:09,149
in our modern test ride facilities it's

2140
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:11,280
not like if you're buying wholesale or

2141
01:35:09,149 --> 01:35:13,920
you know you have a deal and it's like

2142
01:35:11,279 --> 01:35:15,689
okay someone's bringing you some herb it

2143
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,909
looks really good but you know you don't

2144
01:35:15,689 --> 01:35:20,609
know whether or not it's contaminated

2145
01:35:17,909 --> 01:35:24,238
you need to do really statistically

2146
01:35:20,609 --> 01:35:26,639
valid measurement of the entire batch to

2147
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:30,238
make sure that you don't have sun

2148
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:33,810
contamination surprises like those

2149
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:34,949
absolutely well the way we go ahead yeah

2150
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:36,660
real quick that's actually what we're

2151
01:35:34,949 --> 01:35:39,389
using the flour rosin for so somebody

2152
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:42,389
has ten pounds you could you could take

2153
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:45,660
20 grams randomly from those ten pounds

2154
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:46,619
stuff a couple screens press out twenty

2155
01:35:45,659 --> 01:35:48,840
twenty grams

2156
01:35:46,619 --> 01:35:50,219
get a black all those batches that's why

2157
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:52,770
I like flour oz and then you get the

2158
01:35:50,219 --> 01:35:55,020
flour oz just for testing purposes yeah

2159
01:35:52,770 --> 01:35:57,120
that's a good way to test okay now I've

2160
01:35:55,020 --> 01:36:00,180
got I've got two or three grams and sent

2161
01:35:57,119 --> 01:36:03,029
to the lab and do that it's a super good

2162
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:05,850
way to to check that before you get to

2163
01:36:03,029 --> 01:36:10,619
down but I also think this opens up a

2164
01:36:05,850 --> 01:36:13,620
new a new era of clone certification

2165
01:36:10,619 --> 01:36:17,829
meaning when the plants in its mother

2166
01:36:13,619 --> 01:36:21,909
stage take a take a cut of the lead

2167
01:36:17,829 --> 01:36:24,010
go get the leaf tested and get us and

2168
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:25,930
see if we can get maybe this doesn't

2169
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:27,190
exist yet but I thought we maybe it

2170
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:29,380
could get there an ST could probably

2171
01:36:27,189 --> 01:36:31,210
answer this but if there was a way to

2172
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:33,789
test the leaf not the bud while it's in

2173
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:34,890
bed yeah yeah no that's something that's

2174
01:36:33,789 --> 01:36:37,119
when it's gonna be in the highest

2175
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:38,500
concentration ever I've seen by the

2176
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:41,500
plant you know in the time when it was

2177
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:44,289
dipped so I mean just from me I mean if

2178
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:46,510
we had a mother so we say okay where are

2179
01:36:44,289 --> 01:36:49,269
these clones this mother was certified

2180
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:51,670
then we made these clones these clones

2181
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:54,370
are now have to go to a certification

2182
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:57,159
process and then the genetic banks is

2183
01:36:54,369 --> 01:36:58,390
where it starts so if you're gonna be a

2184
01:36:57,159 --> 01:37:00,729
clone bank then you're gonna be a

2185
01:36:58,390 --> 01:37:03,280
genetic thing you need to have these

2186
01:37:00,729 --> 01:37:06,039
certification processes because farmers

2187
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:07,149
like what Brian is saying is like say

2188
01:37:06,039 --> 01:37:10,600
let's say the farmer does everything

2189
01:37:07,149 --> 01:37:13,359
right he's got live soils he's doing the

2190
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:17,440
greenhouses he's got in controlled he

2191
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:19,210
[ __ ] slaves over months he's bought

2192
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:21,909
all these these clones he's like I'm an

2193
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:24,250
all organic grower he doesn't test

2194
01:37:21,909 --> 01:37:27,130
positive and his flowers somebody says

2195
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:28,479
okay great we're getting this you know

2196
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:30,010
our collectors gonna purchase these

2197
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:32,709
flowers and make it into all this great

2198
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:35,860
amazing medicine we do a quick rosin

2199
01:37:32,710 --> 01:37:39,250
test or a first batch of bubble and it's

2200
01:37:35,859 --> 01:37:41,589
warm long and then you know it and now

2201
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:44,710
they failed but they didn't do anything

2202
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:49,180
particularly wrong this is happening all

2203
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:52,000
over so now we're actually destroying

2204
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:54,039
and pushing out good farmers that are

2205
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,880
trying to try to be in the industry

2206
01:37:54,039 --> 01:38:00,130
because we don't have this is this very

2207
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:02,409
significant first step checks and

2208
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:04,060
balance on the genetics right you know

2209
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:05,319
and Tony and you know on that you know I

2210
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:06,910
think I think there's a there's a couple

2211
01:38:05,319 --> 01:38:09,460
couple things I wanted to kind of bring

2212
01:38:06,909 --> 01:38:11,019
up on that point um as you know with if

2213
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:12,670
you're farming you're going to Irv you

2214
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:15,190
know it's I mean it's pretty cut and dry

2215
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:18,880
you know you either sprayed a systemic

2216
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:21,129
or you did it you either source treated

2217
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:23,619
clones that you know we're treated by

2218
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:25,510
you know your mom's the mom plants are

2219
01:38:23,619 --> 01:38:28,449
treated with a medical predator forbid

2220
01:38:25,510 --> 01:38:30,190
or whatever you know or you're going

2221
01:38:28,449 --> 01:38:31,179
them in the house or you know from seed

2222
01:38:30,189 --> 01:38:34,178
where you're able to

2223
01:38:31,179 --> 01:38:37,569
control that supply chain aspect that

2224
01:38:34,179 --> 01:38:40,359
much more or even more horrifying you

2225
01:38:37,569 --> 01:38:43,179
know and you know you you could run into

2226
01:38:40,359 --> 01:38:45,429
this whole idea which in the National

2227
01:38:43,179 --> 01:38:47,708
Organic Program there's an acronym for

2228
01:38:45,429 --> 01:38:49,689
it it's called uric you re C which is

2229
01:38:47,708 --> 01:38:52,389
unavoidable residual environmental

2230
01:38:49,689 --> 01:38:54,070
contamination and it's a term used to

2231
01:38:52,389 --> 01:38:56,739
like that the National Organic Program

2232
01:38:54,069 --> 01:38:59,170
has an effect to help organic products

2233
01:38:56,738 --> 01:39:00,549
still get on the market you know for

2234
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:02,019
people that are certified organic but

2235
01:39:00,550 --> 01:39:03,939
you know they're in between the

2236
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:06,189
neighboring strawberry farm and grape

2237
01:39:03,939 --> 01:39:08,409
farm who like aerial dive-bombs with

2238
01:39:06,189 --> 01:39:10,570
like micro butanol you know but yet

2239
01:39:08,408 --> 01:39:12,908
there are certified organic you know and

2240
01:39:10,569 --> 01:39:15,488
this whole kind of idea of trace

2241
01:39:12,908 --> 01:39:17,649
hartford billion detectable levels of

2242
01:39:15,488 --> 01:39:19,958
these pesticides you know coming from

2243
01:39:17,649 --> 01:39:21,788
the inputs that we use you know and

2244
01:39:19,958 --> 01:39:24,670
source you know for certain

2245
01:39:21,788 --> 01:39:27,488
dirty sources of compost I can Colorado

2246
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:29,559
where you know kind of lighting people

2247
01:39:27,488 --> 01:39:32,049
off for a minute Chlo Priya and it came

2248
01:39:29,559 --> 01:39:34,538
back to this you know heavy source of

2249
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:37,329
compost that's you know that's that's

2250
01:39:34,538 --> 01:39:39,188
you know ultimately being made from kind

2251
01:39:37,328 --> 01:39:40,328
of municipality kind of lawn trimmings

2252
01:39:39,189 --> 01:39:42,519
you know that are treated as

2253
01:39:40,328 --> 01:39:45,340
imidacloprid and so so I mean the whole

2254
01:39:42,519 --> 01:39:49,208
input view reality is such a major issue

2255
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:52,349
now because of all these unlisted in

2256
01:39:49,208 --> 01:39:52,349
sorry one second

2257
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:57,239
well and coupled with the ability to

2258
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:59,279
look at the part per billion level

2259
01:39:57,239 --> 01:40:01,199
because when you look at part per

2260
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:05,219
billion you're looking and you're gonna

2261
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:08,389
find just a whole host of everything

2262
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:10,890
because it's just right I liken it

2263
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:15,060
taking a lint brush to a New York City

2264
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:16,800
sidewalk you're gonna off hey Mitch was

2265
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:18,600
saying something good we're talking

2266
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:20,310
about that you can get right back to it

2267
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:21,840
in one second Alec I just wanted to

2268
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:24,450
mention what Mitch had said in the room

2269
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:26,550
which was a simple you know asking these

2270
01:40:24,449 --> 01:40:29,309
growers when there's you know giving

2271
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:32,159
their material to be to be processed or

2272
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:33,720
first tested you know to get a sample of

2273
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:35,399
their water or at least be told what

2274
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:37,230
kind of water that are using and what

2275
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:38,969
the nutrients are like what are you

2276
01:40:37,229 --> 01:40:40,259
using just tell me what you're using I

2277
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:42,570
want a list I want to know what you're

2278
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:46,020
using I don't want to find it later it's

2279
01:40:42,569 --> 01:40:48,689
tell me well walk throughs of interviews

2280
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:50,880
that goes on now at least from my own

2281
01:40:48,689 --> 01:40:53,759
it's like it becomes a intimate like

2282
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:57,829
interview all right brother let's talk

2283
01:40:53,760 --> 01:41:09,720
about let's talk about everything

2284
01:40:57,829 --> 01:41:14,159
it becomes an investigation about every

2285
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:14,850
single step of his entire grow in what

2286
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:17,970
he goes through

2287
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:19,950
are you using quest filtrations and HEPA

2288
01:41:17,970 --> 01:41:25,050
filters and you these in your rooms what

2289
01:41:19,949 --> 01:41:26,819
are your you know it's like a plethora

2290
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:28,500
of every single you know you don't even

2291
01:41:26,819 --> 01:41:30,059
need to ask any of those questions in a

2292
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:32,399
sense you can just say listen we're

2293
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:33,930
passing this on to the scientists and

2294
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:35,729
they're gonna run it through all sorts

2295
01:41:33,930 --> 01:41:37,890
of fancy machines and come up with

2296
01:41:35,729 --> 01:41:39,419
numbers and graphs and man I'm telling

2297
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:40,829
you it's gonna look bad on you if you

2298
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:44,159
put some [ __ ] in here you weren't

2299
01:41:40,829 --> 01:41:45,449
supposed to go ahead Alec it one thing I

2300
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:48,300
was gonna say sorry dinner it up real

2301
01:41:45,449 --> 01:41:50,460
quick I do have to cut out soon but I'm

2302
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:54,590
involved in a project and we're working

2303
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:57,149
closely with SC labs we're actually

2304
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:59,369
Pacific reserves the name of our nursery

2305
01:41:57,149 --> 01:42:01,589
we're opening in Monterey County and

2306
01:41:59,369 --> 01:42:04,949
we're going to specialize in clean green

2307
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:06,029
organic certified Jeanette Nicks that

2308
01:42:04,949 --> 01:42:06,779
people don't have to worry about

2309
01:42:06,029 --> 01:42:09,989
purchasing

2310
01:42:06,779 --> 01:42:13,199
that are not going to be contaminated so

2311
01:42:09,989 --> 01:42:16,590
that's a big important part of my whole

2312
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:19,769
concerns as far as being an organic

2313
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:22,980
advocate and allowing getting product to

2314
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:26,160
people so they can do their job the

2315
01:42:22,979 --> 01:42:29,069
problems you have any idea how many

2316
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:31,380
generations let's say you have a mother

2317
01:42:29,069 --> 01:42:33,149
plant let's maybe the [ __ ] out of

2318
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:37,140
someone these were the some of these

2319
01:42:33,149 --> 01:42:39,839
systemics then you make us a small clone

2320
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:44,220
permit you grow that at another facility

2321
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:46,470
that's totally clean and there is still

2322
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:48,510
little tiny bits of systemic left in

2323
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:50,550
that plant so you grow it big and you

2324
01:42:48,510 --> 01:42:53,690
chop it up and you start making more

2325
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:56,730
clones you treat it as a mother clone

2326
01:42:53,689 --> 01:42:59,489
well many generations will these

2327
01:42:56,729 --> 01:43:02,309
materials keep showing up how systemic

2328
01:42:59,489 --> 01:43:04,199
are they well that's something I can't

2329
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:10,440
answer yet we're still trying to learn

2330
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:12,149
this and one thing we're doing we're

2331
01:43:10,439 --> 01:43:13,589
doing more and more testing now that we

2332
01:43:12,149 --> 01:43:16,889
have a platform that we could actually

2333
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:19,380
grow more plants and test more we are

2334
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:22,440
you know actively doing that the one the

2335
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:24,989
one way I know that cleans up plants and

2336
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:27,149
genetics is tissue culture and that's

2337
01:43:24,989 --> 01:43:29,429
another part of our business that we're

2338
01:43:27,149 --> 01:43:33,239
going to expand into at the nursery as

2339
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:37,590
well and the grape industry in

2340
01:43:33,239 --> 01:43:40,800
California they for for wine they supply

2341
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:43,409
rootstock which is guaranteed virus free

2342
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:46,560
it would be easy enough to do the same

2343
01:43:43,409 --> 01:43:51,659
thing with cannabis with systemics

2344
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:55,590
poisons and viruses because even from

2345
01:43:51,659 --> 01:43:58,109
seed you get viruses viruses can carry

2346
01:43:55,590 --> 01:43:59,850
over in cannabis seeds so that's not

2347
01:43:58,109 --> 01:44:04,729
guaranteed it's clear it's clean from

2348
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:07,110
pesticides but not from diseases mm-hmm

2349
01:44:04,729 --> 01:44:10,259
interesting well it's a good absolutely

2350
01:44:07,109 --> 01:44:12,179

prevention and you know I've known Brian

2364

doing for this third-party farm

2370
01:44:52,559 --> 01:44:56,309
certification program we're doing in bio

2371
01:44:54,328 --> 01:44:57,960
Canada by organics because you know in

2372
01:44:56,309 --> 01:45:00,420
this brave new world of you know

2373
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:01,559
pesticide regulations are so tight you

2374
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:03,630
know it's like there's just it's just

2375
01:45:01,559 --> 01:45:05,579
such a scary world of like what products

2376
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:07,618
do I use cuz you know just four or five

2377
01:45:05,578 --> 01:45:10,198
years ago people were unknowingly using

2378
01:45:07,618 --> 01:45:12,389
Bushmaster and gravity thinking it was

2379
01:45:10,198 --> 01:45:14,029
derived from seaweed you know and you

2380
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:16,529
know all these products here like

2381

Guardian that's getting got pulled for

2382
01:45:16,529 --> 01:45:21,779
having unlisted avid in the product and

2383
01:45:18,658 --> 01:45:25,679
like the most recent army listed as a

2384
01:45:21,779 --> 01:45:28,288
trawl you know army listed as an actor

2385
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:29,940
and kind of concentrate from neem which

2386
01:45:28,288 --> 01:45:32,460
also turned out to have like three

2387
01:45:29,939 --> 01:45:35,069
unlisted synthetic pyrethroids and pylon

2388
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:36,989
in it you know it's like it's just this

2389
01:45:35,069 --> 01:45:40,018
mind-blowing reality and there's you

2390
01:45:36,988 --> 01:45:42,118
know the room for error of like a farmer

2391
01:45:40,019 --> 01:45:43,829
knowing you know or having confidence in

2392
01:45:42,118 --> 01:45:45,268
the product you know that's going to

2393
01:45:43,828 --> 01:45:46,649
help them succeed especially with

2394
01:45:45,269 --> 01:45:48,570
enterprise the right thing and maintain

2395
01:45:46,649 --> 01:45:50,819
the plant to the highest integrity you

2396
01:45:48,569 --> 01:45:53,069
know it's like looking to more more to

2397
01:45:50,819 --> 01:45:54,929
to you know quality products that are

2398
01:45:53,069 --> 01:45:56,069
vetted and you know actually going

2399
01:45:54,929 --> 01:45:57,960
through some type of process to

2400
01:45:56,069 --> 01:45:59,759
substantiate the product it because can

2401
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:01,408
be so important because yeah I mean

2402
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:03,059
people are you know it's like either

2403
01:46:01,408 --> 01:46:04,529
drift is coming through soil you know

2404
01:46:03,059 --> 01:46:06,659
from neighboring farms that were people

2405
01:46:04,529 --> 01:46:09,090
are at they are in battle implications

2406
01:46:06,658 --> 01:46:11,009
and just you know there's so much Chemie

2407
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:12,960
agriculture going on around them or you

2408
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:14,579
know it's like you know using you know

2409
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,349
all these products in your closed-loop

2410
01:46:14,578 --> 01:46:18,719
kind of organic system that you know you

2411
01:46:16,349 --> 01:46:20,099
you don't necessarily know or should

2412
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:21,840
have the full trust in that they're

2413
01:46:20,099 --> 01:46:23,670
organic because you know oftentimes it's

2414
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:25,739
showing that they're turning out to be

2415
01:46:23,670 --> 01:46:29,158
hot you know or you know the different

2416
01:46:25,738 --> 01:46:30,598
products that are sold so yeah Brian man

good

2446
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:40,340
Wow we went solid there for a couple of

2447
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:42,260
hours got pretty deep I like the

2448
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:44,449
conversation I did just end up sending

2449
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:46,670
the link out to forest who may or may

2450
01:47:44,449 --> 01:47:48,710
not make it in he was watching so the

2451
01:47:46,670 --> 01:47:50,989
panel was wonderful and it was inspiring

2452
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:53,989
him he's kind of a big part of the

2453
01:47:50,989 --> 01:47:55,489
underlining conversation really of all

2454
01:47:53,989 --> 01:47:57,590
of that we're talking about because

2455
01:47:55,489 --> 01:48:00,139
really let's be honest where do we will

2456
01:47:57,590 --> 01:48:02,659
all want to align ourselves with the

2457
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:05,329
highest of integrity with the with with

2458
01:48:02,659 --> 01:48:08,180
no poisons with with things that aren't

2459
01:48:05,329 --> 01:48:09,800
even questionable in any real cause yeah

2460
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:11,840
to do no harm right that's our

2461
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:14,239
Hippocratic oath it's like the cannabis

2462
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:16,880
community really with this core group

2463
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:19,789
right here I believe wants to do no harm

2464
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:21,650
and there's so many different aspects of

2465
01:48:19,789 --> 01:48:24,079
the community that we cover with each

2466
01:48:21,649 --> 01:48:26,750
little box that's currently residing in

2467
01:48:24,079 --> 01:48:30,409
here right from the roots right up to

2468
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:33,949
the to the resin heads and I love it

2469
01:48:30,409 --> 01:48:36,139
yeah give a shout out I want to give a

2470
01:48:33,949 --> 01:48:38,569
shout out to Greece for legalizing

2471
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:39,200
medical cannabis and also to Spain for

2472
01:48:38,569 --> 01:48:41,239
catalona

2473
01:48:39,199 --> 01:48:43,840
for the barcelone area for legalizing

2474
01:48:41,239 --> 01:48:47,198
consumption cultivation and distribution

2475
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:49,989
why'd ya do

2476
01:48:47,198 --> 01:48:52,569
you know that in the 1920s Greece was

2477
01:48:49,988 --> 01:48:55,919
the largest has she's producer for

2478
01:48:52,569 --> 01:49:00,009
Europe I had no idea but I would have

2479
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:03,010
been pretty good hash shout out the

2480
01:49:00,010 --> 01:49:08,800
grease for saganaki flaming cheese it's

2481
01:49:03,010 --> 01:49:10,500
the one they like it's right next to

2482
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:13,029
your table and they bring it to you

2483
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:16,600
awesome it's like doing dabs of cheese

2484
01:49:13,029 --> 01:49:20,880
it's the best appetizer oh cheese dabs I

2485
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:20,880
definitely see a Hulk meme coming up

2486
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:32,230
called Hulk do cheese dance Okla fondue

2487
01:49:27,189 --> 01:49:36,129
I collected about several hundred

2488
01:49:32,229 --> 01:49:39,729
different Lebanese cloth bags that were

2489
01:49:36,130 --> 01:49:42,219
used for for hashish because that's the

2490
01:49:39,729 --> 01:49:45,539
way the Lebanese produced it in like the

2491
01:49:42,219 --> 01:49:49,149
linen cloth bag you have any to show us

2492
01:49:45,539 --> 01:49:54,640
I can go get some in the other room yes

2493
01:49:49,149 --> 01:49:57,339
just a couple hundred at yeah yeah what

2494
01:49:54,640 --> 01:50:00,640
I was trying to say was I wish I had one

2495
01:49:57,340 --> 01:50:02,710
from the twenties and before but Lebanon

2496
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:04,350
was doing the exact same thing in

2497
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:06,819
leather bags

2498
01:50:04,350 --> 01:50:08,890
yeah I've seen some of your linen bags

2499
01:50:06,819 --> 01:50:10,809
and every time you've allowed me to look

2500
01:50:08,890 --> 01:50:15,310
at them and touch them I'm always like

2501
01:50:10,810 --> 01:50:18,219
this is so cool like what a unique part

2502
01:50:15,310 --> 01:50:19,989
of the history yeah I've heard I've

2503
01:50:18,219 --> 01:50:22,420
heard but never seen even when I scored

2504
01:50:19,988 --> 01:50:25,988
Lebanese it came in that very thick

2505
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:28,600
filmed cellophane it wasn't in the in

2506
01:50:25,988 --> 01:50:30,849
something like that but yeah that's that

2507
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:33,070
they're even around or collectible and

2508
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:35,980
that he of course has hundreds of them I

2509
01:50:33,069 --> 01:50:39,488
know I have most of the ones that exist

2510
01:50:35,979 --> 01:50:43,959
on the planet currently in one spot he's

2511
01:50:39,488 --> 01:50:49,209
got the just in the other room I'll be

2512
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:52,350
right back I make a suggestion to Alec

2513
01:50:49,210 --> 01:50:55,329
this is just an idea for when you see

2514
01:50:52,350 --> 01:50:58,000
samples come by that are hot with

2515
01:50:55,329 --> 01:51:01,430
pesticides we're gonna be really cool

2516
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:03,680
you know they sell these little

2517
01:51:01,430 --> 01:51:05,329
pack cartridges with silica gel which

2518
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:07,670
you can do is basically do it just a

2519
01:51:05,329 --> 01:51:10,399
quick flash filtration of that sample

2520
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:12,739
through the silica gel and you know when

2521
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:15,049
you give the customer their bad news

2522
01:51:12,739 --> 01:51:17,510
that their sample is contaminated you

2523
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:19,369
also can give them good news that they

2524
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:21,199
can basically flash that [ __ ] through

2525
01:51:19,369 --> 01:51:24,019
silica gel basically remove the

2526
01:51:21,199 --> 01:51:26,809
contamination and and make it you know

2527
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:28,520
good medicine again is that possible you

2528
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:32,180
know you think you're saying that's a

2529
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:34,100
successful like yeah I mean absolutely I

2530
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:37,820
mean most of the pesticides at least

2531
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:39,500
again Diesel's will get hung up on to

2532
01:51:37,819 --> 01:51:40,309
them if they're there and just trace

2533
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:43,250
amounts

2534
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:45,020
I imagine that again I was thinking I'm

2535
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:48,140
really intrigued about this hexane

2536
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:51,920
extraction of CBD but if you were to

2537
01:51:48,140 --> 01:51:54,289
take a nonpolar media and basically run

2538
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:57,109
that through silica gel your your

2539
01:51:54,289 --> 01:51:58,640
pesticide contamination should be polar

2540
01:51:57,109 --> 01:52:01,039
enough that it gets hung up on the

2541
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:03,380
silica gel where the extract and all the

2542
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:06,260
nonpolar components and the cannabinoids

2543
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:08,720
and [ __ ] come and so now you're

2544
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:10,820
providing your your customer again with

2545
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:13,280
the bad news that their [ __ ] is coming

2546
01:52:10,819 --> 01:52:15,229
back in Tama Nate but good news that

2547
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:17,449
they could basically just flash it

2548
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:19,939
through a column of silica gel and

2549
01:52:17,449 --> 01:52:23,809
basically clean it up and then resubmit

2550
01:52:19,939 --> 01:52:25,879
it and then see if it actually so here's

2551
01:52:23,810 --> 01:52:28,130
a question now when you say clean that

2552
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:30,020
up and say you're doing it regularly and

2553
01:52:28,130 --> 01:52:32,150
you're getting this what I would suppose

2554
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:33,830
is some toxic waste or something that is

2555
01:52:32,149 --> 01:52:35,539
very bad that you don't want to like

2556
01:52:33,829 --> 01:52:37,369
what do you do with that stuff what do

2557
01:52:35,539 --> 01:52:39,140
people do it just gets hung up on the

2558
01:52:37,369 --> 01:52:40,909
silica gel right and it just yeah

2559
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:43,970
basically you'll where's the silica gel

2560
01:52:40,909 --> 01:52:46,220
go do you throw it into a landfill the

2561
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:48,650
ocean does it like I don't I don't

2562
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:50,960
understand you sell it to the jello

2563
01:52:48,649 --> 01:52:53,899
company and they start putting it in

2564
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:55,550
jello along with the cow hooves yeah and

2565
01:52:53,899 --> 01:52:58,129
you know we still I could please a

2566
01:52:55,550 --> 01:53:00,529
silica gel filter right underneath the

2567
01:52:58,130 --> 01:53:04,220
main chamber in our extractor to

2568
01:53:00,529 --> 01:53:06,739
sequester the insecticides but those gel

2569
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:07,909
filters come in a package that says that

2570
01:53:06,739 --> 01:53:10,219
when you're done with it you can put it

2571
01:53:07,909 --> 01:53:12,489
back in the package and dispose of it at

2572
01:53:10,220 --> 01:53:14,250
a place where they take stuff like that

2573
01:53:12,489 --> 01:53:16,590
so it's

2574
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:18,840
it's not like you're gonna put it in

2575
01:53:16,590 --> 01:53:24,000
jello or pudding or send it to Bill

2576
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:25,260
Cosby you know the penalty here you're

2577
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,789
getting out of the concentrate and at

2578
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:29,010
that point I mean again they can be

2579
01:53:26,789 --> 01:53:31,769
incinerated where they get completely

2580
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:33,720
burned and you know I turned in the co2

2581
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:36,390
for the atmosphere but you know whatever

2582
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:38,760
I mean I'm not saying that we have that

2583
01:53:36,390 --> 01:53:41,280
problem solved I'm just saying that if

2584
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:44,940
you know again I always look at those

2585
01:53:41,279 --> 01:53:47,250
you know decisions where vendors are

2586
01:53:44,939 --> 01:53:49,439
looking to either you know buy a whole

2587
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:51,119
lot of material and then you know

2588
01:53:49,439 --> 01:53:52,859
they're like having kind of like what

2589
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:55,309
tony was saying somewhat of an interview

2590
01:53:52,859 --> 01:53:57,839
with the grower or with the supplier to

2591
01:53:55,310 --> 01:54:00,420
understand you know that the stuff is

2592
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:02,940
pesticide free even if they do see

2593
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:05,609
results maybe they got results on one

2594
01:54:02,939 --> 01:54:07,289
bag but they're buying 20 bags how did

2595
01:54:05,609 --> 01:54:09,029
he know that the result from the one bag

2596
01:54:07,289 --> 01:54:10,890
is representative especially if you're

2597
01:54:09,029 --> 01:54:13,109
talking about microbiological

2598
01:54:10,890 --> 01:54:15,660
contamination which is a whole different

2599
01:54:13,109 --> 01:54:17,579
issue but I was just referring to

2600
01:54:15,659 --> 01:54:22,409
pesticide contamination in particular

2601
01:54:17,579 --> 01:54:24,750
which is that again you can sample one

2602
01:54:22,409 --> 01:54:27,769
part of the plant that has pasta side

2603
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:32,850
contamination other parts of that same

2604
01:54:27,770 --> 01:54:36,750
plant could be completely mated so how

2605
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:39,329
you sample a large batch of material to

2606
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:40,890
get a representative sample so when

2607
01:54:39,329 --> 01:54:44,939
you're looking to make you know a

2608
01:54:40,890 --> 01:54:47,090
purchase of you know several a lot of

2609
01:54:44,939 --> 01:54:50,489
material that you could actually have a

2610
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:52,680
reasonable you know idea that that

2611
01:54:50,489 --> 01:54:54,059
material is not contaminated but again

2612
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:55,560
I'll go back to one last thing and then

2613
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:57,630
I'll shut up which is when you're

2614
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:59,760
looking at the ppb level the part per

2615
01:54:57,630 --> 01:55:01,800
billion level holy [ __ ] you're gonna

2616
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:03,570
find [ __ ] everything dude you're

2617
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:05,820
gonna find viagra you're gonna find

2618
01:55:03,569 --> 01:55:07,979
cocaine you're gonna find everything

2619
01:55:05,819 --> 01:55:11,340
that you Bick what is in our environment

2620
01:55:07,979 --> 01:55:13,889
at that level which unfortunately is all

2621
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:16,680
our lines are you saying that cocaine

2622
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:21,780
and viagra are ubiquitous in your

2623
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:23,789
environment mark it depends on the

2624
01:55:21,779 --> 01:55:26,539
region or this in municipal water supply

2625
01:55:23,789 --> 01:55:26,539
you didn't

2626
01:55:27,609 --> 01:55:32,079
and a triple quad mass effect that you

2627
01:55:29,409 --> 01:55:34,479
can roll out any large bill in front of

2628
01:55:32,079 --> 01:55:36,670
that triple quad and it's got a sniffer

2629
01:55:34,479 --> 01:55:39,069
that will find the cocaine on just about

2630
01:55:36,670 --> 01:55:43,560
any bill that comes from anyone's pocket

2631
01:55:39,069 --> 01:55:46,210
no matter if it was used for coke or not

2632
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:48,610
she said looking a part per billion

2633
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:52,659
level again you're finding things that

2634
01:55:48,609 --> 01:55:54,429
are really you know liquidus within our

2635
01:55:52,659 --> 01:55:56,889
environment Alec don't you agree I mean

2636
01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:58,630
part per million is one thing right does

2637
01:55:56,890 --> 01:56:00,730
that want to understand what when we say

2638
01:55:58,630 --> 01:56:03,489
part per billion part so there's there's

2639
01:56:00,729 --> 01:56:05,409
percent right that's part 400 then

2640
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:07,899
there's part per thousand right that's

2641
01:56:05,409 --> 01:56:10,930
even small then there's part per million

2642
01:56:07,899 --> 01:56:14,170
now we're talking part per billion man

2643
01:56:10,930 --> 01:56:17,320
that's just very very sort like a yeah

2644
01:56:14,170 --> 01:56:20,409
that's like a one shot of remove inside

2645
01:56:17,319 --> 01:56:23,920
a railroad car foliage in in terms of a

2646
01:56:20,409 --> 01:56:26,590
dry martini I mean the fact is is that

2647
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:28,930
the dilution of these things in the

2648
01:56:26,590 --> 01:56:31,840
environment and the sensitivity of these

2649
01:56:28,930 --> 01:56:35,110
instruments I mean again can you run

2650
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:38,529
Whole Foods produce through the same

2651
01:56:35,109 --> 01:56:41,380
level of scrutiny and not find trace

2652
01:56:38,529 --> 01:56:44,859
amounts of some of these insecticides

2653
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:49,029
and plant the regulator's the art per

2654
01:56:44,859 --> 01:56:50,289
billion level you know so I I think you

2655
01:56:49,029 --> 01:56:54,609
bring up really interesting like

2656
01:56:50,289 --> 01:56:55,899
conundrum you know I'm and you know they

2657
01:56:54,609 --> 01:56:57,609
kind of reminds me I if you're familiar

2658
01:56:55,899 --> 01:57:00,009
with Michael Pollan's work botany of

2659
01:56:57,609 --> 01:57:02,969
desire you know and in the Bundys I

2660
01:57:00,010 --> 01:57:08,230
retakes these you know for crops can be

2661
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:10,300
several hatched you know like ten

2662
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:13,599
episodes a hashed Church it always comes

2663
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:15,220
on oh it's amazing it's so amazing and

2664
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:17,110
it gives me such future hope for

2665
01:57:15,220 --> 01:57:19,690
Humanity honestly beyond like all the

2666
01:57:17,109 --> 01:57:20,949
political [ __ ] of you know just the

2667
01:57:19,689 --> 01:57:22,449
whole coevolution thing and how much

2668
01:57:20,949 --> 01:57:23,979
who's really in the driver's seat how

2669
01:57:22,449 --> 01:57:25,840
much effect is this kind of cannabis

2670
01:57:23,979 --> 01:57:27,399
plant having effect on our personal

2671
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,569
cultural evolution and the industries

2672
01:57:27,399 --> 01:57:30,849
that are being created from it and the

2673
01:57:28,569 --> 01:57:32,889
awareness that's being you know kind of

2674
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:34,450
brought up you know to you know to to

2675
01:57:32,890 --> 01:57:36,130
everybody that's you know working with

2676
01:57:34,449 --> 01:57:37,329
this plant you know and it's fasting

2677
01:57:36,130 --> 01:57:40,029
because in you know in bodies are he

2678
01:57:37,329 --> 01:57:41,949
believes the future hope his future

2679
01:57:40,029 --> 01:57:45,130
hopes for you know kind of

2680
01:57:41,949 --> 01:57:47,500
then coming you know global food

2681
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:48,970
commodity market and like you know kind

2682
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:51,250
of the shifting to the slow food

2683
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:53,409
movement farm fresh local produce model

2684
01:57:51,250 --> 01:57:54,939
you know in so many ways you know you

2685
01:57:53,409 --> 01:57:56,380
know can't give us props to the cannabis

2686
01:57:54,939 --> 01:57:58,359
farmers because of how intensively we

2687
01:57:56,380 --> 01:58:01,119
focused on how to perfect growing this

2688
01:57:58,359 --> 01:58:03,819
plant optimally for the most resin for

2689
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:05,710
all these things and you know doing it

2690
01:58:03,819 --> 01:58:07,090
organically without any pesticides all

2691
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:08,560
this stuff and and and you know

2692
01:58:07,090 --> 01:58:10,420
regulations it's really interesting

2693
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:12,250
because you know it's you know

2694
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:14,230
regulations around cannabis specifically

2695
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:16,359
on pesticides you know I almost think

2696
01:58:14,229 --> 01:58:19,059
it's like the cannabis plant is almost

2697
01:58:16,359 --> 01:58:20,649
gonna shake a lot of people that aren't

2698
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:22,660
really in line with the integrity of its

2699
01:58:20,649 --> 01:58:25,269
message off you know real quickly

2700
01:58:22,659 --> 01:58:26,649
because you know it's like you know if

2701
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:28,450
so many people coming into so much money

2702
01:58:26,649 --> 01:58:30,279
thing they're gonna come just crush it

2703
01:58:28,449 --> 01:58:33,010
you know and like buy all these you know

2704
01:58:30,279 --> 01:58:35,289
old cut flower greenhouses that have so

2705
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:36,909
caught your so dirty soil like you know

2706
01:58:35,289 --> 01:58:38,260
that the rip my point is the pesticide

2707
01:58:36,909 --> 01:58:40,479
regulations in cannabis I think are

2708
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:42,909
gonna expose the dirty dirty secret

2709
01:58:40,479 --> 01:58:45,219
about how ubiquitous pesticides are in

2710
01:58:42,909 --> 01:58:47,289
our environment and how you know a zero

2711
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:49,630
is almost a really difficult thing to

2712
01:58:47,289 --> 01:58:51,220
ever produce again because of how much

2713
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:52,930
spraying and how much contamination is

2714
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:55,210
taking place you know and I'm really

2715
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:57,070
hoping deeply that you know kind of the

2716
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:59,770
ethics of the leaders in the cannabis

2717
01:58:57,069 --> 01:59:01,239
movement and in in kind of you know kind

2718
01:58:59,770 --> 01:59:03,130
of dedicating and doubling down to

2719
01:59:01,239 --> 01:59:05,500
that's you know knowing the farmer and

2720
01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:08,079
you know you're anti mono crop you know

2721
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:09,909
kind of being able to have you know you

2722
01:59:08,079 --> 01:59:11,739
know tighter understandings and controls

2723
01:59:09,909 --> 01:59:13,420
over the supply chain management of like

2724
01:59:11,739 --> 01:59:15,130
where you're getting but that's making

2725
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:16,779
products that you're trying to put under

2726
01:59:15,130 --> 01:59:18,699
your brand you know I think it's it's

2727
01:59:16,779 --> 01:59:20,559
you know it's the biggest topic in the

2728
01:59:18,699 --> 01:59:21,849
industry I think and and I think it's

2729
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:24,789
kind of you know in so many ways

2730
01:59:21,850 --> 01:59:26,440
highlight you know the in in the global

2731
01:59:24,789 --> 01:59:27,909
agricultural movement it's gonna bring

2732
01:59:26,439 --> 01:59:30,250
up the pesticide issue to people's

2733
01:59:27,909 --> 01:59:32,529
consciousness and and hopefully in some

2734
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:34,569
bit of a way it really does begin to you

2735
01:59:32,529 --> 01:59:37,119
know shift or accelerate kind of just

2736
01:59:34,569 --> 01:59:39,369
you know awareness around slow food

2737
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:43,869
movement and you know kind of yeah I

2738
01:59:39,369 --> 01:59:45,909
mean we supply a lot of our product to

2739
01:59:43,869 --> 01:59:49,649
multiple sustainable agriculture

2740
01:59:45,909 --> 01:59:52,119
consultants in in conventionally

2741
01:59:49,649 --> 01:59:53,619
produced commodity industry where

2742
01:59:52,119 --> 01:59:54,019
they're growing tomatoes and stuff like

2743
01:59:53,619 --> 01:59:57,470
that

2744
01:59:54,020 --> 02:00:00,860
and one of the the larger clients that

2745
01:59:57,470 --> 02:00:02,360
some of my guys sell to is well these

2746
02:00:00,859 --> 02:00:05,210
are independent distributors that are

2747
02:00:02,359 --> 02:00:07,849
selling to large agricultural operations

2748
02:00:05,210 --> 02:00:09,920
one of the things that some of these

2749
02:00:07,850 --> 02:00:14,750
larger producers are doing is they're

2750
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:16,760
actually using systemic fungicides once

2751
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:18,710
per week whether the crop needs that are

2752
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:20,960
not like on tomatoes they'll go ahead

2753
02:00:18,710 --> 02:00:22,520
and put down so you know we're pretty -

2754
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:24,920
some of these protocols that these guys

2755
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:27,260
are doing and so what'll end up

2756
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:28,750
happening is they may use contact

2757
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:31,280
fungicides but they're also using

2758
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:33,109
systemics once a week again whether the

2759
02:00:31,279 --> 02:00:35,599
plant needs they're not it's horrifying

2760
02:00:33,109 --> 02:00:38,119
well what's what systemic do you know

2761
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:39,350
what they're using exactly yeah I do I

2762
02:00:38,119 --> 02:00:41,750
know well there's there's a multitude

2763
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:44,870
there's there's there's quite a few but

2764
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:46,880
rather than get into the details of the

2765
02:00:44,869 --> 02:00:48,229
actual chemical compounds which I think

2766
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:54,310
will poor people I think this will kind

2767
02:00:48,229 --> 02:00:57,379
of be more more of interest so so the

2768
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:59,930
DISA stem expose their actually

2769
02:00:57,380 --> 02:01:02,150
encumbering the vascular system of the

2770
02:00:59,930 --> 02:01:04,970
tomato so if you go into you know a

2771
02:01:02,149 --> 02:01:06,589
major retail store and you see a tomato

2772
02:01:04,970 --> 02:01:07,850
that's grown there like back when we

2773
02:01:06,590 --> 02:01:10,279
were kids you would see those little

2774
02:01:07,850 --> 02:01:14,000
brown spots that the tomato would get

2775
02:01:10,279 --> 02:01:15,649
and now those little brown spots that

2776
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:19,159
the tomato get mixtures which was

2777
02:01:15,649 --> 02:01:20,539
botrytis the tomatoes don't get those

2778
02:01:19,159 --> 02:01:23,119
anymore because again they're using a

2779
02:01:20,539 --> 02:01:25,550
proactive approach now those systemic

2780
02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:29,720
fungicides again we're talking about

2781
02:01:25,550 --> 02:01:31,550
micro doses so think about this this

2782
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:34,850
systemic fungicide that's going into a

2783
02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:37,010
tomato on a part per million basis so so

2784
02:01:34,850 --> 02:01:39,740
that systemic is actually killing all of

2785
02:01:37,010 --> 02:01:43,010
itself it's working as a biocide so it's

2786
02:01:39,739 --> 02:01:46,010
killing all of the bacteria good and bad

2787
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:49,340
yeah well we really wait so now like

2788
02:01:46,010 --> 02:01:52,550
antibiotic yeah what what chemical are

2789
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:55,520
you talking about exactly don't a basis

2790
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:58,510
what's happening is when you eat you

2791
02:01:55,520 --> 02:02:00,250
know a fruit or a vegetable what

2792
02:01:58,510 --> 02:02:01,750
what could happen and again this is

2793
02:02:00,250 --> 02:02:05,130
being disclosed to me I'm not saying

2794
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:08,710
this is fact or truth but that that

2795
02:02:05,130 --> 02:02:11,199
systemic fungicide that is penetrating

2796
02:02:08,710 --> 02:02:14,920
the entire vascular system of that

2797
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:17,380
tomato is is working as like an

2798
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:20,710
antibiotic within our microbiome in our

2799
02:02:17,380 --> 02:02:22,090
digestive diseases Whitford is justice

2800
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:23,890
this is what's being told to me it's

2801
02:02:22,090 --> 02:02:26,110
horrifying it's not something that I'm

2802
02:02:23,890 --> 02:02:27,900
disclosing on the basis of our company

2803
02:02:26,109 --> 02:02:30,279
this is just what some of our

2804
02:02:27,899 --> 02:02:32,109
sustainable agriculture consultants have

2805
02:02:30,279 --> 02:02:35,199
disclosed to me I just want to get that

2806
02:02:32,109 --> 02:02:36,880
straight so you think about the rise in

2807
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:43,960
gluten intolerance you think about the

2808
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:48,239
rise in celiac disease autoimmune can so

2809
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:51,060
you think about the fact that possibly a

2810
02:02:48,238 --> 02:02:55,359
fungicide that's designed to kill

2811
02:02:51,060 --> 02:02:58,510
bacteria is easy now a fungicide is

2812
02:02:55,359 --> 02:03:01,619
designed to kill fungus a bacteria side

2813
02:02:58,510 --> 02:03:04,079
is designed to kill bacteria and are not

2814
02:03:01,619 --> 02:03:07,119
necessarily in the same bucket any

2815
02:03:04,079 --> 02:03:09,340
microbials in general there are broad

2816
02:03:07,119 --> 02:03:11,920
classes of antimicrobial some kill

2817
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:14,770
fungus some kill bug of some kill Bowl

2818
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:17,800
some kill one to kill the other because

2819
02:03:14,770 --> 02:03:20,140
it creates a biofilm and the biofilm

2820
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:23,470
becomes basically a zoo for a whole

2821
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:25,989
diverse population and new microbes that

2822
02:03:23,470 --> 02:03:27,130
basically colonized the people who came

2823
02:03:25,988 --> 02:03:29,919
in there before them

2824
02:03:27,130 --> 02:03:31,000
so let's and I'm really interested in

2825
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:33,420
what you're telling me so what you're

2826
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:35,710
telling me is that and again I'm

2827
02:03:33,420 --> 02:03:37,659
somewhat of an expert in this field of

2828
02:03:35,710 --> 02:03:40,149
antimicrobial so I want to make sure

2829
02:03:37,659 --> 02:03:44,139
you're not being bullshitted which is

2830
02:03:40,149 --> 02:03:48,069
that systemic fungicides are put into

2831
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:50,560
the plant not to kill bacteria it's to

2832
02:03:48,069 --> 02:03:52,329
kill fungus right and so the systemic

2833
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:55,000
fungicides that I know that are used

2834
02:03:52,329 --> 02:03:57,850
basically control fungi on the plant and

2835
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,949
in in the soil but are very very

2836
02:03:57,850 --> 02:04:02,020
short-lived you know they're not there

2837
02:03:59,949 --> 02:04:04,149
for all for a whole long period of time

2838
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:06,030
what you're telling me is that there are

2839
02:04:04,149 --> 02:04:09,539
things that are being applied to

2840
02:04:06,029 --> 02:04:10,920
Tomatoes that are persistent is what

2841
02:04:09,539 --> 02:04:13,710
this is what was disclosed to me more

2842
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:15,510
but I'll tell you what is the active

2843
02:04:13,710 --> 02:04:18,270
ingredient I'm just curious because that

2844
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:20,010
active ingredient must be registered for

2845
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:22,380
human consumption because if it's

2846
02:04:20,010 --> 02:04:24,720
persistent in tomatoes that means you

2847
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:26,909
can eat a tomato that has some level of

2848
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:28,740
this stuff and that means that some

2849
02:04:26,909 --> 02:04:31,470
company registered a whole bunch of

2850
02:04:28,739 --> 02:04:34,079
products based on some safety data that

2851
02:04:31,470 --> 02:04:36,449
said that a whole bunch of human beings

2852
02:04:34,079 --> 02:04:38,189
can eat this [ __ ] with this level of

2853
02:04:36,449 --> 02:04:40,139
this stuff in these Tomatoes

2854
02:04:38,189 --> 02:04:42,750
or else it wouldn't be on the US market

2855
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:46,110
right that's supposedly environment

2856
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:48,390
those limits will harden actually to do

2857
02:04:46,109 --> 02:04:50,189
what you're probably right of like what

2858
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:51,950
this gentleman told me and I again I'm

2859
02:04:50,189 --> 02:04:55,589
not publicly disclosing it on the MOR

2860
02:04:51,949 --> 02:04:57,750
actually I'm just being told that these

2861
02:04:55,590 --> 02:05:01,730
bio science right this is what I was

2862
02:04:57,750 --> 02:05:04,079
told these bio science can actually

2863
02:05:01,729 --> 02:05:05,759
eliminate a lot of the bacteria as well

2864
02:05:04,079 --> 02:05:07,979
so they work as a bio site not

2865
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:09,960
necessarily just a fungicide so so

2866
02:05:07,979 --> 02:05:14,519
they're there destroying all of the

2867
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:19,319
bacteria like you know an antibiotic

2868
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:22,980
would essentially yes so broad-spectrum

2869
02:05:19,319 --> 02:05:26,219
and again broad-spectrum and it's a any

2870
02:05:22,979 --> 02:05:27,750
microbial it's a it's it's a biocide you

2871
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:29,789
know it's definitely something that

2872
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:32,340
they're not being specific on whether

2873
02:05:29,789 --> 02:05:34,319
it's a fungicide most biocides

2874
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:37,590
there are certain again ones that

2875
02:05:34,319 --> 02:05:41,340
basically have no activity against fungi

2876
02:05:37,590 --> 02:05:42,960
at all fungi have their own you know

2877
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:48,659
they got their own [ __ ] kingdom i

2878
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:50,699
think right they do yeah and you know I

2879
02:05:48,659 --> 02:05:53,159
was just gonna add one thing I mean

2880
02:05:50,699 --> 02:05:57,750
there's a whole lot of chemicals that

2881
02:05:53,159 --> 02:06:01,760
are used in the production of food and

2882
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:06,149
processed food and and and and and

2883
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:08,640
produce but what makes it what makes it

2884
02:06:06,149 --> 02:06:11,129
register today is not necessarily you

2885
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:12,720
know chemicals that that kill bugs

2886
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:16,710
there's a lot of chemicals that kill

2887
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:18,840
bugs what makes a crop protection agent

2888
02:06:16,710 --> 02:06:20,880
registered today is the fact that it has

2889
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:23,260
a really good safety profile is that

2890
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:26,850
it's got no mammalian toxicity

2891
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:30,670
so a lot of the mode of actions of new

2892
02:06:26,850 --> 02:06:34,200
low use rate agrochemicals are based on

2893
02:06:30,670 --> 02:06:37,600
specific action that are specific to

2894
02:06:34,199 --> 02:06:39,760
insects so like calcium channeling and

2895
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:42,370
and and potassium channels there's

2896
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:44,260
specific mechanisms in insects that

2897
02:06:42,369 --> 02:06:46,829
don't exist in humans so they can

2898
02:06:44,260 --> 02:06:49,480
develop essentially you know medicines

2899
02:06:46,829 --> 02:06:51,369
if you will just basically knock those

2900
02:06:49,479 --> 02:06:55,629
out but let me just finish this last

2901
02:06:51,369 --> 02:06:59,769
thought so the point is is that this are

2902
02:06:55,630 --> 02:07:01,900
used in foods today somewhere a long

2903
02:06:59,770 --> 02:07:04,960
time ago or maybe not so long ago a

2904
02:07:01,899 --> 02:07:07,929
company spent a whole lot of money in

2905
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:10,689
doing safety and assessment studies to

2906
02:07:07,930 --> 02:07:13,119
get that stuff registered for that end

2907
02:07:10,689 --> 02:07:15,609
use and again here in Canada bias

2908
02:07:13,119 --> 02:07:19,659
yeah we're faced with the pen and room

2909
02:07:15,609 --> 02:07:21,579
that there is no safety assessment for

2910
02:07:19,659 --> 02:07:25,029
any of these products being applied to

2911
02:07:21,579 --> 02:07:28,059
to cannabis because no company was

2912
02:07:25,029 --> 02:07:30,279
forced to do that to register the active

2913
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:32,830
ingredients so they can sell products

2914
02:07:30,279 --> 02:07:35,199
and it looks like the [ __ ] that Trump

2915
02:07:32,829 --> 02:07:37,539
put in there is going to basically keep

2916
02:07:35,199 --> 02:07:40,300
companies from being able to register

2917
02:07:37,539 --> 02:07:43,390
stuff with the EPA which is completely

2918
02:07:40,300 --> 02:07:46,060
[ __ ] stupid and thank you Trump

2919
02:07:43,390 --> 02:07:48,730
voters and the thing is is that you know

2920
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:51,400
there are biological ways of controlling

2921
02:07:48,729 --> 02:07:53,889
plant disease that can aid cannabis

2922
02:07:51,399 --> 02:07:55,899
cultivation so this is really the EPA

2923
02:07:53,890 --> 02:07:58,350
taken two steps backwards and that

2924
02:07:55,899 --> 02:08:00,279
register is progress you know sorry

2925
02:07:58,350 --> 02:08:01,780
biocontrol agents there's at what

2926
02:08:00,279 --> 02:08:03,819
activity a Syrian name there's those

2927
02:08:01,779 --> 02:08:06,250
products and and I've heard that they

2928
02:08:03,819 --> 02:08:09,939
were created Galia I grande Evo no I

2929
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:11,439
don't know yeah the letter D Peter did

2930
02:08:09,939 --> 02:08:14,679
you read the letter that that Scott

2931
02:08:11,439 --> 02:08:17,619
Pruett wrote honest it's just so no

2932
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:20,289
Gallo and so thin it's just oh you know

2933
02:08:17,619 --> 02:08:23,430
we can't the EPA does can't do this

2934
02:08:20,289 --> 02:08:26,460
because cannabis is illegal and uh just

2935
02:08:23,430 --> 02:08:29,560
[ __ ] [ __ ] letter but anyway

2936
02:08:26,460 --> 02:08:32,170
actually all this talk of pesticides is

2937
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:34,690
a bit of a downer I mean we do need to

2938
02:08:32,170 --> 02:08:37,109
have safety standards we do need to

2939
02:08:34,689 --> 02:08:44,638
produce clean safe cannabis

2940
02:08:37,109 --> 02:08:47,039
but Sam is that oh I'm sorry what that

2941
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:50,550
letter shows is that you know they're

2942
02:08:47,039 --> 02:08:52,850
not taking a step forward in letting I I

2943
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:56,460
agree with my mark I read the letter

2944
02:08:52,850 --> 02:09:02,489
yeah it just yeah it sucks go ahead show

2945
02:08:56,460 --> 02:09:05,489
so your show and tell now read Lebanese

2946
02:09:02,488 --> 02:09:07,618
can you see it looks green

2947
02:09:05,488 --> 02:09:18,269
we had see that see the red is a triple

2948
02:09:07,618 --> 02:09:20,819
ice cream yeah I'm afraid but light is

2949
02:09:18,270 --> 02:09:25,980
very poor oh it's pretty good it's not

2950
02:09:20,819 --> 02:09:26,920
that bad I can kind of see it's for the

2951
02:09:25,979 --> 02:09:33,500
kids

2952
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:41,039
[Laughter]

2953
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:42,750
ash oh my god such a character no I

2954
02:09:41,039 --> 02:09:45,510
agree Sam it is I mean it's definitely

2955
02:09:42,750 --> 02:09:47,158
especially with the with the level of

2956
02:09:45,510 --> 02:09:50,010
the people that are in here right now

2957
02:09:47,158 --> 02:09:52,319
even Brian who just left a lot of the

2958
02:09:50,010 --> 02:09:54,480
people really most of us here are at the

2959
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:58,349
point where we'd much prefer to just

2960
02:09:54,479 --> 02:10:00,718
have product not have to become sick and

2961
02:09:58,350 --> 02:10:03,119
have these poisons used on them but a

2962
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:06,179
product that could be bred specifically

2963
02:10:03,118 --> 02:10:10,380
for strength and for resilience used

2964
02:10:06,179 --> 02:10:13,980
with you know like proper root symbiosis

2965
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:16,319
and living soils and teas and organics

2966
02:10:13,979 --> 02:10:17,939
and I mean that's what what I would like

2967
02:10:16,319 --> 02:10:21,000
to see I just I just want to see the

2968
02:10:17,939 --> 02:10:23,549
plant in the most natural of ways be

2969
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,859
boosted to express its terpene and

2970
02:10:23,550 --> 02:10:28,350
cannabinoid profile - you know back to

2971
02:10:25,859 --> 02:10:30,029
the ten because I really feel like we're

2972
02:10:28,350 --> 02:10:32,159
living in the age of the seven right now

2973
02:10:30,029 --> 02:10:36,000
where everyone thinks a seven is like a

2974
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:39,299
9.5 and it's it's not that you have with

2975
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:42,359
soil balanced both men we really do the

2976
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:47,400
soil balance will will return things to

2977
02:10:42,359 --> 02:10:49,380
that balance and I'm excited I was just

2978
02:10:47,399 --> 02:10:50,319
gonna add thinking about what Alex said

2979
02:10:49,380 --> 02:10:53,139
though this is

2980
02:10:50,319 --> 02:10:55,118
[ __ ] cool the toll pesticide issue

2981
02:10:53,139 --> 02:10:57,578
which they want to have you know

2982
02:10:55,118 --> 02:11:00,219
cannabis with zero pesticide zero

2983
02:10:57,578 --> 02:11:02,408
I mean this is rising to the level of

2984
02:11:00,219 --> 02:11:05,319
awareness where people are beginning to

2985
02:11:02,408 --> 02:11:08,379
think about how this affects their food

2986
02:11:05,319 --> 02:11:11,859
and and and so that's like you know hey

2987
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:14,949
how you know our is the food that I'm

2988
02:11:11,859 --> 02:11:17,920
you know eating raised you know is this

2989
02:11:14,948 --> 02:11:22,059
botrytis you know free tomato the safest

2990
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:25,300
thing I could be so you know I've got

2991
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:28,929
whole bags from Lebanon plus I have

2992
02:11:25,300 --> 02:11:30,810
where I just cut out the design on a

2993
02:11:28,929 --> 02:11:34,599
bunch of bags

2994
02:11:30,810 --> 02:11:38,860
samer those hemp is that these are

2995
02:11:34,599 --> 02:11:41,020
probably either cotton or linen nice I

2996
02:11:38,859 --> 02:11:42,429
like to leave the lady with the big

2997
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:47,079
rifle that you could tell by just

2998
02:11:42,429 --> 02:11:49,328
mortise awning yeah yeah she's a that's

2999
02:11:47,078 --> 02:11:50,948
definitely what's from the 70s or

3000
02:11:49,328 --> 02:11:54,939
something like that something like that

3001
02:11:50,948 --> 02:11:58,479
yes I also have two horse two horses

3002

brand and there's Christian ones and

3003
02:11:58,479 --> 02:12:05,859
there's Muslim ones because we were both

3004
02:12:00,849 --> 02:12:10,469
in the hash trade that's awesome dude I

3005
02:12:05,859 --> 02:12:14,229
mean what a killer informations right

3006
02:12:10,469 --> 02:12:18,550
beautiful great collection of history

3007
02:12:14,229 --> 02:12:21,718
one paper one oh the paper one look at

3008
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:28,260
what does that say miss normal hashish

3009
02:12:21,719 --> 02:12:31,679
misses normal yeah I think it does

3010
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:34,630
indeed miss is normal

3011
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:36,639
hey welcome forest hey what's going on

3012
02:12:34,630 --> 02:12:40,239
guys you know we've been talking with

3013
02:12:36,639 --> 02:12:42,670
sorts of things all sorts of things yeah

3014
02:12:40,238 --> 02:12:44,169
got this epidermis in the summer that oh

3015
02:12:42,670 --> 02:12:47,679
it's really glad to hear that systemic

3016
02:12:44,170 --> 02:12:49,239
pesticide discussion one of it sending

3017
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:50,050
that message and tell you thanks but

3018
02:12:49,238 --> 02:12:53,198
thanks for the invite

3019
02:12:50,050 --> 02:12:55,810
come on yeah you know no matter how safe

3020
02:12:53,198 --> 02:12:58,388
we think they are let's probably not put

3021
02:12:55,810 --> 02:13:02,619
them into everything we eat and inhale

3022
02:12:58,389 --> 02:13:04,210
into our lungs right sure that cheers to

3023
02:13:02,618 --> 02:13:06,750
that you know we had enough

3024
02:13:04,210 --> 02:13:10,180
up or not but we had 40% of our

3025
02:13:06,750 --> 02:13:13,119
medicines once we make concentrates 40%

3026
02:13:10,180 --> 02:13:17,050
of them failed Formica butanol from

3027
02:13:13,119 --> 02:13:18,640
organic farms so I've been really making

3028
02:13:17,050 --> 02:13:21,130
a big issue about this and I haven't

3029
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:23,619
heard it talked much anywhere which is

3030
02:13:21,130 --> 02:13:25,480
why I love love this show good job

3031
02:13:23,619 --> 02:13:27,849
what was the woman and especially

3032
02:13:25,479 --> 02:13:29,529
especially 21 of the really trippy

3033
02:13:27,850 --> 02:13:31,120
parties you know since it's such a

3034
02:13:29,529 --> 02:13:33,000
similar boiling point as cannabinoids

3035
02:13:31,119 --> 02:13:34,779
when it's distilled it's so common

3036
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:37,750
concentrated absolutely with

3037
02:13:34,779 --> 02:13:40,149
cannabinoids also as most other things

3038
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:41,319
that might not be what I really wonder

3039
02:13:40,149 --> 02:13:43,599
if we're talking about systemic

3040
02:13:41,319 --> 02:13:45,880
fungicides Azhar is and maybe Mark from

3041
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:51,180
the office are they are they selectively

3042
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:55,779
you know when you talk about the

3043
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:57,700
diminishing titor's of fungi within the

3044
02:13:55,779 --> 02:14:01,779
plants vascular system is that

3045
02:13:57,699 --> 02:14:06,279
particular synthetic capable of being

3046
02:14:01,779 --> 02:14:09,099
selective in what it in what it kills I

3047
02:14:06,279 --> 02:14:11,619
mean will it are you sure mark that that

3048
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:20,400
these products and I studied them great

3049
02:14:11,619 --> 02:14:23,109
but do not I'm not I'm not sure die I

3050
02:14:20,399 --> 02:14:25,659
think it's safe to say though that the

3051
02:14:23,109 --> 02:14:28,599
Green Revolution model of mono crop

3052
02:14:25,659 --> 02:14:31,029
super kami agriculture with dumping

3053
02:14:28,600 --> 02:14:32,969
pesticides just proportionally on your

3054
02:14:31,029 --> 02:14:36,149
plants you know you know without any

3055
02:14:32,969 --> 02:14:38,619
regard you know as obviously that just

3056
02:14:36,149 --> 02:14:41,019
incredible you know loss of soil

3057
02:14:38,619 --> 02:14:43,119
microbiome you know and so I mean I

3058
02:14:41,020 --> 02:14:45,850
think it might be all things your mind

3059
02:14:43,119 --> 02:14:47,079
right you know and because it gives yeah

3060
02:14:45,850 --> 02:14:49,960
if you kill off the fungus in the soil

3061
02:14:47,079 --> 02:14:52,079
and you you you allow an environment for

3062
02:14:49,960 --> 02:14:53,800
certain bacterial colonies to grow

3063
02:14:52,079 --> 02:14:56,880
disproportionately and you know you lose

3064
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:59,230
your balance protozoa and nematodes

3065
02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:01,300
bacteria to fungus you also use

3066
02:14:59,229 --> 02:15:03,609
significantly throw off the soil for a

3067
02:15:01,300 --> 02:15:05,409
food web and and and then yen when you

3068
02:15:03,609 --> 02:15:07,149
is continuously dumping like whatever

3069
02:15:05,409 --> 02:15:09,550
chemicals I mean you it seems like

3070
02:15:07,149 --> 02:15:10,689
they're obviously I mean you know have

3071
02:15:09,550 --> 02:15:11,500
you heard about the Indian farmers that

3072
02:15:10,689 --> 02:15:13,419
have killed himself

3073
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:14,649
drinking months on the fertilizers over

3074
02:15:13,420 --> 02:15:16,480
the last 10 years by the hundred

3075
02:15:14,649 --> 02:15:17,659
thousands you know because of how

3076
02:15:16,479 --> 02:15:20,000
quickly like the soil

3077
02:15:17,659 --> 02:15:22,579
happened and you know like they're you

3078
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,569
know a lot loss of natural soil you guys

3079
02:15:22,579 --> 02:15:28,670
heard anything about that

3080
02:15:23,569 --> 02:15:30,769
yeah good forestry have no they have no

3081
02:15:28,670 --> 02:15:32,659
future anymore so they drink the inside

3082
02:15:30,770 --> 02:15:35,840
decided themselves because it's the

3083
02:15:32,659 --> 02:15:37,789
cheapest way out and I work because well

3084
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:41,900
also because they become almost

3085
02:15:37,789 --> 02:15:44,149
indentured servitude to big AG you know

3086
02:15:41,899 --> 02:15:45,859
in like you know the the loans that they

3087
02:15:44,149 --> 02:15:47,329
then get so far behind on that they

3088
02:15:45,859 --> 02:15:49,369
can't even ever pay back have to use

3089
02:15:47,329 --> 02:15:50,720
increased you know kind of chemical

3090
02:15:49,369 --> 02:15:52,760
fertilizers that they didn't have to buy

3091
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:55,310
just to get the same sustained yields

3092
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:58,280
because their soils dead now you know in

3093
02:15:55,310 --> 02:16:00,860
the end in the end what Monsanto and the

3094
02:15:58,279 --> 02:16:03,109
other companies are doing there is they

3095
02:16:00,859 --> 02:16:05,689
they do make them into indentured

3096
02:16:03,109 --> 02:16:07,489
servants at first but then later they

3097
02:16:05,689 --> 02:16:09,379
actually try to get a hold of the land

3098
02:16:07,489 --> 02:16:11,479
and they can run these guys off of their

3099
02:16:09,380 --> 02:16:15,079
land because of the way the laws and

3100
02:16:11,479 --> 02:16:16,549
financial responsibilities work in India

3101
02:16:15,079 --> 02:16:18,079
well that that's all that's why I think

3102
02:16:16,550 --> 02:16:20,060
that the regulations and cannabis

3103
02:16:18,079 --> 02:16:22,640
pesticide use are gonna be you know

3104
02:16:20,060 --> 02:16:24,560
actually so good for the plants survival

3105
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:26,720
and for the survival of all the mom and

3106
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:28,490
crop mom-and-pop small-scale farmers

3107
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:30,470
have been doing this all their life you

3108
02:16:28,489 --> 02:16:33,500
know because it's so hard to grow

3109
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:36,020
especially on scale really amazing

3110
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:37,760
quality kind of a super turbed up that's

3111
02:16:36,020 --> 02:16:39,739
clean without pesticides and if you

3112
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:41,929
haven't like gotten smashed by broad

3113
02:16:39,739 --> 02:16:43,699
mites or russets or like don't know how

3114
02:16:41,929 --> 02:16:45,770
to deal with identifying all these

3115
02:16:43,700 --> 02:16:48,740
different plant pathogens or plant pests

3116
02:16:45,770 --> 02:16:50,989
that are invasive is like your you know

3117
02:16:48,739 --> 02:16:52,850
the room for error where you can like

3118
02:16:50,989 --> 02:16:55,340
not know how to diagnose it and just

3119
02:16:52,850 --> 02:16:57,319
bomb [ __ ] with like the tryout of eagle

3120
02:16:55,340 --> 02:16:59,510
forbidden floor might look those days

3121
02:16:57,319 --> 02:17:01,340
are gone you know and and i think i

3122
02:16:59,510 --> 02:17:03,620
think the room the margin for error and

3123
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:06,020
not knowing how to have a really strong

3124
02:17:03,620 --> 02:17:07,490
integrated pest management program you

3125
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:09,770
know it's going away real quick so it's

3126
02:17:07,489 --> 02:17:11,510
like i think the people that have

3127
02:17:09,770 --> 02:17:13,909
figured it out are going to be super

3128
02:17:11,510 --> 02:17:15,170
successful while a lot of people fail

3129
02:17:13,909 --> 02:17:17,119
you know cuz a lot of people are

3130
02:17:15,170 --> 02:17:19,100
throwing huge money and building the

3131
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:20,660
most sophisticated build-outs thinking

3132
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:22,700
that they're just gonna crush and become

3133
02:17:20,659 --> 02:17:25,039
like the biggest cannabis millionaires

3134
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:27,020
ever but it's like it's it's interesting

3135
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:29,600
because it's like this is very different

3136
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:31,360
playing field because the pesticide

3137
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:33,370
thing is yeah I think it

3138
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:36,220
one of the single dividing factors who

3139
02:17:33,370 --> 02:17:39,100
makes it who doesn't yeah but you got to

3140
02:17:36,219 --> 02:17:42,369
admit if you look at the food supply in

3141
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:46,180
America the vast majority of it is not

3142
02:17:42,370 --> 02:17:48,220
organic is that I know right but you

3143
02:17:46,180 --> 02:17:51,550
know that's also why like oncology

3144
02:17:48,219 --> 02:17:53,920
doctors and and like autism specialists

3145
02:17:51,550 --> 02:17:57,129
like always first and foremost get

3146
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:58,780
parents to not or to choose organic

3147
02:17:57,129 --> 02:18:00,789
foods and produce for their kids because

3148
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:03,220
of the presence of all these random

3149
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:06,700
endocrine disrupting different types of

3150
02:18:03,219 --> 02:18:09,699
like you know okay gnarly kind of their

3151
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:11,110
neuro toxic pesticides you know and then

3152
02:18:09,700 --> 02:18:12,551
also like you know considering like I'm

3153
02:18:11,110 --> 02:18:15,220
gonna corporate you know imidacloprid

3154
02:18:12,550 --> 02:18:17,609
neoneun nicotine noise pesticide is one

3155
02:18:15,219 --> 02:18:19,569
of the most frequently used common a

3156
02:18:17,610 --> 02:18:22,210
accepted acknowledged you know

3157
02:18:19,569 --> 02:18:24,010
pesticides on you know most produce you

3158
02:18:22,209 --> 02:18:25,719
know nationally but it's also one of the

3159
02:18:24,010 --> 02:18:27,341
biggest contributors to the calling

3160
02:18:25,719 --> 02:18:28,869
collapse disorder and mass be died off

3161
02:18:27,341 --> 02:18:30,100
that's happening and one of the biggest

3162
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:32,440
which is one of the reasons why

3163
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:34,149
California went so you know kind of

3164
02:18:32,440 --> 02:18:36,010
regulated even though I'm inappropriate

3165
02:18:34,149 --> 02:18:38,409
you know regulated freeze on tobacco

3166
02:18:36,010 --> 02:18:39,940
it's not going to be for cannabis at the

3167
02:18:38,409 --> 02:18:42,100
end end in California that what super

3168
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:44,020
strict on it especially because of like

3169
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:46,569
how much California is trying to remove

3170
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:48,760
neo nicotine ODEs from you know kind of

3171
02:18:46,569 --> 02:18:51,489
the supply chain you know or just from

3172
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:52,540
you know the agricultural use you know

3173
02:18:51,489 --> 02:18:54,459
so it's like yeah there's so many

3174
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:56,290
pesticides approved by the EPA but does

3175
02:18:54,459 --> 02:18:58,029
that actually mean that you know we're

3176
02:18:56,290 --> 02:19:00,280
not getting harmed icky or chronically

3177
02:18:58,030 --> 02:19:06,010
from the exposure to all these different

3178
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:09,040
you know whatever I don't think the

3179
02:19:06,010 --> 02:19:12,010
average American gives a book I mean why

3180
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:15,310
do they eat it we do them and why do

3181
02:19:12,010 --> 02:19:18,460
they buy all their food from you know

3182
02:19:15,309 --> 02:19:21,939
places that are manufacturing with

3183
02:19:18,459 --> 02:19:24,909
pesticides because they so but like the

3184
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:26,319
cheap prices and you know yeah

3185
02:19:24,909 --> 02:19:28,030
absolutely but also it's you know

3186
02:19:26,319 --> 02:19:31,619
hopefully that you know there I mean

3187
02:19:28,030 --> 02:19:31,620
there's this very interesting kind of

3188
02:19:31,649 --> 02:19:35,379
oxymoron or I don't know if that's even

3189
02:19:33,520 --> 02:19:39,100
the right word you know you have so many

3190
02:19:35,379 --> 02:19:40,869
people buying you know $100 grams of

3191
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:43,720
extract and just trolling people

3192
02:19:40,870 --> 02:19:44,829
relentlessly on Instagram about having

3193
02:19:43,719 --> 02:19:46,779
dirty product

3194
02:19:44,829 --> 02:19:48,068
we're like residual butane or pesticides

3195
02:19:46,780 --> 02:19:49,659
even though yeah they're going to

3196
02:19:48,068 --> 02:19:55,119
McDonald's and eating a Big Mac after

3197
02:19:49,659 --> 02:19:57,459
that three times a day but I think you

3198
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:59,890
know hopefully you know this educates

3199
02:19:57,459 --> 02:20:02,019
makes us aware and you know pushes us to

3200
02:19:59,889 --> 02:20:04,389
you know change our ways what sealed

3201
02:20:02,020 --> 02:20:06,069
mean about the the hippie girl with the

3202
02:20:04,389 --> 02:20:08,879
fish show the dead show bill needs

3203
02:20:06,068 --> 02:20:11,829
organic and vegan but it's taking the

3204
02:20:08,879 --> 02:20:27,879
tan the mystery the mystery liquid in

3205
02:20:11,829 --> 02:20:28,539
the parking lot how much I happen to

3206
02:20:27,879 --> 02:20:31,119
have money

3207
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:32,380
a recent active test results here and if

3208
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:34,210
for those you out there if you want to

3209
02:20:32,379 --> 02:20:36,759
have clean and do clean medicine that's

3210
02:20:34,209 --> 02:20:37,929
what it takes is testing everything over

3211
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:40,239
and over again so I just went through

3212
02:20:37,930 --> 02:20:43,300
this real quickly to see if I had any

3213
02:20:40,239 --> 02:20:45,879
fails in this stack that I have here of

3214
02:20:43,299 --> 02:20:48,599
recent tests probably about thirty or

3215
02:20:45,879 --> 02:20:51,429
forty tests and I pulled out three this

3216
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:54,210
came up really quick from organic farms

3217
02:20:51,430 --> 02:20:58,148
so with the mic will see this one's got

3218
02:20:54,209 --> 02:21:03,219
Michael butanol 2.1 parts per million a

3219
02:20:58,148 --> 02:21:08,289
lot Carrboro twenty point three parts

3220
02:21:03,219 --> 02:21:10,750
per million to I knew how you say this

3221
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:11,430
one to Tabuk ozone Cebu kosoul that's a

3222
02:21:10,750 --> 02:21:14,260
triangle

3223
02:21:11,430 --> 02:21:15,670
Debu console there you go thank you

3224
02:21:14,260 --> 02:21:17,559
that's what we got experts on the show

3225
02:21:15,670 --> 02:21:20,530
they trial fund site that's point two

3226
02:21:17,559 --> 02:21:24,939
parts per million so that one's quite a

3227
02:21:20,530 --> 02:21:27,850
bit from before on an organic form at

3228
02:21:24,939 --> 02:21:36,489
least carpet roll is a big problem metal

3229
02:21:27,850 --> 02:21:39,250
pops up quite a bit that's right yeah so

3230
02:21:36,489 --> 02:21:43,030
at those levels would you think that

3231
02:21:39,250 --> 02:21:45,520
that could still be not coming from a

3232
02:21:43,030 --> 02:21:52,270
foliar application and it could be

3233
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:54,130
coming from say like a mulch or a non of

3234
02:21:52,270 --> 02:21:56,530
mulch what what we were talking about

3235
02:21:54,129 --> 02:21:58,959
the dirty implants yeah like like dirt

3236
02:21:56,530 --> 02:22:03,159
dirty soil could this be a dirty so

3237
02:21:58,959 --> 02:22:05,409
or adrift and not necessarily hey I

3238
02:22:03,159 --> 02:22:07,539
never applied that material to my plants

3239
02:22:05,409 --> 02:22:09,851
at all you know some of these folks

3240
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:11,681
sorry not to jump in but just with her

3241
02:22:09,851 --> 02:22:13,659
with our organization because we're

3242
02:22:11,681 --> 02:22:16,841
dealing with such fragile and small

3243
02:22:13,659 --> 02:22:19,060
children we don't just take whatever

3244
02:22:16,841 --> 02:22:20,290
somebody wants to donate we try to get

3245
02:22:19,060 --> 02:22:22,601
to know these people and some of these

3246
02:22:20,290 --> 02:22:24,610
folks I know well you know it's been a

3247
02:22:22,601 --> 02:22:26,290
it's an uncomfortable situation I'm sure

3248
02:22:24,610 --> 02:22:27,310
that Tony's had this as well or

3249
02:22:26,290 --> 02:22:29,681
something you have when you have to go

3250
02:22:27,310 --> 02:22:32,739
back and say hey sorry you know we had

3251
02:22:29,681 --> 02:22:34,149
to destroy this or not use it and they

3252
02:22:32,739 --> 02:22:35,771
get pretty upset because people put

3253
02:22:34,149 --> 02:22:39,100
their life's work and passion into this

3254
02:22:35,771 --> 02:22:41,681
so I know some of these people are not

3255
02:22:39,101 --> 02:22:45,730
intentionally contaminating you know so

3256
02:22:41,681 --> 02:22:47,431
I was I was personally the guy that's

3257
02:22:45,729 --> 02:22:50,229
kind of like the Grinch of chalice

3258
02:22:47,431 --> 02:22:53,771
because part of my job was to basically

3259
02:22:50,229 --> 02:22:55,180
contact 79 disqualified entrants that

3260
02:22:53,771 --> 02:22:56,500
had pesticides their products knows

3261
02:22:55,181 --> 02:22:58,601
basically they're letting him know that

3262
02:22:56,500 --> 02:23:01,149
they were disqualified because these

3263
02:22:58,601 --> 02:23:03,579
detected pesticides so yeah people super

3264
02:23:01,149 --> 02:23:05,440
pissed but it's like one of the big

3265
02:23:03,579 --> 02:23:06,851
things I was focusing on like with all

3266
02:23:05,440 --> 02:23:08,860
these people I was talking to you I was

3267
02:23:06,851 --> 02:23:12,700
like you know and I mean this is

3268
02:23:08,860 --> 02:23:15,670
honestly although you lost $500 per

3269
02:23:12,700 --> 02:23:18,131
entry you know entry fee you know it's

3270
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:20,380
such a small price to pay to figure this

3271
02:23:18,130 --> 02:23:22,449
out right now where you still have a few

3272
02:23:20,380 --> 02:23:23,949
months to cook the way ahead of it

3273
02:23:22,450 --> 02:23:26,261
because if you don't you're done and

3274
02:23:23,950 --> 02:23:27,460
it's like it's almost too late to figure

3275
02:23:26,261 --> 02:23:29,620
how it's like if you're finding out

3276
02:23:27,459 --> 02:23:30,609
right now that you have you can and that

3277
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:33,101
you've never cleaned out your

3278
02:23:30,610 --> 02:23:34,480
closed-loop system you know and your

3279
02:23:33,101 --> 02:23:35,860
sourcing from all these farms or all

3280
02:23:34,479 --> 02:23:37,329
those material you know and your

3281
02:23:35,860 --> 02:23:39,489
pesticides and the same concentrations

3282
02:23:37,329 --> 02:23:41,170
across the ten samples that were entered

3283
02:23:39,489 --> 02:23:42,640
so I guess so such clear cross

3284
02:23:41,170 --> 02:23:45,460
contamination in your extraction machine

3285
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:46,869
or in your gas and you know and so just

3286
02:23:45,459 --> 02:23:48,369
people coming to where this right now

3287
02:23:46,870 --> 02:23:50,650
it's like a small price to pay to get

3288
02:23:48,370 --> 02:23:52,329
publicly humiliated and this you know in

3289
02:23:50,649 --> 02:23:54,431
one of these you know events and

3290
02:23:52,329 --> 02:23:55,601
competitions because you know six months

3291
02:23:54,431 --> 02:23:57,971
from now it's a quarter-million dollar

3292
02:23:55,601 --> 02:24:01,000
product recall or a liability lawsuit

3293
02:23:57,970 --> 02:24:04,989
yeah you don't test your your race car

3294
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:08,979
on race day okay you don't right okay

3295
02:24:04,989 --> 02:24:11,799
you don't test you are also to some of

3296
02:24:08,979 --> 02:24:14,350
these really persistent and

3297
02:24:11,799 --> 02:24:17,948
systemic insecticides pesticides

3298
02:24:14,350 --> 02:24:20,350
fungicides they get into the soil and

3299
02:24:17,949 --> 02:24:22,090
they persist there for quite a while

3300
02:24:20,350 --> 02:24:23,649
ya know that's exactly right because

3301
02:24:22,090 --> 02:24:26,020
it's like you know if a foliar

3302
02:24:23,648 --> 02:24:27,430
application is applied and then UV from

3303
02:24:26,020 --> 02:24:29,408
the Sun is the biggest thing breaking

3304
02:24:27,430 --> 02:24:31,180
down that systemic residue what happens

3305
02:24:29,408 --> 02:24:33,189
when your route drenching imidacloprid

3306
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:35,139
or route drenching any of these other

3307
02:24:33,189 --> 02:24:36,908
compounds you know because what is the

3308
02:24:35,139 --> 02:24:39,010
half-life or the residue effect there

3309
02:24:36,908 --> 02:24:42,788
you know I would yeah I would totally

3310
02:24:39,010 --> 02:24:44,738
grease that's probably the the biology

3311
02:24:42,789 --> 02:24:46,930
if you have good biology in the soil

3312
02:24:44,738 --> 02:24:49,328
I'll actually buy into a lot of the

3313
02:24:46,930 --> 02:24:54,818
synthetic hydrocarbons that are in the

3314
02:24:49,328 --> 02:24:59,529
soil and bind it to the the soil kind of

3315
02:24:54,818 --> 02:25:01,600
like like bioremediation so they can i

3316
02:24:59,529 --> 02:25:04,090
it's a microbes will actually degrade

3317
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:07,890
some of these actives because again the

3318
02:25:04,090 --> 02:25:10,750
actives are necessarily antimicrobial

3319
02:25:07,889 --> 02:25:13,448
some of these insecticides again will

3320
02:25:10,750 --> 02:25:15,670
have no activity on the microbes and

3321
02:25:13,449 --> 02:25:17,470
when the microbe sees that carbon it's

3322
02:25:15,670 --> 02:25:21,039
gonna eat it like there's no tomorrow as

3323
02:25:17,469 --> 02:25:23,698
though it's sugar you know so again you

3324
02:25:21,039 --> 02:25:26,710
know a lot of chemicals rely on

3325
02:25:23,699 --> 02:25:29,199
microbial degradation to make sure that

3326
02:25:26,709 --> 02:25:33,488
they're either not persistent my arrow

3327
02:25:29,199 --> 02:25:35,380
bo hydrolytic these are all the you know

3328
02:25:33,488 --> 02:25:37,170
reactive handles that they put into

3329
02:25:35,379 --> 02:25:39,368
these active ingredients so they don't

3330
02:25:37,170 --> 02:25:42,549
persists in the environment like the oh

3331
02:25:39,369 --> 02:25:44,859
voice you know i just wanted to give a

3332
02:25:42,549 --> 02:25:47,978
big shout out to the vegetarians out

3333
02:25:44,859 --> 02:25:50,789
there you folks do realize that all the

3334
02:25:47,978 --> 02:25:57,969
white sugar produced it goes through

3335
02:25:50,789 --> 02:26:01,899
activated bone charcoal nice man first

3336
02:25:57,969 --> 02:26:03,188
jello and now this but you know real

3337
02:26:01,898 --> 02:26:04,840
quick cause something i want to kind of

3338
02:26:03,189 --> 02:26:08,408
share a story on one of my really good

3339
02:26:04,840 --> 02:26:10,750
friends you know for a long time santa

3340
02:26:08,408 --> 02:26:14,170
cruz his family has a lot of pear

3341
02:26:10,750 --> 02:26:17,770
orchards or you know massive pear

3342
02:26:14,170 --> 02:26:19,719
orchard up in northern Oregon and you

3343
02:26:17,770 --> 02:26:22,960
know he's an organic certified perform

3344
02:26:19,719 --> 02:26:24,788
but and so so they you know dedicated

3345
02:26:22,959 --> 02:26:25,589
organic and such they go up there they

3346
02:26:24,789 --> 02:26:27,420
get into

3347
02:26:25,590 --> 02:26:29,609
licensed whatever and they you know have

3348
02:26:27,420 --> 02:26:31,978
over 44,000 square for your greenhouse

3349
02:26:29,609 --> 02:26:35,100
going now you know but they've run into

3350
02:26:31,978 --> 02:26:38,699
a major problem and that's that you know

3351
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:41,550
pretty much all the all the surrounding

3352
02:26:38,700 --> 02:26:46,229
farms in the in that Valley all are also

3353
02:26:41,549 --> 02:26:48,148
per orchards are not organic and and

3354
02:26:46,228 --> 02:26:52,049
when they when they spray for pesticides

3355
02:26:48,148 --> 02:26:54,090
they basically have like a like a metal

3356
02:26:52,049 --> 02:26:56,819
pipe grid kind of going around the

3357
02:26:54,090 --> 02:26:58,530
entire orchard with like kind of holes

3358
02:26:56,819 --> 02:27:00,659
kind of throughout that basically they

3359
02:26:58,530 --> 02:27:02,700
charge the line and it just shoots like

3360
02:27:00,659 --> 02:27:04,950
20 30 feet into the air you know these

3361
02:27:02,700 --> 02:27:06,510
these you know these this you know water

3362
02:27:04,950 --> 02:27:09,060
kind of with diluted pesticide or

3363
02:27:06,510 --> 02:27:12,120
undecided in it and and you know there's

3364
02:27:09,059 --> 02:27:13,109
all these these you know rules for when

3365
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:15,540
these pesticides are allowed to be

3366
02:27:13,109 --> 02:27:17,550
applied like no wind you know certain

3367
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:19,680
times of the day or night you know etc

3368
02:27:17,549 --> 02:27:21,688
etc but he's pretty much already had to

3369
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:23,880
threaten lawsuit to a lot of these

3370
02:27:21,689 --> 02:27:26,880
neighboring farms in the valley you know

3371
02:27:23,879 --> 02:27:28,739
because of how how regulated cannabis is

3372
02:27:26,879 --> 02:27:30,148
is you know that they have to be

3373
02:27:28,739 --> 02:27:31,770
notified with X amount of time so they

3374
02:27:30,148 --> 02:27:33,420
can basically batter down the hatches of

3375
02:27:31,770 --> 02:27:35,640
all the greenhouses and then attempts

3376
02:27:33,420 --> 02:27:37,409
when they're spraying to like prevent

3377
02:27:35,639 --> 02:27:39,148
any drift coming in their greenhouses

3378
02:27:37,409 --> 02:27:41,129
and you know they've already although

3379
02:27:39,148 --> 02:27:43,049
not detected and flower

3380
02:27:41,129 --> 02:27:44,819
you know once they made you know kind of

3381
02:27:43,049 --> 02:27:46,529
their product that's all organic and

3382
02:27:44,819 --> 02:27:48,869
extract they're they're seeing this

3383
02:27:46,530 --> 02:27:50,870
consistent like detectable level of like

3384
02:27:48,870 --> 02:27:53,130
a fungicide called boscola

3385
02:27:50,870 --> 02:27:54,960
possibly and it's one of the sides at

3386
02:27:53,129 --> 02:27:57,719
Oregon in California on their list but

3387
02:27:54,959 --> 02:28:00,059
it's a it's a fun set is used on pears

3388
02:27:57,719 --> 02:28:02,099
quite frequently and so you know just

3389
02:28:00,059 --> 02:28:04,648
kind of you know considering kind of how

3390
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:05,760
how kind of drift travels you know and

3391
02:28:04,648 --> 02:28:08,010
and you know when you don't have like

3392
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:10,680
positive displacement or kind of you

3393
02:28:08,010 --> 02:28:12,148
know what have you it's like I mean is a

3394
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:14,159
lot of people like when you think about

3395
02:28:12,148 --> 02:28:16,079
you know all these huge acquisitions of

3396
02:28:14,159 --> 02:28:17,549
all these old kind of you know kind of

3397
02:28:16,079 --> 02:28:19,680
cut flower or farm green houses

3398
02:28:17,549 --> 02:28:22,319
throughout Monterey and Salinas is they

3399
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:24,479
I mean I my holy [ __ ] did there might be

3400
02:28:22,319 --> 02:28:26,699
he might be shown that a lot of areas

3401
02:28:24,478 --> 02:28:28,648
can't grow herb that is in compliance

3402
02:28:26,700 --> 02:28:31,500
with what the state requirements and

3403
02:28:28,648 --> 02:28:32,369
limits bus has really at least in

3404
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:35,549
greenhouses

3405
02:28:32,370 --> 02:28:36,810
the pesticide is a bit contained what's

3406
02:28:35,549 --> 02:28:39,399
worse is when they're growing

3407
02:28:36,809 --> 02:28:42,069
strawberries and other outdoor crops

3408
02:28:39,399 --> 02:28:47,739
I was just the nation like airplanes to

3409
02:28:42,069 --> 02:28:49,181
spray I was in the in the 90s and you

3410
02:28:47,739 --> 02:28:51,550
know how they use the plastic on the

3411
02:28:49,181 --> 02:28:53,591
strawberries well one they were using

3412
02:28:51,550 --> 02:28:57,399
methyl bromide back then they didn't

3413
02:28:53,591 --> 02:28:59,110
think about good and our grapes they

3414
02:28:57,399 --> 02:29:00,970
were injecting the methyl bromide to

3415
02:28:59,110 --> 02:29:02,681
strawberry fields that were in kind of a

3416
02:29:00,970 --> 02:29:04,841
residential neighborhood the wind came

3417
02:29:02,681 --> 02:29:07,329
and blew that plastic tarp off from weed

3418
02:29:04,841 --> 02:29:11,290
control that actually sustained the the

3419
02:29:07,329 --> 02:29:13,390
the the gas within the soil that the

3420
02:29:11,290 --> 02:29:19,511
tarp came off and they had to evacuate

3421
02:29:13,390 --> 02:29:21,039
four blocks of houses because of this

3422
02:29:19,511 --> 02:29:24,521
methyl bromide that was used on

3423
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:26,980
strawberries so yeah I grew up on the

3424
02:29:24,521 --> 02:29:28,631
Ares I grew up in the Central Valley in

3425
02:29:26,979 --> 02:29:30,609
California and yeah there's no

3426
02:29:28,630 --> 02:29:32,619
containing add those crop tests we used

3427
02:29:30,610 --> 02:29:35,560
to play as kids next to some of those

3428
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:37,271
fields and because we rented houses

3429
02:29:35,560 --> 02:29:39,489
there growing up and I remember they'd

3430
02:29:37,271 --> 02:29:41,579
start spraying you know twenty yards

3431
02:29:39,489 --> 02:29:45,250
before the field and we would just get

3432
02:29:41,579 --> 02:29:47,261
dosed in it you know it's it's just a

3433
02:29:45,250 --> 02:29:49,239
sloppy application and it's really gonna

3434
02:29:47,261 --> 02:29:51,250
happen things impact do you think that

3435
02:29:49,239 --> 02:29:52,989
dosage while you were as a kid had

3436
02:29:51,250 --> 02:29:54,940
anything to do with what's going on with

3437
02:29:52,989 --> 02:29:59,610
you your kid now now I think it's where

3438
02:29:54,940 --> 02:30:03,790
I got my superpowers yeah I have no idea

3439
02:29:59,610 --> 02:30:06,069
but yeah you just bathe in it I know I

3440
02:30:03,790 --> 02:30:07,960
know I used to follow the mosquito truck

3441
02:30:06,069 --> 02:30:15,970
down my back lane while it was spring

3442
02:30:07,959 --> 02:30:17,770
zyklon-b I used to do the same thing

3443
02:30:15,970 --> 02:30:22,739
following a mosquito truck when I lived

3444
02:30:17,771 --> 02:30:22,739
in Florida my bicycle

3445
02:30:24,300 --> 02:30:36,010
oh my god people gasoline and the

3446
02:30:33,851 --> 02:30:39,011
mosquito trucks drove around spraying

3447
02:30:36,011 --> 02:30:40,690
DDT all the time and as kids we rode

3448
02:30:39,011 --> 02:30:43,000
behind it and bicycles because it was

3449
02:30:40,690 --> 02:30:49,780
the only mosquito free zone we could

3450
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:53,319
find own wealth story and well we're all

3451
02:30:49,780 --> 02:30:57,489
gonna die I want to stir it back to

3452
02:30:53,319 --> 02:31:00,851
how cannabis can flourish in scenarios

3453
02:30:57,489 --> 02:31:03,310
where pesticide and fungicide isn't

3454
02:31:00,851 --> 02:31:05,620
really needed I really you know this

3455
02:31:03,310 --> 02:31:08,229
plant involved without our interventions

3456
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:12,190
and I really think there's a thing with

3457
02:31:08,229 --> 02:31:14,079
soil biology and also identification of

3458
02:31:12,190 --> 02:31:16,659
the types that grow in these different

3459
02:31:14,079 --> 02:31:18,700
environments and again indoor and in

3460
02:31:16,659 --> 02:31:21,010
greenhouses to an extent you can create

3461
02:31:18,700 --> 02:31:24,250
different environments outdoor you're

3462
02:31:21,010 --> 02:31:26,800
kind of limited but this is an

3463
02:31:24,250 --> 02:31:29,560
incredibly diverse gene pool that we've

3464
02:31:26,799 --> 02:31:31,779
created at this point and I really it's

3465
02:31:29,560 --> 02:31:34,810
been my experience and I really want to

3466
02:31:31,780 --> 02:31:37,061
push the idea that with the right

3467
02:31:34,810 --> 02:31:39,069
cultivars and the right attention to the

3468
02:31:37,060 --> 02:31:41,319
soil or the biology and whatever

3469
02:31:39,069 --> 02:31:46,199
material you're growing in including

3470
02:31:41,319 --> 02:31:48,819
indoors and greenhouses you can find

3471
02:31:46,200 --> 02:31:52,391
plants that will give you what you're

3472
02:31:48,819 --> 02:31:54,310
seeking and not have to get any

3473
02:31:52,390 --> 02:31:56,979
applications of any of these things that

3474
02:31:54,310 --> 02:31:59,140
we've been discussing today and I'm

3475
02:31:56,979 --> 02:32:01,569
really pushing this idea because one

3476
02:31:59,140 --> 02:32:04,329
Alec was mentioning that small farms

3477
02:32:01,569 --> 02:32:05,739
have an advantage here that large farms

3478
02:32:04,329 --> 02:32:08,079
aren't going to be able to work with

3479
02:32:05,739 --> 02:32:10,750
because at a small farm you can source

3480
02:32:08,079 --> 02:32:12,670
your inputs yourself you can control

3481
02:32:10,750 --> 02:32:14,771
what your compost is just like if you

3482
02:32:12,670 --> 02:32:16,719
control if the biology is like you can

3483
02:32:14,771 --> 02:32:19,470
make friends with your neighbors so that

3484
02:32:16,719 --> 02:32:22,239
they're not spraying on your stuff and

3485
02:32:19,469 --> 02:32:25,750
it's been my experience I'll say it like

3486
02:32:22,239 --> 02:32:27,729
that that I've had some success finding

3487
02:32:25,750 --> 02:32:30,879
plants that flourish in the environment

3488
02:32:27,729 --> 02:32:34,989
I can offer here and I I want to suggest

3489
02:32:30,879 --> 02:32:38,079
to anyone that cares to explore the

3490
02:32:34,989 --> 02:32:40,000
different plants that are out there you

3491
02:32:38,079 --> 02:32:42,219
can probably find something that's going

3492
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,780
to give you what you want in the

3493
02:32:42,219 --> 02:32:45,549
environment you're working with and

3494
02:32:43,780 --> 02:32:47,170
you're going to find it's not going to

3495
02:32:45,549 --> 02:32:50,079
need all these things that we've been

3496
02:32:47,170 --> 02:32:51,729
talking about and when I find a plant

3497
02:32:50,079 --> 02:32:54,851
that I really love and it isn't

3498
02:32:51,729 --> 02:32:57,579
challenged by bugs or whatnot insect

3499
02:32:54,851 --> 02:32:59,851
frass is one of the routine supplements

3500
02:32:57,579 --> 02:33:06,469
that I use in the soil amazing

3501
02:32:59,851 --> 02:33:08,819
but I also like a certain plant based

3502
02:33:06,469 --> 02:33:10,938
amendments that I can use in the soil I

3503
02:33:08,818 --> 02:33:14,850
like comfrey

3504
02:33:10,939 --> 02:33:20,579
stinging nettle and horse tail makes a

3505
02:33:14,850 --> 02:33:24,449
tea that irritates bugs but doesn't seem

3506
02:33:20,579 --> 02:33:26,818
to really be a pesticide per se and

3507
02:33:24,449 --> 02:33:28,380
meantime plants seem to be really

3508
02:33:26,818 --> 02:33:31,049
stimulated and liked it a lot

3509
02:33:28,379 --> 02:33:34,108
that's an example one of the only foyer

3510
02:33:31,049 --> 02:33:37,019
sprays that I use is water especially

3511
02:33:34,109 --> 02:33:39,568
adjusting the pH of water but and I've

3512
02:33:37,020 --> 02:33:43,370
heard Mike there's been discussion here

3513
02:33:39,568 --> 02:33:46,079
about using electrolysis to do that but

3514
02:33:43,370 --> 02:33:48,239
yeah boiler spray of water really has

3515
02:33:46,079 --> 02:33:51,000
remarkable effects when you spray water

3516
02:33:48,238 --> 02:33:52,829
is it at a specific time like I mean I

3517
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:55,020
know you don't really want to do it when

3518
02:33:52,829 --> 02:33:59,639
the Sun is high in the sky and burn a

3519
02:33:55,020 --> 02:34:02,850
lot only if I'm indoors it's right when

3520
02:33:59,639 --> 02:34:05,028
the lights come on or just before I

3521
02:34:02,850 --> 02:34:07,800
don't like to do it as the lights go off

3522
02:34:05,029 --> 02:34:10,199
outdoors again just following that same

3523
02:34:07,799 --> 02:34:12,809
thing in the mornings when the stomata

3524
02:34:10,199 --> 02:34:14,579
on the leaves open up it's a real good

3525
02:34:12,809 --> 02:34:17,189
time to give them some moisture rinse

3526
02:34:14,579 --> 02:34:18,809
the dust off they'll take in some

3527
02:34:17,189 --> 02:34:21,420
moisture there that happens in nature

3528
02:34:18,809 --> 02:34:24,090
that's really the guiding principle

3529
02:34:21,420 --> 02:34:27,090
about how I work with plants is to try

3530
02:34:24,090 --> 02:34:28,920
and understand what nature is like for

3531
02:34:27,090 --> 02:34:32,130
those plants where they come from and

3532
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:34,710
then my duplicate thank you

3533
02:34:32,129 --> 02:34:36,509
yes exactly and I think because the

3534
02:34:34,709 --> 02:34:39,809
plant the genetic pool that we've

3535
02:34:36,510 --> 02:34:41,279
created is so diverse I really think

3536
02:34:39,809 --> 02:34:44,068
that whatever conditions you're working

3537
02:34:41,279 --> 02:34:45,779
with you can find plants that will

3538
02:34:44,068 --> 02:34:47,549
flourish in your scenario and then all

3539
02:34:45,779 --> 02:34:50,100
of a sudden this conversations about

3540
02:34:47,549 --> 02:34:54,148
various things to control pests or

3541
02:34:50,100 --> 02:34:58,380
diseases in check are not so relevant

3542
02:34:54,148 --> 02:35:00,629
and this plant it's incredible what this

3543
02:34:58,379 --> 02:35:03,448
plant is capable of I mean we all every

3544
02:35:00,629 --> 02:35:05,639
one of us has some aspect of deep

3545
02:35:03,449 --> 02:35:07,739
respect for what this plant can do for

3546
02:35:05,639 --> 02:35:11,459
us humans and I really do think that we

3547
02:35:07,738 --> 02:35:15,799
have evolved with this plant to benefit

3548
02:35:11,459 --> 02:35:18,020
from it and it has evolved to benefit us

3549
02:35:15,799 --> 02:35:20,750
all indefinitely hints

3550
02:35:18,021 --> 02:35:23,150
that in yes look the botany of desire

3551
02:35:20,751 --> 02:35:26,149
and I I'm in agreeance with them like

3552
02:35:23,149 --> 02:35:30,039
what a great companion we have both been

3553
02:35:26,149 --> 02:35:32,539
to one another cannabis and humanity

3554
02:35:30,040 --> 02:35:36,200
it's like it's like the dog to the plant

3555
02:35:32,540 --> 02:35:37,391
world right it is it is a very

3556
02:35:36,200 --> 02:35:39,860
successful plant

3557
02:35:37,390 --> 02:35:46,190
yeah it's our companion so it's

3558
02:35:39,860 --> 02:35:47,540
coevolution you know and I'm the kind of

3559
02:35:46,190 --> 02:35:48,829
teeming with microbes approach yeah I

3560
02:35:47,540 --> 02:35:50,811
mean you know whenever you're looking to

3561
02:35:48,829 --> 02:35:52,521
nature for more efficient design and

3562
02:35:50,810 --> 02:35:55,579
you're able to like as close to

3563
02:35:52,521 --> 02:35:57,079
potentially possible recreate that you

3564
02:35:55,579 --> 02:35:58,431
know and you know and I know people that

3565
02:35:57,079 --> 02:36:00,351
are having such amazing success

3566
02:35:58,431 --> 02:36:02,181
especially on kind of big scale Kai

3567
02:36:00,351 --> 02:36:03,681
production Canada you know working with

3568
02:36:02,181 --> 02:36:05,870
and teeming with kind of predatory mites

3569
02:36:03,681 --> 02:36:07,431
like for similar some sworsky mites and

3570
02:36:05,870 --> 02:36:10,160
you know and kind of just having this

3571
02:36:07,431 --> 02:36:12,171
very methodical never deviating from

3572
02:36:10,159 --> 02:36:13,579
kind of preventative approach you know

3573
02:36:12,171 --> 02:36:14,239
the whole ounce of prevention is worth a

3574
02:36:13,579 --> 02:36:15,710
pound of cure

3575
02:36:14,239 --> 02:36:18,110
you know and you're using different

3576
02:36:15,710 --> 02:36:20,300
rotational horticultural oils and bio

3577
02:36:18,110 --> 02:36:22,251
fungicides and bio insecticides and

3578
02:36:20,300 --> 02:36:24,260
compost teas it's like I mean it's just

3579
02:36:22,251 --> 02:36:27,710
amazing because it's like that's the

3580
02:36:24,261 --> 02:36:30,200
leading possible potentially penitential

3581
02:36:27,710 --> 02:36:33,319
way to grow plant to maximize ability

3582
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:35,240
with a you know maximized increases in

3583
02:36:33,319 --> 02:36:37,011
secondary metabolite production you know

3584
02:36:35,239 --> 02:36:39,771
it's just so funny and amazing that kind

3585
02:36:37,011 --> 02:36:43,940
of you know cannabis farmers have

3586
02:36:39,771 --> 02:36:46,489
figured out how to be become the if they

3587
02:36:43,940 --> 02:36:48,171
choose the path the best farmers that

3588
02:36:46,489 --> 02:36:49,851
are possible and so yeah i really hope

3589
02:36:48,171 --> 02:36:51,501
and have a lot of faith that that's

3590
02:36:49,851 --> 02:36:52,671
going to carry over and you know

3591
02:36:51,501 --> 02:36:54,380
hopefully empower through hemp

3592
02:36:52,671 --> 02:36:56,870
production a lot of other you know or

3593
02:36:54,380 --> 02:36:59,001
other farms who you know might have been

3594
02:36:56,870 --> 02:36:59,931
growing GMO corn up to this point you

3595
02:36:59,001 --> 02:37:02,300
know but hopefully you know it's the

3596
02:36:59,931 --> 02:37:09,310
thing that is catalyst to help shift you

3597
02:37:02,300 --> 02:37:12,050
know luck with corn 90% of its GMO

3598
02:37:09,310 --> 02:37:14,210
ninety-four economic model that drives

3599
02:37:12,050 --> 02:37:18,350
the cannabis industry right now is based

3600
02:37:14,210 --> 02:37:21,260
on quality right now our food is not

3601
02:37:18,351 --> 02:37:24,471
that way you know most kids right now

3602
02:37:21,261 --> 02:37:26,239
don't give a [ __ ] about the nutrient

3603
02:37:24,470 --> 02:37:28,189
density within the commodity that

3604
02:37:26,239 --> 02:37:30,530
they're ingesting they're right it's all

3605
02:37:28,190 --> 02:37:31,770
about price well they're not even seeing

3606
02:37:30,530 --> 02:37:33,739
the hypocrisy of

3607
02:37:31,770 --> 02:37:36,210
alik just mentioned spending days

3608
02:37:33,738 --> 02:37:39,148
trolling people relentlessly for their

3609
02:37:36,209 --> 02:37:42,469
dirty extracts while just consuming the

3610
02:37:39,148 --> 02:37:45,629
lowest quality of food known to man

3611
02:37:42,469 --> 02:37:46,739
we're good about McDonald's you making

3612
02:37:45,629 --> 02:37:50,409
me want to go get one

3613
02:37:46,739 --> 02:37:50,409
[Laughter]

3614
02:37:52,309 --> 02:37:59,068
preventative you know so if you got

3615
02:37:55,709 --> 02:38:00,568
clean certified genetics you started to

3616
02:37:59,068 --> 02:38:02,309
grow and you took all of these best

3617
02:38:00,568 --> 02:38:06,868
practices that's being discussed today

3618
02:38:02,309 --> 02:38:09,930
to wade and kind everybody there Cohn

3619
02:38:06,869 --> 02:38:13,399
roots with his product let's say you're

3620
02:38:09,930 --> 02:38:16,470
doing everything you can possibly do to

3621
02:38:13,398 --> 02:38:19,769
give the plant its most healthy

3622
02:38:16,469 --> 02:38:22,948
environment and its best potential to be

3623
02:38:19,770 --> 02:38:25,319
as strong as it can be and it has

3624
02:38:22,949 --> 02:38:28,380
exposed her to you via the Sun in some

3625
02:38:25,318 --> 02:38:33,478
capacity it's going to it's going to

3626
02:38:28,379 --> 02:38:36,089
naturally ward off pests and and p.m.

3627
02:38:33,478 --> 02:38:37,559
and things like that so I mean that's

3628
02:38:36,090 --> 02:38:43,859
what that's what the the bottom line

3629
02:38:37,559 --> 02:38:46,260
here is prevention and and systems

3630
02:38:43,859 --> 02:38:51,869
approach you know systems of how you

3631
02:38:46,260 --> 02:38:53,279
manage your IPM is the key yeah and also

3632
02:38:51,869 --> 02:38:56,069
considering - you know it's it's it's

3633
02:38:53,279 --> 02:38:58,529
really interesting because you know he's

3634
02:38:56,068 --> 02:39:00,809
so when I used to work in the hydroponic

3635
02:38:58,529 --> 02:39:02,520
stores in Santa Cruz you know have one

3636
02:39:00,809 --> 02:39:05,038
of the most frequent things I would see

3637
02:39:02,520 --> 02:39:07,500
happen as you know people would like

3638
02:39:05,039 --> 02:39:10,079
essentially cut corners on you know

3639
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:12,119
build out or like dehumidification say

3640
02:39:10,078 --> 02:39:14,609
and then like they'll go overboard and

3641
02:39:12,119 --> 02:39:17,699
get like the full 20 part kind of you

3642
02:39:14,609 --> 02:39:19,020
know nutrient kind of you know PGR is

3643
02:39:17,699 --> 02:39:21,689
everything - you know almost

3644
02:39:19,020 --> 02:39:23,760
overcompensate with their nutrients for

3645
02:39:21,689 --> 02:39:25,529
a shitty environment or whatever and and

3646
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:26,908
in you know 80% your success in so many

3647
02:39:25,529 --> 02:39:29,520
ways comes the environment that they're

3648
02:39:26,908 --> 02:39:31,590
that you created and you know when you

3649
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:33,630
consider like light DEP revised like the

3650
02:39:31,590 --> 02:39:35,068
private herb you know most people and I

3651
02:39:33,629 --> 02:39:36,658
think we talked about this on on house

3652
02:39:35,068 --> 02:39:38,908
courage before but you know when you

3653
02:39:36,658 --> 02:39:40,680
take a blackout tarp and you cover up

3654
02:39:38,908 --> 02:39:42,510
like a row of class that you're light

3655
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:45,630
that being you know you you create this

3656
02:39:42,510 --> 02:39:48,090
micro it's almost like putting a clone

3657
02:39:45,629 --> 02:39:49,829
phone trade Oman to create a hundred

3658
02:39:48,090 --> 02:39:51,630
percent humidity you know so for the

3659
02:39:49,829 --> 02:39:54,510
whole night you you know you have this

3660
02:39:51,629 --> 02:39:56,489
like shift and in humidity to where it's

3661
02:39:54,510 --> 02:39:58,050
it's at seventy to eighty percent for

3662
02:39:56,489 --> 02:40:00,209
the rest of the night and that's like

3663
02:39:58,049 --> 02:40:02,069
perfect proliferative environment for

3664
02:40:00,209 --> 02:40:04,769
these microbes and powdery mildew inside

3665
02:40:02,069 --> 02:40:06,989
that's that's what that's what is on

3666
02:40:04,770 --> 02:40:10,409
your fans are more you can easily

3667
02:40:06,989 --> 02:40:12,799
control humidity in the darkened

3668
02:40:10,409 --> 02:40:15,299
greenhouse I've done it for 30 years

3669
02:40:12,799 --> 02:40:17,039
right but how many people I mean and you

3670
02:40:15,299 --> 02:40:18,599
know and I think it's a part of people's

3671
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:20,580
own evolution it's like understanding

3672
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:23,069
how much the environment that you create

3673
02:40:20,579 --> 02:40:25,110
is also one of the biggest things you

3674
02:40:23,069 --> 02:40:27,809
could do so like prevent pest and

3675
02:40:25,110 --> 02:40:29,430
pathology and using your attention like

3676
02:40:27,809 --> 02:40:31,199
sprays from the time the plants are

3677
02:40:29,430 --> 02:40:33,540
small to where you can get full plant

3678
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:34,979
coverage with neem or peppermint oil you

3679
02:40:33,540 --> 02:40:36,600
know by the time they're huge you're

3680
02:40:34,978 --> 02:40:37,500
just doing your weekly sprays and even

3681
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:38,760
though you might not cover every

3682
02:40:37,500 --> 02:40:40,319
understand every topside every single

3683
02:40:38,760 --> 02:40:41,610
leaf you know since you've been doing

3684
02:40:40,319 --> 02:40:43,439
methodically every week since the plant

3685
02:40:41,610 --> 02:40:45,149
was a baby it's like you know you you're

3686
02:40:43,439 --> 02:40:47,010
pretty contained you know but that's

3687
02:40:45,148 --> 02:40:49,529
such a body of knowledge and work and

3688
02:40:47,010 --> 02:40:51,180
dedication devotion and so many people

3689
02:40:49,530 --> 02:40:55,140
like that are scaling a thousand percent

3690
02:40:51,180 --> 02:40:56,520
it's like you know they you know it's

3691
02:40:55,139 --> 02:40:59,069
just it's hard to maintain a really

3692
02:40:56,520 --> 02:41:01,739
integrity based IPM strategy you know

3693
02:40:59,069 --> 02:41:03,779
whenever you're you know overextended or

3694
02:41:01,739 --> 02:41:05,340
you don't have enough staff because you

3695
02:41:03,780 --> 02:41:08,430
know it's always been you know you can

3696
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:09,898
handle so much more canopy space with so

3697
02:41:08,430 --> 02:41:15,389
many less employees because this place

3698
02:41:09,898 --> 02:41:16,949
pesticides but you know financing your

3699
02:41:15,389 --> 02:41:18,539
operation I need to protect your crop

3700
02:41:16,950 --> 02:41:20,010
and you have proven methodologies that

3701
02:41:18,540 --> 02:41:22,380
are gonna do exactly what you're talking

3702
02:41:20,010 --> 02:41:23,489
about Alec that's one of the caveats in

3703
02:41:22,379 --> 02:41:28,289
this industry as well

3704
02:41:23,489 --> 02:41:35,209
the economics you know it definitely

3705
02:41:28,290 --> 02:41:35,210
cost more to use IPM III was the largest

3706
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:43,460
biological control person in Europe for

3707
02:41:39,989 --> 02:41:43,459
years and years on cannabis

3708
02:41:46,149 --> 02:41:51,219
and thank you very much for that Sam

3709
02:41:48,370 --> 02:41:52,990
deep respect Sam mmm

3710
02:41:51,219 --> 02:41:55,689
Sam butan Sammy I'm sorry you didn't

3711
02:41:52,989 --> 02:41:57,810
know you were did you have disease pest

3712
02:41:55,690 --> 02:42:00,819
management that's McPartlin correct

3713
02:41:57,810 --> 02:42:01,840
excuse me what was that question it's a

3714
02:42:00,819 --> 02:42:04,270
little bit quiet

3715
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:05,920
sorry hemp disease pest management was

3716
02:42:04,271 --> 02:42:10,800
that McPartland did you have a part of

3717
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:14,319
that to do with that work all all of the

3718
02:42:10,799 --> 02:42:17,770
practical suggestions were for me

3719
02:42:14,319 --> 02:42:22,989
John did research in libraries Robert

3720
02:42:17,771 --> 02:42:26,230
took photographs and I wrote the all the

3721
02:42:22,989 --> 02:42:29,139
how to use the materials and what works

3722
02:42:26,229 --> 02:42:31,049
and what doesn't because I've got 40

3723
02:42:29,139 --> 02:42:34,569
years experience Jeezy and I think

3724
02:42:31,049 --> 02:42:36,579
that's still to this days like the the

3725
02:42:34,569 --> 02:42:40,000
guideline textbook kind of in the

3726
02:42:36,579 --> 02:42:43,329
subject so thank you for your work my

3727
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:46,030
goal at that time was specifically to

3728
02:42:43,329 --> 02:42:47,760
allow people to have alternatives to

3729
02:42:46,030 --> 02:42:52,811
dangerous pesticides insecticides

3730
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:55,780
fungicides and I hope it helped but yeah

3731
02:42:52,810 --> 02:42:59,260
we're - being honest people almost have

3732
02:42:55,780 --> 02:43:02,829
to be driven into using IPM it's not

3733
02:42:59,260 --> 02:43:06,370
enough people have a good enough

3734
02:43:02,829 --> 02:43:09,399
conscience and they just not like they

3735
02:43:06,370 --> 02:43:12,070
they prefer to save time save money and

3736
02:43:09,399 --> 02:43:14,139
do it the easy way which is nuke them

3737
02:43:12,069 --> 02:43:15,639
with some sort of nasty [ __ ] well and

3738
02:43:14,139 --> 02:43:17,680
also because usually whenever somebody's

3739
02:43:15,639 --> 02:43:19,510
going at a hydro store - you know it's

3740
02:43:17,680 --> 02:43:20,829
like even though you know the products

3741
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:22,149
you recommend there's like oh you're and

3742
02:43:20,829 --> 02:43:23,799
week two or three or flower you actually

3743
02:43:22,149 --> 02:43:25,149
shouldn't really spray anything but if

3744
02:43:23,799 --> 02:43:27,129
you are going to spray something here

3745
02:43:25,149 --> 02:43:30,250
are these organic products that you can

3746
02:43:27,129 --> 02:43:31,779
spray if you do you spend 30 hours in

3747
02:43:30,250 --> 02:43:33,610
your room just spray and coat every

3748
02:43:31,780 --> 02:43:34,989
plant you know but it's like by the time

3749
02:43:33,610 --> 02:43:36,220
so many people are coming in to the

3750
02:43:34,989 --> 02:43:38,289
hydro stores to try to find a solution

3751
02:43:36,219 --> 02:43:39,789
it's because they have a deep

3752
02:43:38,290 --> 02:43:41,860
infestation and by that point you know

3753
02:43:39,790 --> 02:43:43,811
it's too late but you see people's like

3754
02:43:41,860 --> 02:43:46,210
moral compass shift really quickly when

3755
02:43:43,810 --> 02:43:48,819
they're faced with huge loss to be

3756
02:43:46,209 --> 02:43:53,049
honest the only thing I ever sprayed was

3757
02:43:48,819 --> 02:43:56,379
bacteria Thurn Janice BT I would do that

3758
02:43:53,049 --> 02:43:59,469
in vegetative but I I never sprayed any

3759
02:43:56,379 --> 02:44:00,509
things on my plants no teas none of this

3760
02:43:59,469 --> 02:44:04,890
kind of

3761
02:44:00,510 --> 02:44:08,130
i biodynamically fertilized my soil in

3762
02:44:04,890 --> 02:44:11,219
between crops and the plants never seem

3763
02:44:08,129 --> 02:44:14,399
to need it that and super super heavy

3764
02:44:11,219 --> 02:44:16,129
prevention I was using at one time 22

3765
02:44:14,399 --> 02:44:19,379
different kinds of predators

3766
02:44:16,129 --> 02:44:21,869
preventively there was no problem I was

3767
02:44:19,379 --> 02:44:23,579
using them preventively the majority

3768
02:44:21,870 --> 02:44:26,160
well and that's I think what's so

3769
02:44:23,579 --> 02:44:27,239
exciting about like the the future of

3770
02:44:26,159 --> 02:44:28,860
what we're talking about it's like you

3771
02:44:27,239 --> 02:44:30,869
know with biodynamic farming and

3772
02:44:28,860 --> 02:44:32,851
permaculture models and sustainable soil

3773
02:44:30,870 --> 02:44:34,829
models of like regenerating topsoil

3774
02:44:32,851 --> 02:44:36,420
creating the most you know rich

3775
02:44:34,829 --> 02:44:39,000
biodiversity

3776
02:44:36,420 --> 02:44:41,729
that's cannabis really fit does cannabis

3777
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:44,069
really fit into permaculture it's an

3778
02:44:41,729 --> 02:44:45,869
annual it gets harvested every year I

3779
02:44:44,069 --> 02:44:47,549
just need more in the model of like you

3780
02:44:45,870 --> 02:44:49,980
know yeah it's like using local source

3781
02:44:47,549 --> 02:44:52,140
inputs and might you know like you know

3782
02:44:49,979 --> 02:44:54,629
kind of acclimated kind of microbes that

3783
02:44:52,140 --> 02:44:56,190
are from you you know then just covering

3784
02:44:54,629 --> 02:44:57,959
all the bases and buildings so because I

3785
02:44:56,190 --> 02:45:00,329
mean whenever you have like all the

3786
02:44:57,959 --> 02:45:02,699
necessary microbes in your soil you know

3787
02:45:00,329 --> 02:45:04,890
oftentimes you're they're both helping

3788
02:45:02,700 --> 02:45:07,021
to find and transport all the nutrients

3789
02:45:04,890 --> 02:45:09,090
needed and break down and you know kind

3790
02:45:07,021 --> 02:45:11,610
of send around but also you know kind of

3791
02:45:09,090 --> 02:45:14,101
they're they're as natural plant without

3792
02:45:11,610 --> 02:45:16,980
a ball stomach microbiome and it's in

3793
02:45:14,101 --> 02:45:19,860
for an immune system you know what I've

3794
02:45:16,979 --> 02:45:22,529
also found in greenhouses is even if

3795
02:45:19,860 --> 02:45:24,540
your soil is perfect and I'm talking

3796
02:45:22,530 --> 02:45:29,900
about the soil of in the earth not

3797
02:45:24,540 --> 02:45:33,680
container soil and you biodynamically it

3798
02:45:29,899 --> 02:45:36,600
enriches your soil furred for decades

3799
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:39,030
pests will still take off if you

3800
02:45:36,601 --> 02:45:42,180
introduce them into a greenhouse you've

3801
02:45:39,030 --> 02:45:45,920
created a perfect environment for pests

3802
02:45:42,180 --> 02:45:45,920
in an enclosed greenhouse

3803
02:45:49,918 --> 02:45:55,228
interesting long drawn-out pause

3804
02:45:52,318 --> 02:45:59,788
everyone's taking a breath hmm

3805
02:45:55,228 --> 02:46:01,969
all right barrio it's true you make the

3806
02:45:59,789 --> 02:46:07,680
environment safe for the plants

3807
02:46:01,969 --> 02:46:11,639
everything else as a conversation for a

3808
02:46:07,680 --> 02:46:12,149
second so I'll take a bong rip with you

3809
02:46:11,639 --> 02:46:15,329
at 10:00

3810
02:46:12,149 --> 02:46:15,329
[Music]

3811
02:46:16,978 --> 02:46:32,908
naturally cobalt particularly I do find

3812
02:46:30,148 --> 02:46:36,059
plants some plants are resistant to some

3813
02:46:32,908 --> 02:46:39,478
pests and diseases but unfortunately

3814
02:46:36,059 --> 02:46:41,219
most growers although they might be

3815
02:46:39,478 --> 02:46:44,698
looking for those what they're really

3816
02:46:41,219 --> 02:46:48,179
looking for is what's popular and what

3817
02:46:44,699 --> 02:46:49,800
sells at the moment to be honest well

3818
02:46:48,180 --> 02:46:55,379
and I also think that from our last

3819
02:46:49,799 --> 02:46:58,889
conversation if you were able to express

3820
02:46:55,379 --> 02:47:00,869
the different types of terpene profiles

3821
02:46:58,889 --> 02:47:03,180
like when you were we were talking about

3822
02:47:00,869 --> 02:47:08,939
having all nine of them light up in

3823
02:47:03,180 --> 02:47:10,770
people equal equal right we you know you

3824
02:47:08,939 --> 02:47:12,869
were saying what that flavor and all

3825
02:47:10,770 --> 02:47:15,238
that kind of stuff was for but these

3826
02:47:12,869 --> 02:47:17,819
plants also are responding to different

3827
02:47:15,238 --> 02:47:20,219
environments and different areas when

3828
02:47:17,818 --> 02:47:22,168
they're growing but and her pains are

3829
02:47:20,219 --> 02:47:26,998
can be repellents for different things

3830
02:47:22,168 --> 02:47:29,908
and they using and expressing is like a

3831
02:47:26,998 --> 02:47:33,119
language I wouldn't be surprised if some

3832
02:47:29,908 --> 02:47:39,510
terpenes are attracted to some insects

3833
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:41,399
insects and fungus they are their

3834
02:47:39,510 --> 02:47:43,738
natural plant defense mechanisms right

3835
02:47:41,398 --> 02:47:45,748
so like lure predator prey or to Ward

3836
02:47:43,738 --> 02:47:48,180
predators and lure pollinators well look

3837
02:47:45,748 --> 02:47:50,939
look what it does top it lures us in and

3838
02:47:48,180 --> 02:47:53,578
lures deer and all kinds of animals my

3839
02:47:50,939 --> 02:47:56,459
little Pomeranian loves cannabis if you

3840
02:47:53,578 --> 02:47:59,760
if she if she can get to it even if it's

3841
02:47:56,459 --> 02:48:02,729
in an edible zip lock up black locked up

3842
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:03,360
in a backpack put in a closet if she can

3843
02:48:02,728 --> 02:48:05,250
you

3844
02:48:03,360 --> 02:48:07,140
to it and and get her mouth into the

3845
02:48:05,250 --> 02:48:08,579
backpack and open it she'll hunt it down

3846
02:48:07,139 --> 02:48:11,340
and find it if you put her in your

3847
02:48:08,579 --> 02:48:13,229
garden and we walked a greenhouse and

3848
02:48:11,340 --> 02:48:14,969
you've got like you know two-foot plants

3849
02:48:13,229 --> 02:48:16,949
all the little lower leaves along our

3850
02:48:14,969 --> 02:48:18,689
little path that we walked she's gonna

3851
02:48:16,950 --> 02:48:22,380
nibble at him all along the way she has

3852
02:48:18,690 --> 02:48:24,690
no control over is she always that baby

3853
02:48:22,379 --> 02:48:27,539
or endocannabinoid system needs a little

3854
02:48:24,690 --> 02:48:31,850
shot honey tell me she'd be happy he

3855
02:48:27,540 --> 02:48:31,850
doesn't have a Great Dane like my sister

3856
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:38,699
I try to keep everything away from her

3857
02:48:36,090 --> 02:48:41,100
and then I would come home and you could

3858
02:48:38,700 --> 02:48:42,570
tell that she was getting high yeah

3859
02:48:41,100 --> 02:48:44,069
where is she getting all this stuff was

3860
02:48:42,569 --> 02:48:46,920
they've got no edibles they got nothing

3861
02:48:44,069 --> 02:48:49,139
she's to the point where even the q-tips

3862
02:48:46,920 --> 02:48:51,479
that I clean out just the little

3863
02:48:49,139 --> 02:48:53,909
residual on the corpse and I put those

3864
02:48:51,479 --> 02:48:59,699
down she's been taking them out of the

3865
02:48:53,909 --> 02:49:03,780
ashtray and has a little hash - and it's

3866
02:48:59,700 --> 02:49:05,970
like dude think about it you're like

3867
02:49:03,780 --> 02:49:10,409
prohibition for your dog but it didn't

3868
02:49:05,969 --> 02:49:14,520
work on us and it won't work on her and

3869
02:49:10,409 --> 02:49:21,149
her animals so the dog do dogs have an

3870
02:49:14,521 --> 02:49:29,730
endocannabinoid yes yes everything does

3871
02:49:21,149 --> 02:49:31,619
not insects don't receptors for the

3872
02:49:29,729 --> 02:49:33,899
terpenes though how's that how do you

3873
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:36,420
explain that well that may be true but

3874
02:49:33,899 --> 02:49:40,590
they don't have cannabinoid receptors

3875
02:49:36,420 --> 02:49:42,200
cb1 and cb2 that's correct

3876
02:49:40,590 --> 02:49:45,690
aaaghh that is a pretty reliable

3877
02:49:42,200 --> 02:49:48,540
indicator for me of when I have a plant

3878
02:49:45,690 --> 02:49:51,630
in the garden that's high in CBD and has

3879
02:49:48,540 --> 02:49:53,430
certainly no THC he will walk with me in

3880
02:49:51,629 --> 02:49:55,349
the garden and with great respect

3881
02:49:53,430 --> 02:49:57,479
reaches in and takes off son leads

3882
02:49:55,350 --> 02:50:02,010
usually kids three or four at a time and

3883
02:49:57,479 --> 02:50:03,569
every year he's been accurate that it

3884
02:50:02,010 --> 02:50:05,130
turns out to be a plant that's high in

3885
02:50:03,569 --> 02:50:08,699
CBD low in tea

3886
02:50:05,129 --> 02:50:10,979
that's pretty much I think into specific

3887
02:50:08,700 --> 02:50:13,561
medicines this pertains to a way to

3888
02:50:10,979 --> 02:50:15,569
brought up as far as which environments

3889
02:50:13,560 --> 02:50:16,469
do the plants express themselves most

3890
02:50:15,569 --> 02:50:19,139
beneficial is

3891
02:50:16,469 --> 02:50:21,238
far as not being success susceptible to

3892
02:50:19,139 --> 02:50:24,090
pests and other things we're also gonna

3893
02:50:21,238 --> 02:50:25,680
find that they reach their fullest

3894
02:50:24,090 --> 02:50:27,210
potential and certain terpene profiles

3895
02:50:25,680 --> 02:50:28,979
in different environments differently

3896
02:50:27,209 --> 02:50:30,659
because of what Tony mentioned is they

3897
02:50:28,978 --> 02:50:33,269
react for the environment that they're

3898
02:50:30,659 --> 02:50:34,859
in and that's what I'm really excited

3899
02:50:33,270 --> 02:50:38,040
with some of these companies are doing

3900
02:50:34,859 --> 02:50:39,899
as far as genetically mapping and doing

3901
02:50:38,040 --> 02:50:41,430
scientific surveys of cultivators

3902
02:50:39,898 --> 02:50:43,709
building the same strains in different

3903
02:50:41,430 --> 02:50:45,779
geographic environments because in the

3904
02:50:43,709 --> 02:50:47,699
next you know five years we're gonna be

3905
02:50:45,779 --> 02:50:49,310
it's so much further ahead as far as

3906
02:50:47,700 --> 02:50:51,149
understanding some of those

3907
02:50:49,309 --> 02:50:54,209
manifestations of plants in different

3908
02:50:51,148 --> 02:50:56,849
geographical areas and as a medicine

3909
02:50:54,209 --> 02:51:00,559
maker in someone who's have a huge

3910
02:50:56,850 --> 02:51:03,210
interest in that how those plants

3911
02:51:00,559 --> 02:51:05,579
interpret their environment and how that

3912
02:51:03,209 --> 02:51:07,769
changes the terpene profiles and the

3913
02:51:05,579 --> 02:51:11,789
levels of certain terpenes is very very

3914
02:51:07,770 --> 02:51:15,149
interesting so I decided mostly it just

3915
02:51:11,790 --> 02:51:17,760
modifies the profile it doesn't create

3916
02:51:15,148 --> 02:51:19,858
new terpenes because right the boughs

3917
02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:22,200
are determined by having the terpene

3918
02:51:19,859 --> 02:51:24,960
synthase for that particular terpene

3919
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:28,829
right right at those different levels of

3920
02:51:24,959 --> 02:51:31,709
those terpenes that's absolutely true

3921
02:51:28,829 --> 02:51:36,029
because I I grew an identical clone for

3922
02:51:31,709 --> 02:51:39,709
25 years it was grown under 100 thousand

3923
02:51:36,029 --> 02:51:45,439
different and we did GC analyzed it and

3924
02:51:39,709 --> 02:51:47,429
the profile would would alter slightly

3925
02:51:45,439 --> 02:51:50,130
depending on the environmental

3926
02:51:47,430 --> 02:51:53,579
conditions they were the most favorable

3927
02:51:50,129 --> 02:51:56,879
or the least favorable well here's

3928
02:51:53,579 --> 02:52:02,279
here's my guess I'm the whole thing the

3929
02:51:56,879 --> 02:52:05,129
first thing I share was a new study that

3930
02:52:02,279 --> 02:52:06,450
came out with the Institute of ecology

3931
02:52:05,129 --> 02:52:09,659
and Netherlands

3932
02:52:06,450 --> 02:52:11,790
so my first hash search I talked to you

3933
02:52:09,659 --> 02:52:13,529
guys about this was they was they came

3934
02:52:11,790 --> 02:52:16,800
out saying that the most widely spoken

3935
02:52:13,529 --> 02:52:19,380
language on the planet is terpene so

3936
02:52:16,799 --> 02:52:21,449
what's happening is and and a couple of

3937
02:52:19,379 --> 02:52:23,159
you have mentioned this is that these

3938
02:52:21,450 --> 02:52:24,750
terpenes are actually you know a

3939
02:52:23,159 --> 02:52:27,029
hydrocarbon lighter than air so they're

3940
02:52:24,750 --> 02:52:29,609
coming into our our nasal passages and

3941
02:52:27,029 --> 02:52:30,250
so our biology is actually communicating

3942
02:52:29,609 --> 02:52:32,370
with that

3943
02:52:30,250 --> 02:52:34,899
biology so there's a whole nother

3944
02:52:32,370 --> 02:52:38,470
physics dynamic happening with our bio

3945
02:52:34,899 --> 02:52:40,750
communication with the plants as well as

3946
02:52:38,469 --> 02:52:43,119
the energetic one so when we're talking

3947
02:52:40,750 --> 02:52:45,159
about the Burpee profile taking

3948
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:47,920
variations of them actually do it's

3949
02:52:45,159 --> 02:52:50,979
pretty comprehensive alien language

3950
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:53,440
shape everything here fits in with

3951
02:52:50,979 --> 02:52:54,909
everything else and so when you take a

3952
02:52:53,440 --> 02:52:56,860
look at the fact that we've got into

3953
02:52:54,909 --> 02:52:59,709
cannabinoid systems everything else does

3954
02:52:56,860 --> 02:53:01,989
- must be that when the Syrians are the

3955
02:52:59,709 --> 02:53:04,679
dog star people left us off here they

3956
02:53:01,989 --> 02:53:07,030
left us with a pot plant and said look

3957
02:53:04,680 --> 02:53:09,280
we're gonna call this a mono machine

3958
02:53:07,030 --> 02:53:17,739
it's actually mono wanna but this will

3959
02:53:09,280 --> 02:53:21,010
sustain you until you get going so I got

3960
02:53:17,739 --> 02:53:22,510
some beans just good as any other theory

3961
02:53:21,010 --> 02:53:24,250
hey you spend enough time behind a

3962
02:53:22,510 --> 02:53:36,309
mosquito truck anything will make sense

3963
02:53:24,250 --> 02:53:42,370
after well what a great quote if you

3964
02:53:36,309 --> 02:53:46,319
spend enough time my god Tony's just

3965
02:53:42,370 --> 02:53:46,320
shaking his head I woke up for this

3966
02:53:49,409 --> 02:53:54,489
super complex endogenous cannabinoids

3967
02:53:51,729 --> 02:53:55,600
system and you know with some of the

3968
02:53:54,489 --> 02:53:57,520
understandings that you know so many

3969
02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:59,380
types of disease and disorder might be

3970
02:53:57,520 --> 02:54:02,200
rooted in some type of endocannabinoid

3971
02:53:59,379 --> 02:54:03,489
deficiency syndrome you know and you

3972
02:54:02,200 --> 02:54:05,829
know and then and then kind of you know

3973
02:54:03,489 --> 02:54:07,899
some of those new work with kind of the

3974
02:54:05,829 --> 02:54:09,190
whole idea of cannibal mimetics and you

3975
02:54:07,899 --> 02:54:10,840
know other types of plants beyond

3976
02:54:09,190 --> 02:54:12,790
cannabis that you know have

3977
02:54:10,840 --> 02:54:14,440
endocannabinoids system stimulating

3978
02:54:12,790 --> 02:54:15,910
effects you know it's it's really

3979
02:54:14,440 --> 02:54:17,620
interesting this whole kind of braving

3980
02:54:15,909 --> 02:54:20,409
the world of like almost like compounds

3981
02:54:17,620 --> 02:54:23,530
pharmacy of these you know blending of

3982
02:54:20,409 --> 02:54:25,569
you know cannabinoid terpenes from the

3983
02:54:23,530 --> 02:54:27,790
cannabis plant with potentially other

3984
02:54:25,569 --> 02:54:29,289
types of plants like echinacea and you

3985
02:54:27,790 --> 02:54:30,790
know kind of agonda and you know

3986
02:54:29,290 --> 02:54:31,780
different things like probiotics because

3987
02:54:30,790 --> 02:54:33,220
you know they have these different up

3988
02:54:31,780 --> 02:54:34,390
regulating or different you know and

3989
02:54:33,219 --> 02:54:36,519
okinawa system you're stimulating

3990
02:54:34,389 --> 02:54:38,709
aspects but you know one interesting one

3991
02:54:36,520 --> 02:54:40,720
you know and have you guys hurt you if

3992
02:54:38,709 --> 02:54:44,020
you know what copal is copal it's this

3993
02:54:40,719 --> 02:54:45,460
like smudge that's a sap from a tree

3994
02:54:44,021 --> 02:54:46,480
Summit's it's a smudge that's very

3995
02:54:45,460 --> 02:54:49,989
commonly burned in like sacred

3996
02:54:46,479 --> 02:54:52,630
ceremonies so my incense yeah it's

3997
02:54:49,989 --> 02:54:54,851
exactly these incredibly distinct smell

3998
02:54:52,630 --> 02:54:56,680
but you know there's a there's a mana

3999
02:54:54,851 --> 02:55:00,221
there's a certain like diterpene or

4000
02:54:56,681 --> 02:55:02,711
something in copal which binds to CD one

4001
02:55:00,220 --> 02:55:05,380
which is what happens to TAC team tapes

4002
02:55:02,710 --> 02:55:07,449
I partial CB one cb2 receptor agonist

4003
02:55:05,380 --> 02:55:09,279
you know and so see you know binding to

4004
02:55:07,450 --> 02:55:11,440
CB one is what helps to give the

4005
02:55:09,280 --> 02:55:12,790
psychoactive feeling in effects you know

4006
02:55:11,440 --> 02:55:15,341
then modulated slightly by the different

4007
02:55:12,790 --> 02:55:17,891
terpenes but you know I wonder what you

4008
02:55:15,341 --> 02:55:19,601
know you know to take some amount of

4009
02:55:17,890 --> 02:55:21,609
like this copal tripping that binds the

4010
02:55:19,601 --> 02:55:23,200
CB one as well you know and adding that

4011
02:55:21,610 --> 02:55:25,421
into some type of preparation is that

4012
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:27,641
gonna slightly create new effects

4013
02:55:25,421 --> 02:55:30,101
because this is too similar you know and

4014
02:55:27,640 --> 02:55:32,069
this bc you have to be a little bit

4015
02:55:30,101 --> 02:55:36,159
careful when you're when you're

4016
02:55:32,069 --> 02:55:38,501
vaporizing or combusting new terpenes

4017
02:55:36,159 --> 02:55:40,751
that are not found in cannabis with a

4018
02:55:38,501 --> 02:55:42,700
cannabis all the terpenes that are there

4019
02:55:40,751 --> 02:55:44,771
we have hundreds and hundreds of years

4020
02:55:42,700 --> 02:55:46,961
of experience right you know that they

4021
02:55:44,771 --> 02:55:49,511
don't cause major problems when you

4022
02:55:46,960 --> 02:55:52,840
start breathing in huge amounts of copal

4023
02:55:49,511 --> 02:55:55,001
with THC it may or may not cause

4024
02:55:52,841 --> 02:55:57,360
problems although copal with since it's

4025
02:55:55,001 --> 02:56:00,610
used in religious ceremonies I doubt it

4026
02:55:57,360 --> 02:56:03,190
right and it's so common like I inhaled

4027
02:56:00,610 --> 02:56:04,961
or just yeah whatever but interesting

4028
02:56:03,190 --> 02:56:06,610
well you know I mean we're running that

4029
02:56:04,960 --> 02:56:08,590
time here but that could be a whole show

4030
02:56:06,610 --> 02:56:10,751
about you know the endo family system is

4031
02:56:08,591 --> 02:56:13,479
unlocking what we've seen in other

4032
02:56:10,751 --> 02:56:16,450
aspects of natural healing anecdotally

4033
02:56:13,479 --> 02:56:18,220
it's it's really pointing to how those

4034
02:56:16,450 --> 02:56:20,530
things are interacting with the body and

4035
02:56:18,220 --> 02:56:23,680
if anyone it hasn't read the paper that

4036
02:56:20,530 --> 02:56:25,631
was mentioned here this dr. Russo's new

4037
02:56:23,681 --> 02:56:27,399
work on cannabinoids outside of cannabis

4038
02:56:25,630 --> 02:56:29,140
it's really interesting and you just see

4039
02:56:27,399 --> 02:56:31,359
all these have this yeah you just see

4040
02:56:29,140 --> 02:56:33,100
this some trail of things that we've

4041
02:56:31,360 --> 02:56:34,721
known forever kava root is another one

4042
02:56:33,101 --> 02:56:36,971
that he does a big piece on in there and

4043
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:38,619
in how they're building things to

4044
02:56:36,970 --> 02:56:40,841
interact with the cannabinoid system but

4045
02:56:38,620 --> 02:56:42,040
we see you know essential oil therapies

4046
02:56:40,841 --> 02:56:43,601
you know you know there's natural

4047
02:56:42,040 --> 02:56:45,881
therapies that we didn't understand kind

4048
02:56:43,601 --> 02:56:47,290
of why we saw the the benefits they did

4049
02:56:45,880 --> 02:56:49,779
but then you start to look at what is in

4050
02:56:47,290 --> 02:56:51,251
lavender and Layla will we see how

4051
02:56:49,780 --> 02:56:53,051
they're interacting with receptors in

4052
02:56:51,251 --> 02:56:54,761
the body you started to understand I

4053
02:56:53,050 --> 02:56:57,039
think I think this endocannabinoid

4054
02:56:54,761 --> 02:56:57,460
system is going to unlock you know far

4055
02:56:57,040 --> 02:56:59,110
more

4056
02:56:57,459 --> 02:57:00,849
than just how cannabis interacts with

4057
02:56:59,110 --> 02:57:03,210
the body it really is the greatest

4058
02:57:00,850 --> 02:57:05,440
discovery in medical science on

4059
02:57:03,209 --> 02:57:08,289
generations and it's just yet funny how

4060
02:57:05,440 --> 02:57:10,239
under under promoted it still is to this

4061
02:57:08,290 --> 02:57:11,590
day outside the circle we're putting you

4062
02:57:10,239 --> 02:57:13,059
know it's only if you're interested in

4063
02:57:11,590 --> 02:57:15,040
are you you know what you pay attention

4064
02:57:13,059 --> 02:57:17,170
to you become conscious of now we're

4065
02:57:15,040 --> 02:57:18,610
like so geek out on it and and nobody

4066
02:57:17,170 --> 02:57:20,020
else is you know so that's why we're the

4067
02:57:18,610 --> 02:57:22,569
leaders of like bringing so much this

4068
02:57:20,020 --> 02:57:24,250
information to today you know but but

4069
02:57:22,569 --> 02:57:25,959
you know that also brings me to the Jean

4070
02:57:24,250 --> 02:57:27,700
McPartland paper care and feeding of the

4071
02:57:25,959 --> 02:57:29,228
endocannabinoids system because when you

4072
02:57:27,700 --> 02:57:31,900
start to understand okay no mysticism is

4073
02:57:29,228 --> 02:57:34,239
like master regulator system that helps

4074
02:57:31,899 --> 02:57:36,520
to bring about homeostasis among all our

4075
02:57:34,239 --> 02:57:39,149
systems in our body you know and it's

4076
02:57:36,520 --> 02:57:41,380
it's so crazy how somehow intuitively

4077
02:57:39,149 --> 02:57:43,510
stoners and hippies had it right all

4078
02:57:41,379 --> 02:57:45,969
along you know because in the paper it

4079
02:57:43,510 --> 02:57:48,880
shows like how certain you know exercise

4080
02:57:45,969 --> 02:57:51,879
you know things do you know yoga and

4081
02:57:48,879 --> 02:57:53,920
like you know aerobic activity up

4082
02:57:51,879 --> 02:57:55,329
regulate your cb1 and cb2 receptor stuff

4083
02:57:53,920 --> 02:57:57,250
what have you you know it's like through

4084
02:57:55,329 --> 02:57:58,510
kind of doing things like traditional

4085
02:57:57,250 --> 02:57:59,770
Chinese medicine complementary

4086
02:57:58,510 --> 02:58:01,300
alternative medicine things like

4087
02:57:59,770 --> 02:58:02,979
acupuncture there's all this research

4088
02:58:01,299 --> 02:58:04,989
coming about how the endocannabinoids

4089
02:58:02,978 --> 02:58:06,909
system is being stimulated in all these

4090
02:58:04,989 --> 02:58:09,069
ways from it you know and like eating

4091
02:58:06,909 --> 02:58:10,780
probiotics and drinking like kombucha

4092
02:58:09,069 --> 02:58:12,520
and sauerkraut juice you know it's like

4093
02:58:10,780 --> 02:58:14,159
it's really funny how it all kind of

4094
02:58:12,520 --> 02:58:16,329
comes back to show that you know these

4095
02:58:14,159 --> 02:58:19,180
alternative ways are actually kind of

4096
02:58:16,329 --> 02:58:22,930
supportive of this like you know balance

4097
02:58:19,180 --> 02:58:25,630
in our life I would be surprised I would

4098
02:58:22,930 --> 02:58:28,420
be surprised if there's not a bell curve

4099
02:58:25,629 --> 02:58:31,089
when it comes to endocannabinoid

4100
02:58:28,420 --> 02:58:33,670
deficiency meaning that the other side

4101
02:58:31,090 --> 02:58:35,889
of the bell curve is over the

4102
02:58:33,670 --> 02:58:39,659
stimulation of the endocannabinoid

4103
02:58:35,889 --> 02:58:42,389
system and positive from having too much

4104
02:58:39,659 --> 02:58:46,030
anand amide or some of the other

4105
02:58:42,389 --> 02:58:48,369
endocannabinoid natural endocannabinoids

4106
02:58:46,030 --> 02:58:51,880
I wouldn't be surprised if there's

4107
02:58:48,370 --> 02:58:53,770
disorders connected with the too much

4108
02:58:51,879 --> 02:58:55,839
right well you know and and that's I

4109
02:58:53,770 --> 02:59:00,280
mean too much fog you know fog which is

4110
02:58:55,840 --> 02:59:02,559
fatty acid one of the enzymes that

4111
02:59:00,280 --> 02:59:05,970
breaks down an and amide and you know I

4112
02:59:02,559 --> 02:59:08,949
was ma GL is what breaks down to AG but

4113
02:59:05,969 --> 02:59:11,079
too far they're finding you know in you

4114
02:59:08,950 --> 02:59:13,930
know elevated levels in the gut

4115
02:59:11,079 --> 02:59:15,398
of patients that have certain irritable

4116
02:59:13,930 --> 02:59:17,200
bowel and gastrointestinal tract

4117
02:59:15,398 --> 02:59:20,019
disorder conditions like Crohn's ideas

4118
02:59:17,200 --> 02:59:20,920
colitis what have you and you know sort

4119
02:59:20,020 --> 02:59:23,500
of seems like there's some type of

4120
02:59:20,920 --> 02:59:27,460
dysbiosis of your new family system in

4121
02:59:23,500 --> 02:59:29,590
the final also with those same patients

4122
02:59:27,459 --> 02:59:32,339
they're finding out that what are the

4123
02:59:29,590 --> 02:59:36,398
most effective therapies is hypnosis

4124
02:59:32,340 --> 02:59:39,939
which to me implies that they are

4125
02:59:36,398 --> 02:59:42,340
creating the stress internally that is

4126
02:59:39,939 --> 02:59:45,280
causing the disorder rather than

4127
02:59:42,340 --> 02:59:46,359
straight biochemically based that's

4128
02:59:45,280 --> 02:59:49,450
awesome because that kind of that also

4129
02:59:46,359 --> 02:59:51,939
gonna then gets into the that new Martin

4130
02:59:49,450 --> 02:59:53,950
Lee and Adrienne devoutly paper that

4131
02:59:51,939 --> 02:59:56,409
they wrote on its they call it they put

4132
02:59:53,950 --> 02:59:58,780
the project CV it's called mind over

4133
02:59:56,409 --> 03:00:00,818
matter over minds and it's it's amazing

4134
02:59:58,780 --> 03:00:02,829
because it's all about you know these

4135
03:00:00,818 --> 03:00:05,739
different mechanisms and actions of how

4136
03:00:02,829 --> 03:00:08,620
the placebo effect and the nocebo

4137
03:00:05,739 --> 03:00:10,180
effects or the belief that's a medicine

4138
03:00:08,620 --> 03:00:11,890
or treatment is going to work or a

4139
03:00:10,180 --> 03:00:14,530
belief that most and is not going to

4140
03:00:11,889 --> 03:00:16,449
work in so many ways is also regulated

4141
03:00:14,530 --> 03:00:22,630
specifically by an OU cannabinoid system

4142
03:00:16,450 --> 03:00:29,470
function and tone excited absolutely I

4143
03:00:22,629 --> 03:00:32,349
know the topic for the next show the

4144
03:00:29,469 --> 03:00:35,648
endocannabinoid system is what changed

4145
03:00:32,350 --> 03:00:38,439
cannabis science then after that appears

4146
03:00:35,648 --> 03:00:40,779
later they discovered Ananda mine but it

4147
03:00:38,439 --> 03:00:44,859
was the endocannabinoid discovery I

4148
03:00:40,780 --> 03:00:46,930
think in 88 that changed it it was

4149
03:00:44,859 --> 03:00:52,890
announced that the I CRS meeting I

4150
03:00:46,930 --> 03:00:52,889
attended yes things start to miss Yulan

4151
03:00:58,200 --> 03:01:04,390
hmm hey before I go I want to thank

4152
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:06,010
everybody in estrogen the last time I

4153
03:01:04,389 --> 03:01:07,420
was on here people we were talking about

4154
03:01:06,010 --> 03:01:10,120
the colliders network when people

4155
03:01:07,420 --> 03:01:11,409
started throwing donations in there and

4156
03:01:10,120 --> 03:01:13,569
I just want to take a second to thank

4157
03:01:11,409 --> 03:01:14,409
everybody who's for watching who did

4158
03:01:13,568 --> 03:01:17,739
that

4159
03:01:14,409 --> 03:01:20,318
I sent what I think I sent the receipts

4160
03:01:17,739 --> 03:01:23,049
to mark yes sir but what we ended up

4161
03:01:20,318 --> 03:01:24,270
getting but we were able to get you know

4162
03:01:23,049 --> 03:01:25,920
the childproof

4163
03:01:24,271 --> 03:01:27,510
proof lids we needed a bunch of models

4164
03:01:25,920 --> 03:01:31,021
for kids a lot of just the logistic

4165
03:01:27,510 --> 03:01:32,760
things the jars and we were able to get

4166
03:01:31,021 --> 03:01:35,250
what we needed for most of the year

4167
03:01:32,760 --> 03:01:37,351
because of the help from the past church

4168
03:01:35,250 --> 03:01:39,750
community that didn't have to come out

4169
03:01:37,351 --> 03:01:41,221
of my family's pocket and our volunteers

4170
03:01:39,750 --> 03:01:43,290
where we normally try to chip in and get

4171
03:01:41,220 --> 03:01:45,539
these out to the kids so I thought to

4172
03:01:43,290 --> 03:01:47,250
take a second to thank you guys so much

4173
03:01:45,540 --> 03:01:50,400
let you know how much of an impact that

4174
03:01:47,250 --> 03:01:52,500
had literally on the lives of the kids

4175
03:01:50,399 --> 03:01:54,090
that were working with so much love to

4176
03:01:52,500 --> 03:01:56,479
you guys out there it's very much

4177
03:01:54,090 --> 03:01:58,140
appreciated

4178
03:01:56,479 --> 03:02:00,869
much love us

4179
03:01:58,140 --> 03:02:03,181
yeah awesome man that was very nice of

4180
03:02:00,870 --> 03:02:06,540
everyone - that was almost 700 bucks

4181
03:02:03,181 --> 03:02:10,800
that everyone can't down and I made sure

4182
03:02:06,540 --> 03:02:12,271
that I got it all - Forrest and I trust

4183
03:02:10,799 --> 03:02:14,310
a hundred percent that he's doing the

4184
03:02:12,271 --> 03:02:15,811
good work with it so it's it was a nice

4185
03:02:14,310 --> 03:02:18,510
episode to be able to make that happen

4186
03:02:15,810 --> 03:02:21,329
for sure yeah that helps

4187
03:02:18,510 --> 03:02:21,960
I think the Lebanese were decades ahead

4188
03:02:21,329 --> 03:02:24,539
of us

4189
03:02:21,959 --> 03:02:28,439
you saw that bag I had of kiddie hash

4190
03:02:24,540 --> 03:02:30,271
that was for people like you right it

4191
03:02:28,440 --> 03:02:32,010
was the it was the children hash it's

4192
03:02:30,271 --> 03:02:34,351
the hash for the children Sam's always

4193
03:02:32,010 --> 03:02:36,149
got to save it the one quote they'll

4194
03:02:34,351 --> 03:02:38,880
take from there was a guy on there

4195
03:02:36,149 --> 03:02:40,619
promoting hash first our prime minister

4196
03:02:38,879 --> 03:02:43,319
is constantly trying to protect the

4197
03:02:40,620 --> 03:02:45,950
children from cannabis so I'm not quite

4198
03:02:43,319 --> 03:02:49,770
sure if he understands exactly how safe

4199
03:02:45,950 --> 03:02:53,010
cannabis is but they do one day maybe

4200
03:02:49,771 --> 03:02:54,630
one day more work to be done well thanks

4201
03:02:53,010 --> 03:02:56,250
again for us for what you do and what

4202
03:02:54,629 --> 03:02:58,379
you're doing you know if you can see it

4203
03:02:56,250 --> 03:03:00,780
and we understood and you know those

4204
03:02:58,379 --> 03:03:03,810
pictures rang and struck a lot of souls

4205
03:03:00,780 --> 03:03:06,659
and thank you for just doing what you do

4206
03:03:03,810 --> 03:03:09,060
and keep at it well it's it's really

4207
03:03:06,659 --> 03:03:11,069
it's it's touching - and touching hearts

4208
03:03:09,060 --> 03:03:13,440
everywhere and I want to come on here

4209
03:03:11,069 --> 03:03:15,690
maybe in a few weeks or where the time

4210
03:03:13,440 --> 03:03:18,060
is tried to talk about huge strides

4211
03:03:15,690 --> 03:03:19,471
we've had here in California and huge

4212
03:03:18,060 --> 03:03:21,629
progress they've had with the state

4213
03:03:19,470 --> 03:03:24,600
legislature legislature that it's gonna

4214
03:03:21,629 --> 03:03:27,180
be changing the laws in California to

4215
03:03:24,601 --> 03:03:29,040
help make what we're doing and it helped

4216
03:03:27,181 --> 03:03:31,319
kind of shift how the cannabis industry

4217
03:03:29,040 --> 03:03:33,271
looks at the charity and opportunities

4218
03:03:31,319 --> 03:03:35,431
businesses have to participate in it so

4219
03:03:33,271 --> 03:03:38,010
we're making huge strides I couldn't do

4220
03:03:35,431 --> 03:03:39,689
it without everybody supports and

4221
03:03:38,010 --> 03:03:41,369
what's really exciting to say I think

4222
03:03:39,689 --> 03:03:43,710
we're gonna start something out of these

4223
03:03:41,369 --> 03:03:46,498
this effort here that hasn't been done

4224
03:03:43,709 --> 03:03:49,049
that once we get to laws written

4225
03:03:46,498 --> 03:03:51,629
appropriately can be adopted nationwide

4226
03:03:49,049 --> 03:03:53,309
and hopefully be a model internationally

4227
03:03:51,629 --> 03:03:56,639
for people to pick up and take on and

4228
03:03:53,309 --> 03:03:58,948
just allow this industry to do what it

4229
03:03:56,639 --> 03:04:01,738
has the potential to do which is thrive

4230
03:03:58,949 --> 03:04:04,248
and more importantly create and spread

4231
03:04:01,738 --> 03:04:06,328
healing throughout the world and just

4232
03:04:04,248 --> 03:04:07,828
we're gonna keep working working at a

4233
03:04:06,328 --> 03:04:10,439
tree keep chipping away at it but yeah I

4234
03:04:07,828 --> 03:04:11,969
want to come on here and when when that

4235
03:04:10,439 --> 03:04:13,800
gets closer to where we can talk about

4236
03:04:11,969 --> 03:04:14,908
it publicly and share with everybody

4237
03:04:13,799 --> 03:04:19,288
what we're doing it's just really

4238
03:04:14,908 --> 03:04:21,600
excited and I'll work on a new joke I'm

4239
03:04:19,289 --> 03:04:24,329
trying to figure out a good one with

4240
03:04:21,600 --> 03:04:26,130
your name forests oh man there's a line

4241
03:04:24,328 --> 03:04:32,908
the trick is train comes in original

4242
03:04:26,129 --> 03:04:36,328
wood you can't see the forest for all

4243
03:04:32,908 --> 03:04:37,828
the trees yeah I've heard mole but yeah

4244
03:04:36,328 --> 03:04:39,988
you keep working on I'll let you know

4245
03:04:37,828 --> 03:04:41,369
well really

4246
03:04:39,988 --> 03:04:43,978
you've had two lumber through many of

4247
03:04:41,369 --> 03:04:47,039
them as what you said builds character

4248
03:04:43,978 --> 03:04:49,618
those character yeah all right guess I

4249
03:04:47,039 --> 03:04:51,359
gotta take off run Forrest run

4250
03:04:49,619 --> 03:04:53,369
yes you're not even close to really I

4251
03:04:51,359 --> 03:04:54,988
still get that my favorite thing to do

4252
03:04:53,369 --> 03:04:57,149
though is when I get that from people on

4253
03:04:54,988 --> 03:04:58,738
the bonus just pretend like I've never

4254
03:04:57,148 --> 03:05:00,358
heard of it you know like what is that

4255
03:04:58,738 --> 03:05:02,189
from it's this movie you haven't heard

4256
03:05:00,359 --> 03:05:04,470
of it yeah what the hell are you talking

4257
03:05:02,189 --> 03:05:05,939
about not only do they feel original but

4258
03:05:04,469 --> 03:05:12,209
then they're blown away that I've never

4259
03:05:05,939 --> 03:05:17,578
heard of this movie but you have to say

4260
03:05:12,209 --> 03:05:24,868
to them as lap is back the chocolate how

4261
03:05:17,578 --> 03:05:28,920
about for rest of us that's good I'll

4262
03:05:24,869 --> 03:05:31,199
give it a six out of ten it's it's out

4263
03:05:28,920 --> 03:05:33,238
there with about the standard quality of

4264
03:05:31,199 --> 03:05:36,180
cannabis that I seem to see these days

4265
03:05:33,238 --> 03:05:39,988
we need to bump that six up to a ten

4266
03:05:36,180 --> 03:05:42,119
yeah yeah we're gonna you know just put

4267
03:05:39,988 --> 03:05:43,288
a little effort into it yeah well you

4268
03:05:42,119 --> 03:05:45,359
know what it's not even a little effort

4269
03:05:43,289 --> 03:05:47,789
because I'm looking now and realizing

4270
03:05:45,359 --> 03:05:49,670
that it's like expertise on all levels

4271
03:05:47,789 --> 03:05:51,520
it's like deciding to do a YouTube show

4272
03:05:49,670 --> 03:05:52,930
because you have a little bit of

4273
03:05:51,520 --> 03:05:54,069
content and you're like oh I'm gonna do

4274
03:05:52,930 --> 03:05:56,050
a YouTube channel and all of a sudden

4275
03:05:54,068 --> 03:05:58,059
you realize you have to start learning

4276
03:05:56,049 --> 03:06:00,099
about sound and microphones and you have

4277
03:05:58,059 --> 03:06:01,930
to learn about editing and transitions

4278
03:06:00,100 --> 03:06:03,300
you have to learn about all this other

4279
03:06:01,930 --> 03:06:05,710
[ __ ] that you didn't even know existed

4280
03:06:03,299 --> 03:06:08,198
that's what I love about hashed Church

4281
03:06:05,709 --> 03:06:10,448
that people are specializing in their in

4282
03:06:08,199 --> 03:06:12,489
their spaces and when we can all get

4283
03:06:10,449 --> 03:06:15,789
together it really puts a beautiful

4284
03:06:12,488 --> 03:06:18,609
picture from you know from seed to resin

4285
03:06:15,789 --> 03:06:20,800
head and even beyond to the testing and

4286
03:06:18,609 --> 03:06:24,520
the consuming which we all love to do

4287
03:06:20,799 --> 03:06:36,299
it's just it's awesome it's it's a great

4288
03:06:24,520 --> 03:06:39,300
thing Tony's bounced all right guys

4289
03:06:36,299 --> 03:06:42,099
thanks so much I will talk to you soon

4290
03:06:39,299 --> 03:06:42,938
thanks for just sayin Forrest thanks for

4291
03:06:42,100 --> 03:06:48,309
words be safe out there

4292
03:06:42,939 --> 03:06:50,738
right on guys yeah that's smart of

4293
03:06:48,309 --> 03:06:53,049
sub-cooled some cool said [ __ ] that and

4294
03:06:50,738 --> 03:06:56,709
hired a sound man and an engineering guy

4295
03:06:53,049 --> 03:07:00,368
well it's it's true that's awesome that

4296
03:06:56,709 --> 03:07:02,618
sub did that I just unfortunately did

4297
03:07:00,369 --> 03:07:04,630
not do that although one time when I

4298
03:07:02,619 --> 03:07:08,130
filmed with Tony he brought a sound guy

4299
03:07:04,629 --> 03:07:08,129
that was pretty awesome

4300
03:07:08,219 --> 03:07:17,198
speaking of sound I do also think that

4301
03:07:11,818 --> 03:07:21,430
conversation ultrasonic vibration and

4302
03:07:17,199 --> 03:07:23,109
frequency for pest control is isn't been

4303
03:07:21,430 --> 03:07:28,119
explored all the way yet on a massive

4304
03:07:23,109 --> 03:07:29,738
level and also vibration in music itself

4305
03:07:28,119 --> 03:07:32,770
and how that might enter how that

4306
03:07:29,738 --> 03:07:35,859
impacts our emotional spiritual level

4307
03:07:32,770 --> 03:07:37,840
that translates through how our

4308
03:07:35,859 --> 03:07:40,470
endocannabinoid system works in itself

4309
03:07:37,840 --> 03:07:42,880
so I think music unlocks quite a few

4310
03:07:40,469 --> 03:07:46,648
different things in humans and if you

4311
03:07:42,879 --> 03:07:50,559
study the life of plants and the

4312
03:07:46,648 --> 03:07:53,590
emotional projection that you can put in

4313
03:07:50,559 --> 03:07:56,350
a plant what I mean by that is you know

4314
03:07:53,590 --> 03:07:58,689
the vibe of if you had two of the same

4315
03:07:56,350 --> 03:08:00,789
plants growing in two different lab

4316
03:07:58,689 --> 03:08:03,818
controlled environments and in one

4317
03:08:00,789 --> 03:08:05,320
environment you came in with positive

4318
03:08:03,818 --> 03:08:08,289
vibes music and

4319
03:08:05,319 --> 03:08:10,409
to the plant in a reassuring way and you

4320
03:08:08,290 --> 03:08:11,920
know you're beautiful every day and I

4321
03:08:10,409 --> 03:08:13,869
appreciate you

4322
03:08:11,920 --> 03:08:16,360
there's actually science behind that

4323
03:08:13,870 --> 03:08:19,000
versus somebody coming in and screaming

4324
03:08:16,360 --> 03:08:21,810
at the plant cursing at the plant saying

4325
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:23,920
you know saying I hate you and

4326
03:08:21,809 --> 03:08:25,629
projecting that on to the plant they

4327
03:08:23,920 --> 03:08:31,540
they feel it and they actually respond

4328
03:08:25,629 --> 03:08:34,719
and I do think Johnny yes I just read

4329
03:08:31,540 --> 03:08:38,350
last night where ultrasonic pest

4330
03:08:34,719 --> 03:08:40,510
repellers seem to be through research

4331
03:08:38,350 --> 03:08:44,649
right now stressing plants out big time

4332
03:08:40,510 --> 03:08:48,040
when you have them on mmm okay what

4333
03:08:44,649 --> 03:08:53,649
about around the property though in any

4334
03:08:48,040 --> 03:08:56,260
strategic gridlock I don't know I I just

4335
03:08:53,649 --> 03:08:58,389
read work they did some research and it

4336
03:08:56,260 --> 03:09:01,630
looks like the plants were stressed by

4337
03:08:58,389 --> 03:09:04,090
the constant non-stop on the mix I think

4338
03:09:01,629 --> 03:09:06,219
about it makes sense I think I said it's

4339
03:09:04,090 --> 03:09:11,229
it's in the early stages I mean I think

4340
03:09:06,219 --> 03:09:13,770
that right yeah frequency n roll I think

4341
03:09:11,229 --> 03:09:17,680
frequency and sound though has another

4342
03:09:13,771 --> 03:09:21,909
ability to unlock a lot of things - are

4343
03:09:17,680 --> 03:09:25,600
you familiar with cymatics yeah yeah you

4344
03:09:21,909 --> 03:09:28,329
know a little bit it's a fascinating

4345
03:09:25,600 --> 03:09:30,030
subject but like you know your secret

4346
03:09:28,329 --> 03:09:33,729
life of plants - you know it's like this

4347
03:09:30,030 --> 03:09:37,260
yes without adding I think be respects

4348
03:09:33,729 --> 03:09:37,260
even your prayers and their blessings

4349
03:09:39,450 --> 03:09:49,120
Tony when I was younger like 18 20 years

4350
03:09:44,771 --> 03:09:52,450
old I used to honestly believe that the

4351
03:09:49,120 --> 03:09:55,480
vibes of the grower somehow affected the

4352
03:09:52,450 --> 03:10:00,400
potency or quality of the cannabis I I

4353
03:09:55,479 --> 03:10:03,670
don't believe that anymore but Taggart I

4354
03:10:00,399 --> 03:10:06,659
know a lot of people who do believe it

4355
03:10:03,670 --> 03:10:11,620
and I just have never seen any

4356
03:10:06,659 --> 03:10:14,049
scientific proof of it you know I would

4357
03:10:11,620 --> 03:10:16,180
I would I would say it's what's funny

4358
03:10:14,049 --> 03:10:18,729
I'd you know there's a gentleman in

4359
03:10:16,180 --> 03:10:21,851
Oregon who I would say is a testament to

4360
03:10:18,729 --> 03:10:24,609
working and it's a breeder good friend

4361
03:10:21,851 --> 03:10:27,040
of mine named Greene bode gentleman

4362
03:10:24,610 --> 03:10:29,230
named John and he's in this whole kind

4363
03:10:27,040 --> 03:10:31,891
of idea of like intentional horticulture

4364
03:10:29,229 --> 03:10:34,210
you know and he's a you know kind of

4365
03:10:31,890 --> 03:10:36,279
really deep down is like Buddhist Dharma

4366
03:10:34,210 --> 03:10:38,079
philosophy path and he's right now out

4367
03:10:36,280 --> 03:10:39,909
kind of kickin with the Dalai Lama and

4368
03:10:38,079 --> 03:10:42,899
his crew at this big teaching kind of

4369
03:10:39,909 --> 03:10:44,979
situation and over on the East Coast but

4370
03:10:42,899 --> 03:10:45,609
honestly to this day the best weed I've

4371
03:10:44,979 --> 03:10:48,671
ever seen in my life

4372
03:10:45,610 --> 03:10:51,341
from Oregon and it's like space weed

4373
03:10:48,671 --> 03:10:55,211
and organic has grown really simply but

4374
03:10:51,341 --> 03:10:59,800
you know there's yeah that's an anecdote

4375
03:10:55,210 --> 03:11:03,069
but and me what you mark is the right

4376
03:10:59,800 --> 03:11:06,430
genetics and to grow it the right way

4377
03:11:03,069 --> 03:11:09,671
but I'm not sure whether the bar vibes

4378
03:11:06,431 --> 03:11:11,890
of the farmer has any serious effect

4379
03:11:09,671 --> 03:11:14,530
well when the vibes are conscious and

4380
03:11:11,890 --> 03:11:17,140
raised in high integrity and you're

4381
03:11:14,530 --> 03:11:19,721
focused on much more of what's going on

4382
03:11:17,140 --> 03:11:21,279
like maybe not spraying poisons and

4383
03:11:19,720 --> 03:11:25,239
maybe not doing things that would bring

4384
03:11:21,280 --> 03:11:28,931
harm to others I think from that I agree

4385
03:11:25,239 --> 03:11:31,750
with that about if everything is

4386
03:11:28,931 --> 03:11:34,421
identical except for the mental attitude

4387
03:11:31,750 --> 03:11:37,091
of the grower but everything else is

4388
03:11:34,421 --> 03:11:39,220
totally identical well I hear you

4389
03:11:37,091 --> 03:11:43,870
promote that did that dr. Emoto work

4390
03:11:39,220 --> 03:11:47,319
with yeah messages in the water yes

4391
03:11:43,870 --> 03:11:52,301
that's a real thing for me that's a real

4392
03:11:47,319 --> 03:11:54,880
thing that's one of those it's funny cuz

4393
03:11:52,300 --> 03:11:56,409
you know as you you know the moment you

4394
03:11:54,880 --> 03:11:58,659
start talking about that around more

4395
03:11:56,409 --> 03:12:00,310
scientific reminded people it

4396
03:11:58,659 --> 03:12:02,530
immediately kind of gets thrown out you

4397
03:12:00,310 --> 03:12:04,091
know for hippie dippie [ __ ] but you know

4398
03:12:02,530 --> 03:12:05,771
it's it's it's really interesting

4399
03:12:04,091 --> 03:12:07,899
because you know I think you know

4400
03:12:05,771 --> 03:12:09,700
cannabis is this power wisdom plant you

4401
03:12:07,899 --> 03:12:12,159
know conscious expanding kind of

4402
03:12:09,700 --> 03:12:13,990
paradigm shifting similar to a lot of

4403
03:12:12,159 --> 03:12:15,970
these other plant entheogens have been

4404
03:12:13,989 --> 03:12:18,119
around for thousands of years and you

4405
03:12:15,970 --> 03:12:21,430
know I definitely I don't know

4406
03:12:18,120 --> 03:12:23,891
I don't know if it's romantic like hope

4407
03:12:21,431 --> 03:12:25,091
you know so much my hope for Humanity

4408
03:12:23,890 --> 03:12:27,640
lies within the wisdom of and the

4409
03:12:25,091 --> 03:12:29,021
teachings of these power plants you know

4410
03:12:27,640 --> 03:12:30,699
and shifting our awareness ship your

4411
03:12:29,021 --> 03:12:31,540
consciousness and helping us to live a

4412
03:12:30,700 --> 03:12:34,630
more mindful

4413
03:12:31,540 --> 03:12:36,970
based approach towards life and you know

4414
03:12:34,629 --> 03:12:38,670
being kind so hopefully well obviously

4415
03:12:36,969 --> 03:12:41,289
we're getting there when you think about

4416
03:12:38,670 --> 03:12:43,210
just the fact that how many people I've

4417
03:12:41,290 --> 03:12:47,050
met over the years and the cannabis

4418
03:12:43,209 --> 03:12:48,459
industry are truly like maybe not taking

4419
03:12:47,049 --> 03:12:51,188
the best care of themselves in other

4420
03:12:48,459 --> 03:12:52,750
aspects but just so focused on the plant

4421
03:12:51,189 --> 03:12:54,818
that they love that they want it to be

4422
03:12:52,750 --> 03:12:56,379
the safest and the healthiest and you

4423
03:12:54,818 --> 03:12:58,659
know like I'm not laughing at that

4424
03:12:56,379 --> 03:13:00,759
hypocrisy because I'm sure I've lived it

4425
03:12:58,659 --> 03:13:03,250
and I'm living my own hypocrisy zazz I

4426
03:13:00,760 --> 03:13:06,040
speak so I'm not trying to talk down on

4427
03:13:03,250 --> 03:13:08,709
anyone but it's in that experience it's

4428
03:13:06,040 --> 03:13:11,529
in that hypocrisy that you can learn to

4429
03:13:08,709 --> 03:13:13,028
be from one side and to move over to the

4430
03:13:11,529 --> 03:13:14,529
other side the part that you weren't

4431
03:13:13,029 --> 03:13:16,810
thinking about the part that you weren't

4432
03:13:14,529 --> 03:13:18,670
aware and so people should welcome that

4433
03:13:16,809 --> 03:13:19,959
hypocrisy they shouldn't look down on it

4434
03:13:18,670 --> 03:13:21,879
like it's the worst thing ever

4435
03:13:19,959 --> 03:13:23,919
hypocrisy is the bridge that leads us

4436
03:13:21,879 --> 03:13:27,369
from where we were to hopefully where we

4437
03:13:23,920 --> 03:13:28,809
want to be absolutely ignorant is the

4438
03:13:27,370 --> 03:13:30,550
state of being uninformed and an

4439
03:13:28,809 --> 03:13:34,500
opportunity to learn if you're open to

4440
03:13:30,549 --> 03:13:35,829
it and not cognitively dissonant yeah

4441
03:13:34,500 --> 03:13:37,689
true

4442
03:13:35,829 --> 03:13:45,489
did you have something you wanted to add

4443
03:13:37,689 --> 03:13:53,350
Wade well you're on mute I'm also

4444
03:13:45,489 --> 03:13:55,180
technologically challenged I'm here yeah

4445
03:13:53,350 --> 03:13:57,489
I got a sign off here pretty soon - I

4446
03:13:55,180 --> 03:14:02,350
want I want to just thank you for the

4447
03:13:57,489 --> 03:14:04,449
invite and anytime that makes sense I I

4448
03:14:02,350 --> 03:14:09,700
am thrilled to join this panel because

4449
03:14:04,450 --> 03:14:11,950
yeah I really feel blessed by the

4450
03:14:09,700 --> 03:14:16,140
perspectives the different points of

4451
03:14:11,950 --> 03:14:18,520
view that are being offered here and

4452
03:14:16,139 --> 03:14:20,528
some of you folks are people I've known

4453
03:14:18,520 --> 03:14:24,310
for years and never had a chance to meet

4454
03:14:20,529 --> 03:14:25,989
with or talked to and Marcus I really

4455
03:14:24,309 --> 03:14:28,269
want to bless you and thank you for

4456
03:14:25,989 --> 03:14:30,840
putting together panels like this and

4457
03:14:28,270 --> 03:14:35,700
hand doing it every day over and over

4458
03:14:30,840 --> 03:14:35,700
and I think it's really important that

4459
03:14:35,879 --> 03:14:40,389
this information be available to more

4460
03:14:38,889 --> 03:14:43,959
people I'm really hoping that the

4461
03:14:40,389 --> 03:14:45,159
Chester pastors turns into a huge

4462
03:14:43,959 --> 03:14:49,600
presence in

4463
03:14:45,159 --> 03:14:54,340
cannabis world simply for the both the

4464
03:14:49,601 --> 03:14:56,650
depth and the heartfelt nosov belief in

4465
03:14:54,340 --> 03:14:58,479
the plant and what it can do for us and

4466
03:14:56,649 --> 03:15:00,789
I really think for the world it really

4467
03:14:58,479 --> 03:15:05,049
is the healing of the people to use a

4468
03:15:00,790 --> 03:15:08,080
phrase and yeah just over and over again

4469
03:15:05,049 --> 03:15:10,449
I'm amazed what I hear in these few

4470
03:15:08,079 --> 03:15:14,590
times I've been with you guys and it's

4471
03:15:10,450 --> 03:15:17,771

4474
03:15:20,799 --> 03:15:25,689
community everything you're saying is

4475
03:15:22,959 --> 03:15:28,779
true if if you're a cannabis convert

4476
03:15:25,690 --> 03:15:31,870
already it's all true but the vast

4477
03:15:28,780 --> 03:15:37,000
majority of the planet are not converted

4478
03:15:31,870 --> 03:15:39,030

today good people good conversation I

4485
03:15:52,299 --> 03:15:55,810
loved the way it started the middle

4486
03:15:54,340 --> 03:15:58,601
throughout the end of the the

4487
03:15:55,810 --> 03:16:00,549
conversation I loved I loved having us

4488
03:15:58,601 --> 03:16:03,641
call each other on the information that

4489
03:16:00,549 --> 03:16:05,979
we know and might not know it's just it

4490
03:16:03,640 --> 03:16:07,600
is true it's like Sam said you know and

4491
03:16:05,979 --> 03:16:11,199
one of the things I don't very often

4492
03:16:07,601 --> 03:16:13,180
sort of request which he'll hear me

4493
03:16:11,200 --> 03:16:14,680
maybe in chat at least more and more so

4494
03:16:13,180 --> 03:16:16,450
now listen if you're watching and you

4495
03:16:14,680 --> 03:16:18,970
want to help you want to be a part of it

4496
03:16:16,450 --> 03:16:21,010
sharing the link to hash Church is a

4497
03:16:18,969 --> 03:16:22,779
good way to do that if you can share it

4498
03:16:21,010 --> 03:16:25,450
and get it out and help build the live

4499
03:16:22,780 --> 03:16:27,280
audience we'd love to get back up to a

4500
03:16:25,450 --> 03:16:30,010
thousand or even above and beyond that

4501
03:16:27,280 --> 03:16:32,290
and I'm gonna try and make a photo a

4502
03:16:30,010 --> 03:16:34,840
nice beautiful photograph each week

4503
03:16:32,290 --> 03:16:36,820
where we'll have the hash Church episode

4504
03:16:34,840 --> 03:16:38,049
and maybe who's gonna be some guests and

4505

[ __ ] Alec but I mean in the end that I

4531
03:17:50,761 --> 03:17:55,739
mean you just defer to hey science is

4532
03:17:53,610 --> 03:17:57,601
science is science you know I didn't

4533
03:17:55,739 --> 03:17:59,699
poopoo your [ __ ] reality you proposed

4534
03:17:57,601 --> 03:18:01,200
your reality science just verified it

4535
03:17:59,700 --> 03:18:07,771
and validated it sorry

4536
03:18:01,200 --> 03:18:09,601
hey I'm sure it's amazing because like

4537
03:18:07,771 --> 03:18:12,420
I've I've had this conversation so many

4538
03:18:09,601 --> 03:18:13,261
times and like I I can so many in so

4539
03:18:12,420 --> 03:18:15,239
many words

4540
03:18:13,261 --> 03:18:17,431
help people deduce down to a specific

4541
03:18:15,239 --> 03:18:20,989
space where they didn't think about the

4542
03:18:17,431 --> 03:18:25,380
contamination coming from and so it's so

4543
03:18:20,989 --> 03:18:27,629
I feel so great you know to help people

4544
03:18:25,379 --> 03:18:28,979
arrive at like ah ha moment you know

4545
03:18:27,629 --> 03:18:30,420
about a certain thing of the

4546
03:18:28,979 --> 03:18:32,129
vulnerability their business that they

4547
03:18:30,420 --> 03:18:36,300
took to take such pride in and so yeah

4548
03:18:32,129 --> 03:18:39,420
it says I'm in service to the plants the

4549
03:18:36,300 --> 03:18:42,629
honest truth is people have ignored this

4550
03:18:39,420 --> 03:18:45,530
for decades it's it's been going on with

4551
03:18:42,629 --> 03:18:49,069
imported products that they were using

4552
03:18:45,530 --> 03:18:52,230
poisonous sprays to have in Mexico and

4553
03:18:49,069 --> 03:18:54,779
until it's publicly acknowledged and

4554
03:18:52,229 --> 03:18:56,789
people are forced to admit their

4555
03:18:54,780 --> 03:19:00,271
mistakes that move out they will not

4556
03:18:56,790 --> 03:19:02,360
change well what a great way for them to

4557
03:19:00,271 --> 03:19:06,091
be sort of forced to see it through the

4558
03:19:02,360 --> 03:19:08,819
perspectives of you know critically ill

4559
03:19:06,091 --> 03:19:11,159
and catastrophic ly ill both adults and

4560
03:19:08,819 --> 03:19:13,379
children who these these

4561
03:19:11,159 --> 03:19:15,780
small amounts that might not seem to a

4562
03:19:13,379 --> 03:19:18,509
healthy persons daily consumption to be

4563
03:19:15,780 --> 03:19:20,130
that big of a deal in fact some of them

4564
03:19:18,510 --> 03:19:21,780
are a great deal and I'm sure some of

4565
03:19:20,129 --> 03:19:24,270
them are probably accumulative in the

4566
03:19:21,780 --> 03:19:25,561
body I don't know the science behind it

4567
03:19:24,271 --> 03:19:27,811
but I wouldn't be surprised to hear

4568
03:19:25,560 --> 03:19:30,659
that's you know some of these things are

4569
03:19:27,810 --> 03:19:32,699
pretty oh yeah it's just terrible

4570
03:19:30,659 --> 03:19:34,739
everyone should know like that should be

4571
03:19:32,700 --> 03:19:37,110
the law if you're consuming something

4572
03:19:34,739 --> 03:19:39,149
that's accumulative in the body that

4573
03:19:37,110 --> 03:19:41,460
tends to stick around for your lifetime

4574
03:19:39,149 --> 03:19:42,989
that seems kind of insane that there

4575
03:19:41,459 --> 03:19:45,449
wouldn't be some sort of a little maybe

4576
03:19:42,989 --> 03:19:47,129
giant huge label that actually has an

4577
03:19:45,450 --> 03:19:49,620
audio button that you push and it

4578
03:19:47,129 --> 03:19:51,239
screams at you well they do it with they

4579
03:19:49,620 --> 03:19:54,480
do it now with cigarettes cuz they got

4580
03:19:51,239 --> 03:19:56,310
sued for so long now it's basically like

4581
03:19:54,479 --> 03:19:58,109

03:19:58,110 --> 03:20:02,460
in this there hundred and something

4584
03:20:00,780 --> 03:20:05,670
different addictive chemicals in it it's

4585
03:20:02,459 --> 03:20:07,259
more addictive than morphine and every

4586
03:20:05,670 --> 03:20:09,810
cigarette takes 30 minutes off your life

4587

dollars of that Jesus what a racket

4598

it's unbelievable it is truly an

4599
03:20:49,250 --> 03:20:54,870
unbelievable racket I don't even want to

4600
03:20:52,049 --> 03:20:56,699
get too deep into that one because I'm

4601
03:20:54,870 --> 03:20:58,920
hypersensitive to cigarettes they make

4602
03:20:56,700 --> 03:21:00,540
me very ill I tend to turn green and

4603
03:20:58,920 --> 03:21:03,271
throw up if I'm around large

4604
03:21:00,540 --> 03:21:05,490
concentrations of them and I've always

4605
03:21:03,271 --> 03:21:08,010
felt like it's kind of the worst payback

4606
03:21:05,489 --> 03:21:10,500
ever when you like turn on someone to

4607
03:21:08,010 --> 03:21:12,960
this beautiful cannabis resin that you

4608
03:21:10,500 --> 03:21:15,060

4610
03:21:15,060 --> 03:21:18,090
you feel and then they're just like oh

4611
03:21:16,379 --> 03:21:22,140

4613
03:21:22,140 --> 03:21:27,239
I do now feel like a bag of [ __ ] yeah

4614
03:21:25,950 --> 03:21:29,190
you end up you and I are very similar

4615
03:21:27,239 --> 03:21:30,569
somebody starts smoking a cigarette on

4616
03:21:29,190 --> 03:21:34,801
this we just happened to scatter as

4617
03:21:30,569 --> 03:21:41,239
quick as possible I'm a militant smoker

4618
03:21:34,800 --> 03:21:41,239
yeah spray ozium on people cigarettes

4619
03:21:41,329 --> 03:21:46,729
airplanes allowed to have cigarettes

4620
03:21:46,851 --> 03:21:51,021
well that's when I was in Amsterdam I

4621
03:21:51,440 --> 03:21:58,649
rolled up you know just a joint with I

4622
03:21:56,341 --> 03:22:00,239
think I had some bubble or something I

4623
03:21:58,649 --> 03:22:03,659
smoked it and everybody gave me the evil

4624
03:22:00,239 --> 03:22:07,261
eye the pier at the pier why you smoke

4625
03:22:03,659 --> 03:22:09,479
the pier at the pier right crackhead

4626
03:22:07,261 --> 03:22:11,700
back then I wasn't the reason the Dutch

4627
03:22:09,479 --> 03:22:14,761
don't smoke purest because they're too

4628
03:22:11,700 --> 03:22:22,261
cheap tobacco's cheaper so they mix it

4629
03:22:14,761 --> 03:22:24,750
with tobacco yeah also cannabis is a

4630
03:22:22,261 --> 03:22:26,819
learned experience and if the first time

4631
03:22:24,750 --> 03:22:30,511
you smoke cannabis it's mixed with

4632
03:22:26,819 --> 03:22:34,170
tobacco then that's one of the cues your

4633
03:22:30,511 --> 03:22:36,960
body is brain is looking for you smoke

4634
03:22:34,170 --> 03:22:40,079
pure you have trouble realizing you're

4635
03:22:36,959 --> 03:22:45,270
even high yeah that's a backhoe I'll

4636
03:22:40,079 --> 03:22:50,819
tell ya whoo harsh on the throat harsh

4637
03:22:45,271 --> 03:22:54,710
on the lungs like what do you mean I'm

4638
03:22:50,819 --> 03:22:58,170
like I'll show you what I mean it's

4639
03:22:54,709 --> 03:23:01,289
because tobacco was a sacred plant to

4640
03:22:58,170 --> 03:23:03,420
the American Indians and of course they

4641
03:23:01,290 --> 03:23:05,670
were not growing it mixed with chemicals

4642
03:23:03,420 --> 03:23:07,710
and all this other crap like modern

4643
03:23:05,670 --> 03:23:11,280
cigarettes with blisterin to keep it

4644
03:23:07,709 --> 03:23:13,919
burning but still it was a sacred planet

4645
03:23:11,280 --> 03:23:16,681
they used it they would take big doses

4646
03:23:13,920 --> 03:23:19,860
of it and get psychedelic on it well you

4647
03:23:16,681 --> 03:23:22,649
know you know also you know a psychic

4648
03:23:19,860 --> 03:23:24,540
you brought that up you know about yeah

4649
03:23:22,649 --> 03:23:27,390
tobacco has always been viewed as this

4650
03:23:24,540 --> 03:23:29,460
really sacred super powerful plant

4651
03:23:27,390 --> 03:23:31,859
medicine and a lot of different healing

4652
03:23:29,459 --> 03:23:33,869
traditions for like thousands of years

4653
03:23:31,860 --> 03:23:35,909
you know and and you know one of the

4654
03:23:33,870 --> 03:23:38,340
most I was sitting in

4655
03:23:35,909 --> 03:23:41,100
I was experiment once in this shaman

4656
03:23:38,340 --> 03:23:43,139
from Brazil kind of blue am I so hard on

4657
03:23:41,100 --> 03:23:45,809
this what you said he was he talking

4658
03:23:43,139 --> 03:23:48,750
about tobacco he was saying how tobacco

4659
03:23:45,809 --> 03:23:50,579
is such a powerful like amplifier spirit

4660
03:23:48,750 --> 03:23:52,860
to like amplify your prayers and

4661
03:23:50,579 --> 03:23:54,329
intentions and blessings and which is

4662
03:23:52,860 --> 03:23:56,880
one of the reason why so commonly used

4663
03:23:54,329 --> 03:23:58,260
in these ceremonial spaces you know and

4664
03:23:56,879 --> 03:24:00,359
the shaman will be smoking it and kind

4665
03:23:58,260 --> 03:24:02,130
of blowing it on somebody or you know

4666
03:24:00,360 --> 03:24:03,560
it's used in a tobacco like in the

4667
03:24:02,129 --> 03:24:06,599
preparation that you blowing your nose

4668
03:24:03,559 --> 03:24:08,609
using aren't they using commercial

4669
03:24:06,600 --> 03:24:11,640
cigarettes are not using say no to back

4670
03:24:08,610 --> 03:24:13,110
no no I mean sir I mean it's ceremony

4671
03:24:11,639 --> 03:24:14,879
typically like they'll use like tobacco

4672
03:24:13,110 --> 03:24:17,010
Rustica you know kind of grown down

4673
03:24:14,879 --> 03:24:19,559
South America or what have you but but

4674
03:24:17,010 --> 03:24:21,300
but my point is is you know what what

4675
03:24:19,559 --> 03:24:24,359
was spoken through the words of the

4676
03:24:21,299 --> 03:24:26,789
shaman was that you know tobacco is used

4677
03:24:24,360 --> 03:24:28,890
so improperly by the Western world's

4678
03:24:26,790 --> 03:24:31,470
because in all healing traditions it's

4679
03:24:28,889 --> 03:24:33,119
never inhaled into your lungs because

4680
03:24:31,469 --> 03:24:36,420
tobacco has the power to create or

4681
03:24:33,120 --> 03:24:37,110
destroy and and whenever it's taken into

4682
03:24:36,420 --> 03:24:38,610
lungs

4683
03:24:37,110 --> 03:24:39,960
you know it's smoked in the way that's

4684
03:24:38,610 --> 03:24:42,930
done in the Western world and just

4685
03:24:39,959 --> 03:24:47,039
thinking about your stresses and all the

4686
03:24:42,930 --> 03:24:49,470
things there was no shellac it was hoped

4687
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:52,649
there was no tobacco you couldn't hail

4688
03:24:49,469 --> 03:24:55,079
into your lungs until after the 1860s

4689
03:24:52,648 --> 03:24:58,590
when they invented bright tobacco in

4690
03:24:55,079 --> 03:25:00,689
America by I mean I mean wasn't blue

4691
03:24:58,590 --> 03:25:01,950
during it whether she believed it was in

4692
03:25:00,689 --> 03:25:03,930
Peru have been using kind of tobacco

4693
03:25:01,950 --> 03:25:06,390
rooster cover you know same thing with

4694
03:25:03,930 --> 03:25:08,280
you know certain tobacco

4695
03:25:06,389 --> 03:25:10,799
you couldn't inhale that into your lungs

4696
03:25:08,280 --> 03:25:12,659
no no but it's not meant to be and it

4697
03:25:10,799 --> 03:25:13,889
kills you if you do and it's what it's

4698
03:25:12,659 --> 03:25:15,360
the way the way in Native American

4699
03:25:13,889 --> 03:25:17,459
traditions the way to back because use

4700
03:25:15,360 --> 03:25:19,380
this has taken in your mouth not inhaled

4701
03:25:17,459 --> 03:25:21,269
and then blown out with the power of all

4702
03:25:19,379 --> 03:25:23,369
your prayers and superior you know it

4703
03:25:21,270 --> 03:25:25,530
continued no intention you know and so

4704
03:25:23,370 --> 03:25:27,780
so it's used so the way was described by

4705
03:25:25,530 --> 03:25:29,340
this shaman is that you know it has the

4706
03:25:27,780 --> 03:25:31,530
power to create or destroy and it's

4707
03:25:29,340 --> 03:25:34,260
destroying someone to more because of

4708
03:25:31,530 --> 03:25:36,659
the way it's used you know and it's so

4709
03:25:34,260 --> 03:25:38,309
far off the medicinal use of it you know

4710
03:25:36,659 --> 03:25:39,780
and and I'm not advocating for you know

4711
03:25:38,309 --> 03:25:41,789
taking smoke in your mouth and blowing

4712
03:25:39,780 --> 03:25:43,229
it out not inhaling you know but but you

4713
03:25:41,790 --> 03:25:45,840
know certain tobacco preparations like

4714
03:25:43,228 --> 03:25:49,420
hot Bay which is so commonly they still

4715
03:25:45,840 --> 03:25:51,370
do that with pipes and cigars sure sure

4716
03:25:49,420 --> 03:25:52,899
sure sure yeah he's found it very

4717
03:25:51,370 --> 03:25:55,120
interesting because it's like it's you

4718
03:25:52,899 --> 03:25:56,469
know it's it's so so so common used in

4719
03:25:55,120 --> 03:25:59,170
so many different healing traditions on

4720
03:25:56,469 --> 03:26:01,389
the world for so long and it hasn't had

4721
03:25:59,170 --> 03:26:03,939
the same effect on just wiping out

4722
03:26:01,389 --> 03:26:05,430
populations as as here and then you know

4723
03:26:03,939 --> 03:26:07,569
they attributed basically just to our

4724
03:26:05,430 --> 03:26:16,120
disrespectful and improper use of it you

4725
03:26:07,569 --> 03:26:18,670
know what Jamie let's fall back oh right

4726
03:26:16,120 --> 03:26:20,829
which is an alkaloid which is again a

4727
03:26:18,670 --> 03:26:24,790
completely different ballgame

4728
03:26:20,829 --> 03:26:30,370
nicotine is toxic right you need so

4729
03:26:24,790 --> 03:26:33,939
imagine again the cannabis plant doesn't

4730
03:26:30,370 --> 03:26:36,790
have a non-toxic component right tobacco

4731
03:26:33,939 --> 03:26:39,460
has a toxic component I think like a

4732
03:26:36,790 --> 03:26:43,750
dose of somewhere between 50 to 80

4733
03:26:39,459 --> 03:26:46,869
milligrams can kill a adult human being

4734
03:26:43,750 --> 03:26:49,270
imagine a dose of 50 to 80 milligrams of

4735
03:26:46,870 --> 03:26:50,079
THC if that killed it would mean oh my

4736
03:26:49,270 --> 03:26:54,310
god

4737
03:26:50,079 --> 03:26:55,659
so they're two different biologies two

4738
03:26:54,309 --> 03:26:58,899
different plants two different

4739
03:26:55,659 --> 03:27:02,260
chemistry's and and I'm like you know

4740
03:26:58,899 --> 03:27:05,489
nicotine or unlike tobacco the cannabis

4741
03:27:02,260 --> 03:27:08,590
essential oil is remarkably free of

4742
03:27:05,489 --> 03:27:11,260
nitrogen containing compounds where if

4743
03:27:08,590 --> 03:27:14,139
you look at the essential oil of tobacco

4744
03:27:11,260 --> 03:27:17,110
and nicotine itself which is a parola

4745
03:27:14,139 --> 03:27:18,879
teen based alkaloid these things are not

4746
03:27:17,110 --> 03:27:20,920
thermally stable and they undergo

4747
03:27:18,879 --> 03:27:22,959
Hofmann degradation when you heat them

4748
03:27:20,920 --> 03:27:26,170
up in the presence of air so they

4749
03:27:22,959 --> 03:27:29,589
degrade into a variety of different just

4750
03:27:26,170 --> 03:27:32,319
downstream products so it's like they're

4751
03:27:29,590 --> 03:27:38,710
two very very different plants it's very

4752
03:27:32,319 --> 03:27:43,299
very different tobacco itself when you

4753
03:27:38,709 --> 03:27:46,750
when you blue carrot bright to produce

4754
03:27:43,299 --> 03:27:47,438
bright tobacco which is all modern

4755
03:27:46,750 --> 03:27:50,799
cigarettes

4756
03:27:47,439 --> 03:27:52,960
it changes the pH that allows it to be

4757
03:27:50,799 --> 03:27:57,549
inhaled and absorbed through the lungs

4758
03:27:52,959 --> 03:28:02,390
which made it way more addictive

4759
03:27:57,549 --> 03:28:04,850
well yeah it's an interesting plant that

4760
03:28:02,390 --> 03:28:09,140
obviously you know when looked at from

4761
03:28:04,851 --> 03:28:11,900
the shamanic perspective many shamans

4762
03:28:09,140 --> 03:28:14,959
using tobacco as a ways to sort of

4763
03:28:11,899 --> 03:28:17,329
almost you know uncover things and also

4764
03:28:14,959 --> 03:28:20,569
leave breadcrumbs to get back from these

4765
03:28:17,329 --> 03:28:23,090
journeys on certain psychedelics that

4766
03:28:20,569 --> 03:28:26,149
it's not surprising that somehow you

4767
03:28:23,090 --> 03:28:31,010
know you know we got a hold of it and

4768
03:28:26,149 --> 03:28:33,859
turned it into this in itself a lot of

4769
03:28:31,010 --> 03:28:36,739
shaman's also will take a mouthful of

4770
03:28:33,860 --> 03:28:40,819
distilled spirits and spray it on their

4771
03:28:36,739 --> 03:28:42,709
subject and yeah I don't use distilled

4772
03:28:40,819 --> 03:28:45,680
spirits I don't use tobacco

4773
03:28:42,709 --> 03:28:49,310
no North nor do I never did do you just

4774
03:28:45,680 --> 03:28:58,851
spit on people then III tried to as

4775
03:28:49,310 --> 03:29:00,619
often as I can what do we got three and

4776
03:28:58,851 --> 03:29:04,280
a half hours a hashed church pretty

4777
03:29:00,620 --> 03:29:06,550
slammin pretty slamming you have

4778
03:29:04,280 --> 03:29:09,500
anything you wanted to tell us about

4779
03:29:06,549 --> 03:29:11,319
anyone anyone have anything they wanted

4780
03:29:09,500 --> 03:29:13,670
to say that they didn't get to say yet

4781
03:29:11,319 --> 03:29:16,459
but they've been sitting on the whole

4782
03:29:13,670 --> 03:29:18,170
time I wanted to go back to the thing I

4783
03:29:16,459 --> 03:29:22,219
was saying earlier about about

4784
03:29:18,170 --> 03:29:26,210
contamination so if you do have you know

4785
03:29:22,219 --> 03:29:30,199
for whatever reason like a contaminated

4786
03:29:26,209 --> 03:29:33,369
batch of material you can we claim so

4787
03:29:30,200 --> 03:29:35,210
there's a lot of advances in in membrane

4788
03:29:33,370 --> 03:29:37,550
separation and chromatographic

4789
03:29:35,209 --> 03:29:41,060
separation technologies that will enable

4790
03:29:37,549 --> 03:29:43,159
you to basically remediate contaminated

4791
03:29:41,060 --> 03:29:45,440
oil and if you think about it just like

4792
03:29:43,159 --> 03:29:49,010
water filtration systems a lot of these

4793
03:29:45,440 --> 03:29:51,409
are basically membranes that have again

4794
03:29:49,010 --> 03:29:54,050
certain wetting capacities so there it

4795
03:29:51,409 --> 03:29:55,610
is a disposable again Marcus what

4796
03:29:54,049 --> 03:29:59,119
happens I was thinking about your

4797
03:29:55,610 --> 03:30:02,690
question that you asked before like if

4798
03:29:59,120 --> 03:30:05,480
you do filter the stuff through like the

4799
03:30:02,690 --> 03:30:07,819
silicon what do you do with this total

4800
03:30:05,479 --> 03:30:10,789
job well it's kind of like well what do

4801
03:30:07,819 --> 03:30:14,869
you do with the cartridge in your filter

4802
03:30:10,790 --> 03:30:17,120
that filters your water for your you

4803
03:30:14,870 --> 03:30:20,420
know kitchen or your refrigerator

4804
03:30:17,120 --> 03:30:22,579
yeah or anything so so these things so

4805
03:30:20,420 --> 03:30:24,979
even if you did like indras always

4806
03:30:22,579 --> 03:30:27,590
talked about having you know activated

4807
03:30:24,979 --> 03:30:28,699
charcoal and molecular sieves well

4808
03:30:27,590 --> 03:30:31,250
there's a lot of different

4809
03:30:28,700 --> 03:30:34,521
chromatographic supports that will

4810
03:30:31,250 --> 03:30:36,771
basically bind up any trace amounts of

4811
03:30:34,521 --> 03:30:39,440
residues so if you took an ethanol

4812
03:30:36,771 --> 03:30:43,820
solution of these things run it through

4813
03:30:39,440 --> 03:30:46,430
hang up the stuff and then just Tyrael

4814
03:30:43,819 --> 03:30:48,860
tested by Alec before and after and see

4815
03:30:46,430 --> 03:30:51,590
if your chromatographic separation

4816
03:30:48,860 --> 03:30:55,700
actually gets rid of the material I mean

4817
03:30:51,590 --> 03:30:57,950
that sounds malleable yeah absolutely

4818
03:30:55,700 --> 03:31:00,470
oh yeah this is used in in water

4819
03:30:57,950 --> 03:31:04,010
remediation I yeah I work with companies

4820
03:31:00,469 --> 03:31:06,139
that yeah did do this all the time all

4821
03:31:04,010 --> 03:31:09,021
the time these didn't oil in the food

4822
03:31:06,139 --> 03:31:11,629
industry as well and again there's all

4823
03:31:09,021 --> 03:31:13,521
kinds of different membranes and

4824
03:31:11,629 --> 03:31:16,279
different types of separation technology

4825
03:31:13,521 --> 03:31:18,170
I don't think we should be spreading

4826
03:31:16,280 --> 03:31:21,021
this knowledge because the truth of it

4827
03:31:18,170 --> 03:31:24,979
is if it will encourage people to use

4828
03:31:21,021 --> 03:31:28,250
and pesticides to produce big dietary

4829
03:31:24,979 --> 03:31:30,079
so-called healthy crops and then they

4830
03:31:28,250 --> 03:31:32,690
say well we could clean it up afterwards

4831
03:31:30,079 --> 03:31:33,799
no you know that for what it's worth I

4832
03:31:32,690 --> 03:31:35,000
actually really appreciate bringing that

4833
03:31:33,799 --> 03:31:37,129
because I didn't know if I want to say

4834
03:31:35,000 --> 03:31:39,739
I've done some romantic level I kind of

4835
03:31:37,129 --> 03:31:41,539
was hoping that pesticide removal wasn't

4836
03:31:39,739 --> 03:31:45,049
gonna be scalable or would ultimately

4837
03:31:41,540 --> 03:31:48,620
fail because I feel like the biggest the

4838
03:31:45,049 --> 03:31:50,809
biggest you know demand for that service

4839
03:31:48,620 --> 03:31:52,579
is going to be the big mono crop gnarly

4840
03:31:50,809 --> 03:31:55,119
guys they're just trying to cut you know

4841
03:31:52,579 --> 03:31:58,940
and you know it's figured out like that

4842
03:31:55,120 --> 03:32:00,170
and I feel like as long as there's type

4843
03:31:58,940 --> 03:32:02,239
has that regulations and you can't

4844
03:32:00,170 --> 03:32:03,710
remove those there's almost it's over

4845
03:32:02,239 --> 03:32:06,829
it's almost gonna work out better for

4846
03:32:03,709 --> 03:32:10,929
the small guy you know but the people

4847
03:32:06,829 --> 03:32:10,930
who are do use them in the first place

4848
03:32:10,959 --> 03:32:15,319
well I'm just thinking just from the

4849
03:32:13,549 --> 03:32:17,840
point of view that someone's made an

4850
03:32:15,319 --> 03:32:20,299
investment and some material they did

4851
03:32:17,840 --> 03:32:22,790
some testing they had a good idea that

4852
03:32:20,299 --> 03:32:24,139
this material was contaminant free now

4853
03:32:22,790 --> 03:32:26,689
they've taken that material

4854
03:32:24,139 --> 03:32:29,358
processed it into a concentrate like a

4855
03:32:26,689 --> 03:32:31,488
rosin and now it comes up hot

4856
03:32:29,359 --> 03:32:35,479
well [ __ ] what do they do they just

4857
03:32:31,488 --> 03:32:38,000
flush that $50,000 down the toilet or do

4858
03:32:35,478 --> 03:32:39,198
they try to remediate that material to

4859
03:32:38,000 --> 03:32:41,090
make medicine out of it

4860
03:32:39,199 --> 03:32:43,279
I would point out pine makes them I'm

4861
03:32:41,090 --> 03:32:45,408
not trying to say that this is how it

4862
03:32:43,279 --> 03:32:47,810
should be done but the point is is that

4863
03:32:45,408 --> 03:32:50,209
there are ways of basically cleaning

4864
03:32:47,809 --> 03:32:52,430
these things up so you can actually

4865
03:32:50,209 --> 03:32:54,169
recoup the medicine that you that you

4866
03:32:52,430 --> 03:32:57,079
don't know don't you think of people

4867
03:32:54,170 --> 03:33:01,040
know that it will encourage the populace

4868
03:32:57,079 --> 03:33:05,270
to mass produce with pesticides and

4869
03:33:01,040 --> 03:33:07,609
clean it up later now because cleaning

4870
03:33:05,270 --> 03:33:10,250
it up basically marginalizes the product

4871
03:33:07,609 --> 03:33:12,079
somewhat you know because now you're

4872
03:33:10,250 --> 03:33:17,059
you're probably cleaning out other

4873
03:33:12,079 --> 03:33:19,010
things as well and again I think alec

4874
03:33:17,059 --> 03:33:21,889
asked a really important question is it

4875
03:33:19,010 --> 03:33:23,600
scalable so I think it's very very

4876
03:33:21,889 --> 03:33:26,260
important to be able to point out the

4877
03:33:23,600 --> 03:33:29,300
fact that you know when you're removing

4878
03:33:26,260 --> 03:33:32,449
trace amounts of material from say a

4879
03:33:29,299 --> 03:33:35,898
large amount of oil or a large amount of

4880
03:33:32,449 --> 03:33:39,260
extract you can easily overload the

4881
03:33:35,898 --> 03:33:42,858
capacity of any of these smaller columns

4882
03:33:39,260 --> 03:33:44,750
so it's just like you know running a lot

4883
03:33:42,859 --> 03:33:47,420
of crap through your water filtration

4884
03:33:44,750 --> 03:33:49,459
system for home yeah eventually the

4885
03:33:47,420 --> 03:33:51,139
capacity of that column is going to be

4886
03:33:49,459 --> 03:33:53,539
overloaded and it's not going to

4887
03:33:51,139 --> 03:33:56,180
function anymore which is why you got to

4888
03:33:53,540 --> 03:33:58,359
do it test before and after and again

4889
03:33:56,180 --> 03:34:01,520
I'm not saying that you should use

4890
03:33:58,359 --> 03:34:03,680
remediation as part of your production

4891
03:34:01,520 --> 03:34:06,229
process Sam which i think is what you're

4892
03:34:03,680 --> 03:34:08,199
trying to say I'm saying that if you're

4893
03:34:06,228 --> 03:34:10,278
in the situation where you already have

4894
03:34:08,199 --> 03:34:12,380
material that you've already made an

4895
03:34:10,279 --> 03:34:14,899
investment in rather than throwing away

4896
03:34:12,379 --> 03:34:17,509
it can be remediated and it can be

4897
03:34:14,898 --> 03:34:21,920
purified and test results can show that

4898
03:34:17,510 --> 03:34:25,880
this stuff now passes the the you know

4899
03:34:21,920 --> 03:34:28,370
pesticide test you know it's a tough one

4900
03:34:25,879 --> 03:34:29,839
I see both points I see the one point

4901
03:34:28,370 --> 03:34:31,850
more than the other but I see where

4902
03:34:29,840 --> 03:34:33,699
marks coming from - I see every time he

4903
03:34:31,850 --> 03:34:36,260
says what are you gonna do throw that

4904
03:34:33,699 --> 03:34:37,540
$50,000 away and that's where like Alec

4905
03:34:36,260 --> 03:34:40,239
and Sam

4906
03:34:37,540 --> 03:34:42,790
my most yes I would throw it away the

4907
03:34:40,239 --> 03:34:44,949
hot sack me too and I have that's the

4908
03:34:42,790 --> 03:34:47,560
problem that's what that's what Marx is

4909
03:34:44,950 --> 03:34:48,490
addressing is that they're not and then

4910
03:34:47,559 --> 03:34:50,229
what they're doing is that they're

4911
03:34:48,489 --> 03:34:52,420
getting it into the market whether it's

4912
03:34:50,229 --> 03:34:54,430
quote unquote medicine or black market

4913
03:34:52,420 --> 03:34:56,079
they're just getting it to people

4914
03:34:54,430 --> 03:34:58,630
because they're there it those people

4915
03:34:56,079 --> 03:35:00,340
are turning a profit they're not turning

4916
03:34:58,629 --> 03:35:02,109
medicine they're like okay [ __ ] it we

4917
03:35:00,340 --> 03:35:04,120
just need to move this yeah those sell

4918
03:35:02,110 --> 03:35:06,579
in a market where they don't have to

4919
03:35:04,120 --> 03:35:09,970
have testing requirements on the package

4920
03:35:06,579 --> 03:35:12,459
or you know it'll be black market I mean

4921
03:35:09,969 --> 03:35:15,010
it'll lose some value in the market

4922
03:35:12,459 --> 03:35:16,750
right because they can't put a label on

4923
03:35:15,010 --> 03:35:18,940
it and sell it for the market for which

4924
03:35:16,750 --> 03:35:22,180
it was intended but the point is is that

4925
03:35:18,940 --> 03:35:25,390
I I don't know and again it the ethics

4926
03:35:22,180 --> 03:35:30,610
of it is that the material can be

4927
03:35:25,389 --> 03:35:33,809
salvaged it seems like able to have a

4928
03:35:30,610 --> 03:35:37,750
way to reproducibly clean up

4929
03:35:33,809 --> 03:35:39,909
contaminated oil that shows

4930
03:35:37,750 --> 03:35:42,430
contamination at a certain level when

4931
03:35:39,909 --> 03:35:45,100
again some of the contamination could be

4932
03:35:42,430 --> 03:35:47,771
there not from a follower application or

4933
03:35:45,100 --> 03:35:50,620
anything that the cultivator debt did it

4934
03:35:47,771 --> 03:35:54,700
could be contamination from either the

4935
03:35:50,620 --> 03:35:57,070
soil or just unintentional contamination

4936
03:35:54,700 --> 03:35:59,521
from some other source and I think if we

4937
03:35:57,069 --> 03:36:03,520
if we were in a much more regulated

4938
03:35:59,521 --> 03:36:05,680
situation and we the industry itself

4939
03:36:03,521 --> 03:36:09,610
took the all of the things that we need

4940
03:36:05,680 --> 03:36:12,130
to do to be proactive in this middle

4941
03:36:09,610 --> 03:36:15,280
ground right now we're you know there's

4942
03:36:12,129 --> 03:36:18,819
no repercussions but if it was organized

4943
03:36:15,280 --> 03:36:21,280
and we had all of these lines of defense

4944
03:36:18,819 --> 03:36:24,069
if you will from the genetics to the

4945
03:36:21,280 --> 03:36:26,170
cultivating and extracting if somebody

4946
03:36:24,069 --> 03:36:28,029
or their material was found with

4947
03:36:26,170 --> 03:36:29,469
contaminants and had pesticides you

4948
03:36:28,030 --> 03:36:31,030
don't even want to just throw it away

4949
03:36:29,469 --> 03:36:34,840
it's bad for the environment

4950
03:36:31,030 --> 03:36:38,710
so as a remediation process maybe what

4951
03:36:34,840 --> 03:36:41,790
happens is you know material can't go

4952
03:36:38,709 --> 03:36:47,139
into the market and it has to be

4953
03:36:41,790 --> 03:36:48,730
processed prior to even getting rid of

4954
03:36:47,139 --> 03:36:51,219
it so I think there might be but

4955
03:36:48,729 --> 03:36:53,318
potentially a

4956
03:36:51,219 --> 03:36:54,818
potentially a it's kind of like I'll be

4957
03:36:53,318 --> 03:36:57,549
clean hazardous waste

4958
03:36:54,818 --> 03:36:59,049
you know our sewer systems work in the

4959
03:36:57,549 --> 03:37:01,958
clean hazardous waste before it gets

4960
03:36:59,049 --> 03:37:05,679
re-released I think that that would be

4961
03:37:01,959 --> 03:37:08,770
on it on a larger you need to worry so

4962
03:37:05,680 --> 03:37:11,738
much Tony because if you think about the

4963
03:37:08,770 --> 03:37:14,340
average trash dump it all of the

4964
03:37:11,738 --> 03:37:17,078
America's food is getting dumped there

4965
03:37:14,340 --> 03:37:24,100
and you don't think they said hey

4966
03:37:17,078 --> 03:37:26,859
pesticides yeah so the the problem is

4967
03:37:24,100 --> 03:37:29,289
not delusions and pollution terminating

4968
03:37:26,859 --> 03:37:31,568
the environment the problem is the

4969
03:37:29,289 --> 03:37:34,270
people are using the goddamn things in

4970
03:37:31,568 --> 03:37:36,248
the first place well on top of that you

4971
03:37:34,270 --> 03:37:38,260
also have you know statisticians are

4972
03:37:36,248 --> 03:37:39,850
coming out saying that even in legal

4973
03:37:38,260 --> 03:37:42,130
states and where things will come online

4974
03:37:39,850 --> 03:37:43,479
and regulated they're still expecting a

4975
03:37:42,129 --> 03:37:45,698
third of the market to still remain

4976
03:37:43,478 --> 03:37:48,849
illegal so as much as I'd love the

4977
03:37:45,699 --> 03:37:50,859
utopian idea was that you're opposing

4978
03:37:48,850 --> 03:37:52,779
there that if something is you know

4979
03:37:50,859 --> 03:37:54,430
negative it should be destroyed which I

4980
03:37:52,779 --> 03:37:56,800
agree because that's what happens in

4981
03:37:54,430 --> 03:37:58,720
other environments nobody takes barley

4982
03:37:56,799 --> 03:38:00,818
that's failed and goes along and sells

4983
03:37:58,719 --> 03:38:03,038
it you know on the side on the cheap

4984
03:38:00,818 --> 03:38:04,629
maybe some people do illegally etc but

4985
03:38:03,039 --> 03:38:07,020
you know they're still not allowed to

4986
03:38:04,629 --> 03:38:09,868
carry that into other markets etc but

4987
03:38:07,020 --> 03:38:12,069
that's still going to continue until the

4988
03:38:09,869 --> 03:38:14,170
it's going to come from the individual

4989
03:38:12,068 --> 03:38:17,948
consumer they have to demand the test

4990
03:38:14,170 --> 03:38:20,129
that's where it all came from the black

4991
03:38:17,949 --> 03:38:23,470
market will continue as long as we

4992
03:38:20,129 --> 03:38:25,778
remain so high as soon as the prices get

4993
03:38:23,469 --> 03:38:27,608
below a certain level there will be no

4994
03:38:25,779 --> 03:38:29,520
black market because there's no money in

4995
03:38:27,609 --> 03:38:31,359
the black market

4996
03:38:29,520 --> 03:38:34,720
it's just interesting that when you

4997
03:38:31,359 --> 03:38:36,158
consider how much like tonnage of herb

4998
03:38:34,719 --> 03:38:37,868
is grown in California every year and

4999
03:38:36,158 --> 03:38:39,129
like literally probably like eighty five

5000
03:38:37,869 --> 03:38:41,319
percent of it or something like that

5001
03:38:39,129 --> 03:38:43,809
goes elsewhere you know it's it's

5002
03:38:41,318 --> 03:38:46,389
amazing to think how I mean it seems

5003
03:38:43,809 --> 03:38:49,658
like such a impossibility for a

5004
03:38:46,389 --> 03:38:51,488
regulated model to actually be able to

5005
03:38:49,658 --> 03:38:53,469
get it all to stay in state and so it's

5006
03:38:51,488 --> 03:38:57,368
not it just seems like it's gonna be oh

5007
03:38:53,469 --> 03:39:00,368
because it can't because it can't you

5008
03:38:57,369 --> 03:39:05,230
can't stay in state and say over girl

5009
03:39:00,369 --> 03:39:10,060
the government everyone wants cow

5010
03:39:05,229 --> 03:39:11,739
or like not just California you know how

5011
03:39:10,060 --> 03:39:15,460
are you gonna this is the problem with

5012
03:39:11,739 --> 03:39:17,560
these legal sort of platforms if they

5013
03:39:15,460 --> 03:39:20,170
don't allow for everything and they put

5014
03:39:17,560 --> 03:39:21,789
rules too many rules then the black

5015
03:39:20,171 --> 03:39:25,329
market just continues to do its thing

5016
03:39:21,790 --> 03:39:28,091
it's like oh well especially when the

5017
03:39:25,329 --> 03:39:31,030
prices are still based on prohibition

5018
03:39:28,091 --> 03:39:33,521
and not on straight agricultural

5019
03:39:31,030 --> 03:39:35,141
conditions exactly look at look at my

5020
03:39:33,521 --> 03:39:38,440
alright I have two dispensaries in

5021
03:39:35,140 --> 03:39:41,289
Nevada and the the prices of Nevada are

5022
03:39:38,440 --> 03:39:43,060
high and there's and there's no way that

5023
03:39:41,290 --> 03:39:46,721
the illegal market is going to go away

5024
03:39:43,060 --> 03:39:49,210
as the ungodly amount of taxation and

5025
03:39:46,720 --> 03:39:51,520
over taxation that we have seen in these

5026
03:39:49,210 --> 03:39:53,380
regulated environments that has to also

5027
03:39:51,521 --> 03:39:54,579
go the way because there again as we

5028
03:39:53,380 --> 03:39:56,699
have talked about the past they're

5029
03:39:54,579 --> 03:39:59,560
looking through these prohibition

5030
03:39:56,700 --> 03:40:03,370
induced eyeglasses that have produced

5031
03:39:59,560 --> 03:40:05,500
this false high price of cannabis and as

5032
03:40:03,370 --> 03:40:07,540
we see in these legal states it's

5033
03:40:05,500 --> 03:40:11,530
considerably coming down and it's only

5034
03:40:07,540 --> 03:40:13,900
continuing to come out creates time

5035
03:40:11,530 --> 03:40:16,150
rates in what are the tax rates in

5036
03:40:13,899 --> 03:40:19,779
Nevada because I've seen a couple posts

5037
03:40:16,149 --> 03:40:21,940
on this week that I couldn't believe the

5038
03:40:19,780 --> 03:40:23,829
taxes that were on a receipt but I think

5039
03:40:21,940 --> 03:40:26,649
the receipt may have been fake news

5040
03:40:23,829 --> 03:40:29,050
never like smoke well what an eighth

5041
03:40:26,649 --> 03:40:33,699
like is an eighth gonna cost somewhere

5042
03:40:29,050 --> 03:40:35,171
between 40 to 50 bucks and be taxed how

5043
03:40:33,700 --> 03:40:38,051
much how much are you gonna walk out of

5044
03:40:35,171 --> 03:40:40,601
that transaction and I have I have not

5045
03:40:38,050 --> 03:40:44,710
done than than an actual transaction at

5046
03:40:40,601 --> 03:40:46,301
the retail at the adult use yet it's

5047
03:40:44,710 --> 03:40:47,710
being done every day at my facilities

5048
03:40:46,300 --> 03:40:49,569
but I have not actually gone there

5049
03:40:47,710 --> 03:40:52,930
because it's only in one facility in in

5050
03:40:49,569 --> 03:40:55,060
Las Vegas currently are inclined one we

5051
03:40:52,931 --> 03:40:57,579
had to wait for the laws to change in

5052
03:40:55,060 --> 03:40:59,739
Incline which are set to take pass at

5053
03:40:57,579 --> 03:41:01,479
the end of this month and then on August

5054
03:40:59,739 --> 03:41:04,869
1st we'll be able to do an adult sale

5055
03:41:01,479 --> 03:41:06,909
but the adult sale tax is unfortunately

5056
03:41:04,870 --> 03:41:10,051
very high I mean it can be as I know is

5057
03:41:06,909 --> 03:41:15,069
up to sixty to eighty dollars per a DH

5058
03:41:10,050 --> 03:41:16,930
Wow with that's all right yeah that is

5059
03:41:15,069 --> 03:41:18,639
that's it's obnoxious but this is

5060
03:41:16,931 --> 03:41:21,609
unfortunately we're dealing with limited

5061
03:41:18,639 --> 03:41:23,289
cly limited suppliers there's also

5062
03:41:21,609 --> 03:41:25,988
already happening what happened up in

5063
03:41:23,290 --> 03:41:28,479
Washington State is happening to some of

5064
03:41:25,988 --> 03:41:30,309
the others suppliers is that they didn't

5065
03:41:28,478 --> 03:41:32,108
order enough stock for when they went

5066
03:41:30,309 --> 03:41:33,278
legal and now they're already running

5067
03:41:32,109 --> 03:41:34,750
out of cannabis and a lot of the

5068
03:41:33,279 --> 03:41:37,210
distributors don't have either the

5069
03:41:34,750 --> 03:41:38,850
licenses yet or the ability to transfer

5070
03:41:37,209 --> 03:41:42,068
so we're still dealing with

5071
03:41:38,850 --> 03:41:45,460
unfortunately the realities of supply

5072
03:41:42,068 --> 03:41:49,930
chain isn't even fully up to snuff yet

5073
03:41:45,459 --> 03:41:51,818
and we have already been inundated under

5074
03:41:49,930 --> 03:41:55,148
prohibition people were basically

5075
03:41:51,818 --> 03:41:58,209
growing under lights that was the

5076
03:41:55,148 --> 03:42:01,539
biggest method and the production costs

5077
03:41:58,209 --> 03:42:04,809
under lights has a certain basic minimum

5078
03:42:01,540 --> 03:42:07,090
it's it's probably like a little 500

5079
03:42:04,809 --> 03:42:10,389
bucks a pound or a thousand or whatever

5080
03:42:07,090 --> 03:42:12,329
whatever the price is I'm not an under

5081
03:42:10,389 --> 03:42:15,369
like grower so I don't know exactly but

5082
03:42:12,329 --> 03:42:18,100
when you grow that in a greenhouse you

5083
03:42:15,370 --> 03:42:20,290
cut the price by three-quarters when you

5084
03:42:18,100 --> 03:42:26,500
grow it outdoors you can cut the price

5085
03:42:20,290 --> 03:42:29,319
by ninety percent again yeah that's

5086
03:42:26,500 --> 03:42:32,199
$10,000 pounds that's just like over the

5087
03:42:29,318 --> 03:42:34,059
top no and that's what over-regulation

5088
03:42:32,199 --> 03:42:35,260
is done but it's gonna have to we have

5089
03:42:34,059 --> 03:42:37,000
to go through these growing pains

5090
03:42:35,260 --> 03:42:38,500
unfortunately to finally get to the

5091
03:42:37,000 --> 03:42:41,609
reality that we're going to because

5092
03:42:38,500 --> 03:42:44,500
again we're dealing with major reaction

5093
03:42:41,609 --> 03:42:48,520
to the state the states can regulate it

5094
03:42:44,500 --> 03:42:53,799
the state of Nevada the state that is

5095
03:42:48,520 --> 03:42:56,380
full of a bunch of wise guys man yeah I

5096
03:42:53,799 --> 03:42:58,719
think the price of herb is gonna go up

5097
03:42:56,379 --> 03:43:01,000
before it goes down you know because I

5098
03:42:58,719 --> 03:43:04,299
think although there's such an abundance

5099
03:43:01,000 --> 03:43:05,620
flood of weed everywhere and you know

5100
03:43:04,299 --> 03:43:07,269
people are growing outdoor having such a

5101
03:43:05,620 --> 03:43:09,310
hard time getting here for like seventy

5102
03:43:07,270 --> 03:43:11,738
thousand dollars a pound right you know

5103
03:43:09,309 --> 03:43:14,309
it's it's you know I think I think it's

5104
03:43:11,738 --> 03:43:17,228
an artificial floor I mean I think it's

5105
03:43:14,309 --> 03:43:18,488
true point well my point my moment I was

5106
03:43:17,228 --> 03:43:19,599
gonna make it's just like although

5107
03:43:18,488 --> 03:43:20,738
there's an abundance of herb on the

5108
03:43:19,600 --> 03:43:22,000
market I think a lot of the big

5109
03:43:20,738 --> 03:43:24,369
manufacturers and producers who are

5110
03:43:22,000 --> 03:43:25,988
sourcing so much trim trying to find

5111
03:43:24,370 --> 03:43:28,449
abundance to trim they're having this

5112
03:43:25,988 --> 03:43:30,969
reality check of like how actually

5113
03:43:28,449 --> 03:43:32,649
there's a crisis of scarcity of clean

5114
03:43:30,969 --> 03:43:34,270
material and so I think I think

5115
03:43:32,649 --> 03:43:36,341
for the clean material the price is

5116
03:43:34,271 --> 03:43:37,841
gonna go up before it goes down well and

5117
03:43:36,341 --> 03:43:39,909
that's one of the reasons why it's also

5118
03:43:37,841 --> 03:43:43,479
so high is because it is tested you know

5119
03:43:39,909 --> 03:43:46,360
and and it we have prices and prices and

5120
03:43:43,479 --> 03:43:48,399
dispensaries are like you say going

5121
03:43:46,360 --> 03:43:50,771
slightly higher or in any constant or

5122
03:43:48,399 --> 03:43:53,079
whatever but wholesale prices in

5123
03:43:50,771 --> 03:43:56,500
California they're a fraction of what

5124
03:43:53,079 --> 03:43:58,479
they were but again that that

5125
03:43:56,500 --> 03:43:59,920
fluctuation will change with the regular

5126
03:43:58,479 --> 03:44:02,649
with the regulations that have been here

5127
03:43:59,920 --> 03:44:04,360
in California oh yeah and you know cuz I

5128
03:44:02,649 --> 03:44:05,979
think you like if you look at Colorado

5129
03:44:04,360 --> 03:44:08,261
the price of trim in so many ways cuz

5130
03:44:05,979 --> 03:44:10,329
it's so hard to find really good quality

5131
03:44:08,261 --> 03:44:12,131
trim you know I mean for really good

5132
03:44:10,329 --> 03:44:14,289
generally be a forty eight hundred bucks

5133
03:44:12,130 --> 03:44:15,850
a pound people have been known to pay

5134
03:44:14,290 --> 03:44:17,080
you know and and you know when you

5135
03:44:15,851 --> 03:44:19,659
consider how what people are selling for

5136
03:44:17,079 --> 03:44:21,550
California how worthless you know or I

5137
03:44:19,659 --> 03:44:22,959
mean or just people yeah it's just

5138
03:44:21,550 --> 03:44:24,970
there's so much abundance of material

5139
03:44:22,959 --> 03:44:26,079
but again you know I think you know just

5140
03:44:24,970 --> 03:44:30,850
working with a lot of really big

5141
03:44:26,079 --> 03:44:33,729
manufactures people who attorneys who

5142
03:44:30,851 --> 03:44:35,471
pays 48 hundred dollars a pound for trim

5143
03:44:33,729 --> 03:44:37,689
I've never heard of such it they don't

5144
03:44:35,470 --> 03:44:41,409
know for not 48 I said four to eight

5145
03:44:37,690 --> 03:44:43,721
hundred pounds 400 even that's quite

5146
03:44:41,409 --> 03:44:45,550
high yes yeah and so I think you know I

5147
03:44:43,720 --> 03:44:49,500
think whenever Bhalla realizing the

5148
03:44:45,550 --> 03:44:53,680
scarcity of clean medicine I think

5149
03:44:49,500 --> 03:45:00,399
indoor market outdoor you'll see it 50

5150
03:44:53,681 --> 03:45:02,021
to 200 all indoor yeah yeah and you know

5151
03:45:00,399 --> 03:45:04,511
but but just in general I think I just

5152
03:45:02,021 --> 03:45:06,131
think you know as as we go into this

5153
03:45:04,511 --> 03:45:08,710
regulated space I just think the value

5154
03:45:06,130 --> 03:45:12,729
of clean herb is gonna spike much more

5155
03:45:08,709 --> 03:45:14,560
you know I because I think I is part of

5156
03:45:12,729 --> 03:45:15,699
my consistent clean unlimited source

5157
03:45:14,560 --> 03:45:16,149
material and I think that's the biggest

5158
03:45:15,700 --> 03:45:19,210
problem

5159
03:45:16,149 --> 03:45:20,319
supply chain stuff that most have you

5160
03:45:19,209 --> 03:45:22,119
could have all the dreams you want but

5161
03:45:20,319 --> 03:45:24,310
if you're if you know once regulations

5162
03:45:22,120 --> 03:45:25,480
kick in it and you're relying on

5163
03:45:24,310 --> 03:45:27,101
hundreds of thousands of pounds of trim

5164
03:45:25,479 --> 03:45:30,520
a month it's like if you don't know any

5165
03:45:27,101 --> 03:45:31,900
dude holding clean weed you're like you

5166
03:45:30,521 --> 03:45:34,989
don't have anything you know you're dead

5167
03:45:31,899 --> 03:45:37,800
in the water okay I got this from my

5168
03:45:34,989 --> 03:45:41,140
guys and in Las Vegas

5169
03:45:37,800 --> 03:45:44,640
$65 pretexts with taxes about seventy

5170
03:45:41,140 --> 03:45:44,640
six eighty six for an eighth

5171
03:45:45,639 --> 03:45:54,560
okay shelf that's all that's top shelf

5172
03:45:51,350 --> 03:45:58,399
that's top shelf so as a percentage that

5173
03:45:54,560 --> 03:46:01,779
15 20 percent it's a sales tax by county

5174
03:45:58,399 --> 03:46:04,670
plus a 10 percent excise tax for

5175
03:46:01,780 --> 03:46:07,070
recreational customers so they play a

5176
03:46:04,670 --> 03:46:10,090
specific tax like and ten percent their

5177
03:46:07,069 --> 03:46:12,829
it will be 15 percent here in California

5178
03:46:10,090 --> 03:46:19,760
same in Colorado I think it's the same

5179
03:46:12,829 --> 03:46:23,030
same system I believe if cannabis is

5180
03:46:19,760 --> 03:46:24,440
legal the taxes don't bother me yeah I

5181
03:46:23,030 --> 03:46:27,170
was gonna say just complaining about

5182
03:46:24,440 --> 03:46:29,780
taxes sure seems less serious than

5183
03:46:27,170 --> 03:46:32,659
complaining about how your house used to

5184
03:46:29,780 --> 03:46:34,340
always be like 20 years ago with the

5185
03:46:32,659 --> 03:46:36,170
joke you know it'll never happen in our

5186
03:46:34,340 --> 03:46:38,149
lifetimes then it would turn to the

5187
03:46:36,170 --> 03:46:39,950
conversation well if they were to tax it

5188
03:46:38,149 --> 03:46:41,869
you know I'm fine with it well now it's

5189
03:46:39,950 --> 03:46:44,420
taxed and this is the reality and this

5190
03:46:41,870 --> 03:46:45,470
is the it's the short-term reality as

5191
03:46:44,420 --> 03:46:48,530
what it is because there will be

5192
03:46:45,469 --> 03:46:50,510
adjustments as things happen but this is

5193
03:46:48,530 --> 03:46:53,600
reality if we got it it's here it is

5194
03:46:50,510 --> 03:46:56,540
this is what is to lower basic

5195
03:46:53,600 --> 03:46:59,870
production costs then an approximate 10

5196
03:46:56,540 --> 03:47:04,610
or 20 percent but it's only costing $100

5197
03:46:59,870 --> 03:47:06,680
a kilo of manicured dry who cares right

5198
03:47:04,610 --> 03:47:08,271
and then it will have to be taken by the

5199
03:47:06,680 --> 03:47:11,210
distributors as well and be all across

5200
03:47:08,271 --> 03:47:12,800
the chain but again this is the still

5201
03:47:11,209 --> 03:47:15,289
growing pains listen they'll still be

5202
03:47:12,799 --> 03:47:17,060
someone when Sam comes out and grows it

5203
03:47:15,290 --> 03:47:18,530
for a hundred dollars a kilo they'll

5204
03:47:17,060 --> 03:47:21,199
still be someone that says listen we

5205
03:47:18,530 --> 03:47:23,000
have to charge three thousand dollars a

5206
03:47:21,200 --> 03:47:25,730
kilo because we have a very large

5207
03:47:23,000 --> 03:47:29,540
overhead and I mean we need to keep our

5208
03:47:25,729 --> 03:47:32,029
head above water here I mean it's hard

5209
03:47:29,540 --> 03:47:34,940
to take the price of herb down because

5210
03:47:32,030 --> 03:47:37,190
truly like first of all there's never

5211
03:47:34,940 --> 03:47:39,230
enough of it like Alec was saying like

5212
03:47:37,190 --> 03:47:41,420
how many companies if all you do is

5213
03:47:39,229 --> 03:47:43,670
extractions or processing if you don't

5214
03:47:41,420 --> 03:47:46,700
have relationships with people who

5215
03:47:43,670 --> 03:47:50,479
actually have a material that is not

5216
03:47:46,700 --> 03:47:54,409
latent with pests diseases pesticides

5217
03:47:50,479 --> 03:47:57,289
all these things then you have nothing

5218
03:47:54,409 --> 03:47:58,340
I figured it out one time 50 square

5219
03:47:57,290 --> 03:48:01,609
miles I think

5220
03:47:58,340 --> 03:48:04,489
maybe even 40 nice well produce all the

5221
03:48:01,609 --> 03:48:07,579
cannabis that is consumed in America for

5222
03:48:04,489 --> 03:48:10,189
a year oh so you weren't even taking

5223
03:48:07,579 --> 03:48:14,750
into account Canada's cannabis thanks

5224
03:48:10,189 --> 03:48:18,020
sample no just just Americans whether

5225
03:48:14,750 --> 03:48:20,090
they were smoking the straight herb or

5226
03:48:18,020 --> 03:48:22,399
whether they were grinding it up and

5227
03:48:20,090 --> 03:48:24,859
making extracts or whether they were

5228
03:48:22,398 --> 03:48:26,869
making dry cept or water hash I was

5229
03:48:24,859 --> 03:48:29,359
looking at the whole picture and I

5230
03:48:26,870 --> 03:48:33,200
figured the consumption was between 40

5231
03:48:29,359 --> 03:48:36,770
and 50 square miles per year Wow what

5232
03:48:33,200 --> 03:48:40,340
year was that about six months ago I

5233
03:48:36,770 --> 03:48:43,040
figured it out based on cannabis

5234
03:48:40,340 --> 03:48:44,000
consumption when though because it's

5235
03:48:43,040 --> 03:48:47,090
grown right

5236
03:48:44,000 --> 03:48:51,439
yeah the present one okay so fine it's a

5237
03:48:47,090 --> 03:48:54,290
hundred square miles just just in case

5238
03:48:51,439 --> 03:48:58,340
it's 50 square miles give or take it's a

5239
03:48:54,290 --> 03:49:00,050
small speck of California agricultural

5240
03:48:58,340 --> 03:49:02,420
property well you know what it makes

5241
03:49:00,049 --> 03:49:04,688
sense Sam because isn't like most of the

5242
03:49:02,420 --> 03:49:07,010
more opium that's grown for the

5243
03:49:04,689 --> 03:49:09,020
pharmaceutical industry grown on like a

5244
03:49:07,010 --> 03:49:12,380
small island like ninety percent of it

5245
03:49:09,020 --> 03:49:19,729
or something well Tasmania grows it's

5246
03:49:12,379 --> 03:49:25,849
actually a GMO opium plant which doesn't

5247
03:49:19,728 --> 03:49:29,148
produce traditional morphine it's got I

5248
03:49:25,850 --> 03:49:31,550
think I forget what the mark probably

5249
03:49:29,148 --> 03:49:34,728
knows what it produces but then they

5250
03:49:31,549 --> 03:49:37,449
convert that to morphine so that junkies

5251
03:49:34,728 --> 03:49:40,670
can't use the flowers themselves

5252
03:49:37,450 --> 03:49:44,030
interesting they just want to create

5253
03:49:40,670 --> 03:49:47,059
like soccer mom junkies not like you

5254
03:49:44,030 --> 03:49:49,609
know junkie junkies well no you have to

5255
03:49:47,059 --> 03:49:51,859
buy pharmaceutical drugs and it's okay

5256
03:49:49,609 --> 03:49:54,050
to be addicted that's what I mean right

5257
03:49:51,859 --> 03:49:55,700
like if you go get your your [ __ ] from

5258
03:49:54,049 --> 03:49:57,590
the pharmacy you're like all right these

5259
03:49:55,700 --> 03:50:00,680
are the junkies we want to create it's

5260
03:49:57,590 --> 03:50:02,569
crazy how they've changed the face of an

5261
03:50:00,680 --> 03:50:05,210
addiction because here in here in

5262
03:50:02,569 --> 03:50:07,100
Vancouver I mean six thousand overdoses

5263
03:50:05,209 --> 03:50:10,639
last year not death six thousand

5264
03:50:07,100 --> 03:50:12,021
overdoses last year in 365 days six

5265
03:50:10,639 --> 03:50:15,140
thousand people overdose

5266
03:50:12,021 --> 03:50:17,961
unlike fentanyl and it's like

5267
03:50:15,140 --> 03:50:20,390
unbelievable and it's unfortunately

5268
03:50:17,960 --> 03:50:24,920
widespread all across the entire United

5269
03:50:20,390 --> 03:50:27,710
States right now yeah it's such a that's

5270
03:50:24,921 --> 03:50:29,360
so evil you know that that's a compound

5271
03:50:27,710 --> 03:50:31,970
that's been able to be creative and

5272
03:50:29,360 --> 03:50:34,730
pharmaceutical eyes because of how much

5273
03:50:31,970 --> 03:50:36,979
more multiple like exponentially more

5274
03:50:34,729 --> 03:50:39,319
addictive and strong it is than morphine

5275
03:50:36,979 --> 03:50:40,970
you know it's like that's why we're

5276
03:50:39,319 --> 03:50:45,261
creating is alternative healing world

5277
03:50:40,970 --> 03:50:47,689
right yeah truly they have newer and of

5278
03:50:45,261 --> 03:50:50,720
the logs which are ten to a hundred

5279
03:50:47,690 --> 03:50:53,060
times more potent than pure fentanyl I

5280
03:50:50,720 --> 03:50:57,020
trust those even less that's carfare

5281
03:50:53,060 --> 03:50:58,851
working brutal brutal [ __ ] unbelievable

5282
03:50:57,021 --> 03:51:01,341
it's serious though I mean when you have

5283
03:50:58,851 --> 03:51:03,440
that many people passing away and not

5284
03:51:01,341 --> 03:51:05,421
just like the you know and for me I

5285
03:51:03,440 --> 03:51:07,280
never see them as undesirables but

5286
03:51:05,421 --> 03:51:09,050
society does they see people who are

5287
03:51:07,280 --> 03:51:10,551
junkies living under bridges it's easy

5288
03:51:09,050 --> 03:51:13,189
for them to say goodbye to those people

5289
03:51:10,550 --> 03:51:16,069
oh they are drug addicts but now with

5290
03:51:13,190 --> 03:51:17,870
oxycodone and fentanyl drug addicts are

5291
03:51:16,069 --> 03:51:19,579
everyday people they're not living under

5292
03:51:17,870 --> 03:51:21,740
bridges anymore they're living in homes

5293
03:51:19,579 --> 03:51:23,690
and they're just like teenage girls and

5294
03:51:21,739 --> 03:51:26,780
boys and they're and they're our

5295
03:51:23,690 --> 03:51:29,421
brothers our sisters our fathers our

5296
03:51:26,780 --> 03:51:31,971
brothers our sisters they always were

5297
03:51:29,421 --> 03:51:34,130
they always were but they were harder

5298
03:51:31,970 --> 03:51:35,800
those homes long they need to sell them

5299
03:51:34,130 --> 03:51:39,109
so they could buy some more fentanyl

5300
03:51:35,800 --> 03:51:40,729
well it's crazy you hear about the

5301
03:51:39,110 --> 03:51:42,739
addiction quality of fentanyl and how

5302
03:51:40,729 --> 03:51:45,350
often they have to hit that every day

5303
03:51:42,739 --> 03:51:47,149
like four or five six times a day or

5304
03:51:45,351 --> 03:51:51,730
they can go through withdrawal four or

5305
03:51:47,149 --> 03:51:55,130
five or six times a day can you imagine

5306
03:51:51,729 --> 03:51:59,180
fentanyl is maybe two that if you take

5307
03:51:55,130 --> 03:52:01,970
the exact same measured dose time after

5308
03:51:59,181 --> 03:52:04,149
time after time one time it just kills

5309
03:52:01,970 --> 03:52:06,470
you it becomes a clue man to Tilburg

5310
03:52:04,149 --> 03:52:06,949
something there's something different

5311
03:52:06,470 --> 03:52:09,979
about it

5312
03:52:06,950 --> 03:52:13,820
heroin doesn't do that if you had the

5313
03:52:09,979 --> 03:52:16,970
exact same measured dose it doesn't kill

5314
03:52:13,819 --> 03:52:18,619
you all of a sudden if in fact heroin

5315
03:52:16,970 --> 03:52:21,619
kind of preserves people

5316
03:52:18,620 --> 03:52:23,211
lookey Keith Richards somebody in the

5317
03:52:21,620 --> 03:52:25,470
chat was saying they lost a friend on

5318
03:52:23,210 --> 03:52:28,929
Friday from an overdose

5319
03:52:25,469 --> 03:52:31,929
Richard looks Haggard by the way he does

5320
03:52:28,930 --> 03:52:37,449
he does he does look Haggard but he's

5321
03:52:31,930 --> 03:52:39,520
alive that was the third best thing he

5322
03:52:37,449 --> 03:52:41,199
said today Alec I don't know why there's

5323
03:52:39,520 --> 03:52:43,779
just been a few key things that a baby

5324
03:52:41,199 --> 03:52:47,130
laughs but Keith Keith Richards looks

5325
03:52:43,779 --> 03:52:50,680
Haggard that was great

5326
03:52:47,129 --> 03:52:54,488
clearly I'm baked anyone else enjoying

5327
03:52:50,680 --> 03:52:56,648
their day big time although you may have

5328
03:52:54,488 --> 03:52:59,260
noticed I was a little bit late that's

5329
03:52:56,648 --> 03:53:01,930
because I was asleep until my wife came

5330
03:52:59,260 --> 03:53:03,789
and woke me up I know I was it was funny

5331
03:53:01,930 --> 03:53:05,350
cuz people like Sam not coming into

5332
03:53:03,789 --> 03:53:06,880
church I'm like no what do you mean of

5333
03:53:05,350 --> 03:53:08,470
course Sam's coming into Church and then

5334
03:53:06,879 --> 03:53:10,148
like a half an hour went by I was like I

5335
03:53:08,469 --> 03:53:13,358
think Sam's coming into church and then

5336
03:53:10,148 --> 03:53:16,148
it was like 45 minutes so yes I will

5337
03:53:13,359 --> 03:53:18,670
admit I sent your wife a message hey

5338
03:53:16,148 --> 03:53:21,368
what's going on we're looking forward to

5339
03:53:18,670 --> 03:53:23,228
Sam on church she wasn't home either

5340
03:53:21,369 --> 03:53:25,659
which is part of the reason why I was

5341
03:53:23,228 --> 03:53:28,889
sleeping she was off at the beach but

5342
03:53:25,658 --> 03:53:32,049
having fun with our granddaughter and

5343
03:53:28,889 --> 03:53:34,358
having a good time at the beach and she

5344
03:53:32,049 --> 03:53:38,738
came back hashed heard she'd been on for

5345
03:53:34,359 --> 03:53:39,309
an hour and I was asleep well we're glad

5346
03:53:38,738 --> 03:53:41,859

5349
03:53:43,539 --> 03:53:49,569
being said in the hour that I felt was

5350
03:53:45,578 --> 03:53:51,818
pertinent to your being here so I'm glad

5351
