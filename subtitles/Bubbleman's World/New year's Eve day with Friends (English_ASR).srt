RFD

100
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,160
boom little click mine just turn

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,759
green it's not

102
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,478
ideal so if that child goes missing well

103
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,000
exactly they usually keep them pretty

104
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,399
pretty close and whatnot but still it's

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,120
you want to keep those on the on the

106
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:29,758
child so like what'll happen is it'll be

107
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,959
monitored by the computer and it'll

108
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,759
start beeping when it's not moving from

109
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,159
the group and then they'll they'll radio

110
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,000
to him and say one of your kids so

111
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,360

227
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:51,078
day on Whistler Mountain what did you

228
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,078

fun up here this is some world class

231
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,120
[ __ ] when you come to Whistler one of

232
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,958
the things you'll notice really fast is

233
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,839
that it's a world class class resort and

234
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,799
if you think you can ski you probably

235
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,320
can't you probably can't so we figured

236
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,439
we'd have a little Trippy Stick session

237
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,199

240
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,879
puffing too much for you guys so we

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,958
figured we get the Trippy Stick out here

242
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:18,480
