hey everybody Welcome to the Cannabis

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:09,839
Journal Club just to guys give you guys

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,239
a little breakdown uh cannabis Journal

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,240
Club is where we review and interpret

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,160
United States cannabis patents and

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,920
scientific journals with concise

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,079
overviews of complex scientific

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,039
literature in an understandable and easy

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:25,518
to consume manner to expose the

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,640
knowledge hidden in this scientific

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:31,239
literature we do not claim any medical

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,159
utility and of these government patents

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,039
or scientific articles what we advise

14
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:38,319
you to do is to obtain your own copies

15
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:41,320
uh of these uh public uh documents and

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,238
we will often have them um Linked In the

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,280
description of each show that you're

18
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,799

35
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:34,879
about a a another patent so please share

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,040
with us the number and what this patent

37
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,640
is uh is is going to be about today all

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,960
right thank you so right to the

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,560
point um there's two US

40
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:50,879
patents uh for cannabis and diabetes

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,478
they're both labeled the same name

42
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:57,000
treating or preventing diabetes with

43
00:01:53,478 --> 00:02:01,039
cannab dial the first patent number is 8

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,680
comma 071 comma 641

45
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,680
the second uh patent is named the same

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:12,560
treating or preventing diabetes with

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:15,000
canabidol and it's patent number US

48
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,479
2000700

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,878
99987 A1 that came out in 2005 the first

50
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:24,318
one came out in

51
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:26,919
2011 and

52
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,919
um I don't know why they're both named

53
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:33,559
the same I think it's because uh B

54
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,719
basically we're reviewing uh two lab

55
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,759
animal

56
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,959
experiments and a human study with it

57
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,000
with this

58
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,000
uh with this

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,158
uh uh chapter of

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,680
uh cannabis uh Journal club and

61
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:59,239
so uh both of these patterns are by are

62
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:04,319
authored by Professor Dr Raphael mulam

63
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:07,799
and are out of of the uh University of

64
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:11,039
Jerusalem and um it's interesting that

65
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:14,480
they would have two pattern on cannabis

66
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:17,840
treating diabetes and they used the word

67
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:21,959
preventing which they kind of prove but

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,360
it also kind of alludes to a cure to

69
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,479
diabetes and so you'll have to read this

70
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,239
yourself to come up to that

71
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:32,959
conclusion um so they mentioned that in

72
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,120
these pattern that diabetes is the most

73
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,840
prevalent endocrine disease worldwide

74
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,680
and the mortality

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,680
morbidity uh associated with this is

76
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,680
unbelievable uh because a lot of people

77
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,599
go blind a lot of people have

78
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,200
amputations a lot of people have to go

79
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:53,839
on renal dialysis because of diabetes

80
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,318
massive cost to the health system and

81
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,878
the cost is

82
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,679
unbelievable uh and so if if we could

83
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:04,639
give you something that would help your

84
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:08,040
diabetes or help you help prevent you to

85
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:11,119
develop diabetes then uh We've helped a

86
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,400
lot of people so the complications to

87
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,199
diabetes include a bunch of

88
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:20,239
stuff um blindness heart attack Strokes

89
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,800
kidney failure

90
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,959
amputations uh and these people uh that

91
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,918
have to go on dialysis they have to have

92
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:31,279
multiple surgical procedures for Venus

93
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,439
access so they can can uh put them on

94
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,239
dialysis machines and then there's

95
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:39,439
paranal dialysis too so there's a lot of

96
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,600
surgical procedures if we can opening

97
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,719
them up to susceptibility of infection

98
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,919
too I'm guessing

99
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,240
absolutely so

100
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:53,079
um uh so the two experiments they did

101
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:58,439
was the first one was they were trying

102
00:04:53,079 --> 00:05:00,439
to do uh transplants of uh the beta

103
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,879
cells of the pancreas the beta cells are

104
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,160
the ones that produce the insulin and

105
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,439
they noticed when they did transplants

106
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,439
that the immune system attacked the

107
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:14,959
transplants and it killed all the beta

108
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:16,959
cells and so they they studied uh uh

109
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,638
these transplants and they found out

110
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:23,000
that if

111
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:27,199
they uh gave the patients cannabis or

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,720
CBD that the transplant cells survived

113
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:34,240
if they didn't give CBD then Almost 100%

114
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:39,039
of them would be dead and if they did do

115
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:42,639
give them CBD about 87% of the cells

116
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,800
survived and so this is a

117
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,280
remarkable uh

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,319
finding and the second uh animal study

119
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:55,679
they did was they used these uh

120
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:59,319
specially uh raised mice they're called

121
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,000
mod mice and this is a strain of mice

122
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:04,919
that develop diabetes within the first

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,759
month or so of life and so they're

124
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,959
excellent animal model for studying

125
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,160
diabetes and

126
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:20,519
uh so in the in the

127
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:24,039
mice um they found out that

128
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,680
uh that uh they it delayed the

129
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:28,519
development of

130
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,959
diabetes and they have have a whole lot

131
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:35,279
of evidence and these pads are extremely

132
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:39,359
long one of the pads is like 50 pages so

133
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:43,399
it's a strain to go through this and so

134
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,439
we read this stuff so you don't have to

135
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,839
so yeahh we're getting that's really

136
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,918
powerful that's really powerful I mean

137
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:55,560
it's saying that 100% of untreated mod

138
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:58,399
mice develop diabetes and only 53% of

139
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,360
mice treated with CBD develop diabetes

140
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:04,519
that is insane that's like half the mice

141
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,319
didn't develop diabetes and so this is a

142
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:11,159
mouse breed to to that's develops

143
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,039
diabetes and if you could decrease the

144
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,039
the incidence of Diabetes by 53% in this

145
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,399
mouse

146
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:21,000
group um and this is just preliminary

147
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:24,519
stuff they really have not done this on

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,720
humans there is a human study uh called

149
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:32,120
to It's called The N haanes NH H NES and

150
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,199
it has a Roman numeral three behind it

151
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:39,160
so it enhs three and this is a human

152
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,879
study where they found that uh people

153
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,720
that were using

154
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:48,520
cannabis uh had a

155
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,280
66% decrease in the incidence of

156
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:53,359
diabetes than people that weren't using

157
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,519
cannabis so that's a human

158
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,240
study and

159
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:01,399
um

160
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,319
so uh they found that the lowest glucose

161
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:06,239
levels were found in the group of people

162
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,479
that had the highest prevalence of

163
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,240
marijuana

164
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:14,519
use and and nonusers had two to four

165
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:20,478
times more likely to develop diabetes as

166
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:24,639
marijuana users wow and uh this you the

167
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:29,959
use of of CBD had no was not associated

168
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,759
with any other diseases like uh

169
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,718
it didn't cause any heart failure or any

170
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:38,399
other trouble so it's safe to use in

171
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:44,760
large doses and even given chronically

172
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:48,639
so uh this is not hard evidence that

173
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:50,559
CBD stops all diabetes but it's it's

174
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,319
kind of a bunch of

175
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:57,000
indications that uh it can have a major

176
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,160
effect and more human studies will will

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,039
be done in the future I'm sure but since

178
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,360
CBD is so

179
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:08,360
safe and you can't hurt yourself by

180
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:13,639
taking CBD according to the science that

181
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:15,200
we know so far and so if you if you

182
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:19,000
think that

183
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,519
you have diabetes or getting to be where

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,958
your sugar's higher it would I would

185
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:31,600
definitely put CBD in my diet and um so

186
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:35,278
none of these studies are what happens

187
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,399
when you eat cannabis or eat hemp so

188
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:42,480
hemp may actually be a better medicine

189
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,440
than marijuana in a bunch of different

190
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,120
uh disease States and we don't know

191
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,000
which state is which uh it actually

192
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,480
seems that Tac and CBD work in

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,679
conjunction with each other and uh most

194
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,399
diseases are are helped with a

195
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:04,239
combination of these two products right

196
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:07,399
other than uh isolates but since uh CBD

197
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,919
doesn't get you high and you can take uh

198
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:13,320
a boatload of it and not hurt yourself

199
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:16,360
then uh really the government should be

200
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:21,879
doing studies on what is the incidence

201
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:25,159
of diabetes when you eat cannabis or eat

202
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:27,838
hemp and so that will be done in the

203
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:30,879
future and uh

204
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,560
so we're trying trying to give people

205
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,600
evidence that they can show their

206
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:39,359
doctors because if you ask your doctor

207
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:45,800
do you know about the two US

208
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:48,560
patents on cannabis or or CBD and and

209
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:51,120
diabetes they won't have any idea that

210
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,559
this even exist so you'll have more

211
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,519
information than your physician does

212
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:58,278
because they don't teach this in medical

213
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,959
school um and I know that because I did

214
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:04,320
the study it's called ignorance is not

215
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:07,559
Bliss it's in cannabis digest and we

216
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,680
called my office called 157 medical

217
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:13,000
schools and we asked them if they're

218
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:15,599
teaching the science and only 133% of

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,399
the medical schools even mentioned this

220
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,000
science and nobody has organized courses

221
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,200
and so it's very likely if you're a

222
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,839
student of cannabis that you may know

223
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:31,639
more medical science about this than

224
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,839
your Physicians and your heart surgeon

225
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,399
so well there's there's always this

226
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,560
protective component and and definitely

227
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,120
big shout out to uh you know Raphael

228
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,638
mulam uh I was going to put my picture

229
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,320
up with him when we originally mentioned

230
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,000
him so I'll put my picture up here here

231
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,399
I am at the icrs in Liden Holland

232
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,759
meeting meeting the the the man himself

233
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,120
and for those of you that don't know

234
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:57,799
about rafhael Mich mulam you can go down

235
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,720
that Rabbid ho very very cool but even

236
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,879
at the end of his study in conclusion

237
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,600
they said marijuana use was associated

238
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,200
with a decreased prevalence of diabetes

239
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,680
prospective studies on humans and

240
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,440
animals need to be clean to need to be

241
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,519
completed and they do not recommend the

242
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,440
use of marijuana for patients at risk

243
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,278
for diabetes they just did this study

244
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,120
that showed you could reduce it by 53%

245
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:25,120
in mice that were bred to get diabetes

246
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,919
yeah they're afraid to say that oh my

247
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,440
God and and God bless them they have to

248
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:32,439
be I get that but this is what Dr Alan

249
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,399
and I are trying to get past this this

250
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,320
confusion and this can you imagine

251
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,320
reading this patent and going through it

252
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,720
and then at the end coming and saying

253
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,120
they don't recommend me doing this it's

254
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,920
like but the patent said that it reduced

255
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,120
the and and I don't think people can

256
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,759
wrap their heads around of the

257
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,639
importance of these mice that were bred

258
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:57,399
to get diabetes are way more susceptable

259
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,278
than the human race grp population

260
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,000
getting diabetes some are more

261
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,639
susceptible some are less susceptible

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,480
but it's not like every human being gets

263
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,680
diabetes within a month of being born so

264
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,920
you got to think that that is a that

265
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:14,638
that number of 47% that didn't get it

266
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,799
must have been it it would be way higher

267
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,159
in mice that weren't bred to get

268
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:23,399
diabetes and if you guys don't know

269
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:26,958
about Dr mulam you should definitely

270
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:32,120
learn about him I believe he should be

271
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:35,518
put forth for a saint Ood because of his

272
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,519
work St

273
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:42,958
mulam certainly was like a saint when I

274
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:44,679
met him just the kindest kindest man uh

275
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,439
God he must have been 90s something

276
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:50,479
years old there when I when I met him so

277
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,759
really cool uh great breakdown on that

278
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,839
patent I'm sure we'll have a Q&amp;A

279
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,320
potentially towards the end of the week

280
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,759
where if you guys and I'm sure listen

281
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,759
brain tumor

282
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,680
and uh you know some of the other stuff

283
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,278
we've covered

284
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,879
antioxidants this diabetes one is a big

285
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:11,958
one an enormous amount of people suffer

286
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,198
from or know loved ones and close family

287
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:16,278
members who suffer from type 1 and two

288
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:18,120
diabetes this is very interesting

289
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:20,679
information I don't need a doctor to

290
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,360
tell me that I consume cannabis orally

291
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:25,679
every day I do that for the preventative

292
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,680
aspects that I don't even really know

293
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:32,078
100% scientifically what they are but I

294
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:34,958
know if cannabis is a part of this

295
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,599
endocannabinoid cannaboid signaling

296
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:41,239
system it's it's it's got to be

297
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,240
preventative as much as it is

298
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,839
medicinal all right well thank you very

299
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,879
much for having us today and we hope

300
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:55,040
that people can use this information for

301
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,600
their families so I recommend putting

302
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,439
cannabis in your

303
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,800
diet I also recommend that I'm not a

304
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,560
doctor but I have played one on TV isn't

305
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,599
that what Marcus uh what's his name used

306
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,479
to say I'm I'm not a doctor but I play

307
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,680
one on TV anyway we'll finish it with a

308
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,000
budley green quote and budley green says

309
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,559
herb is superb so thanks a lot for

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,639
watching the Cannabis Journal Club

311
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,399
thanks to Dr Allen for sharing his

312
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,240
knowledge as always and uh we'll see you
