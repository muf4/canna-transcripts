00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:24,179
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,060
been a while since I posted a video

4
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:30,198
actually but today I had to post one

5
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:33,799
because this is the last day before

6
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:37,289
Canada legalizes cannabis recreationally

7
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:39,328
now a lot of you may know that I have

8
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:43,469
had a MMA hour license a federal

9
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:46,950
exemption from the government since 2011

10
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:50,250
2012 sorry I'm out of breath I just

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,289
literally ran up from my truck need to

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,789
catch my breath

13
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:55,530
and also pretty excited about this I

14
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,300
know a lot of people are still you know

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,710
calling it prohibition 2.0 they're

16
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:00,709
they're bashing on it they're saying

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,640
that all the laws are worse they're

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,290
absolutely not happy with the way things

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,840
are playing out at all I on the other

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,560
hand see this as a great step forward

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,118
more access for people obviously we

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,560
still have to fight for dispensaries and

23
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:15,329
we still have to fight for different

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,990
products like edibles and concentrates

25
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:20,489
but this is pretty big news in Canada

26
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:22,649
legalization up to 4 plants everyone in

27
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,298
the country can grow we're allowed to

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,100
carry 30 grams we're allowed to smoke

29
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,680
outside the airport we're a lot of smoke

30
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,239
at campgrounds and any public place

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,759
where you can smoke cigarettes we're

32
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,469
allowed to smoke it's a pretty big deal

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,118
from someone like myself who for 30

34
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,819
years has been fighting the prohibition

35
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,290
machine and you know watching a lot of

36
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,599
my friends get arrested and having their

37
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,280
lives ruined myself included having

38
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,649
having been arrested and having gone

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,368
through the court systems and it's just

40
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,969
a huge huge relief to seeing it come to

41
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:55,140
fruition

42
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:56,968
tonight at 12:01 a.m. it's October 16th

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,728
right now and I'm actually gonna be

44
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:02,548

45
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:04,349
pachu pachu party they've got like a

46
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,159
couple of special guests I think one is

47
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:10,758
Tommy Chong and the other is the actor

48
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,530

66
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:54,469
next 15 minutes or so and it may be

67
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,439
jumping on a float plane from downtown

68

Vancouver and we're gonna be flying into

69
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,489
downtown Victoria in which case I'll

70
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:04,280
jump in a cabin and head over to the

71
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:05,539
house after that but super excited

72
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,199
figured I might as well take a quick dab

73
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:09,560

76
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,969
dance hall almost identical to Juanita

78
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:27,979

79
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:29,419
orange e very delicious and why don't we

80
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:33,409

81
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:35,150

83
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,919
what it is 12 13 14 more hours before

84
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,989
we're out of that sort of Prohibition

85
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,250
mentality that's plagued Canada for at

86
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:46,569
least the last hundred years

87
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,568
pretty exciting times

88
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,260
so I do a 20 second heat up on my quartz

89
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,560
and a 50 second cooldown for those of

90
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:56,560
you wondering

91
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,189

92
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,379
minute for this particular cooldown so

93
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:12,969
yeah it's exciting I'm looking forward

94
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:14,109

95
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:15,729

Cheech

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,339
[Applause]

417
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:42,059
I've been teaching Vancouver because he

418
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:48,179
was up hiding from the war in Vietnam so

419
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:50,549
Canada means a lot to me it doesn't give

420
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:55,880
me my attitude that got me where I am

421
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:55,879
today because if it wasn't for we

422
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:07,349
[Music]

423
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:07,348
[Applause]

424
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:11,150
[Music]

425
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:21,528
the Vietnam War

426
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:24,798
candidate took him in he became almost a

427
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:26,869
landed immigrant in Canada but then when

428
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:29,298
we got together and I found out that we

429
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:31,369
could be funny there was only one place

430
00:34:29,298 --> 00:34:32,469
we had to go was down the states to make

431
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:35,450
it

432
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:40,668
and so Cheech was the first Mexican to

433
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:43,460
sneak into the States from Canada and

434
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:47,179
he'd be here today but he's hiding from

435
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:50,168
Donald Trump because Chuck wants to

436
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:50,168
deport his ass

437
00:34:53,690 --> 00:35:04,170
while we were down there being Canadian

438
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:08,309
really helped me with my career because

439
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:10,769
no matter what we did down there it was

440
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:15,900
nothing compared to working up in this

441
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:18,300
[ __ ] I had the worst jobs you

442
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,910
could possibly have because I dropped

443
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,430
out of school soon as I smoked my first

444
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:29,819
joint I said [ __ ] this I haven't done

445
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:33,358
those school I became a roofer I became

446
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:36,329
a truck driver I've dug ditches for the

447
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,759
telephone company I had all the [ __ ]

448
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:41,519
jobs that you could possibly imagine and

449
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:45,000
so when I went down and find out that we

450
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:50,750
can make a buck being funny and smoking

451
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,750
weed and getting paid

452
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,929
that's what we did again

453
00:35:55,429 --> 00:36:04,338
[Applause]

454
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:07,539
the Canadian it was a Canadian attitude

455
00:36:04,338 --> 00:36:10,940
that got me right where I am today

456
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:13,039
because of the beat I couldn't do the

457
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,730
interviews all day today because of the

458
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:20,019
weed and they wanted to know you know

459
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:20,019
what my favorite screen is

460
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:30,579
I'm still looking for and then they

461
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:35,278
always say the read today's a lot later

462
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:38,920
than it was back then and I say no you

463
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:48,130
know back then and today is the same

464
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:51,019
thing only bad we is no way because you

465
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:53,510
don't have to smoke

466
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:58,460
it's all in your mind it affects the

467
00:36:53,510 --> 00:37:01,430
brain and when I was in jail I never

468
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:03,230
smoked a joint I never touched it but

469
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:06,919
I've got high every night just thinking

470
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:10,519
about it because it does affects the

471
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,340
brain the Johnson for a week and you

472
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:15,019
don't have it just get quiet and

473
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:19,039
remember what it was like when you were

474
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:21,980
high and you go get that contact I it'll

475
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:27,739
come back to you it does to me all the

476
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:31,429
time anyway okay on the way here I try

477
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:34,579
to think of something special because of

478
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:38,419
the legalization so I started reading

479
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:41,059
this song I just got the last part of

480
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:44,510
