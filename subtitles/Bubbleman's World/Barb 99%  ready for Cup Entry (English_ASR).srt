7
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:34,640
ceramic insert that is not ceramic at

8

o but it

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,280
is sapphire so the boys at denil have

11
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,200
created a sapphire insert it's different

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,679
from ceramic no doubt it almost feels

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,440
like a thin composite plastic or

14
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,878
something he so we're about

15
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:55,479
