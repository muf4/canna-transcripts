00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,560
crushed opal ball

20
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,319
exosphere it is definitely completely

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,799
once again I don't think I've been this

22
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:17,199
blown away since you brought over the

23
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:21,079
Marcel Fab egg this also has that level

for whatever reason it's it it has

29
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,399
definitely opened my eyes back up to

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,240
after seeing so many strains just not

31
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,320
produce melty resin the watermelon the

32
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,158
astroboy and and a lot of TGA strains

33
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,398
are definitely full melt certified I'll

34
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,040
be uh this is

35
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,840
um well the best that I've seen yeah

36
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,560
it's definitely like a 9 point something

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,118
you know on the on the level of of

38
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,159
bubble has have you hit it yet Morgan I

39
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,519

we should definitely do it again we

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,960
should do it again well we're going to

43
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,438
do it again we're going to uh we're

44
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,758
going to hit this mother ship and I

45
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,959
guess really the only thing I need to do

46
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,919
we got our yeah we're rocking on the Dil

47
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,400
so that's good this is a little trick I

48
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:23,479
learned back in the days of

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,840
old on well you know what staring at you

50
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,799
have to see how these Opals are

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,280
suspended in this glass it's it's really

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
it's I've taken some photos and I'll

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,159
will insert them into the video amazing

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,680
so while you're staring at those he

55
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,840
didn't really be able to see what was

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,800
there and with the sun reflection right

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,400
he's been hitting bows already off

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,719

103
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,960
catches the Opals just at this angle

104
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:58,038
when I pulled back every opal in here

105
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,319
went red really I I leaned over a tiny

106
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:01,918
little bit and now they're all green

107
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,038
you know you move another little angle

108
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,639
and you see more Blues but like yeah

109
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,719
right over here at this angle from the

110
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,879
Sun coming down

111
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,360
red I'm seen nice Blues just amazing

112
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,319
colors on this one here I'm amazed at

113
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,879
the level of perfection that they've

114
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:20,599
acquired from the distance of glass that

115
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:23,199
is encased around the opal is almost

116
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,639
they're all just perfect it's that's

117
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:30,120
what I was memor and

118
