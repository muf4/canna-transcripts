just one week after our three-year

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,040

panelists and we'll see how that goes

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:33,420

16
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:44,819
headphones in as I'm probably gonna be

17
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:48,179
causing some some sort of a feedback

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,070
loop as I always do let's just make sure

19
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,128
that I'm getting the right links out to

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:57,149
everyone so that they all have the right

21
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:58,710

oh I'm sorry burn it I was in New

27
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:19,079
Orleans so it was impossible to really

28
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:21,889
do anything it was a nice it was a nice

29
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:25,728
three years so congratulations though

30
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:29,489

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,890
right what temp was that president I was

38
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,290
pressed around 200 degrees on the

39
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:59,849
Sasquatch m1 Wow very nice squish oh

40
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,590
yeah what temp to 200 degrees justjust

41
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,599
just around 200 degrees I remember it

42
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,359
was a little bit higher and we we

43
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:10,098
dropped the temp but yeah it did a you

44
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:12,568
know that dueled butter and also a nice

45
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:13,500
drip there as well I took some macro

46
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:16,829
photographs early

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,699
so I figured it might be the way to go

48
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:24,150
about it

49
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:26,459
sweet well I got my bubble man vaporizer

50
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,650
fortunately before my trip and was able

51
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,770
to use it on my trip which was very

52
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,530
helpful so kudos on your latest

53
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,240
accomplishment needless to say yeah dude

54
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,830
I'm glad that you got one that put a

55
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,650
smile on my face to see that you had

56
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,060
when I saw that forest forest also

57
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,879
posted one the other day I'm like right

58
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,310
on Tony stop he's getting them out to

59
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,819
all the right people you know yeah yeah

60
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,599
yeah

61
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,639
it's I was impressed there's I was also

62
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,889
able because I I ran out a little bit on

63
00:02:53,639 --> 00:03:00,089
my trip so I was able to put my own wax

64
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:02,819
in there so yeah yeah yeah yeah as

65
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,620
opposed to the rosin so I had a little

66
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:10,079
little learning curve with that because

67
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,239
the BHO when it's heated tends to expand

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,730
so you have to make sure that the the

69
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,849
lids on it etc etc so when I finally did

70
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:18,389
it cooked down but it definitely it

71
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:21,479
worked

72
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:24,479
alright so this is for Ontario he's

73
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,819
asking me to show dry sifting bubble so

74
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,039
here you go on Terry oh there you go

75
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:32,189
three different grades of dry sift

76
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:35,459
separated out from one full melt bubble

77
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:38,419
hash in the bottom of the jar and we'll

78
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,489
be looking forward to Ontario hashish

79
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:43,349
posting his dry sifting bubble that he's

80
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,140
going to be showing us in the Facebook

81
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,739
room later today we'll look forward to

82
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,949
seeing that

83
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,599
masya Ontario hashish and in the

84
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:53,939
meantime why don't we smoke some hashish

85
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,849
well now that we're doing picture time

86
00:03:53,939 --> 00:04:00,090
and sharing I think it is already like

87
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:02,879
five bowls in and I'm I need to join the

88
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,319
party and get in here buddy and I don't

89
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,259
know what's going on with the rest of

90
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:12,359
our crew maybe today it's you and I say

91
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:13,769
let me say hey I'm happy dude up I'll do

92
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,850
a whole house Church with you today I

93
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:19,079
tend not a problem no it's not like we

94
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,870
don't have anything to talk

95
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,629
[Laughter]

96
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:27,000
between between you and me I think that

97
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:28,819
we'll probably be able to find enough to

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,168
discuss

99
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:32,819
needless to say yeah a lot of things are

100
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:35,549
happening here in California the new

101
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:39,478
regulations still kind of digesting

102
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:42,740
those but the governor signed the a B

103
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,909
133 the other day which allows for

104
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,478
collocations amongst other things

105
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:52,590
it's kind of an emergency situation that

106
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:54,000
is transpired because the it's not like

107
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,668
the state of California was dragging its

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,370
feet it's just that time is getting away

109
00:04:56,668 --> 00:05:02,310
from them in that January first they

110
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,590
want to be able to issue permits so ona

111
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,720
goodies are still racing to get people

112
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:08,339
into their systems and local people are

113
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,410
trying to get into their local systems

114
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:13,379
or get their local municipalities to

115
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,930
change laws so we're still in that

116
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,909
neophyte phase as opposed to watching

117
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,668
all the exciting things happening up in

118
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,919
Canada where it's still so draconian and

119
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:26,639
still in the individual state status as

120
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:28,859
opposed to the inter province love that

121
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,418
you guys have well but we got a

122
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,098
nightmare of a scene in a way too

123
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,319
because there's this major major

124
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:36,959
division that still occurs in our

125
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,879
federal and in our non federal system so

126
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,560
you know once they figure it out and

127
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,089
offer us everything we need because

128
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,800
obviously they're not offering us

129
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:48,029
everything we need therefore we have to

130
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,800
continue with civil disobedience if

131
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:51,119
they're not going to allow you know all

132
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,400
the extracts and all these different

133
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,930
things then people are forced to you

134
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,728
know produce them and sell them through

135
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,740
dispensaries and other means so that's

136
00:05:56,728 --> 00:06:01,199
what Canada's continuing to do and

137
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,329
hopefully they'll figure out at one

138
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,330
point how to get rid of this sort of

139
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:09,209
prohibition problem in regards to trying

140
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:11,698
to pass it over to a legal system it's

141
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:14,370
going to be interesting to see yeah here

142
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:17,610
in California we've we very fortunately

143
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:20,009
have Lori Ajax who's the former head of

144
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:23,280
the alcohol Control Board she's the one

145
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:25,650
that's been a sign or the initial for

146
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,538
the marijuana control and okay very

147
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:29,158
fortunate that they've been holding

148
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:31,949
meetings all over the state and that

149
00:06:29,158 --> 00:06:32,968
they are open and listening to us so we

150
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,420
have fortunately we don't have to

151
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:37,290
approach

152
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,850
at the moment we have to actually again

153
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,590
out see that everything that we get you

154
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:44,070
know there's still the issue of the

155
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:48,239
hundred milligram limit on edibles and

156
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:51,569
things like that which the our edibles

157
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,800
allowed by the the federal government

158
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,839
there in Canada are you allowed to

159
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,850
produce edibles or is it just like

160
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:00,029
flowers and extracts you're allowed to

161
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,070
produce well it for my own personal I

162
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:03,929
can I can produce every type of extract

163
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:06,349
that's from the MMAR that's from the

164
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:12,660
court case that Owen Smith went through

165
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:14,310
but yeah yeah Michael's not seeing the

166
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,170
panel today not sure oh well because

167
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:19,500
there is no panel today right now it's

168
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:21,330
it's myself and and it's yeah that's all

169
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,439
that's all there is we are the panel

170
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:27,959
today we are cooking it up early have

171
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,759
your vaporizers ready you know I haven't

172
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,519
even hit a DAB so if you have something

173
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:36,300
to say let me mute my mic and heat this

174
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:39,180
court there you go nice got the banger

175
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:43,110
that fits and oh that's the adapter that

176
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,449
fits in very nice very nice I like that

177
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,610
makes them many so much better but

178
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:51,769
California is you know we're really

179
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:55,110
pushing for proper regulations and

180
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:57,750
pesticide testing which of course is we

181
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:02,610
just had a major release by another one

182
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:04,050
by steep hill saying that uh over 90% of

183
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,009
the clones on the market are

184
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:11,069
contaminated which is well it shows that

185
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:13,050
the market needs for somebody who's

186
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,149
watching you know their need to get on

187
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,720
their game and start producing and get

188
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:21,329
in the you know mother and clone game

189
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,570
because genetics are needed and it's a

190
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:26,819
major issue if you're perpetuating a

191
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:29,159
problem and selling clones to people I

192
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:31,079
mean I'm doing it right now because the

193
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,790
suppliers that I have I thought were

194
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,870
clean but it turns out that you know

195
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:38,579
that's not necessarily always the case

196
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,409
and one of the difficult things about

197
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,590
not being vertically integrated because

198
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:46,709
my city hasn't allowed for that vertical

199
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,470
integration yet so by not having a clean

200
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:51,139
supply of clones or

201
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,629
clean genetics to start with as we've

202
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:56,059
talked about multiple time it's you're

203
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:58,580
basically giving people a problem to

204
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:59,929
start without the door and it's only a

205
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,420
problem that they're going to find

206
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:03,649
because we found that these wonderful

207
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:05,360
and growing environments that we

208
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:07,490
recreate insides or the perfect

209
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,409
environments for nature to thrive and

210
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,789
nature will find its way in different

211
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:16,579
ways so you know starting off with an

212
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:17,959
automatic contaminant be it something in

213
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:22,280
the roots or something like white

214
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:24,710
powdery mildew etc you've already behind

215
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,019
the ball because as soon as you grow it

216
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:29,990
the problem is going to show itself and

217
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:31,639
you're going to think that it was your

218
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,129
problem or something that you did in

219
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:36,860
your room or your environment that may

220
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:38,450
have caused it but in reality it's

221
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,610
starting off with the plant that you're

222
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,110
bringing in and the perfect growing

223
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,759
environment that you're setting for the

224
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:49,039
plant you're creating those perfect

225
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:50,509
conditions unfortunately to host and you

226
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,009
know deal with those situations so I

227
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:54,409
know Sam has talked about in the past

228
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:56,539
you know when ways to get around this is

229
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:58,159
to get solid genetics that are seeds and

230
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:03,139
start from there if you're unable to

231
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:06,139
find but I would strongly suggest use

232
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:09,019
varieties which are resistant to powdery

233
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:13,029
mildew or whatever the specific problem

234
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:16,850
is that you have you'll find you know a

235
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:19,220
difference in resistance between a

236
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,940
Coryell varieties and widely varieties

237
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:25,009
to powdery mildew for example and it

238
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,560
literally is what you start with can can

239
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:29,419
affect so it's and the ways that we have

240
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:33,199
found this our lakes myself I've grown

241
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:35,389
little areas with starter plants and

242
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,520
then to see which ones get white powdery

243
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:39,259
mildew or not because of it's very

244
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,029
prevalent here in the Bay Area so it's

245
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:44,360
easier to get white powdery mildew than

246
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:47,149
most things and so you can actually

247
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,009
start to see through and pull out those

248
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:50,120
plants that are just up to the white

249
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:53,149
powdery mildew and as you will see

250
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,120
plants or you know equatorial tend to be

251
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,590
at that natural defense so that you can

252
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,240
literally see a plant that's covered in

253
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,680
white powdery mildew right next to

254
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,460
another plant that has white powdery

255
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:03,259
mildew and so

256
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,150
but that doesn't have it so that's how

257
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:07,730
we go through that type of selection if

258
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:10,309
you don't have access to a good seed

259
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:13,519
stock or a geneticist who's knows that

260
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:18,279
this in fact is a what it says it's too

261
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:21,169
because most of the real problem is that

262
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:24,019
in anything with wide leaf drug

263
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:26,719
varieties genetics in it from

264
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:30,289
Afghanistan the Hindukush that general

265
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,420
area there have no natural resistance

266
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:34,819
for powdery mildew because the

267
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:39,229
conditions are not conducive to powdery

268
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:42,230
mildew whereas ecuator ids they had to

269
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,909
have resistance right and so it's been

270
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:47,529
biologically built into the plant

271
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:51,079
through yeah they're the ones that

272
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:52,850
reproduced and the problem is is that

273
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,820
the most popular strains like your

274
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:59,090
cookies and your og cush is and things

275
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,500
like that are tend to be from the upper

276
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,330
mountain regions and tend to be widely

277
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,690
varieties and highly susceptible to

278
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,730
white powdery mildew and that's a issue

279
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,650
because that's that's kind of come from

280
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,680
the consumer because of consumer demand

281
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:14,509
but not necessarily from the brewers of

282
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:18,049
the growers demands from the growers are

283
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:20,779
growing it because I mean as far as I

284
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:22,399
know white powdery mildew is a problem

285
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:25,250
all over the United States and into

286
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:29,720
North America I'm not sure about it's a

287
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:32,960
problem worldwide exactly I mean you

288
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,050
don't see it very much from fields crops

289
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:40,310
in Afghanistan because it's dry there

290
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:42,649
and yeah but in general where ever

291
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:45,739
there's began work I'm sure there are

292
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:50,329
some which do get powder and they'll do

293
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:52,879
even in Afghanistan hmm hey welcome dr.

294
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:55,040
mark and Scott Benson as well to the

295
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,919
room it was just a Eddie and myself for

296
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,929
a few minutes there it was kind of kind

297
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,110
of unique it was cool

298
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:06,559
and now Wade is in the house with his

299
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:10,100
smiley face it's going on Wade it's all

300
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:13,549
good today beautiful sunny day gardeners

301
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,870
flourishing nice yeah I saw your photos

302
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:18,740
with Forest

303
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:23,269
the Swami ah and I was like I was visit

304
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:29,990
that looked like a fun visit we got a

305
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:31,699
little bit of rain on us yeah yeah no

306
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:35,110
Swami's doing good

307
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:39,460
it was a real treat to see them there

308
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:42,889
his plants are struggling he's doing a

309
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:47,330
he's transitioning from working in pots

310
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:50,379
to working in soil and because he's so

311
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:53,800
fervent about using no animal products

312
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:59,689
nitrogen is a real issue for his garden

313
00:13:53,799 --> 00:14:03,439
though yeah we we explored what

314
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:05,480
possibilities there were to increase the

315
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,450
nitrogen without adding any fish

316
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,028
emulsion or any of the other things that

317
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:14,570
a lot of folks use and meantime he's

318
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:18,528
very meticulous about organic and all of

319
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,850
that but yeah what was what were what

320
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:21,889
were some of the alternatives that you

321
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,839
guys were talking about for producing

322
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:28,309
nitrogen for his plants green manures

323
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,770
he's not willing to use animal manures

324
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:33,859
of any kind and compost so it's really

325
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:36,620
cut across that takes a while Wade

326
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:40,480
knightly another thing that he could

327
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:43,810
think of would be using the seed meal of

328
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,870
high-protein seeds for example have seen

329
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:51,708
Christopher oil you could use that that

330
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:54,560
is fairly high carbon and I'm sure

331
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:56,599
Italian what you need and most

332
00:14:54,559 --> 00:15:02,750
importantly Sam I bet you it would put a

333
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:06,040
smile on Swami's face yes as Aussie

334
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:10,700
didn't have to squash the billion seeds

335
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:13,549
right is there a source for that Sam

336
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:16,520
that you know of that you could name in

337
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:19,250
Canada probably Marcus knows better than

338
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,009
me yeah in the u.s. there really isn't

339
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,360
anybody squishing it I've got my I'm

340
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:25,338
listening

341
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,529
I've got some friends doing things in

342
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:29,270
Nebraska etc but they're more dealing in

343
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:32,059
Decorah caters

344
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:35,569
and there's got to be an oil company

345
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:37,579
using oil in the US and that you'd think

346
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,040
like nutiva or somebody like that would

347
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:43,610
be ready to reach out to a new team is

348
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:45,289
California so reach out to them and see

349
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,870
what they're doing with their these old

350
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:51,349
game your what they do with the seed

351
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:54,139
after the squash should is they make it

352
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:57,440
into animal feed really high in protein

353
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:59,659
uh-huh yeah yeah it's high protein yeah

354
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,550
it's it's animals love it too I mean

355
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,500
they they will gravitate toward it when

356
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:05,120
their have different types of protein

357
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,059
for some reason and it's you know it's

358
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,399
very good for them its digestible

359
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:11,329
okay well into the room forest good

360
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,689
morning everybody

361
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:16,580
yeah I I wanted to give thanks to forest

362
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,990
once again I think that that hashtag

363
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:23,120
that you started make them watch and

364
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:25,370
that whole mentality behind it and the

365
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,950
words that you wrote prior to that

366
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:31,029
hashtag which I shared on my Facebook

367
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:33,890
page was I was powerful [ __ ] man

368
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:37,189
you know I have a unique perspective and

369
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:39,379
I just ship have nothing you know I

370
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,690
think a lot of the cannabis industry and

371
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:43,129
for good reason this isn't a judgement

372
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,190
but they've had to just tiptoe around

373
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:48,230
all these judgmental people you know and

374
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:51,230
all their reasons why the cannabis

375
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,029
industry is bad and evil and even in our

376
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,409
own community you know there's just in

377
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:58,579
my opinion they're putting up with

378
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:59,600
ridiculous regulation that they really

379
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,400
don't have any choice because they've

380
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,860
just been abused and mistreated for so

381
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,779
many years but see I'm not in that

382
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,750
circle you know I don't have something

383
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:12,529
to prove or to sell so I have nothing to

384
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:15,529
lose to call people out and and really

385
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:17,839
point out how they're you know there's

386
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:19,309
these old ideologies that they can't

387
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,019
point back to any reason why they even

388
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:23,000
believe them other than they were told

389
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:25,970
at some point they should how they

390
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,430
impact everybody you know so yeah that

391
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,350
post was one of many that just I feel as

392
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:33,200
my role to just really put it in

393
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:35,740
people's faces that we're at a point now

394
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,690
where if you are going to hold on to old

395
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,059
ideologies and in outdated beliefs that

396
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,200
put people's lives at risk and severely

397
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:44,359
impact can

398
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,759
members quality alive you shouldn't be

399
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:49,069
protected in your little bubble and not

400
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:51,138
have to see the damage that causes so

401
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:53,119
that's where the make them watch hashtag

402
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:55,129
I came from they should see what it

403
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,109
looks like the watch a child slowly sees

404
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,450
to death they should see what it's like

405
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:01,519
to suffer from conditions where your

406
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,230
skin fall off they should see what it's

407
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,659
like for a cancer patient to go through

408
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:08,389
chemotherapy with and without access to

409
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:13,278
cannabis I mean the only way you can

410
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:16,990
have these outdated really you know

411
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:19,700
callous and heartless to be blunt

412
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,888
positions is if you can shelter yourself

413
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,840
from the impact that has on people

414
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:26,119
around you so I encourage families in

415
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,730
patients out there who are suffering to

416
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,879
film it and post it and tag it with the

417
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,528
make them watch so that they can see the

418
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,649
real impact that cannabis prohibition

419
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:39,940
has so yeah a prior prior to that

420
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:44,750
statement you you posted a photo of

421
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:47,509
Silas may 20th fairly heavy not looking

422
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:50,720
as healthy on pharmaceuticals back to

423
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:54,019
September 17th like lost major weight

424
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,600
looks just so much more aware and

425
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:59,058
healthy and that's on cannabis and and

426
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:01,459
you wrote you know don't tell me that we

427
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:04,038
as parents do not know what is and is

428
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,690
not safe for our children we have to

429
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:08,329
live with the consequences of the pills

430
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,460
we've given our child every day 95

431
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:12,619
percent seizure free 100 percent

432
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,538
pharmaceutical free so that was also

433
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,918
very powerful I wrote that and sort of I

434
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:17,960
wrote that to the people who are very

435
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,549
consistent in their well we need more

436
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,179
proof where's the proof we need more

437
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:25,009
scientific documentation etc well like

438
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:27,409
Forrest says in the last sentence of his

439
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:28,849
statement here and what you said you

440
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:31,130
know don't tell me that we as parents

441
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:34,250
don't know what is safe and not safe

442
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,990
that was that was that predated the make

443
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,750
them watch but I just thought both of

444
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:40,970
them were like cracked right out of the

445
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,619
ball thank you this is where it all

446
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,419
started was with patients because

447
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:45,859
remember it was the AIDS patients and

448
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:48,380
you have suffering here in the Bay Area

449
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:49,969
that got so sick and tired of literally

450
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,340
watching on their friends wasting away

451
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,288
and dying yeah that they're like [ __ ]

452
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:55,058
you [ __ ] this I'm gonna break the

453
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:59,259
[ __ ] law

454
00:19:55,058 --> 00:20:01,778
again if it was not for them we would

455
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:03,669
not be here you and I i agree we've kind

456
00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:06,759
of gotten to a stagnation point and i

457
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:09,370
think what you're doing there for us is

458
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:12,849
touting a whole other level because we

459
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:15,308
were able to open up that first wave but

460
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:17,918
at the same time it's opened up a whole

461
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:22,240
other wave of medicines to these very

462
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,038
intricate delicate illnesses that you're

463
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,378
dealing with that are there on the very

464
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:28,298
rare side of the realities they're not

465
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:30,219
common things like depression or

466
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:30,759
unfortunately aids and other things like

467
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,850
that

468
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:36,538
they're so narrowly along a finite point

469
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:39,189
that they you've literally been ignored

470
00:20:36,538 --> 00:20:41,230
by everything from the pharmaceutical

471
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:43,840
companies you're trying doctors who are

472
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,899
desperately trying to find any way to

473
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:49,480
find any type by their standards that

474
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:53,319
they have access to you know discarded

475
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:56,019
even a TN absolutely and so III think

476
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:58,388
your awareness and your ability to raise

477
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:01,179
awareness because of the difficulties

478
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:03,638
that you face and the connection that

479
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:06,850
those vulnerabilities have with the

480
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:09,998
everyday person really becomes its own

481
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:12,609
arrow point and spear in its own

482
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:15,100
trajectory that I think will do nothing

483
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:16,928
but help millions of people and

484
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:19,689
especially thousands of children with

485
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:22,480
these rare conditions that can get some

486
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:25,990
relief and some relief is better than no

487
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,819
relief as you know temporary you know

488
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,859
it's the same here in Vancouver I just

489
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:32,558
have to say that it really was this sort

490
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:34,479
of the gay community who are the first

491
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,668
to stand up and just be like and it was

492
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,409
it was a part of the gay community who

493
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:40,690
was suffering with AIDS and it was this

494
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:42,159
wasting syndrome and it was all of these

495
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,879
different things that cannabis just

496
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,710
seemed to be miraculous for in how it

497
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:50,199
was improving the quality of a life that

498
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,600
was being decimated if you hung around

499
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,980
you know in the beginning of the BC

500
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,898
compassion club with Hillary the

501
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,690
majority of the people that she signed

502
00:21:55,898 --> 00:22:00,508
originally were were terminally ill they

503
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,860
were they were it was really almost like

504
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:05,288
palliative care she was offering but

505
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:06,959
they were also homeless so they were you

506
00:22:05,288 --> 00:22:08,769
know it was just it was unbelievable

507
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,809
like the firt you know

508
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:12,309
we should never forget that group of

509
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:15,309
people and how they really were the

510
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:17,559
front lines for you know here on the

511
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:19,569
west coast I think pretty since Tinley

512
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:21,819
everywhere they were ostracized by

513
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:24,549
everything and by everyone everybody

514
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:26,919
didn't know how AIDS was it wasn't until

515
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:29,349
Princess Diana actually shook the hand

516
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,920
of an AIDS patient in a hospital in like

517
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:35,349
1985 that people realize oh I'm not

518
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,080
gonna catch this this way but I mean it

519
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:40,689
was originally just dismissed as a a gay

520
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,779
disease and because of that the you know

521
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:46,420
is we're not necessarily looked proper

522
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:49,480
upon by society as much as necessarily

523
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,130
they are and respectfully are now and

524
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,950
they had to literally come out and fight

525
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:55,960
for their freedoms dog I mean and then

526
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,120
they pulled its society all of us

527
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,340
together and I got great respect for the

528
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:03,009
gay community for their hard work their

529
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:04,959
dedication and their networking [ __ ]

530
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:06,970
they taught us and in the cannabis

531
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,460
community we thought we knew networking

532
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,200
[ __ ] we had no idea how to network until

533
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,329
we saw the gay community come out in the

534
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,000
AIDS and the cannabis community and they

535
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:17,799
showed us how it's done people we

536
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,619
thought we straights had it going on etc

537
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:23,919
etc no we had no clue their networks

538
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:26,829
before internet etc etc were a class

539
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,810
that we all envy because of how able and

540
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:32,619
how quickly they were able to organize

541
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:34,690
and get it together so much respect to

542
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,459
all those pioneers and those survivors

543
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,930
and needless to say much love and

544
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,610
respect to all those who passed and

545
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:42,880
those family members who had to suffer

546
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:44,199
along the way yeah you know some of the

547
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,570
most inspiring activists I've worked

548
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,029
with started you know in Los Angeles and

549
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:50,829
other areas with working with the gay

550
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:51,819
community during the AIDS epidemic and

551
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:54,579
you know the stories are just

552
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:55,929
heartbreaking and what's more heart now

553
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:58,480
more it's probably the wrong word but

554
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:02,650
what is also heartbreaking is the fact

555
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,000
that community didn't rise up to support

556
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,190
you know just like you're saying they

557
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,789
shunned them they had all this judgment

558
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,410
towards homosexuality and you know you

559
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:14,079
look back on that and people look back

560
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:16,240
on it with shame you know the people who

561
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,699
have a good you know moral compass in my

562
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,380
opinion but we're

563
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,240
we're just humans we just have to repeat

564
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,940
this history you know the MER at this

565
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,289
point now where the word medicine and

566
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,080
how it pertains to cannabis the doors

567
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:30,579
have been blown wide open I mean I had

568
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:32,319
always thought yeah this is great this

569
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:35,109
is harmless and it helps people get

570
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:37,000
hungry this wonderful you know there is

571
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:38,349
absolutely no moral or ethical reason to

572
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,440
prevent these people from eating it but

573
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:43,599
now we're on the cusp of you know slowly

574
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,240
discovering but rapidly in the terms of

575
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:48,969
medical understanding discovering that

576
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,210
it is interacting with one of the most

577
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:54,069
important regulatory systems in our body

578
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,930
and could hold the key to some of the

579
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:58,029
most important medical discoveries we've

580
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,680
seen in generations and went from this

581
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:01,599
is harmless and yeah this can help it's

582
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,279
just the right thing to do - this is

583
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,250
without a doubt one of the greatest

584
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,710
medical discoveries of our lifetime and

585
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:11,049
has the potential to change the world

586
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,340
and anyone who's saying that the studies

587
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:14,500
you know there just needs to be more

588
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:15,819
research as soon as I hear that come out

589
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,269
of my mouth I know I'm talking to

590
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:20,829
someone who has made little to no effort

591
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:23,019
to look at the research that's available

592
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:25,329
because at this point the only way you

593
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:26,980
could say there's no research or more

594
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:29,199
needs to happen is that you've locked

595
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,789
yourself in a bubble or are just

596
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,830
repeating mantras that you've heard

597
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:34,629
other people say and you're hoping that

598
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:36,990
they're true because we have human

599
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,130
clinical trials in this country we have

600
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:41,859
peer-reviewed papers coming out every

601
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,720
other day at this point you can't even

602
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:46,169
keep up with the science that's coming

603
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,690
out so you know it's just at this point

604
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:52,269
one of my main goals is that exact

605
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:54,100
concept of people protecting themselves

606
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:56,109
in this bubble by saying well we didn't

607
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:59,469
really know we didn't really understand

608
00:25:56,109 --> 00:26:00,729
and one of the things I try to do every

609
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,400
time I speak or if I've made a

610
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,410
conference or if I'm talking to anyone

611
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,000
is that when we're done talking you're

612
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:10,180
no longer gonna get to stay you didn't

613
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,519
know so you're gonna know and you're

614
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:15,120
gonna either act on it and look back and

615
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:17,920
realize he you acted with pride and with

616
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,149
you know with a good moral compass

617
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,640
you're gonna look back on it and realize

618
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,900
that you you know put a lot of people in

619
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,910
a really dangerous position that could

620
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:28,570
cost a lot of people their lives for

621
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:30,070
really no justifiable reason at all well

622
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:32,399
I think the problem is is that people

623
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:35,369
are so easily manipulated

624
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,650
and directed and you know they're just

625
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:39,000
and and and everyone I'm not talking

626
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,009
about people that are you know

627
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,990
brainwashed by a particular type of

628
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:44,910
religion or people like I'm not talking

629
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,819
about and I mean belief systems in

630
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:51,590
generally allow humans to be manipulated

631
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:53,609
easily and a perfect example is these

632
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:55,079
anarchists that go around to different

633
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:57,089
events they like to show up at the

634
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:59,429
Olympics they like to go to like the end

635
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:01,829
games of baseball and football and

636
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:05,160
basketball and hockey and what they do

637
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:07,049
is they start riots they start riots

638
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,180
with just normal good people that are

639
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:11,069
out enjoying a football game or a soccer

640
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,930
game or whatever and these [ __ ]

641
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:14,460
show up they got the tear gas they got

642
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,660
the gas masks that's how you know

643
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,130
they're there to start riots because

644
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,080
you're like did you notice there was

645
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:22,260
guys with gas masks on it's like yeah

646
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:24,089
they brought those gas pasts they do all

647
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:25,619
this little [ __ ] and they they do a

648
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:27,689
little push here and a little push there

649
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:29,939
and the next thing you know everyday

650
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,190
normal people are flipping and burning

651
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,279
cop cars I've seen it in my own city

652
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:38,549
twice when the Vancouver Canucks lost

653
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:40,649
the playoffs for the Cup but Markus

654
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:44,849
these people are not doing this for

655
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:49,620
their own reasons but for the revolution

656
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:52,169
the revolution I'll tell ya hey well I

657
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:53,099
mean go ahead I just say one more final

658
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,110
thought and this is something we all

659
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:58,769
have to combat and we you know before we

660
00:27:55,109 --> 00:28:00,599
move on from this topic is that it's not

661
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:05,220
just that they're easily manipulated but

662
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:07,829
we also have this like inert need to

663
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,450
protect our worldview and paradigm

664
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:11,759
whether it's right or wrong we don't

665
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,319
adapt to change very well it's animals

666
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,170
and you know there's this whole

667
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:19,349
cognitive dissonance built in function

668
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,610
into the human brain that is I don't

669
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:22,169
know there must be some sort of

670
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:24,959
protection mechanism or it's beneficial

671
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:26,820
to us at one time but but now at this

672
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,890
point you know with that information

673
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:30,480
coming at us in ways it never has in

674
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,100
human history it's not it doesn't serve

675
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,730
us very well we have this need to just

676
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:37,980
protect ideas and sometimes it's

677
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,890
harmless and benign you know and

678
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,059
sometimes it's it's very harmful and you

679
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,790
know I think this is one of the things

680
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:46,259
we can do is really what I try to watch

681
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,940
that in myself you know

682
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:49,980
is this something that I want to believe

683
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,600
or is this something that I know and I

684
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,279
try to point that out with people that

685
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,168
were talking to in ways that are

686
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,548
hopefully not challenging to them

687
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:58,410
personally so I'm not attacking the

688
00:28:56,548 --> 00:29:01,529
person we're just trying to get them to

689
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:04,710
understand where their own ideas have

690
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:06,808
even come from and we adopt so much that

691
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,690
it's just becomes our personal identity

692
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:11,668
that is really just candid to us through

693
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:14,910
our culture in our communities through

694
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:17,820
television through you know radio and

695
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,950
pop culture influences and in school

696
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:22,079
friends you know we just adopt pieces of

697
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,798
things and at some point when we're

698
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,329
challenged

699
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:25,500
you know it's it's really good that

700
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,970
we're making sure we're looking back on

701
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,619
this and saying okay am i holding on to

702
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,419
this because it's just something I've

703
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:32,250
always believed and I'm not sure why or

704
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:35,309
it's just something that I I have good

705
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:37,769
foundation to to adopt as part of me and

706
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:41,160
part of what I'm advocating for and I

707
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:43,289
see with cannabis it's all falls under

708
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,290
that category because all the arguments

709
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:49,139
that you hear we're really not backed up

710
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:51,000
with much of anything you know there's

711
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,559
just things that people have been raised

712
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,690
to believe and have been told and

713
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,119
they've been ruined are still continuing

714
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:59,548
to be repeated like the harmful effects

715
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,168
on you know development or brains and

716
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,548
kids and all these things that we've

717
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:04,230
just that you go back and look at the

718
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:06,329
research and there's very little if any

719
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,089
supportive evidence but people just

720
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:11,789
adopted so it's really good for people

721
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:13,649
in the cannabis activism realm to

722
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:16,339
recognize that and to be able to provide

723
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:19,080
information in a way that helps people

724
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:21,480
like shift ideas without triggering that

725
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,829
that need to protect their worldview

726
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,190
which just shuts down their ears

727
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:28,678
completely it's very true well we in the

728
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:32,250
and the can days when my my activist

729
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:35,400
Road days we learned early that it's all

730
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,230
about planting seeds planting seeds in

731
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,480
their minds because you can't change

732
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:41,190
someone's opinion however if you could

733
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,929
prove in this piece of information or

734
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,090
this link to this knowledge so that they

735
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:47,100
themselves can then go to that link

736
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:48,539
themselves in their own time when

737
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:50,730
they're ready for it and they're ready

738
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:53,879
to absorb it and then they actually look

739
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:56,130
at it and actually read it it affects

740
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,640
the collective unconsciousness not only

741
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:02,280
themselves and so those planting

742
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,750
seeds as we said it was back then it was

743
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,029
having a pamphlet and getting into

744
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:08,519
somebody's pants and hoping that they

745
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:10,259
forgot to wash they forgot about that in

746
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:12,000
their pants and then their mom goes

747
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:13,470
through their pants and it pulls out

748
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,660
that piece of paper and goes hey what's

749
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,319
this and it sparks that discussion you

750
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:20,130
know what I'm saying

751
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:22,109
it engages people in forces them to have

752
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,270
these uncomfortable conversations that

753
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:26,849
they don't want to have but for some

754
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:28,470
reason because as you stated the

755
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:30,839
collective conscious has taught them

756
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,210
this and so they can't go against that

757
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:35,399
because of change but if you can give

758
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:37,680
them the idea and it has to come from

759
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,660
themselves and it has to be instigated

760
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,420
by themselves so if you can give them

761
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,630
the seed that can sit in there and give

762
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:48,170
them time it in time will form its own

763
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:50,340
manure and break down and start to grow

764
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:52,590
and when it starts to grow it becomes

765
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:54,329
their idea and then that change can come

766
00:31:52,589 --> 00:31:56,609
from within them from their own

767
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:59,039
instigation as opposed to us try to beat

768
00:31:56,609 --> 00:32:01,079
it over their heads because I realize we

769
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,639
going out there we could only reach

770
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,250
certain amount of people there is always

771
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,590
for every one person at a rally back in

772
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,660
the 90s there was 10 to 15 to 20 people

773
00:32:07,589 --> 00:32:13,319
at home because they were afraid to come

774
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:15,540
out or show their face etc etc which now

775
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:17,429
become the standard reality of people

776
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:19,049
being filmed at rallies back then it

777
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,120
wasn't the case but it was still the

778
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:24,329
fear but it became that reality

779
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,699
consciously so we have to again plant

780
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:29,309
our own seeds so that it can sprout and

781
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,559
teach others through our own education

782
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:33,000
and passing that knowledge on to them so

783
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,940
that they can judge and grow for

784
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,130
themselves I couldn't agree more but I

785
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,220
would just add one last thing which is I

786
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:43,410
found there is one way to make a direct

787
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,900
and immediate paradigm shift in someone

788
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:47,160
and that's with direct experience you

789
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,000
know we've had we've worked with

790
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:52,380
lawmakers where we've had kids there and

791
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,319
they're like I don't know we need more

792
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:58,110
research right bam child has a seizure

793
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:59,899
and their idea on what is and what it's

794
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:04,169
not appropriate changes immediately

795
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:06,300
because we have a reaction that then you

796
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,890
know changes are I think it changes us

797
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,960
physiologically you know when we have

798
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:13,350
this you know almost maternal sensitive

799
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,519
this reaction to parent paternal sense

800
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:16,288
when we see people have these

801
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,529
experiences and I've seen people change

802
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:21,390
immediately and but that's hard to do

803
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:24,980
but it's one of the reasons I think we

804
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:27,450
I'd like to see more integration of

805
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,029
people who a lot of the community things

806
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,558
we should protect from cannabis

807
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:33,569
integrated with cannabis I want to see

808
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:36,089
children in gardens I want to see

809
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:37,769
children in farms and interacting and

810
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:40,019
showing that this plant is not gonna

811
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:42,298
reach out and grab them and say and you

812
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:44,308
know rip them from limb to limb that the

813
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:46,918
the the perceived harm is it's really

814
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:49,889
just that it's it's it's it's fear

815
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,509
without a without reasoning in the basis

816
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,788
and this is also and this can bring us

817
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:55,890
back to where Marcus started us and if

818
00:33:53,788 --> 00:33:58,379
we need to move on and that's good but

819
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:02,700
that's also the idea behind the make

820
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:05,039
them watch hashtag people change through

821
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,830
direct experience I want them to see

822
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:10,619
what it's like for people to have a

823
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:13,349
seizure adult or child but see the fear

824
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:16,230
in the parents I see the pain experience

825
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:18,269
the trauma and it's not quite as

826
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,789
effective but it still has more impact

827
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:22,378
than just verbal dialogue when they have

828
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:23,730
to see it and experience it and they're

829
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:26,608
uncomfortable and they don't want to

830
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:28,918
watch it that has an impact on the mind

831
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:31,019
and I think we can change hearts and

832
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:32,819
minds that way and it's hard because a

833
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:36,509
lot of people don't want to share that

834
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,769
personal pain and struggling and they

835
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,419
shouldn't have to there's no other

836
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:42,750
medical condition where you have to

837
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:46,079
expose your suffering that way publicly

838
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:48,239
to prove that you have it in and

839
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,000
maintain access but with cannabis right

840
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,668
now I think we need to and I think it

841
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,739
really directly impacts exactly what you

842
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:58,139
were saying as far as you know people's

843
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:00,209
ability to change their perspective and

844
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,309
that's how we change communities and

845
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,380
then when they understand what happens

846
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,670
is I've seen it then they say well we

847
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,320
are all for these kids yeah I know

848
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,909
that's fine yeah kids with seizures that

849
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,830
helps we all agree they should have it

850
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:13,230
but there's this mental disconnect that

851
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:15,569
you know it's just gonna spring out of

852
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,639
thin air and and then families are gonna

853
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,750
have access to medicine but I can't we

854
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:21,210
want them to have it but we just don't

855
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,349
want it grown right or we don't want to

856
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,240
in our communities because we might

857
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:26,400
smell it for six weeks out of the year

858
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,000
and you know that's part of a lot of the

859
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,340
work I'm doing

860
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,349
is really trying to focus on well these

861
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,750
are not mutually exclusive ideas you

862
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:36,900
have to be able to understand that if

863
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:39,179
you want to and protect these vulnerable

864
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:42,750
members in your community or adult or a

865
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:45,029
child then it has to grow somewhere and

866
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:47,460
it has to be tested somewhere it has to

867
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,740
be manufactured somewhere and this is

868
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,800
the angle I take into these local

869
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:54,419
community fights in California I mean

870
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,490
it's just every county is fighting tooth

871
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,610
and nail and it seems like they're all

872
00:35:56,489 --> 00:36:02,039
arguing like it's 2008 still you know or

873
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:04,890
2005 like oh you should have setbacks

874
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,630
and we don't know if we want it here but

875
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:08,819
that's just the wrong conversation I

876
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:10,710
don't even want to allow my board of

877
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,380
supervisors or local officials to even

878
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:17,900
have that type of conversation in 2008

879
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:19,950
fine but with the amount of undisputable

880
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,530
scientific evidence that has shown this

881
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:25,799
is life-saving medication you no longer

882
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,480
get to say you know or choose if we want

883
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,910
to in our communities that's not a

884
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,679
choice that is an option you don't get

885
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:33,719
to choose if we're gonna have insulin

886
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,969
for kids who need it you don't get to

887
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:37,769
choose even if we're gonna have opioids

888
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:39,719
and opioids are killing people by the

889
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:42,119
millions but it would be considered

890
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:44,609
completely unethical to say you can't

891
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,609
have morphine after you have heart

892
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:50,849
surgery or you have an amputation of the

893
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:54,120
leg we know that these things are not up

894
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:55,619
for debate as far as human rights but

895
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,659
with cannabis for some reason we're

896
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:59,549
still debating it like it's an if type

897
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:01,319
of question like oh yeah it's just some

898
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,910
people like to get high and are we gonna

899
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,640
allow that in our community or not but

900
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:07,679
that conversation is over it's no longer

901
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:08,909
okay to see if we're gonna have it in

902
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:10,859
our communities the only ethical

903
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:13,289
question is how are we going to do it

904
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,030
and how are we gonna do it in a way that

905
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:17,969
protects our communities and protects

906
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:19,830
the most vulnerable there so alright I'm

907
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,989
off my soapbox dude that's an awesome

908
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:24,630
soapbox I really appreciated everything

909
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:26,189
you said in that it's a very important

910
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,750
perspective and I've said for a long

911
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,450
time now that it's definitely going to

912
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,280
be the children unfortunately because we

913
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:34,859
really shouldn't have to be exposing

914
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,790
sick children but this is the thing that

915
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:40,230
changes the minds of the most staunch

916
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:42,480
prohibitionist the one who's just

917
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:45,809
Walla Hill he believes in all the all

918
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:49,019
the propaganda and in it and a half a

919
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:51,150
second you can see that change with

920
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:52,858
exactly what you described have someone

921
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,720
having a seizure right in front of them

922
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:57,719
and then being relieved with a drop of

923
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:59,699
cannabis oil they're no longer just

924
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:01,949
changes their mind it changes their soul

925
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:05,269
for it oh yeah loads them to that and

926
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:08,460
that's what you can see it in that

927
00:38:05,269 --> 00:38:11,670
representative city councilperson county

928
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:14,730
person etc eyes and that's what's needed

929
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:17,608
and so they need to be shocked they need

930
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:20,130
to see the horror of these kids whose

931
00:38:17,608 --> 00:38:22,920
skin cannot basically stay on and that

932
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:25,500
this medicine literally holds them

933
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,420
together nota unintended you know

934
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:33,659
they're shocked they're shocked as well

935
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:37,639
is is the real shock has to be how could

936
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:39,779
I have been led down such an evil path

937
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:41,608
because when you notice that in that

938
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,040
instant and you see that like Forrest

939
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:47,159
mentioned the fear in the parents eyes

940
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:48,929
the real experience of it happening I

941
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:51,029
mean I'm guaranteeing you nine point

942
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:53,250
nine out of ten would stand there with

943
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:57,030
their jaw on the floor unable to really

944
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:58,469
process what was happening well and

945
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,540
that's why I share these pictures of

946
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,439
these EB kids and and they can be

947
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:03,029
graphic

948
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,490
you know that's it's hard to look at but

949
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:07,560
let me tell you I know you guys have

950
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:09,479
seen it but some watching might not have

951
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,670
if you go to the Gladius Network on

952
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,369
Instagram or on Facebook you can see

953
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:18,119
some of these pictures and they're the

954
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:21,600
most mild pictures I have to share there

955
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:25,559
I'm trying to not intentionally exploit

956
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,719
your posts gory photos and I have a file

957
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:29,369
that parents have sent me that I just

958
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,439
don't know if people are ready to see

959
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:33,119
yet I don't want to scare people off but

960
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,480
if you look at those pictures of those

961
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,600
EB kids realize you're seeing the most

962
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,730
tame pictures I can try to show to get

963
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,799
the point across without making people

964
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:47,490
not want to come back because it's

965
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:51,900
terrific can you say yeah the conditions

966
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:53,939
called epidermolysis bullosa be ull OS a

967
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,760
in the f you wanna you

968
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,530
have your paradigm shifted go ahead and

969
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:02,130
google that se what those kids go

970
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:06,600
through what what is the root cause of

971
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:08,160
this is there a single cause yes yeah

972
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,259
sorry I didn't catch oh yeah it's a

973
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,929
genetic malformation so they it's just a

974
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:15,180
genetic fluke where their body doesn't

975
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:18,230
produce the protein there's a protein

976
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:22,139
that holds our layers of skin together

977
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:24,119
like a like velcro yeah and when when

978
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:25,559
you don't produce that this layers of

979
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,359
skins slide on each other and when they

980
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:28,980
if you bump it hard enough then it

981
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,900
starts the blistering process so it's

982
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,090
just like a burn all right it blisters

983
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,490
and then peels off and dies and tries to

984
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:37,470
heal but it your body never stops doing

985
00:40:35,489 --> 00:40:39,239
that which is why they call them

986
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:40,319
butterfly kids a lot of the parents

987
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:41,539
don't like that they like calm like

988
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,920
turtle kids because they're tough but

989
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:45,449
the term is like they call butterfly

990
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,730
kids because their skin is so soft that

991
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:51,089
when you bump it it comes off and we've

992
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:54,409
seen huge improvements in their ability

993
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:56,550
to heal and regenerate skin quickly and

994
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:57,989
get them off the other medications

995
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,340
because remember some of the damage and

996
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:02,449
this goes back to what Marcus said about

997
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:05,100
the pictures of Silas I've hurt my son

998
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:07,469
treating his condition but it wasn't

999
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:11,789
with cannabis I've given him drugs that

1000
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:14,009
I it's hard to talk about I hold so much

1001
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:15,079
regret forgiving him for such a long

1002
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:20,340
amount of time

1003
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:22,079
horrible drugs from our doctor and these

1004
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,789
kids are no difference what happens it's

1005
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,860
not only are they sick but then you give

1006
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:27,840
them drugs that just destroy their body

1007
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,420
so they're being given the e back to the

1008
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:33,390
EB kids now you know topical ketamine

1009
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,680
right and in their two and a half years

1010
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:37,349
older younger and they're on dilaudid

1011
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:39,329
right and topical more afine so what

1012
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:40,980
happens over time is now not only are

1013
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:43,259
you sick and struggle these conditions

1014
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:45,599
but your body becomes an addict and it

1015
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,180
never functions well we know in that

1016
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,880
condition so what we're seeing was a

1017
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:52,589
mistake you're just treating the

1018
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,110
symptoms and you're not treating the

1019
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:57,870
underlying cause of the disease itself

1020
00:41:55,110 --> 00:42:00,240
and you're deadening the body's own

1021
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:03,029
nervous system which is there to sense

1022
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,879
right discomfort to tell you that

1023
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:06,940
something is just not not correct but I

1024
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,890
a wider

1025
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,990
again so there's two things that Canada

1026
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:13,598
miss can potentially help with not only

1027
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:17,259
is cannabis wonderful in its wound

1028
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:20,650
healing properties but also just any

1029
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:25,599
inflammatory aspects alone

1030
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:29,019
so are these treatments topical for us I

1031
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,420
know they can create like a subdermal

1032
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:34,210
thing but you're also treating this

1033
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:36,190
condition topically yeah so I spent a

1034
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:39,639
couple years now working on a topical

1035
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:41,858
cream that with no bells and whistles

1036
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:44,889
it's just designed to work and we worked

1037
00:42:41,858 --> 00:42:46,750
with these EB families and yeah I don't

1038
00:42:44,889 --> 00:42:48,250
have them prepared but if we want or we

1039
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,880
could do another show on this I could

1040
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:52,989
get pictures ready but the it's just the

1041
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,030
anti-inflammatory properties or you know

1042
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:57,459
from with knees like the size of like

1043
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:59,470
cantaloupes just completely swollen to

1044
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:02,460
within three or four weeks it looks like

1045
00:42:59,469 --> 00:43:05,289
a completely different leg just hues so

1046
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,900
significant anti-inflammatory properties

1047
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:09,759
yeah and pain modulation and management

1048
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,639
and then when they we see that we get

1049
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,130
them off of some of these drugs that

1050
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:17,230
suppress the whole system and some

1051
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:19,568
families are doing large internal dosing

1052
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:22,809
as well so the kids have a g-tube and

1053
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:28,289
they'll just do up to upwards of 150

1054
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:31,239
milligrams THC and 300 CBD a day

1055
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:33,429
internal dosing the kids show no sign of

1056
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:35,049
intoxication whatsoever but that also

1057
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:37,088
will knock the whole body inflammation

1058
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:38,800
down you get benefit to the

1059
00:43:37,088 --> 00:43:40,480
endocannabinoids system so they can be

1060
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,940
functioning in the most efficient manner

1061
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,338
that it can and essentially you just see

1062
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:50,440
these kids start to transform through a

1063
00:43:45,338 --> 00:43:54,578
combination of a quicker time for the

1064
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:56,500
wounds to heal and healthier skin and

1065
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:59,250
healthier skin becomes a little bit more

1066
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,269
robust and one of the key things that is

1067
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,789
efficient for effective for

1068
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:06,159
epidermolysis bullosa kids is the

1069
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:08,380
control of itching in cannabis cream can

1070
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,899
do that we're still trying to make it

1071
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,059
better but when your skin like when you

1072
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:15,190
get road rash if anyone remembers or a

1073
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:17,380
big kind of skin wound when it hear a

1074
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:20,470
tattoo all right when it starts to heal

1075
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:21,010
it itches right that's the dangerous

1076
00:44:20,469 --> 00:44:22,719
cycle

1077
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,520
because as the wounds healing and then

1078
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,399
the kids are starting to itch right and

1079
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:28,780
what happens when you itch you break the

1080
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,849
skin and these kids and then you're just

1081
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,950
reopening this wound constantly and a

1082
00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:35,170
lot of times that's what gets them is

1083
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:37,869
eventual either staph infection or skin

1084
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:39,909
cancer from the constant wounds so these

1085
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:42,190
creams really help with that as well so

1086
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:44,649
it it's kind of that whole cycle you're

1087
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:48,519
not able to cure the condition but if

1088
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:51,910
you are able to in pain and modulate the

1089
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:54,820
pain decrease time for wound healing and

1090
00:44:51,909 --> 00:44:57,399
overall anti-inflammatory properties in

1091
00:44:54,820 --> 00:45:00,010
the body we see dramatic quality of life

1092
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,990
changes in these kids and there's

1093
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:03,400
significant progress going on with gene

1094
00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:05,529
editing right now we don't have to get

1095
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,849
in the crisper and those things but you

1096
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,769
know these are probably gonna be some of

1097
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:10,839
the frontline kids to look at potential

1098
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:13,059
gene editing applications of some of

1099
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,559
those so our goal is to you know really

1100
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:17,139
improve their quality of life and just

1101
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,840
you know make sure they're here so when

1102
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:27,639
the cure comes they can experience it

1103
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:29,890
you know I I can I'd like to donate to

1104
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:34,750
something a little bit to you I have a

1105
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:38,639

today's episode got about 542 people

1142
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:19,640
watching in the chatroom and listening

1143
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:22,670
away and yeah I love gathering every

1144
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:24,498
Sunday with all of you and seeing where

1145
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:26,028
the discussion goes it always feels like

1146
00:47:24,498 --> 00:47:27,738
I know you feel like you don't want to

1147
00:47:26,028 --> 00:47:31,009
be up on a soapbox for us but it just

1148
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:33,199
seems like such a such an important

1149
00:47:31,009 --> 00:47:34,880
aspect of the like the tip of the spear

1150
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:36,379
soar to speak you know there's a there's

1151
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,568
a whole handle and there's all this

1152
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:42,229
other component but the tip of the spear

1153
00:47:38,568 --> 00:47:43,909
should get a lot of attention and I just

1154
00:47:42,228 --> 00:47:45,768
don't think that there is anyone that

1155
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:47,538
could argue with you because of how

1156
00:47:45,768 --> 00:47:50,659
you're coming at this and where you're

1157
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:54,109
coming from it's like you said you don't

1158
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:55,639
have a product to sell you're not well

1159
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:58,909
it's also how intelligent he comes

1160
00:47:55,639 --> 00:48:00,318
across and you know you the empathy and

1161
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,058
sympathy comes through in your voice

1162
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:06,048
because you've experienced it firsthand

1163
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:09,199
and you know you you hear that if you

1164
00:48:06,048 --> 00:48:12,380
don't you're not human and you are

1165
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:14,630
pushing them and pushing them into the

1166
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:17,358
uncomfortable region in ways that no

1167
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:19,969
other person can and I'm thankful that

1168
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:23,119
we have spokespersons like you that

1169
00:48:19,969 --> 00:48:24,708
unfortunately are have come through the

1170
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,778
hard route and had to educate yourself

1171
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:31,338
regarding the realities that you face

1172
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:33,920
but you and Silas the type of catalysts

1173
00:48:31,338 --> 00:48:37,659
that are going to affect real change for

1174
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:40,430
many and we thank you for taking on your

1175
00:48:37,659 --> 00:48:44,358
difficulty with the dignity and a grace

1176
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:45,828
that benefits us all well it's my planet

1177
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:48,170
I'm just honored to be here with you

1178
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:50,990
guys you know that and the pave the way

1179
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:54,530
here and what I just saw was that there

1180
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:56,779
was this disrespect that I thought was

1181
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:58,700
inappropriate to people like you the

1182
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,890
activists in the community and it was

1183
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:03,379
justified with this illusion that it's

1184
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:04,789
all a game and none of the things you're

1185
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,380
saying to all the patients you've helped

1186
00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:10,159
is real and they just had all these

1187
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:13,039
excuses to justify not taking some

1188
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:15,588
really really heartfelt activist

1189
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:17,949
seriously and I just felt like I had

1190
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:21,318
another angle to offer that to help to

1191
00:49:17,949 --> 00:49:24,469
combat that exact dissidents and their

1192
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:26,719
thinking and I said with us working

1193
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:29,769
together we can make change and so I'm

1194
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:32,509
just honored to be here with you guys

1195
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:33,798
it's not a game to me you know this is a

1196
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:36,380
serious subject

1197
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:38,150
you know I stayed on CNN to I mean it's

1198
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,440
all fine there's a lot of great fun

1199
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:41,180
things that come out of cannabis it's

1200
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:45,048
not all serious I realized that I am NOT

1201
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:46,848
the the you know most fun topic when it

1202
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:49,699
comes to cannabis and I enjoy all the

1203
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:51,890
other fun sides of cannabis as well but

1204
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:53,659
um it's the fact that it's only framed

1205
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:56,269
that way that really bothered me that

1206
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:58,730
every time there's a thing on you know

1207
00:49:56,269 --> 00:50:01,400
the news or CNN I go it's 4/20 in

1208
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:03,769
Colorado and everybody's sparking up and

1209
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,720
you know the citizens are tired of it

1210
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:08,719
Ness and it's just always framed in this

1211
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:10,699
way that it's just a big game so I just

1212
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:12,469
felt that I had something that really

1213
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:14,480
show that there are parts of this

1214
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:17,000
conversation that are not funny and it's

1215
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,838
very serious and should be taken very

1216
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:25,358
seriously and I felt like I had that to

1217
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:32,029
add to the conversation and as long as

1218
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:34,400
it's legal they wanna make fun of

1219
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:38,170
medical make fun of industrial but

1220
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:42,170
legally allow it I'm a happy guy yeah

1221
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:44,088
yeah I'm with you there well but you

1222
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:46,608
know the public making fun of it the way

1223
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:49,489
comedians have always chose to create

1224
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:52,429
the stereotypical jokes about it I think

1225
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:54,769
all that has a big negative sort of

1226
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:57,440
impact on people that are trying to see

1227
00:50:54,769 --> 00:50:58,789
this plant as you know for what it

1228
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,630
really is you're just you're sending

1229
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:02,389
mixed messages I haven't seen

1230
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:05,519
this new show yet but I've heard

1231
00:51:02,389 --> 00:51:08,519
disjointed is a lot of like not the most

1232
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:10,590
popular cannabis humor its kind of

1233
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:14,940
negative and I don't know I haven't seen

1234
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:16,950
it but I I have and it is all the

1235
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,730
negative stereotypes plus one on the

1236
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:20,309
guest list

1237
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:21,929
use ad they had an opportunity to really

1238
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:26,369
do some intelligence missin yeah some of

1239
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:28,409
the lingo was current but I also saw one

1240
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:31,230
of the people who was assisting or in

1241
00:51:28,409 --> 00:51:33,509
the production and she is persona non

1242
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:36,210
grata for what she's done in our

1243
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:38,970
community and it's only making us all

1244
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:41,449
look bad and I thought we were past

1245
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:44,489
these degenerate stoner

1246
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:46,049
stereotypes which is why we have and I

1247
00:51:44,489 --> 00:51:48,299
come to hash Church because I want to

1248
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:51,060
have intelligent talk with intelligent

1249
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:53,640
people as opposed to these stereotypic

1250
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:56,639
hey dude what's going on man and a

1251
00:51:53,639 --> 00:52:00,150
cooking baked me and again he straight

1252
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,949
you know but you know we've all had to

1253
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:05,460
deal with the unfortunate realities of

1254
00:52:01,949 --> 00:52:07,649
life and and many of these realities but

1255
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,000
when people you know had AIDS and stuff

1256
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:10,829
like that people didn't realize that

1257
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,409
they were ostracized completely from

1258
00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:15,809
their families and they were basically

1259
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:19,349
ostracized by everyone we were literally

1260
00:52:15,809 --> 00:52:21,590
sometimes their only physical contact of

1261
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:25,039
somebody who would even speak to and

1262
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:30,210
that was beyond disheartening to see

1263
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:31,769
society so ignore the realities that we

1264
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:34,740
were forced to deal with those realities

1265
00:52:31,769 --> 00:52:37,349
and those are humbling realities you

1266
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:40,379
know when you have to stare into open

1267
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:42,480
cysts on people's arms you know open

1268
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,340
sores to the point where you're

1269
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,990
uncomfortable just even looking at them

1270
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:47,880
you know but you have to have the inner

1271
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:49,859
strength to stand there and say this

1272
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,780
person is a patient they need help they

1273
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:55,140
need help now and I'm here to do that

1274
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:57,900
and that to me is where I feel so

1275
00:52:55,139 --> 00:53:01,739
insulted by disjointed even though it is

1276
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:04,559
humorous it still is a poke at our

1277
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:06,539
reality that you know a lot of our

1278
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,579
reality isn't funny as you know for us

1279
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:12,259
firsthand it's not funny it's it's

1280
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:14,090
there's ugly realities to this but I

1281
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,820
really hoped more first

1282
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,390
thing like that and I just that's my

1283
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,160
opinion

1284
00:53:17,389 --> 00:53:22,190
I'm not a fan of the show but I

1285
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:24,259
encourage each one of you to encourage

1286
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:26,000
your old man to look at it just to see

1287
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,710
you for yourself you know to judge for

1288
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,449
yourself because some of this stuff is

1289
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:32,240
giggly but some of the stuff is very

1290
00:53:29,449 --> 00:53:33,889
cringe-worthy the most cringe-worthy for

1291
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:34,429
me is when they went and did Jack

1292
00:53:33,889 --> 00:53:39,109
carrers

1293
00:53:34,429 --> 00:53:42,230
funeral and they mocked it and I was

1294
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:44,750
there and it was not handled in any type

1295
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:47,059
of disrespectful way in any way shape or

1296
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:50,000
form nor the portrayals they changed his

1297
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:52,070
name to heron as opposed to Herer but

1298
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,530
that type of portrayal

1299
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:58,039
it was literally a slap in the face to

1300
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:59,900
me and my community and it's very

1301
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:04,519
difficult for me to then get behind

1302
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:07,880
something like that that totally insults

1303
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:09,860
heroes I mean I would not know you if it

1304
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,019
would not been for Jack Herer coming to

1305
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:15,050
my University in 1989 and me getting off

1306
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:18,949
my ass okay and then to have him mocked

1307
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:21,289
and a show like that so they made it

1308
00:54:18,949 --> 00:54:23,210
seem like he grew a career the strain

1309
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:25,639
which was not the case the strain was

1310
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:27,559
bestowed upon him out of utter [ __ ]

1311
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:29,809
respect out of all the hard work and

1312
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:32,599
dedication that he is done and so to

1313
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:36,099
perpetuate that into the eyes of the

1314
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:39,019
ether of the collective consciousness is

1315
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:40,610
disrespectful to Jack's name and the

1316
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:42,920
hard work that he's done and all the

1317
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:46,460
hard work a lot of us have done and so

1318
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:48,650
yes it's made in jest but it is

1319
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:51,530
insulting the way that it was presented

1320
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:54,559
to me yeah I'm not a big fan of this

1321
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:57,310
sort of does that mean you didn't think

1322
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,929
the show was funny

1323
00:54:57,309 --> 00:55:02,329
hmm I would say he did it was

1324
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:05,960
cringe-worthy in areas yes I did laugh

1325
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:08,150
at times and yes they did I think the

1326
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,010
cast is called a B and the dabber and

1327
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:11,599
stuff like that I mean they're current

1328
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:13,940
with their lingo don't get me wrong and

1329
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:17,750
it's nice to hear the current lingo

1330
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:20,030
being used properly as opposed to you

1331
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:23,239
know the silliness that were o or the

1332
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:25,400
puns were always left with but it just

1333
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:29,409
it didn't

1334
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,410
it was disingenuous and

1335
00:55:29,789 --> 00:55:36,269
the majority of cannabis humor movies

1336
00:55:32,759 --> 00:55:39,389
over the decades have been kind of like

1337
00:55:36,268 --> 00:55:41,848
making this look a bit like losers of

1338
00:55:39,389 --> 00:55:44,518
course that's not just making us look a

1339
00:55:41,849 --> 00:55:49,740
little bit like losers listen it's a

1340
00:55:44,518 --> 00:55:52,048
huge part of this of the of the story

1341
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:54,239
like if you look back like first of all

1342
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:56,460
the culture that's that's basically

1343
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,348
setting the tone for everything is

1344
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,659
Hollywood Hollywood makes the movies

1345
00:55:58,349 --> 00:56:02,670
Hollywood makes the TV shows everyone

1346
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:04,440
wants to export America's culture

1347
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:06,690
everyone's importing it to their

1348
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,088
countries everyone wants to be a part of

1349
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:11,849
it that's a major point of contention

1350
00:56:09,088 --> 00:56:13,558
with me because people can blame William

1351
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:15,778
Randolph Hearst all they want he may

1352
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:17,849
have started it but it's these cup these

1353
00:56:15,778 --> 00:56:20,278
people that are continuing to propagate

1354
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:23,099
it by you know shitty jokes on Jimmy

1355
00:56:20,278 --> 00:56:25,818
Kimmel or or whatever it is you know

1356
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:28,170
anti and sort of prohibition based

1357
00:56:25,818 --> 00:56:31,108
stereotypical jokes that I just feel

1358
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:33,900
like man like when there's a side of

1359
00:56:31,108 --> 00:56:35,969
this that forest is coming in and

1360
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:38,430
sharing with us how can you make jokes

1361
00:56:35,969 --> 00:56:41,399
like this that this is this is a

1362
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:44,460
disservice to the community it's keeping

1363
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:48,150
people from seeing the actual benefits

1364
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:50,039
of the plant by goodbye hahaha and when

1365
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:52,410
people think they're going into fight

1366
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:54,299
activity in their community that's what

1367
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:56,429
they envision like well we just don't

1368
00:56:54,298 --> 00:56:59,489
want that in our community you know

1369
00:56:56,429 --> 00:57:01,889
people though the non cannabis related

1370
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:04,920
community that's their only experience

1371
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:07,288
is their television for the most part or

1372
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:09,900
story horror stories they see in the

1373
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:10,980
newspaper and that's when they go in and

1374
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,298
say well we don't want this in our

1375
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,748
community a lot of times that's what

1376
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:18,480
they're envisioning is this dumb stoner

1377
00:57:14,748 --> 00:57:21,748
culture that really doesn't exist in

1378
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,380
very many places in it does yeah it's

1379
00:57:21,748 --> 00:57:23,699
harmful

1380
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:26,099
well Cheech and Chong they were

1381
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:29,548
snapshots in time and I actually one

1382
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:31,380
time I did a panel with Tommy Chong and

1383
00:57:29,548 --> 00:57:33,538
afterwards we were at the smoking circle

1384
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,338
getting high and I asked him that I was

1385
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:37,619
I could affirm him as an activist I was

1386
00:57:35,338 --> 00:57:41,250
like hey you know I really felt your

1387
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:45,000
humor set us back a long time

1388
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:47,010
and he said I get that kid respectfully

1389
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,460
but you got to understand it was the

1390
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:52,770
darkest days of prohibition the only way

1391
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:55,559
we could get through with humor and I

1392
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:57,150
said much respect coming from you I get

1393
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,650
that because you have literally or than

1394
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:01,320
one of the few people have carved a

1395
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:03,750
reality out of nothing in the Hollywood

1396
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:06,120
and that's very difficult to do however

1397
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:10,050
the continued perpetuation of those

1398
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:12,839
stereotypes and prolonging them into the

1399
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:14,970
70 past the 70s into the 80s into the

1400
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:17,850
90s and into the now and now it's

1401
00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:21,359
disjointed are the problems you know

1402
00:58:17,849 --> 00:58:23,670
yeah well that's it I mean we didn't the

1403
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:25,950
understanding of cannabis in the 70s was

1404
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:27,420
not what it is now and that's why you

1405
00:58:25,949 --> 00:58:29,819
know in my first kind of opening

1406
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,889
statement I made there was we can't even

1407
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:35,490
talk about cannabis like we're talking

1408
00:58:31,889 --> 00:58:37,710
about it in 2008 today let alone you

1409
00:58:35,489 --> 00:58:39,299
know so yeah I love Cheech and Chong we

1410
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:41,940
had growing up all that stuff was great

1411
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:44,070
but but the time is death that's the

1412
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:47,130
whole problem the the understanding has

1413
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:49,410
changed the evidence behind the

1414
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:51,510
understanding is there and has changed

1415
00:58:49,409 --> 00:58:53,489
but the conversation hasn't and that's

1416
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:54,540
really where the problem is and that's

1417
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:55,829
what I see a lot of people doing in

1418
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:59,969
their local communities is they're

1419
00:58:55,829 --> 00:59:01,829
allowing really outdated tactics and

1420
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:03,869
arguments to be made about cannabis and

1421
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:06,900
how it's gonna be integrated or not in

1422
00:59:03,869 --> 00:59:10,230
our communities in a conversation that

1423
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:12,420
in 2017 is completely different if

1424
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:17,039
you're open and understand you know the

1425
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:19,079
the just wave of good data in science

1426
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:21,690
that it's just being done every day and

1427
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:22,949
coming at us like a tsunami you know if

1428
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:24,929
we can just keep up with just a little

1429
00:59:22,949 --> 00:59:26,549
bit of that you can see that a lot of

1430
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:29,129
the conversation is just old and

1431
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:31,500
outdated it doesn't even pertain anymore

1432
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:33,539
or shouldn't but unfortunately it's just

1433
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,099
prevalent in communities and it's

1434
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:37,139
continuing to be successful

1435
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:41,809
unfortunately we're seeing bands you

1436
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:41,809
know all over California in every County

1437
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:48,240
to Tommy you know when if you go see him

1438
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:50,969
and you go see him speak his memory is

1439
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:53,819
impeccable he's articulate you can tell

1440
00:59:50,969 --> 00:59:54,909
he's a smart guy and in that sense he's

1441
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:57,880
kind of show

1442
00:59:54,909 --> 01:00:00,129
that the stereotype maybe isn't a

1443
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:02,380
stereotype he's out living all of his

1444
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:05,680
contemporaries that were drinkers and

1445
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:09,490
smokers he survived cancer and beat it

1446
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:11,618
using cannabis so it's it's you know I'm

1447
01:00:09,489 --> 01:00:13,689
in that same boat of not liking the you

1448
01:00:11,619 --> 01:00:15,880
know back in the 70s absolutely I

1449
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:18,039
thought it was hilarious I was a huge

1450
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,809
fan of Cheech and Chong I just thought

1451
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:21,640
man these guys are and it's true you

1452
01:00:19,809 --> 01:00:23,440
know we were I was a very very little

1453
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:25,690
kid at that time I can't really

1454
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,789
understand what the mentality was some

1455
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:30,039
of the panelists can I'm sure it was

1456
01:00:27,789 --> 01:00:32,020
probably a pretty damn dark time after

1457
01:00:30,039 --> 01:00:35,230
Nancy Reagan came out and said just say

1458
01:00:32,019 --> 01:00:37,568
no was that in the 80s in the 70s so

1459
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:39,369
that was in the 80s so he did he did

1460
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:42,460
that in the early 70s they did it during

1461
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:43,539
Hamlet it was a comedy routine it was

1462
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:46,599
meant to be funny

1463
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:48,910
yeah and it was meant to be poking fun

1464
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:53,798
at ourselves I mean it's the classic

1465
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:55,899
example is it is art imitating life or

1466
01:00:53,798 --> 01:00:57,509
his life imitating art right I mean

1467
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,829
there was already kind of like a

1468
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:03,130
[Music]

1469
01:00:58,829 --> 01:01:06,160
Hispanic community in East LA that was

1470
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:09,068
just like Cheech right so and yeah they

1471
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:11,348
were all smoking weed and it was just it

1472
01:01:09,068 --> 01:01:13,150
was part of just the culture of who they

1473
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:14,859
are and it's just kind of like the

1474
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:15,789
deadheads and the fish-heads I mean you

1475
01:01:14,858 --> 01:01:18,519
know in a sense

1476
01:01:15,789 --> 01:01:21,430
look we mark you you remember we were

1477
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:24,579
able to smoke at fish shows or a dead

1478
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:26,769
shows in arenas where if during an ill

1479
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:29,710
young you took out one lighter you are

1480
01:01:26,769 --> 01:01:32,170
immediately swarmed by by security so

1481
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:34,298
what was it that Bill Graham was able to

1482
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:36,730
do why was why were the Bill Graham

1483
01:01:34,298 --> 01:01:39,099
shows when the Grateful Dead played why

1484
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:41,289
were they allowed to smoke weed at the

1485
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:42,940
venues and again if weed was being

1486
01:01:41,289 --> 01:01:45,220
smoked at the venues that means there

1487
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:48,909
was a traveling circus outside that was

1488
01:01:45,219 --> 01:01:50,798
bringing all kinds of different you know

1489
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:52,298
things and you know not just drugs but

1490
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:54,759
wares and everything like that so like

1491
01:01:52,298 --> 01:01:56,679
when the Dead came to town it was a real

1492
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:59,619
real traveling circus that actually

1493
01:01:56,679 --> 01:02:01,690
brought all kinds of you know not just

1494
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:04,180
creepy people but just weirdness into

1495
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:05,889
the town and and sometimes like in Vegas

1496
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:07,808
you would never even know that the dead

1497
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,269
were in town because Vegas is already

1498
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:10,430
pretty

1499
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:12,619
weird to begin with but I just go back

1500
01:02:10,429 --> 01:02:16,369
to teach and Chong just be more of a

1501
01:02:12,619 --> 01:02:18,589
reflection on society you know I'm of

1502
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:20,179
just I would compare them honestly now

1503
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:22,190
in a way that I've never really seen

1504
01:02:20,179 --> 01:02:24,730
before I would compare them to what Dave

1505
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:28,490
Chappelle came and did years later with

1506
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:31,219
stereotypical race humour and pushing

1507
01:02:28,489 --> 01:02:32,959
that envelope maybe into and and he got

1508
01:02:31,219 --> 01:02:34,489
the same thing he got like a lot of

1509
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,710
groups saying hey man you're not doing

1510
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:38,659
us any favors here we're trying to have

1511
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:39,349
people take us seriously but yet at the

1512
01:02:38,659 --> 01:02:41,929
time

1513
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:44,059
Chappelle's comedy was so disruptive and

1514
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:47,690
so hilarious and made us all think in a

1515
01:02:44,059 --> 01:02:50,329
different way that who's to say what's

1516
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:54,470
good and bad I suppose I would say Tommy

1517
01:02:50,329 --> 01:02:56,630
Chong when I think it was in 2016 so not

1518
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:58,279
too long a year-and-a-half ago or so the

1519
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:01,670
Sacramento Bee the Capitol here in

1520
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:03,920
California did a three-day story on my

1521
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:06,050
family in Silas they called it the Silas

1522
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,450
project you can look it up Sacramento

1523
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:10,880
Bee and Silas projects but the sheriff

1524
01:03:08,449 --> 01:03:13,309
had raided Silas is grow I was fighting

1525
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,070
here and raised in hell and they did a

1526
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:17,869
three-day story on that and Tommy Chong

1527
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:20,690
picked it up and shared it on his

1528
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:22,579
Twitter and all those things and that

1529
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:25,639
you know and it's still this day I don't

1530
01:03:22,579 --> 01:03:28,099
see a lot of that sort of posting coming

1531
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:29,869
from him and some some others but I

1532
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:33,170
definitely appreciated that and it

1533
01:03:29,869 --> 01:03:35,929
showed that he is keeping up on some of

1534
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:38,119
the other contexts that cannabis

1535
01:03:35,929 --> 01:03:41,509
activism is has taken shape in the last

1536
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:43,579
10 years and got a lot of attention from

1537
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:47,390
that because of him so mm-hmm

1538
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:51,139
Thanks is that Cheech Marin is heavily

1539
01:03:47,389 --> 01:03:53,869
involved in is establishing a a museum

1540
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:55,969
for Latino art in I think it's Riverside

1541
01:03:53,869 --> 01:03:58,279
California you can google it there was a

1542
01:03:55,969 --> 01:04:00,819
story a couple weeks ago in the news on

1543
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:04,250
it but again he's assembled the largest

1544
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:06,289
collection of of Latino art and he's now

1545
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:08,150
gonna you know basically I think they're

1546
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:11,840
looking to raise a couple million

1547
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:14,900
dollars to tourist library side I

1548
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:16,940
believe it is into basically a museum

1549
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:19,250
where this art can be shown so I mean

1550
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:21,599
these people are doing beneficial things

1551
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:23,519
in society they're not just yeah

1552
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,369
I think that you know the positions they

1553
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:29,159
played back in that you know comedy

1554
01:04:26,369 --> 01:04:31,469
routine they're actors man they're

1555
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:34,920
acting that part they're both really

1556
01:04:31,469 --> 01:04:36,959
really high intellect people with a lot

1557
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,470
more to contribute to society than just

1558
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:42,059
up in smoke you know they were just

1559
01:04:39,469 --> 01:04:45,539
portraying couple stoners in that movie

1560
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:47,340
well what other contexts could you do it

1561
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:51,029
in back then I mean the understanding

1562
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:52,320
the cannabis was pretty much enjoying it

1563
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:54,570
would have been some other comedy

1564
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:56,760
routine making fun of it so they were

1565
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:58,559
just making fun of her so if you go back

1566
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,790
and listen to their company routines on

1567
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,829
their first couple albums they're

1568
01:04:59,789 --> 01:05:03,539
actually [ __ ] hilarious

1569
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:06,269
and if you listen to it hi it's even

1570
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:10,380
better but I was actually one of the

1571
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:12,570
guys who had the big Ambu record album

1572
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:14,820
and inside the album they had a big

1573
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:17,160
bamboo rolling page I still have my I

1574
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:19,440
was one of the guys old enough to

1575
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:21,000
actually roll a joint in that paper it

1576
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,400
was about a quarter with worth of weed

1577
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,170
but we roll the joint a big brown

1578
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,480
Mexican weed that mean take the seeds

1579
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:29,190
out but we we smoked that I remember the

1580
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,869
teacher Chong joint that was a good and

1581
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:34,200
that last you have that album with the

1582
01:05:30,869 --> 01:05:37,319
paper skills papers those papers were

1583
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:39,839
made by Esmeralda at the time that that

1584
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:42,210
big album came out I know I bought ten

1585
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:46,740
of those albums and had those Esmeralda

1586
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:49,079
papers around for quite a long time oh

1587
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:54,259
yeah you have to clean the seeds out on

1588
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:57,989
the record album right you know high

1589
01:05:54,260 --> 01:06:00,810
modern tradition of having seeds just go

1590
01:05:57,989 --> 01:06:02,879
down the side of your record album as

1591
01:06:00,809 --> 01:06:04,230
you were cleaning out your weed you

1592
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,480
don't do that anymore but you know first

1593
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:12,119
people are afraid that's the whole deal

1594
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:15,719
I mean to paraphrase an idiot who is

1595
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:18,900
arguing with Trump right now the more

1596
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:20,699
afraid dogs are the louder they bark and

1597
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,200
you got you people in the committees

1598
01:06:20,699 --> 01:06:24,419
that are barking the lightest are the

1599
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:28,349
ones that are most fearful of this and

1600
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:30,480
until you find a way to placate those

1601
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:33,179
people are bringing them into the fold

1602
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:35,369
of understanding it's gonna be a

1603
01:06:33,179 --> 01:06:39,268
difficult fight because

1604
01:06:35,369 --> 01:06:41,849
there is fear of the unknown it's the

1605
01:06:39,268 --> 01:06:44,098
scariest thing that human beings have

1606
01:06:41,849 --> 01:06:46,619
and these people don't know and so

1607
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:47,940
they're afraid and well this is why I

1608
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:52,890
think they're fighting a losing battle

1609
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:55,470
because you can't you can only watch Fox

1610
01:06:52,889 --> 01:06:58,498
News or only watch CNN or only be red or

1611
01:06:55,469 --> 01:07:00,058
blue or however people like to sanction

1612
01:06:58,498 --> 01:07:03,419
off their information and you can only

1613
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:05,730
search for bad research that's been done

1614
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:08,338
over the last 20 years trying to find

1615
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:10,858
harmful effects of cannabis to reinforce

1616
01:07:08,338 --> 01:07:14,730
your views but illness is

1617
01:07:10,858 --> 01:07:17,909
non-discriminatory cancer hits one in

1618
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:20,219
three you know rare disease I'll be a

1619
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:23,009
rare is rather common you know when you

1620
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:25,078
have one in fifty thousand one in 300

1621
01:07:23,009 --> 01:07:27,838
thousand of a whole bunch of different

1622
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:29,519
rare diseases you know it hits people in

1623
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:32,639
all demographics and when that

1624
01:07:29,518 --> 01:07:34,588
experience happens that change is a

1625
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:36,929
ripple through their community you know

1626
01:07:34,588 --> 01:07:39,210
so when I get people from church groups

1627
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:41,159
who come with their kids seizing and

1628
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:43,199
they don't want their church to know but

1629
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:45,778
within six months their kids have

1630
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:47,460
relative stability and everyone's asking

1631
01:07:45,778 --> 01:07:49,139
the family why and they start to feel

1632
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:50,460
more and more confident to share them

1633
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:52,739
because they see that everything that

1634
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:54,389
they've known has not been 100 percent

1635
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:56,818
accurate and everything they've been

1636
01:07:54,389 --> 01:07:58,528
told that that's like a seed in that

1637
01:07:56,818 --> 01:08:00,268
community you know we get families from

1638
01:07:58,528 --> 01:08:02,880
the military and from the Sheriff's

1639
01:08:00,268 --> 01:08:07,008
Department who come in it's really

1640
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:09,269
hardcore ideologues but like we said

1641
01:08:07,009 --> 01:08:11,190
experience has a way of kicking your ass

1642
01:08:09,268 --> 01:08:13,858
and really changing the way you see the

1643
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:16,289
world and that's why anybody thinks

1644
01:08:13,858 --> 01:08:17,908
they're fighting cannabis from from

1645
01:08:16,289 --> 01:08:20,488
being around to be in uses of medicine

1646
01:08:17,908 --> 01:08:22,888
it's just has no idea what they're

1647
01:08:20,488 --> 01:08:24,658
talking about because it's just a

1648
01:08:22,889 --> 01:08:26,460
different conversation when it comes to

1649
01:08:24,658 --> 01:08:29,099
the the medical needs of cannabis and

1650
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:31,560
how it's gonna hit people whether you

1651
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:33,329
believe in it or not and when your

1652
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,770
doctor tells you there's no other option

1653
01:08:33,329 --> 01:08:36,420
the only thing that might help you is

1654
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:39,389
maybe some of these cannabinoid based

1655
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:40,889
therapies people's worlds are gonna

1656
01:08:39,389 --> 01:08:42,539
change and it changes within those

1657
01:08:40,889 --> 01:08:44,219
communities and I'm seeing it happen now

1658
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:46,619
I'm seeing whole church groups that were

1659
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:49,060
against us one year one of the kids in

1660
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:51,099
the in the group gets ill and

1661
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:52,300
the sudden everyone's experiences is

1662
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:55,240
different in their attitudes are

1663
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:57,069
different so have you sorry have you

1692
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:13,659

hilarious skit in my face cuz to me Wade

1694

1696

not getting into church and like just

1697
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:25,539

trying

1705
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:44,320
whereas myself I'm not gonna lie I have

1706
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:46,659
gotten fairly upset at my computer when

1707
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:49,090
I feel the responsibility of getting

1708
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:50,529
Church going even you know like having

1709
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:53,680

internet works and I can it's a it's a

1711
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:58,060
responsibility I'll tell you and have

1712
01:10:56,109 --> 01:11:00,609
you found it helped a lot when you got

1713
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:02,180
angry at your computer absolutely I feel

1714
01:11:00,609 --> 01:11:04,159
that when I get really

1715
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:07,220
angry with my computer and like break it

1716
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:09,680
right over my my face that's when I I

1717
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:11,840
just feel that things work out the best

1718
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:14,510
for me no absolutely not

1719

01:11:21,979 --> 01:11:25,909
a comment I wanted to make and this the

1724
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:28,730
duality of what you guys are talking

1725
01:11:25,909 --> 01:11:30,380
about you know California right now in

1726
01:11:28,729 --> 01:11:33,169
Northern California where I live is set

1727
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:35,779
to bury the [ __ ] country in cannabis

1728
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:37,850
and Keith I want to bury the country and

1729
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:39,889
week but I was at a restaurant on

1730
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:41,450
Tuesday afternoon having dinner I'm in a

1731
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:43,430
local place I like to eat at because

1732
01:11:41,449 --> 01:11:46,069
there's lots of tourists and I like

1733
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:47,659
people and like to talk so the lady

1734
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:50,389
asked me what I did for a living I told

1735
01:11:47,659 --> 01:11:52,460
him - I agree cannabis and I told her

1736
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:54,079
that I also sell my cannabis and raise

1737
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:55,460
money for Sick Children and she said

1738
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:58,309
well what does cannabis have to do with

1739
01:11:55,460 --> 01:12:00,020
children she was 55 years old up early

1740
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:02,000
mobile biga last diamond on her hand

1741
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:03,920
driving a BMW family full of yuppie wine

1742
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,689
drinkers and she looked at me and she

1743
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:10,100
said oh well does that work that's what

1744
01:12:08,689 --> 01:12:12,019
we're fighting in this country she is an

1745
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:14,000
intelligent articulate woman who was

1746
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:16,010
[ __ ] clueless that cannabis can help

1747
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,380
kids with autism and seizures and stuff

1748
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:20,060
and this is not this is not us you know

1749
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:22,430
this is not what I call us the stoner

1750
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:25,100
community or the fam community this is

1751
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:28,220
what I considered to be America she was

1752
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:29,690
clueless that cannabis could maybe help

1753
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,730
kids with seizures and stuff and of

1754
01:12:29,689 --> 01:12:33,919
course you can imagine the mouth full of

1755
01:12:31,729 --> 01:12:37,009
information she got from me she was

1756
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,810
backing up a little bit I just had to

1757
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:40,970
that's really what I'm seeing this week

1758
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:43,850
we are we are producing so much cannabis

1759
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:47,750
and medicine right now that we could

1760
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:50,120
treat the whole world and yet most

1761
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:52,670
Americans still think that a valium is

1762
01:12:50,119 --> 01:12:53,869
the cure to our problems I just wanted

1763
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:56,149
to point that out it got under my skin

1764
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:58,250
this week well there's definitely a

1765
01:12:56,149 --> 01:13:00,679
system that's been put in place for that

1766
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:03,890
all to be the way it is and it seems as

1767
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:07,550
though people will only hear it when

1768
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:09,470
they're told it by particular you know

1769
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:12,110
the people they trust the anchor on the

1770
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:14,780
news or the newspaper that they hope one

1771
01:13:12,109 --> 01:13:16,059
person at a time just like every well

1772
01:13:14,779 --> 01:13:18,460
you can see how

1773
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:20,320
that's going mark Sheldon whereas when

1774
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:22,239
they want everyone to know something

1775
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:25,000
they put it into their little media

1776
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:27,760
system and it's just like wham four

1777
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,039
billion people in one shot it's like

1778
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:34,480
great isn't it great when you finally do

1779
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:37,810
like talk to sort of random strangers on

1780
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:41,349
the way back from the airport in the

1781
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:43,690
shuttle to people that yeah you meet

1782
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:47,050
wherever when they ask what is it that

1783
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:48,909
you do and in order to tell them to

1784
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:51,070
describe that no this isn't you know

1785
01:13:48,909 --> 01:13:53,529
Cheech and Chong and getting high this

1786
01:13:51,069 --> 01:13:56,979
is really about medicine and the

1787
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:58,920
reunification of human beings with this

1788
01:13:56,979 --> 01:14:01,629
plant because until the last century

1789
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:04,149
which as Todd used to say is the

1790
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:09,369
cannabis deficient century humans were

1791
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:11,889
you know United with this plant so this

1792
01:14:09,369 --> 01:14:14,319
is just the reunification century and

1793
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:16,630
well so it is a mission of education and

1794
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:19,479
it is sometimes one person at a time

1795
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:23,140
I've talked to people again who had no

1796
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:25,509
clue I got their email address and then

1797
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:28,270
I sent them like the Missoula movie sent

1798
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:29,800
them links - Church sent them links so

1799
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:32,260
they could actually see for their cells

1800
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:34,989
no there are clinical trials there is

1801
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:38,170
validity to taking this thing to the

1802
01:14:34,989 --> 01:14:41,439
next level and yeah I mean so winning

1803
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:43,180
people over one at a time it I think 10

1804
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:45,939
years and from now this will be a mute

1805
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:47,980
discussion but I hope so though and I

1806
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:51,899
would also say we should always

1807
01:14:47,979 --> 01:14:53,769
represent as weak someone's got a

1808
01:14:51,899 --> 01:14:55,960
reverberation in the microphone there

1809
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:58,660
I'm not sure who's not muted but I think

1810
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:00,880
it just disappeared I always got to give

1811
01:14:58,659 --> 01:15:02,619
props to the stoner community - for

1812
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,270
being the stewards for so long and

1813
01:15:02,619 --> 01:15:06,039
basically who you know who the heck do

1814
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:08,320
you think came up with all this who

1815
01:15:06,039 --> 01:15:09,699
started digging and digging and learning

1816
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:11,649
all this information it was people who

1817
01:15:09,699 --> 01:15:14,470
were using cannabis oh my goodness to

1818
01:15:11,649 --> 01:15:16,629
get high to feel euphoria to feel

1819
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:20,440
positive to relieve stress to be like

1820
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:22,750
yeah so as as much as the stereotype is

1821
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:26,529
we should always also respect the the

1822
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:29,039
actual experience of feeling elevated

1823
01:15:26,529 --> 01:15:31,109
feeling the so called high it's not

1824
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:33,180
bad thing it shouldn't be a bad word we

1825
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:37,109
shouldn't be embarrassed by it because

1826
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:39,600
it is how it's the thing that has kept

1827
01:15:37,109 --> 01:15:42,659
it alive because you know you know for

1828
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:44,610
cannabis to be around in the way that it

1829
01:15:42,659 --> 01:15:46,710
is for people like Wendy Turner to get

1830
01:15:44,609 --> 01:15:48,329
cannabis for her son Colton and for

1831
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:51,119
people like Forrest and meet people like

1832
01:15:48,329 --> 01:15:53,340
Wade it's like people who were getting

1833
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:55,769
high who were the stewards of that

1834
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:58,650
planet for all those decades you know

1835
01:15:55,770 --> 01:16:01,110
you can call it medicine it is but it's

1836
01:15:58,649 --> 01:16:04,289
it was it was that euphoria that that

1837
01:16:01,109 --> 01:16:06,779
got a lot of us involved passionately to

1838
01:16:04,289 --> 01:16:11,789
the point where as you won receptors

1839
01:16:06,779 --> 01:16:13,649
right yeah so I was prevailing receptor

1840
01:16:11,789 --> 01:16:15,750
or one of the most prevalent receptors

1841
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:17,729
in the human brain so I mean that's not

1842
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:20,520
a happy accident and we were talking

1843
01:16:17,729 --> 01:16:22,409
last week with Chris at the fountain of

1844
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,240
youth you know I did a little bit of

1845
01:16:22,409 --> 01:16:27,449
research into that I'm absolutely

1846
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:29,369
convinced that when people smoked

1847
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:31,710
cannabis before they really understood

1848
01:16:29,369 --> 01:16:33,510
the biological impacts and then the

1849
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:35,250
cannabinoid system think about when

1850
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:39,420
Native people smoked it probably for the

1851
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:43,500
first time and felt like no more pain or

1852
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:46,319
no more anxiety or they probably did say

1853
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:49,250
hey this could make me live forever

1854
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:52,289
right this is the Fountain of Youth I

1855
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:55,409
always think of John's quote where he

1856
01:16:52,289 --> 01:17:00,289
said it's hard to feel bad when you feel

1857
01:16:55,409 --> 01:17:03,180
good well said yeah interest said that

1858
01:17:00,289 --> 01:17:04,949
like a year ago on hostage he's like

1859
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:06,450
it's hard to feel bad when you feel good

1860
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:09,090
now it's just like wow that's just so

1861
01:17:06,449 --> 01:17:12,420
simple and that's about as accurate and

1862
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:14,940
that's it it's profound yeah so the

1863
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:19,949
terpenes drew us in and the cannabinoids

1864
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:21,569
made us stay that's my quote me let me

1865
01:17:19,949 --> 01:17:23,069
share something else with the panel is

1866
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:26,009
uh and there's some people here that

1867
01:17:23,069 --> 01:17:28,109
don't know so I have um and this is new

1868
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:30,060
to me this is I just find this cool so I

1869
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:33,089
have alpha one it's a respiratory

1870
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:35,010
disease so liver disease my my white

1871
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:36,480
blood cells attack my internal organs

1872
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:39,119
and I don't I don't have a protein that

1873
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:40,019
protects it so I'm I'm dissolving from

1874
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:42,329
the inside out

1875
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:42,870
so I quit using cannabis when they told

1876
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:45,569
me I had

1877
01:17:42,869 --> 01:17:46,769
lung problems for a long time some

1878
01:17:45,569 --> 01:17:48,269
people that know me closer know I had a

1879
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:52,470
bout with alcoholism and all kind of

1880
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:54,540
drugs and everything 292 days clean of

1881
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:57,659
all drugs right now except for cannabis

1882
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:59,699
but this is my point when I when I when

1883
01:17:57,659 --> 01:18:01,619
I started using cannabis again I really

1884
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:04,319
obviously like wow why the [ __ ] did I

1885
01:18:01,619 --> 01:18:06,930
quit using this but recently my diseases

1886
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:09,689
just really kicking my ass the pain I

1887
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:11,010
experienced it's just brutal and you

1888
01:18:09,689 --> 01:18:12,869
know we talk about the benefits of

1889
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:14,850
cannabis and I'm so cool and I smoke

1890
01:18:12,869 --> 01:18:16,529
weed all the time but the last couple of

1891
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:19,350
days I've actually noticed like just

1892
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:21,359
brutal pain from this disease and then

1893
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:23,640
I'll smoke a couple of bowls which for

1894
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:26,130
me it's really weird because my smoke it

1895
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:28,590
hurts like [ __ ] it hurts my lungs I

1896
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:29,970
can't breathe it makes me panic a little

1897
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:33,210
bit because my lungs not in great

1898
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:35,850
condition but follow me here about five

1899
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:40,079
minutes afterwards when my lungs recover

1900
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:42,810
from the carcinogens of my life all of a

1901
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:45,569
sudden doesn't suck my panic goes away

1902
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:48,330
in in and all these feelings that I have

1903
01:18:45,569 --> 01:18:49,819
from this illness this horrible pain and

1904
01:18:48,329 --> 01:18:52,890
it causes all throughout the whole body

1905
01:18:49,819 --> 01:18:54,090
it just goes away and I mean it's funny

1906
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:55,890
that I've been an advocate for this

1907
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:59,940
plant for so long but I'm telling you

1908
01:18:55,890 --> 01:19:01,590
again today that even though it's tough

1909
01:18:59,939 --> 01:19:04,529
for me to consume the plant but if the

1910
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:06,690
smoke and I consumed mine the benefit

1911
01:19:04,529 --> 01:19:10,079
that I get from this plant mentally

1912
01:19:06,689 --> 01:19:12,599
emotionally spiritually overcomes

1913
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:14,729
anything that he could do to me because

1914
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,560
I have to consume smoke and he in the

1915
01:19:14,729 --> 01:19:19,649
last week or two it is like I'm just

1916
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,600
like oh god I'm in such pain let me take

1917
01:19:19,649 --> 01:19:24,000
a couple of hits of this wax I dunno

1918
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,890
like hey I mean I want to put on some

1919
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,289
[ __ ] Stephen Stills and enjoy life

1920
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:31,980
and so I just had to say that I mean

1921
01:19:28,289 --> 01:19:35,069
after 45 years of smoking it still does

1922
01:19:31,979 --> 01:19:38,129
what I needed to do that's why I'm fond

1923
01:19:35,069 --> 01:19:40,409
of it that's awesome man and I guess the

1924
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:41,909
vaporizing is just not happening for you

1925
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:43,829
it's just not strong enough it's not

1926
01:19:41,909 --> 01:19:47,489
giving you that relief that a good blast

1927
01:19:43,829 --> 01:19:49,920
gives you it's um the problem mark is my

1928
01:19:47,489 --> 01:19:52,949
lungs only in will move like a like a

1929
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:55,670
quarter of an inch so I can't empty the

1930
01:19:52,949 --> 01:19:58,010
damn bag same thing than email

1931
01:19:55,670 --> 01:20:00,949
I can't inhale long enough so I use a

1932
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:03,350
teeny ball and a teeny teeny teeny

1933
01:20:00,948 --> 01:20:05,329
height and then I just smoke like the

1934
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:07,489
tiniest piece of wax I drop the teeny

1935
01:20:05,329 --> 01:20:09,769
piece of wax I don't even use add a

1936
01:20:07,488 --> 01:20:12,049
brick it melts and flows down but the

1937
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:13,900
amount of smoke I get that teeny amount

1938
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:16,670
of smoke I get from these great

1939
01:20:13,899 --> 01:20:19,250
concentrates we make after I say after

1940
01:20:16,670 --> 01:20:21,199
my lungs go cool the smokes going like

1941
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:23,750
right now I got how about 15 minutes ago

1942
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:27,799
and life changed I mean when I left the

1943
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:29,119
house I was like 20 pounds I'm going

1944
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:31,489
through a divorce and you like just

1945
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:33,920
[ __ ] it I smoked a couple bowls and

1946
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:38,019
I'm like hey let's get our hash Church

1947
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:40,100
and hang out with my friends they should

1948
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:42,080
cool we should get together and talk and

1949
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:44,150
see if we can you set up with a good

1950
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:46,429
supplement regiment because I've talked

1951
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:47,599
more than a few people who have only

1952
01:20:46,429 --> 01:20:49,969
experienced cannabis and cannabis

1953
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:51,679
medicine through smoking have their life

1954
01:20:49,969 --> 01:20:53,869
completely changed with a good

1955
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:55,550
supplement regiment and supplement

1956
01:20:53,869 --> 01:20:57,469
consistent supplement dose and I'd be

1957
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:59,779
happy to put some things together and

1958
01:20:57,469 --> 01:21:01,189
talk to you about some new ways you

1959
01:20:59,779 --> 01:21:03,380
could approach that that could introduce

1960
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:04,879
new types of relationships that might

1961
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:09,829
really help some of the things you're

1962
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:12,800
going through as well yeah I this is

1963
01:21:09,829 --> 01:21:14,719
Wade I want to say yeah I used fingers

1964
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,779
quite a bit so cool because

1965
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:20,329
yeah I've smoked most of my life and I

1966
01:21:17,779 --> 01:21:22,759
can't smoke enough cannabis to get the

1967
01:21:20,329 --> 01:21:24,380
thing that I want and long ago I started

1968
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:28,400
that in hash to what I was smoking and

1969
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:30,289
still it abuses my lungs good as much as

1970
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:32,659
I want and so I supplement with

1971
01:21:30,289 --> 01:21:34,969
tinctures and you can find tinctures

1972
01:21:32,659 --> 01:21:36,710
that are made that taste good for you

1973
01:21:34,969 --> 01:21:40,730
and meantime have significant enough

1974
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:42,948
dose that I find it's as good I mean I

1975
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:45,109
smoked because I enjoy smoking at this

1976
01:21:42,948 --> 01:21:48,799
point not because it's adding to my

1977
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:51,229
cannabinoid levels in my blood

1978
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:55,039
Forest tells me sometimes that I maybe

1979
01:21:51,229 --> 01:21:59,569
have too high a cannabinoid thing go on

1980
01:21:55,039 --> 01:22:02,329
in my blood but I enjoy the state of

1981
01:21:59,569 --> 01:22:04,880
being that I work for and I get a lot of

1982
01:22:02,329 --> 01:22:07,670
it from tinctures and occasionally I

1983
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,498
have a chocolate or something but yeah I

1984
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:12,769
can't get there with just smoke anymore

1985
01:22:09,498 --> 01:22:15,828
yeah mister you know some mr. buzzkill

1986
01:22:12,769 --> 01:22:18,498
sometimes go ahead sir no force well I

1987
01:22:15,828 --> 01:22:20,420
want to explore this um so and I'm gonna

1988
01:22:18,498 --> 01:22:21,889
every time I talk on me I sound like I'm

1989
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:23,389
going to a coup feel special but it's

1990
01:22:21,889 --> 01:22:26,029
not like that these are just the facts

1991
01:22:23,389 --> 01:22:28,460
I'm super [ __ ] high-strung this

1992
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:31,179
illness has really got me I used to take

1993
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:33,859
20 values a day now I dump let's smoke

1994
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:35,420
high quality bubble hash all day long

1995
01:22:33,859 --> 01:22:38,179
Jill said yesterday you realize you got

1996
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:40,248
lung disease you smoke yeah I like it so

1997
01:22:38,179 --> 01:22:42,529
I take a thousand milligrams of cannabis

1998
01:22:40,248 --> 01:22:45,738
every night and a form of a peppermint

1999
01:22:42,529 --> 01:22:48,050
pattie or I would not sleep at all and I

2000
01:22:45,738 --> 01:22:49,518
think and you said something I think I

2001
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:52,369
have too much damn cannabis not long

2002
01:22:49,519 --> 01:22:56,619
like like for real like I smoke

2003
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:59,839
constantly and I eat constantly

2004
01:22:56,618 --> 01:23:02,029
I've never tried concentrated Rick

2005
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:05,538
Simpson all like made from something

2006
01:23:02,029 --> 01:23:07,340
that'll really put me down but I want to

2007
01:23:05,538 --> 01:23:09,139
talk about tolerance I mean you said

2008
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:10,969
you've eaten glycerin all your life and

2009
01:23:09,139 --> 01:23:13,340
tinctures and stuff I mean how many

2010
01:23:10,969 --> 01:23:15,529
people are you know like me they're in

2011
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:17,929
their 40s or 50s and they use canvas all

2012
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:20,179
their life for medicine and as you said

2013
01:23:17,929 --> 01:23:22,190
you just can't smoke enough anymore or a

2014
01:23:20,179 --> 01:23:24,618
tincture I mean what is what is what is

2015
01:23:22,189 --> 01:23:26,808
the solution of that fell off well I

2016
01:23:24,618 --> 01:23:28,368
mean yeah understanding what tolerance

2017
01:23:26,809 --> 01:23:31,670
is I think is really important for

2018
01:23:28,368 --> 01:23:33,198
everybody I'm sure mark could add a lot

2019
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:36,859
to this so if I miss something let me

2020
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:38,719
know but tolerance is essentially it's

2021
01:23:36,859 --> 01:23:41,929
good to understand the physiology of

2022
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:44,889
phyto cannabinoids and essentially to

2023
01:23:41,929 --> 01:23:47,210
boil it down simply as as they mimic

2024
01:23:44,889 --> 01:23:48,889
endogenous cannabinoids so the body has

2025
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:52,489
a hard time telling the difference

2026
01:23:48,889 --> 01:23:54,440
between the two so th sees chemical

2027
01:23:52,488 --> 01:23:56,058
structures so closely resembles an and

2028
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:58,788
amide that when it bonds to the cb1

2029
01:23:56,059 --> 01:24:01,219
receptor the body thinks it's the signal

2030
01:23:58,788 --> 01:24:03,859
from an anthem ID it acts accordingly we

2031
01:24:01,219 --> 01:24:05,229
get miracle responses in the body right

2032
01:24:03,859 --> 01:24:07,698
we don't get the consequences of

2033
01:24:05,229 --> 01:24:10,099
neurotransmitter rate regulation gone

2034
01:24:07,698 --> 01:24:13,399
wild so when you're flooding your body

2035
01:24:10,099 --> 01:24:15,409
with high doses of THC your body has

2036
01:24:13,399 --> 01:24:17,748
more than one safety mechanism and it's

2037
01:24:15,408 --> 01:24:19,670
your endocannabinoids system is a safety

2038
01:24:17,748 --> 01:24:21,559
mechanism really it's job is to trigger

2039
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:22,590
and respond to things that are going

2040
01:24:21,559 --> 01:24:25,440
wrong in the bar

2041
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:28,679
specifically when you're flooding your

2042
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:30,719
body with THC other safety mechanisms

2043
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:34,230
start to trigger in one of those is the

2044
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:36,179
body's observance of over-and-under

2045
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:38,009
production of an and mind so it starts

2046
01:24:36,179 --> 01:24:40,679
to think wow I must be really over

2047
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:42,780
producing endocannabinoids because I

2048
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:46,109
look at all this an and amide in my

2049
01:24:42,779 --> 01:24:48,118
stream even though it's so what it

2050
01:24:46,109 --> 01:24:50,759
starts to do is it starts to

2051
01:24:48,118 --> 01:24:52,609
down-regulate cb1 receptors which means

2052
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:55,679
it starts to shut them off and

2053
01:24:52,609 --> 01:24:57,689
essentially what happens is it's not the

2054
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,520
people with high tolerance are able to

2055
01:24:57,689 --> 01:25:02,158
just handle a bunch of cannabis

2056
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,380
they just can't absorb the cannabis so

2057
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:05,848
they're urinating it out and it's

2058
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:08,520
flushing out the body in other ways

2059
01:25:05,849 --> 01:25:11,340
because your body is a safety mechanism

2060
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:13,800
has turned off a large majority of the

2061
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:16,199
cb1 receptors and this is where the

2062
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:18,210
concept of a reset comes in with some

2063
01:25:16,198 --> 01:25:20,698
people so and when you pull them when

2064
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:22,679
you withhold the phyto cannabinoids from

2065
01:25:20,698 --> 01:25:24,598
the body all of a sudden the body says

2066
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:26,219
oh my god I've quit producing all this

2067
01:25:24,599 --> 01:25:28,560
in an demise something must be wrong

2068
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:31,649
and it starts to upregulate and turn in

2069
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:34,230
turn on all the cb1 receptors

2070
01:25:31,649 --> 01:25:35,549
essentially so you can if you find that

2071
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:36,928
you're in a place where you built up a

2072
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:38,849
lot of tolerance what you've done is

2073
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:40,770
you've shut down a lot of cb1 receptors

2074
01:25:38,849 --> 01:25:42,560
and you can find that if you can get

2075
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:45,540
those to up regulate and turn back on

2076
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:47,670
you can get just as much of a feeling

2077
01:25:45,539 --> 01:25:51,630
with less cannabis because you're able

2078
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:53,699
to absorb more so you can lower the dose

2079
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:56,460
without losing some of the effect that

2080
01:25:53,698 --> 01:25:58,829
you like but it takes time to allow the

2081
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:00,408
body to up regulate those receptors but

2082
01:25:58,829 --> 01:26:02,939
when I say time you know we're talking

2083
01:26:00,408 --> 01:26:06,000
there are some studies have shown 72

2084
01:26:02,939 --> 01:26:07,979
hours you know but you know a week is

2085
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,039
more than enough a lot of times to have

2086
01:26:07,979 --> 01:26:12,359
that sort of effect force can I tell one

2087
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:14,069
of my stories you know I'm famous for

2088
01:26:12,359 --> 01:26:17,519
stories do I tell one of my story that's

2089
01:26:14,069 --> 01:26:20,460
Marcus's show you guys ask him it's

2090
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:23,280
short it's short so when I am when I got

2091
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:25,198
popped the second time and did my little

2092
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:27,809
jaunt up in a can and everything I was

2093
01:26:25,198 --> 01:26:31,888
under lock and key for around 19 months

2094
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:34,920
and before before I left I had sent

2095
01:26:31,889 --> 01:26:36,739
Jilly about an eighth of Jack's cleaner

2096
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:38,989
and about an 8:15

2097
01:26:36,739 --> 01:26:41,630
to organ as we were supposed to meet the

2098
01:26:38,989 --> 01:26:43,489
day before they grabbed me so she put

2099
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:46,640
some of it away and bless her heart

2100
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:48,529
forever and when I got out there was

2101
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:50,360
more time I had to pee for all you know

2102
01:26:48,529 --> 01:26:52,130
that you know the game but then there

2103
01:26:50,359 --> 01:26:54,199
became a day when I was allowed to get

2104
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:55,010
high again for the first time in almost

2105
01:26:54,199 --> 01:26:57,199
two years

2106
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:59,960
and is this a guy who smokes you know

2107
01:26:57,199 --> 01:27:02,449
full-time all the time and so I'm in my

2108
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:04,579
head I'm that guy so Jill's making

2109
01:27:02,449 --> 01:27:05,929
dinner and we get the weed out if

2110
01:27:04,579 --> 01:27:08,869
there's only a couple grams left she's

2111
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:10,909
saved and so I take one hit of the Danny

2112
01:27:08,869 --> 01:27:12,170
Boy I'm telling you right now before I

2113
01:27:10,909 --> 01:27:14,300
finish the story I should have [ __ ]

2114
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:16,159
stopped there but but then I took

2115
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:18,650
another hit about Jack's cleaner that

2116
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:22,300
lemony freshness and she went into the

2117
01:27:18,649 --> 01:27:24,289
kitchen and I got so high like

2118
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:25,940
uncomfortably like every person that

2119
01:27:24,289 --> 01:27:27,380
ever came to my house in Florida I got

2120
01:27:25,939 --> 01:27:30,049
up so stoned they got lost when they

2121
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:32,329
left it was like instant karma payback

2122
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:34,670
the Jill was talking like Charlie

2123
01:27:32,329 --> 01:27:37,430
Brown's teacher walk walk walk walk I

2124
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:39,319
couldn't talk I couldn't communicate and

2125
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:41,360
my favorite part of the story was until

2126
01:27:39,319 --> 01:27:43,549
the next day that I can actually

2127
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:45,529
communicate help [ __ ] stoned I

2128
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:47,360
actually got cuz I got going I'm really

2129
01:27:45,529 --> 01:27:49,219
alright I'm really hard she kept going

2130
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:51,339
oh good good the next morning I was like

2131
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:54,110
look the house was flying through space

2132
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:56,630
so that that I mean I guess all my

2133
01:27:54,109 --> 01:27:59,359
receptors reset my body went back to a

2134
01:27:56,630 --> 01:28:01,069
virgin state and and the other funny

2135
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:03,589
part about this story is for about six

2136
01:28:01,069 --> 01:28:05,090
months every time I got hot pass out and

2137
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:07,369
she would go I thought this guy was some

2138
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:09,440
hardcore stoner or some [ __ ] and it took

2139
01:28:07,369 --> 01:28:11,329
four or five months before I could

2140
01:28:09,439 --> 01:28:14,059
function again as a normal person

2141
01:28:11,329 --> 01:28:16,789
smoking cannabis I doesn't know I like

2142
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:19,940
that story two years off that's a

2143
01:28:16,789 --> 01:28:21,920
substantial a break for sure the last

2144
01:28:19,939 --> 01:28:23,899
thing I would just add so cool and again

2145
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,909
let's let's get in touch after the show

2146
01:28:23,899 --> 01:28:27,710
and I'm gonna help and I can even send

2147
01:28:25,909 --> 01:28:29,599
you some things is that there is a

2148
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:32,510
completely new experience people have

2149
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:35,300
when you keep sustained levels of

2150
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:37,520
healing cannabinoids in the body for a

2151
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:39,770
two to three-week period of time right

2152
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:41,150
and when as opposed to what we're used

2153
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:43,010
to which are these blasts which are

2154
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:45,439
spiking waves get these big increases

2155
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:47,810
these decreases and you can continue to

2156
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:50,399
do that but when you keep a supplement

2157
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:52,410
level sustain level in the body differ

2158
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:55,529
types of reactions start to happen and

2159
01:28:52,409 --> 01:28:56,819
in we at this point I've seen so many

2160
01:28:55,529 --> 01:28:59,519
amazing results in different conditions

2161
01:28:56,819 --> 01:29:02,069
that you know you get more and more

2162
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:03,990
confident saying just I would highly

2163
01:29:02,069 --> 01:29:06,119
doubt that it would not have some sort

2164
01:29:03,989 --> 01:29:09,779
of improvement in your in your condition

2165
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:11,519
and a lot of times it's just it's a

2166
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:13,829
different type of relationship you know

2167
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,450
and but when when you experience it it

2168
01:29:13,829 --> 01:29:16,920
just shows how much we still have to

2169
01:29:15,449 --> 01:29:18,329
learn about this amazing plant in

2170
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:21,690
different ways we can integrate it into

2171
01:29:18,329 --> 01:29:24,029
our lives forest I appreciate it I will

2172
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:26,339
definitely take you up on this it's the

2173
01:29:24,029 --> 01:29:28,710
anxiety level and I ain't gonna go off

2174
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:32,369
again the problem with alpha and and and

2175
01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:34,890
cannabis is so Friday I felt great I

2176
01:29:32,369 --> 01:29:36,779
started harvesting my [ __ ] there's teeth

2177
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:39,420
falling all over the place my condition

2178
01:29:36,779 --> 01:29:41,699
feels pretty good I feel normal and this

2179
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:44,069
is I'm digressing into personal shipping

2180
01:29:41,699 --> 01:29:45,510
but then when it hits it's just a whammy

2181
01:29:44,069 --> 01:29:47,399
like like last night I couldn't take

2182
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:50,460
three steps without gas praying and

2183
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:52,409
panning so I don't move very fast and I

2184
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:54,270
honestly believe that it's not just

2185
01:29:52,409 --> 01:29:56,430
alpha I believe that is a panic

2186
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:58,260
condition I believe my lungs are

2187
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:58,680
vibrating or whatever the hell's going

2188
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:00,930
on

2189
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:03,810
and I can't breathe and so exasperates

2190
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:05,850
itself enough always believed if I could

2191
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:09,750
get an infusion of cannabis at that time

2192
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:12,030
whatever cannabinoid works from cbn or

2193
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:13,649
whatever the hell it is if I could get

2194
01:30:12,029 --> 01:30:15,750
an infusion of cannabis at that time

2195
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:17,909
without taking a giant hit of hash and

2196
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:20,130
the lungs that are already trashed I

2197
01:30:17,909 --> 01:30:21,989
think I could get much better results

2198
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:24,119
than sitting there and I told you I gave

2199
01:30:21,989 --> 01:30:26,609
up drugs so when I have a full-blown

2200
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:28,559
panic attack I cease your attack the

2201
01:30:26,609 --> 01:30:30,929
only tool I have right now is I went to

2202
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:33,930
a class that taught me how to not get

2203
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:36,000
myself to be present not to be past or

2204
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:39,420
future trip and I can actually take a

2205
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,189
panic attack and not lose my mind but

2206
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:43,920
God would it be cool if I had a liquid

2207
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:47,069
or something that I could consume that

2208
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,210
would act fast to bring that down you're

2209
01:30:47,069 --> 01:30:53,639
telling me there's something available

2210
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:56,399
oh well yeah kava kava extract sub I

2211
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:59,640
expected somebody for a friend who was

2212
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:01,710
having serious anxiety and it's not a

2213
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:04,349
very big yield it's a beautiful golden

2214
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:07,198
oil and just a tiny dot of it

2215
01:31:04,349 --> 01:31:10,349
on the end of a flat Chinese chopstick

2216
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:13,198
will bring a speed freak down to ground

2217
01:31:10,349 --> 01:31:15,479
in ten minutes it's the hottest thing

2218
01:31:13,198 --> 01:31:20,998
since sunburn when it comes to anxiety

2219
01:31:15,479 --> 01:31:24,599
I'll be like almond extract by the kava

2220
01:31:20,998 --> 01:31:27,269
and I'll expect it for you how the

2221
01:31:24,599 --> 01:31:30,418
extract is is amazing and you know it

2222
01:31:27,269 --> 01:31:34,378
that in but we've also seen with PTSD

2223
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:35,878
and other issues the the the problem is

2224
01:31:34,378 --> 01:31:36,988
is it's learning how to look at it in a

2225
01:31:35,878 --> 01:31:39,568
little bit of a different way where

2226
01:31:36,988 --> 01:31:41,968
we're reactive with cannabis right now

2227
01:31:39,569 --> 01:31:44,760
so we have an experience and we go to

2228
01:31:41,969 --> 01:31:47,399
cannabis for that reactive response and

2229
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:49,048
and with a lot of these supplement

2230
01:31:47,399 --> 01:31:51,929
health approaches that can be used with

2231
01:31:49,048 --> 01:31:54,359
cannabis it's a proactive response right

2232
01:31:51,929 --> 01:31:56,969
so instead of we using cannabis and

2233
01:31:54,359 --> 01:31:58,588
looking forward in time to how you're

2234
01:31:56,969 --> 01:32:01,828
gonna feel in a few minutes or an hour

2235
01:31:58,588 --> 01:32:04,078
we want to look at supplementing these

2236
01:32:01,828 --> 01:32:06,268
cannabinoids in the body in a way where

2237
01:32:04,078 --> 01:32:08,728
we look backwards so it's we look back

2238
01:32:06,269 --> 01:32:11,010
and say okay how many anxiety attacks

2239
01:32:08,729 --> 01:32:12,389
did I have in the last 30 days we get a

2240
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:14,069
good journal of that and see what we

2241
01:32:12,389 --> 01:32:16,439
have and we start to work with these

2242
01:32:14,069 --> 01:32:17,879
supplements for two-three weeks and then

2243
01:32:16,439 --> 01:32:20,039
we look back over that period of time

2244
01:32:17,878 --> 01:32:24,149
and we measure how many did we have well

2245
01:32:20,038 --> 01:32:26,009
gosh I only had three as opposed to 17

2246
01:32:24,149 --> 01:32:29,309
okay we're on the right track and it's

2247
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:32,729
just a it's a different type of process

2248
01:32:29,309 --> 01:32:34,199
and it's a different type of it takes a

2249
01:32:32,729 --> 01:32:36,019
little more time right it's not

2250
01:32:34,198 --> 01:32:38,038
something that it's it's immediate but

2251
01:32:36,019 --> 01:32:42,059
I've seen it time and time again

2252
01:32:38,038 --> 01:32:44,759
especially with PTSD am sort of things I

2253
01:32:42,059 --> 01:32:48,838
serious anxiety attacks and those sort

2254
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:50,280
of things that it absolutely can benefit

2255
01:32:48,838 --> 01:32:52,168
and I think you're absolutely right I

2256
01:32:50,279 --> 01:32:54,298
mean if you are in a state of panic and

2257
01:32:52,168 --> 01:32:56,099
you're concerned about your health all

2258
01:32:54,298 --> 01:32:58,168
those things modulate your

2259
01:32:56,099 --> 01:32:59,849
endocannabinoids system and your

2260
01:32:58,168 --> 01:33:01,498
endocannabinoids systems job is to

2261
01:32:59,849 --> 01:33:03,418
regulate the things in the body that

2262
01:33:01,498 --> 01:33:04,679
prevent panic attacks and prevents these

2263
01:33:03,418 --> 01:33:07,198
other things from happening so they're

2264
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:09,899
all tied in together which is you know

2265
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:12,148
why I advocate everybody being on a

2266
01:33:09,899 --> 01:33:14,849
supplement of CBD and certain other

2267
01:33:12,149 --> 01:33:16,160
cannabinoids THC being one of them CBC

2268
01:33:14,849 --> 01:33:18,619
etc

2269
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:21,019
because like an omega-3 you know because

2270
01:33:18,619 --> 01:33:23,809
it does have this proactive preventive

2271
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:25,880
ability to help the body ride through

2272
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:29,210
heavy times of stress that we might not

2273
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:32,329
see coming all sorts of things so anyway

2274
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:33,949
we don't have to keep sometimes I hate

2275
01:33:32,329 --> 01:33:36,289
speaking in front of really smart people

2276
01:33:33,949 --> 01:33:37,970
but I'm gonna head and do it now one of

2277
01:33:36,289 --> 01:33:39,680
the things that I mean would think I

2278
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:41,150
would know this stuff but this show is

2279
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:45,289
definitely about education so let's

2280
01:33:41,149 --> 01:33:47,839
learn together so I have the recently I

2281
01:33:45,289 --> 01:33:49,189
had the opportunity to be a judge for

2282
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,650
the High Times Cannabis Cup and that

2283
01:33:49,189 --> 01:33:52,879
gave me the hash we could talk a whole

2284
01:33:51,649 --> 01:33:54,649
show about that but that's not what

2285
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:58,579
we're talking about they gave me CBD

2286
01:33:54,649 --> 01:34:01,339
medicals like 35 kinds of CBD medals and

2287
01:33:58,579 --> 01:34:03,439
that was the most CBD I've ever consumed

2288
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:05,960
in my life and the two things that I

2289
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:08,059
noticed that surprised me was it did not

2290
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:09,890
sedate me at all

2291
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:11,539
like I thought if I took four or five

2292
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:13,270
hundred milligrams of CBD but at

2293
01:34:11,539 --> 01:34:15,079
nighttime I would go to bed but

2294
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:17,540
absolutely not

2295
01:34:15,079 --> 01:34:21,109
the other thing and you talked about

2296
01:34:17,539 --> 01:34:23,869
looking backwards and I want to tell you

2297
01:34:21,109 --> 01:34:27,609
that during that time I think my head

2298
01:34:23,869 --> 01:34:29,869
was clearer and I think I felt smarter

2299
01:34:27,609 --> 01:34:31,670
what what do you think of those

2300
01:34:29,869 --> 01:34:32,800
observations about high quantities of

2301
01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:37,670
CBD

2302
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:39,829
yeah you grew brain cells well I mean we

2303
01:34:37,670 --> 01:34:43,340
see across the board and this is one of

2304
01:34:39,829 --> 01:34:44,960
the myths I like to to dispel a lot of

2305
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:47,510
the concern with cannabis is right the

2306
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:50,480
effects on children and learning and

2307
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:52,579
does it decrease IQ points or not I can

2308
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:54,439
tell you without a shadow of a doubt but

2309
01:34:52,579 --> 01:34:56,569
again we're working with developmentally

2310
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:58,729
delayed and severe conditions but we see

2311
01:34:56,569 --> 01:35:01,219
across-the-board cognitive improvement

2312
01:34:58,729 --> 01:35:03,799
in kids we have kids who I mean

2313
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:06,199
sometimes dramatic from not speaking to

2314
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:09,590
starting to form words and starting to

2315
01:35:06,199 --> 01:35:12,260
use one word sounds you know so severe

2316
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:13,970
conditions but from kids take Silas for

2317
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:16,280
example from kids at times he's a

2318
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:18,829
one-word kid you know he can't really

2319
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:20,779
structure sentences together and as his

2320
01:35:18,829 --> 01:35:22,159
brain gets healthier and when we

2321
01:35:20,779 --> 01:35:24,109
introduce cannabinoids all of a sudden

2322
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:25,579
we were getting full sentences out of

2323
01:35:24,109 --> 01:35:27,319
him like he would say things we'd built

2324
01:35:25,579 --> 01:35:29,719
turn and look like it had to be another

2325
01:35:27,319 --> 01:35:31,788
kid you know so

2326
01:35:29,719 --> 01:35:34,609
I'm a hundred percent on the train of

2327
01:35:31,788 --> 01:35:36,920
when you improve neuro cognition

2328
01:35:34,609 --> 01:35:39,889
function neurotransmitter regulation in

2329
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:41,929
the brain when the body is able to work

2330
01:35:39,889 --> 01:35:44,630
you know homeostasis isn't just a

2331
01:35:41,929 --> 01:35:48,139
buzzword when it's able to be in the

2332
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:50,078
proper balance there's no reason to

2333
01:35:48,139 --> 01:35:52,010
think that the functioning of your

2334
01:35:50,078 --> 01:35:54,018
physiological system is going to be

2335
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:56,119
better in that that also includes the

2336
01:35:54,019 --> 01:35:58,849
function of the brain and in cognition

2337
01:35:56,118 --> 01:36:01,518
so I'm not one that has to be convinced

2338
01:35:58,849 --> 01:36:04,998
I see it every day all that turns around

2339
01:36:01,519 --> 01:36:06,949
the ability to pay attention if kids

2340
01:36:04,998 --> 01:36:09,559
can't pay attention because they're so

2341
01:36:06,948 --> 01:36:11,388
involved with what else is going on in

2342
01:36:09,559 --> 01:36:13,880
their body and the irritation is so

2343
01:36:11,389 --> 01:36:16,699
great they can't pay attention so you

2344
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:19,069
might miss take that for the for not

2345
01:36:16,698 --> 01:36:20,419
developing but a minute they can pay

2346
01:36:19,069 --> 01:36:22,399
attention the minute they can actually

2347
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:24,649
get some relief and start paying

2348
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:27,138
attention they advanced rapidly just

2349
01:36:24,649 --> 01:36:28,939
like any other being this business of

2350
01:36:27,139 --> 01:36:31,010
being able to pay attention it's

2351
01:36:28,939 --> 01:36:34,969
something that we don't pay enough

2352
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:36,769
attention to in our society morning I

2353
01:36:34,969 --> 01:36:39,229
was gonna talk to you when you're just

2354
01:36:36,769 --> 01:36:41,449
saying about the high melted CBD I just

2355
01:36:39,229 --> 01:36:43,159
good morning guys one something I just

2356
01:36:41,448 --> 01:36:44,839
went through this dude like I was having

2357
01:36:43,158 --> 01:36:46,788
a lot of problems with my knees and

2358
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:48,860
stuff like that and I'm not really I

2359
01:36:46,788 --> 01:36:50,719
take CBD but I don't take high amounts

2360
01:36:48,859 --> 01:36:52,308
of it and they had these CBD bites and

2361
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:54,679
it was at the High Times Cannabis Cup

2362
01:36:52,309 --> 01:36:56,210
here and they gave me a bag full of CBD

2363
01:36:54,679 --> 01:36:58,550
edibles and stuff like that just like

2364
01:36:56,210 --> 01:37:00,679
you said and I can see and I was able to

2365
01:36:58,550 --> 01:37:01,880
run up the stairs like I was just kind

2366
01:37:00,679 --> 01:37:03,380
of relaying when he said that to me I

2367
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:05,510
was like [ __ ] I just that's what I'm

2368
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:08,179
diggin shitty bags beside me right now

2369
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:10,849
my I had all these CBD bites and they

2370
01:37:08,179 --> 01:37:13,489
were so good and they were 250 rounds of

2371
01:37:10,849 --> 01:37:15,199
bite out of time but I can totally

2372
01:37:13,488 --> 01:37:17,359
relate to that so I started eating more

2373
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:20,928
and higher amounts of CBD right now and

2374
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:23,658
I'm Korean and me at all I'm getting

2375
01:37:20,929 --> 01:37:25,519
more done I'm more active I'm getting

2376
01:37:23,658 --> 01:37:25,969
into do more things so going back to

2377
01:37:25,519 --> 01:37:27,769
rehab

2378
01:37:25,969 --> 01:37:29,868
like I Center in the gym for my injuries

2379
01:37:27,769 --> 01:37:31,670
into tai chi and stuff but I've been

2380
01:37:29,868 --> 01:37:33,828
eating a lot amount of high CBD now for

2381
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:35,479
the last month just like over the

2382
01:37:33,828 --> 01:37:38,029
thousand milligrams a day and it's oxy

2383
01:37:35,479 --> 01:37:40,460
make me feel pretty good that's part of

2384
01:37:38,029 --> 01:37:41,779
the cannabis education you know we the

2385
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:43,640
cloud you're set we're trying to provide

2386
01:37:41,779 --> 01:37:46,069
is that being present

2387
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:47,990
aware of your own body right it's not

2388
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:49,909
gonna hit you like a steamroller in

2389
01:37:47,989 --> 01:37:51,760
certain applications of cannabis

2390
01:37:49,909 --> 01:37:54,199
medicine you actually have to observe

2391
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,640
and pay attention but sometimes when

2392
01:37:54,199 --> 01:37:58,579
you're observing and present in your

2393
01:37:55,640 --> 01:38:00,680
body and looking you notice miraculous

2394
01:37:58,579 --> 01:38:01,789
effects that can kind of you just miss

2395
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:03,710
because you feel good you're doing

2396
01:38:01,789 --> 01:38:05,630
something else and you don't notice that

2397
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:07,010
you didn't have that same pain that

2398
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:09,109
would have been there because it didn't

2399
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:10,250
occur and that's why a lot of people who

2400
01:38:09,109 --> 01:38:12,649
are really trying to deal with chronic

2401
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:14,989
issues the number one thing I recommend

2402
01:38:12,649 --> 01:38:17,569
is that they're journaling their

2403
01:38:14,989 --> 01:38:19,670
incidents right how many incidents are

2404
01:38:17,569 --> 01:38:23,449
you having how intense are they so that

2405
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:27,109
you can look back and look at it you

2406
01:38:23,449 --> 01:38:28,970
know with an impartial view of seeing

2407
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:30,769
exactly what was occurring because we

2408
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:32,449
distort things in our mind we get busy

2409
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:33,920
we're going off and when we feel good

2410
01:38:32,449 --> 01:38:36,019
sometimes we just don't notice so then

2411
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,390
we quit on the treatments or we don't

2412
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:40,640
continue as maybe a supplement that

2413
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:41,840
really benefitted our lives and then all

2414
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:43,940
of a sudden the pains back you know

2415
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:46,489
because we're not just being present and

2416
01:38:43,939 --> 01:38:48,679
observing and treating it like the

2417
01:38:46,489 --> 01:38:50,239
medicine it is that it needs to be

2418
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:52,460
maintained and there's some work in

2419
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:53,329
there but when you can really approach

2420
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:55,640
it that way

2421
01:38:53,329 --> 01:38:57,979
observe your body be present journal and

2422
01:38:55,640 --> 01:39:00,440
log the incidents so you can see what is

2423
01:38:57,979 --> 01:39:03,289
and isn't working you can really dial in

2424
01:39:00,439 --> 01:39:05,599
a system that can have huge benefits on

2425
01:39:03,289 --> 01:39:07,729
quality alive but it is a proactive

2426
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,410
approach as opposed to a lot of our

2427
01:39:07,729 --> 01:39:12,529
experience with cannabis was just more

2428
01:39:09,409 --> 01:39:15,769
reactive and immediate I noticed from

2429
01:39:12,529 --> 01:39:19,639
taking 1/2 a teaspoon of CBD a day that

2430
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:21,440
I have I've been doing that for a past 4

2431
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:23,240
or 5 months now and one of the things

2432
01:39:21,439 --> 01:39:25,579
I've noticed over a period of time of

2433
01:39:23,239 --> 01:39:29,269
doing it is a tremendous feeling of

2434
01:39:25,579 --> 01:39:31,760
well-being that I find in my body that I

2435
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:33,680
didn't have before and I just feel I

2436
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:35,780
wake up in the morning and I feel

2437
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:40,220
well-being and I get up and I've got

2438
01:39:35,779 --> 01:39:43,420
energy and my three titanium cages in my

2439
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:46,159
back aren't hurting me and my frozen

2440
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:47,930
sciatic nerve from the titanium cages

2441
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:51,769
isn't bothering me and I had this

2442
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:53,570
feeling of well-being and so I gravitate

2443
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:55,490
I eat a have a spoon of it every single

2444
01:39:53,569 --> 01:39:57,359
day because it leaves me with that

2445
01:39:55,489 --> 01:40:00,210
feeling of well-being I

2446
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:02,880
you can call that a hi if you want to

2447
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:05,189
look at it a certain way I know that Sam

2448
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:09,000
doesn't feel like you get a high off CBD

2449
01:40:05,189 --> 01:40:10,769
but the feeling of well-being is it goes

2450
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,500
back to my original statement it's hard

2451
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:15,660
to feel bad when you're feeling good and

2452
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:18,270
so I would love to share a funny story

2453
01:40:15,659 --> 01:40:20,519
on myself about how I learned this thing

2454
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:25,650
we were talking about the effect of high

2455
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:27,600
CBD dosing back and it has to do a

2456
01:40:25,649 --> 01:40:33,299
tincture sub cool

2457
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:36,150
we were making a from ac/dc a tincture

2458
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:38,579
that was really high in CBD not much THC

2459
01:40:36,149 --> 01:40:41,939
at all and we'd gotten it to where we

2460
01:40:38,579 --> 01:40:44,630
had 350 milligrams of CBD and that a

2461
01:40:41,939 --> 01:40:47,189
little half fluid ounce bottle like this

2462
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:49,590
this is an example of it I don't know if

2463
01:40:47,189 --> 01:40:52,619
you can make it out but yeah anyway

2464
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:54,449
early version of it the top wasn't very

2465
01:40:52,619 --> 01:40:57,979
good and I had one in my pocket

2466
01:40:54,449 --> 01:41:01,380
and I was sitting on a bench outside and

2467
01:40:57,979 --> 01:41:03,449
a long story short the top of the bottle

2468
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:07,619
came off and it poured out on the bench

2469
01:41:03,449 --> 01:41:09,750
and I'd put a lot of effort into making

2470
01:41:07,619 --> 01:41:13,829
that tincture and having it and I was

2471
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:16,319
really wanting to it was a tragedy to me

2472
01:41:13,829 --> 01:41:17,670
that if they'd fallen on the bench and I

2473
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:24,960
got down on my hands and knees and

2474
01:41:17,670 --> 01:41:28,649
licked it all up off the bench I'll tell

2475
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:31,470
you what sleep that night I felt I it

2476
01:41:28,649 --> 01:41:34,559
was amazing within about an hour like I

2477
01:41:31,470 --> 01:41:36,690
have used my body pretty hard in my life

2478
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,880
I don't have any serious conditions

2479
01:41:36,689 --> 01:41:40,259
really other than glaucoma which is what

2480
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,800
brought me to cannabis in the first

2481
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:45,449
place

2482
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:48,480
but yeah I felt better I could not sleep

2483
01:41:45,449 --> 01:41:49,889
that night so cool you said something

2484
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:51,389
like that earlier night that's what made

2485
01:41:49,890 --> 01:41:54,119
me think of this story I couldn't sleep

2486
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:55,860
but I had a great night

2487
01:41:54,119 --> 01:41:59,430
I've caught up on some reading I've been

2488
01:41:55,859 --> 01:42:02,699
one to do the next day I got up I was

2489
01:41:59,430 --> 01:42:04,920
ready to go oh I had a great day by that

2490
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:08,010
afternoon I took a nap woke up that

2491
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:10,239
afternoon took dinner and went back to

2492
01:42:08,010 --> 01:42:13,180
sleep slept all night man

2493
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:16,090
was really soon and ever since then yeah

2494
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:19,690
I've tried to keep some I found actually

2495
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:21,789
that small doses of CBD still in the

2496
01:42:19,689 --> 01:42:23,979
acid form which is a little bit hard to

2497
01:42:21,789 --> 01:42:26,890
do but in a tincture you can preserve

2498
01:42:23,979 --> 01:42:29,589
them still in the acid form and small

2499
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:33,100
dosing actually works pretty well for me

2500
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:36,010
I'm taking probably 20 25 milligrams a

2501
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:38,590
day over the course of the day a few

2502
01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:41,140
drops at a time of a tincture like that

2503
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:43,569
and it really helps a lot with my

2504
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:45,490
general sense of well-being is how I

2505
01:42:43,569 --> 01:42:47,979
think of it it's more of a physical

2506
01:42:45,489 --> 01:42:49,659
experience than a psychoactive one

2507
01:42:47,979 --> 01:42:52,059
there's right yeah I think there's

2508
01:42:49,659 --> 01:42:55,359
really no psychoactive aspect to it

2509
01:42:52,060 --> 01:43:01,420
other than how good it can feel to feel

2510
01:42:55,359 --> 01:43:04,509
good feeling of well-being has to bleed

2511
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:07,060
back through your entire sensory network

2512
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:11,320
in your body in order for you to have it

2513
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:16,630
so literally that means your whole body

2514
01:43:11,319 --> 01:43:19,719
is saying kudos to you and that's how

2515
01:43:16,630 --> 01:43:23,380
the sensation of feeling good comes on

2516
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:25,510
and it's the same when you feel bad when

2517
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:29,440
you feel bad your entire body is telling

2518
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:31,690
you you're feeling bad and hey some make

2519
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:34,989
yourself up elbow dammit and I'll come

2520
01:43:31,689 --> 01:43:37,449
and get you some Bratton but anyway look

2521
01:43:34,989 --> 01:43:40,059
look when when when when I have my own

2522
01:43:37,449 --> 01:43:41,979
home again and people don't get yelled

2523
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:45,480
at for coming to my house you can come

2524
01:43:41,979 --> 01:43:48,129

2527
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:54,640
pretty cool so I'm a wound up guy and

2528
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,399
I'm also through nerd and I thought

2529
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:58,960
maybe I loved ink so I thought I would

2530
01:43:57,399 --> 01:44:01,210
put my money where my mouth is this week

2531

flowers having a blast I just learned to

2562
01:45:34,149 --> 01:45:40,510
change temperatures often different

2563
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:42,398
strains but I have as I mentioned I'm

2564

Keef so last night I did a pressing

2567
01:45:47,229 --> 01:45:53,679
about 150 degrees I had a blowout

2568
01:45:51,969 --> 01:45:54,819
because I didn't position the bag right

2569
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:56,708
and I actually ended up putting the

2570
01:45:54,819 --> 01:45:58,748
whole blowout back in a bag and making

2571
01:45:56,708 --> 01:46:00,188
something really nice but but what I

2572
01:45:58,748 --> 01:46:02,648
wanted from you when we're pressing

2573
01:46:00,189 --> 01:46:04,989
super high-quality Keef and I'm talking

2574
01:46:02,649 --> 01:46:07,989
about Keith it keep when you put in a

2575
01:46:04,988 --> 01:46:09,788
jar after a few minutes it becomes hash

2576
01:46:07,988 --> 01:46:12,178
can you tell me I say what you're

2577
01:46:09,788 --> 01:46:14,469
holding can you tell me like what

2578
01:46:12,179 --> 01:46:17,649
temperatures and times would you mind

2579
01:46:14,469 --> 01:46:19,658
sharing that with me for lift not bubble

2580
01:46:17,649 --> 01:46:21,699
the sift right well this was actually

2581
01:46:19,658 --> 01:46:24,938
some sift that we pro know this was

2582
01:46:21,698 --> 01:46:27,339
bubble actually sift it depends on the

2583
01:46:24,939 --> 01:46:30,249
on how how how much moisture is present

2584
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:32,019
in it and how how clean that you've

2585
01:46:30,248 --> 01:46:33,340
gotten it because that'll also affect

2586
01:46:32,019 --> 01:46:36,039
the moisture

2587
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:39,429
and so for me I get asked constantly

2588
01:46:36,039 --> 01:46:42,250
what my numbers are but they change

2589
01:46:39,429 --> 01:46:44,980
depending on what I'm running so for

2590
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:46,988
sift you know if it was if it was really

2591
01:46:44,979 --> 01:46:49,709
sticky and kind of had a moisture

2592
01:46:46,988 --> 01:46:53,529
content and I might hit it as high as

2593
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:55,899
200 degrees and you know if less

2594
01:46:53,529 --> 01:46:58,408
moisture I'll go for a longer time at a

2595
01:46:55,899 --> 01:47:01,420
lower temperature like 180 or something

2596
01:46:58,408 --> 01:47:03,698
and pressure on hash like like with

2597
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:05,710
flowers I don't have a ton and then it's

2598
01:47:03,698 --> 01:47:07,269
hung and I pump it on my butt but when

2599
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:10,179
you're dressed a little teeny packet of

2600
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:11,860
whites if that was just harvested a

2601
01:47:10,179 --> 01:47:14,590
couple of days ago this is a delicate

2602
01:47:11,859 --> 01:47:16,118
thing so ya go over pressures you're not

2603
01:47:14,590 --> 01:47:17,619
smashing the [ __ ] out of it well you

2604
01:47:16,118 --> 01:47:19,299
know what that that's why there's

2605
01:47:17,618 --> 01:47:24,339
different ways there are there's the

2606
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:26,230
electric generator that's not an an air

2607
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:28,779
compressor that's like two grand us

2608
01:47:26,229 --> 01:47:31,178
that's the butter that's the best then

2609
01:47:28,779 --> 01:47:35,229
there's the air compressor with the foot

2610
01:47:31,179 --> 01:47:37,420
pedal then there is the hand pump which

2611
01:47:35,229 --> 01:47:39,218
is vert I like the hand pump in the m1

2612
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:40,868
I've been using that a lot lately so

2613
01:47:39,219 --> 01:47:44,230
that my unfortunate thing is that I

2614
01:47:40,868 --> 01:47:47,500
don't have a pressure gauge between my

2615
01:47:44,229 --> 01:47:49,959
pump and my m1 right now but I can tell

2616
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:55,539
you from past I've always hit around 80

2617
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:57,189
psi is what I have my my compressor set

2618
01:47:55,539 --> 01:47:59,979
out when I'm using a compressor and I

2619
01:47:57,189 --> 01:48:03,149
hit it you know I hit it pretty hard I

2620
01:47:59,979 --> 01:48:06,879
prefer getting the majority of my of my

2621
01:48:03,149 --> 01:48:09,399
squish in one shot so we did this one

2622
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:11,469
the other day and it was over 90% of

2623
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:14,649
what there was to squish and we did this

2624
01:48:11,469 --> 01:48:16,539
at 200 degrees you can see it didn't

2625
01:48:14,649 --> 01:48:19,539
affect the color by any means it's very

2626
01:48:16,539 --> 01:48:22,149
chirpy smells amazing this is seedsman

2627
01:48:19,539 --> 01:48:26,109
haze it's just reeks like Turkey no lean

2628
01:48:22,149 --> 01:48:31,149
it's beautiful hey what's going on Josh

2629
01:48:26,109 --> 01:48:37,868
and Kelly hey family all good nice to

2630
01:48:31,149 --> 01:48:40,929
see everyone today hey guys nice just

2631
01:48:37,868 --> 01:48:44,380
sitting on the porch sitting on the

2632
01:48:40,929 --> 01:48:46,000
porch enjoying some daylight yeah we're

2633
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:47,079
hoping to get some sunshine on her face

2634
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,510
here in a moment

2635
01:48:47,079 --> 01:48:52,000
now it looks like it's gonna be a sunny

2636
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:53,770
day here as well but I have to get out

2637
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,739
obviously maybe in the next couple hours

2638
01:48:53,770 --> 01:48:58,930
I'll make my way out onto the house

2639
01:48:56,739 --> 01:49:02,769
sound for some of the last boating of

2640
01:48:58,930 --> 01:49:05,530
the season as we fall into fall awesome

2641
01:49:02,770 --> 01:49:08,230
I love fall in British Columbia but I

2642
01:49:05,529 --> 01:49:10,960
love winter a lot more so fall is kind

2643
01:49:08,229 --> 01:49:13,629
of us like its shoulder season for us

2644
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:20,230
yeah it's wading through the mud until

2645
01:49:13,630 --> 01:49:23,199
the snow falls shoulder season so how

2646
01:49:20,229 --> 01:49:25,389
are things going in the Kootenays really

2647
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:28,840
amazing we've had a really tremendous

2648
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:31,180
year despite all of the that we've had

2649
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:33,819
we've had a really nice dry hot summer

2650
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:36,520
so it's been really helpful for all of

2651
01:49:33,819 --> 01:49:38,139
our crops you know we could have not

2652
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:40,330
done with the smoke that was pretty

2653
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:41,740
awful but we were thankful that we

2654
01:49:40,329 --> 01:49:43,539
didn't have brain all summer like the

2655
01:49:41,739 --> 01:49:47,170
past three summers and we didn't have

2656
01:49:43,539 --> 01:49:49,210
ash falling off on Oliver all over all

2657
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:51,659
of our herb or anything so that was nice

2658
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:56,380
we have a lot of it in greenhouses and

2659
01:49:51,659 --> 01:49:58,510
we've gotten a few rainstorms but pretty

2660
01:49:56,380 --> 01:50:01,300
dry and sweet out so yeah a lot of

2661
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:03,550
flowers amazing food all of the food

2662
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:05,199
Gardens have rest themselves on ways

2663
01:50:03,550 --> 01:50:08,289
that you know we haven't seen in a

2664
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:12,699
really long time and the fruit trees

2665
01:50:08,289 --> 01:50:14,739
apple trees are over abundant and yeah

2666
01:50:12,699 --> 01:50:16,179
we're making lots of food saving it so

2667
01:50:14,739 --> 01:50:18,369
we need to build another root cellar

2668
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:21,940
basically yeah yeah we're collecting all

2669
01:50:18,369 --> 01:50:25,720
the food but we don't have anywhere to

2670
01:50:21,939 --> 01:50:27,159
put it right now we could definitely I

2671
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:29,409
was open Tony would be here I like to

2672
01:50:27,159 --> 01:50:32,260
find out something about Puerto Rico but

2673
01:50:29,409 --> 01:50:34,809
uh yeah I'm wondering how they are

2674
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:37,869
actually because they just got smashed

2675
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:41,200
so hard I haven't heard anything back

2676
01:50:37,869 --> 01:50:44,890
same with dr. William Courtney and his

2677
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:46,659
wife are in Dominica oh yeah also got

2678
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:49,450
hit pretty hard and they haven't been in

2679
01:50:46,659 --> 01:50:52,149
touch so everyone's sort of hoping that

2680
01:50:49,449 --> 01:50:54,159
all of well everyone on those Caribbean

2681
01:50:52,149 --> 01:50:54,779
islands is okay it's kind of a scary

2682
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:58,319
thing

2683
01:50:54,779 --> 01:51:00,529
having that ripped through Herman and

2684
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:04,309
Jose

2685
01:51:00,529 --> 01:51:06,019
yeah well heading there so we usually do

2686
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:08,420
to disaster relief and a lot of the

2687
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:10,940
organizations that we work with might be

2688
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:12,619
heading down so as of yesterday there's

2689
01:51:10,939 --> 01:51:14,269
big conversations that we might be

2690
01:51:12,619 --> 01:51:15,800
headed down with a group to go help

2691
01:51:14,270 --> 01:51:19,100
women and children in this one we'll

2692
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:22,520
find out in the next week well right

2693
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:24,350
just work a little bit weird yeah we

2694
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:27,130
figured we'd just be sandals on the

2695
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:30,350
ground helping out you know what I mean

2696
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:37,069
sandals on the ground sounds like your

2697
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:41,450
people there Sam who's that guy wearing

2698
01:51:37,069 --> 01:51:43,909
Birkenstocks it's it's winter you know

2699
01:51:41,449 --> 01:51:45,019
it's uh it's you guys mentioned

2700
01:51:43,909 --> 01:51:48,079
something earlier though if you don't

2701
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:50,420
mind me asking kind of a disco so

2702
01:51:48,079 --> 01:51:52,579
there's going to be about I don't know a

2703
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:54,890
couple of hundred tons of I think

2704
01:51:52,579 --> 01:51:58,460
they're calling it campfire oh gee is

2705
01:51:54,890 --> 01:52:01,400
the joke so this is this is cannabis

2706
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:03,439
that is smoke flavored bacon flavored

2707
01:52:01,399 --> 01:52:05,779
and you know you know people are not

2708
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:09,379
going to throw it away you know this is

2709
01:52:05,779 --> 01:52:12,889
going to be part of the 2017 season is

2710
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:15,770
Ash and and smoke flavor cannabis so is

2711
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:29,480
anybody seen any of this coming out it's

2712
01:52:15,770 --> 01:52:30,680
for the patients up right it's so when

2713
01:52:29,479 --> 01:52:32,269
you work it it won't have any flavor

2714
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:34,670
that makes good sense so you can just

2715
01:52:32,270 --> 01:52:36,590
turn it into if it's distilled that the

2716
01:52:34,670 --> 01:52:38,420
distillation was done probably and it's

2717
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:40,489
clean it shouldn't have any flavor

2718
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:42,710
whatsoever right I didn't think of that

2719
01:52:40,489 --> 01:52:45,439
and I don't know if you guys know if

2720
01:52:42,710 --> 01:52:47,510
you've been watching us here we're not a

2721
01:52:45,439 --> 01:52:49,519
typical harvest here mark I think he

2722
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:51,230
would be really impressed so we are

2723
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:53,510
harvesting some giant colas for the

2724
01:52:51,229 --> 01:52:55,219
market our our garden is a charity card

2725
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:57,710
and we have four families that we're

2726
01:52:55,220 --> 01:53:00,530
going to give $2,500 to if we can get it

2727
01:52:57,710 --> 01:53:02,090
to market but I have a 6x6 gorilla tent

2728
01:53:00,529 --> 01:53:04,699
with an air conditioner in it and I have

2729
01:53:02,090 --> 01:53:06,980
mr. bond flying out on the third we have

2730
01:53:04,699 --> 01:53:09,199
three giant freezers and we also have

2731
01:53:06,979 --> 01:53:11,449
Frenchie cannoli coming out so we're

2732
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:13,970
hashing the garden I mean we chop it we

2733
01:53:11,449 --> 01:53:14,300
put it in freezers or we chop it and we

2734
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:16,429
put it

2735
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:18,110
Frenchie's little spinny machinee thingy

2736
01:53:16,429 --> 01:53:20,359
because i want to see some simple balls

2737
01:53:18,109 --> 01:53:22,639
out of my own garden and you know i

2738
01:53:20,359 --> 01:53:25,189
don't know i'm sure people are doing it

2739
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:26,960
but we're actively hashing like a

2740
01:53:25,189 --> 01:53:28,698
seven-year 80 pound garden because i

2741
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:30,289
don't have anywhere to hang that much

2742
01:53:28,698 --> 01:53:32,359
weed I just want to turn it into hatch

2743
01:53:30,289 --> 01:53:39,439
so I thought you'd like that

2744
01:53:32,359 --> 01:53:41,868
I am absolutely in 100% full support of

2745
01:53:39,439 --> 01:53:43,519
you hashing your garden I'm in support

2746
01:53:41,868 --> 01:53:46,098
of everyone hashing their gardens I

2747
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:48,349
always grew my garden to hash it just

2748
01:53:46,099 --> 01:53:50,420
because well I

2749
01:53:48,349 --> 01:53:53,029
it's the hash that I was looking for on

2750
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:55,420
the plant so it seemed to be make the

2751
01:53:53,029 --> 01:53:59,779
most sense to go right right for it

2752
01:53:55,420 --> 01:54:01,489

2758
01:54:09,828 --> 01:54:14,689
times as nice and soft and good as

2759

comes to talk we'll call it injuries

2770
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:03,828
balls versus French cheese balls

2771
01:55:00,578 --> 01:55:06,558

2773
01:55:06,559 --> 01:55:12,650
nicest balls because stops going to hit

2774
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:16,368
both of those balls falls at balls and

2775
01:55:12,649 --> 01:55:16,879
he'll let us know somebody repaint them

2776
01:55:16,368 --> 01:55:20,328
already

2777
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:22,250
indras called balls by the way yes are

2778
01:55:20,328 --> 01:55:23,899
you guys I'm gonna cut out thank you

2779
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:25,969
guys for letting me take over a minute

2780
01:55:23,899 --> 01:55:27,589
learn lots of stuff you'll laugh since

2781
01:55:25,969 --> 01:55:28,039
you guys are talking about CBD I don't

2782
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:30,980
happen

2783
01:55:28,039 --> 01:55:32,989
have any CBD so I drove my ass to Sonoma

2784
01:55:30,979 --> 01:55:37,039
patient group and I'm gonna go in here

2785
01:55:32,989 --> 01:55:38,750
and get me some CBD do it really quick

2786
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:40,579
if you're gonna hash your whole garden

2787
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:42,739
like that with Frenchie might I hope you

2788
01:55:40,579 --> 01:55:45,439
have a good worm farm start because all

2789
01:55:42,739 --> 01:55:48,559
that all that leaf matter is just the

2790
01:55:45,439 --> 01:55:53,299
best worm food yeah I was talking to

2791
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:56,750
ballin last night about I was talking to

2792
01:55:53,300 --> 01:56:00,860
bond last night about how to properly

2793
01:55:56,750 --> 01:56:02,630
lasagna the motto all I'm gonna use this

2794
01:56:00,859 --> 01:56:05,539
stuff called earthshine on my 400 gallon

2795
01:56:02,630 --> 01:56:07,970
pots which dissolves the roots so we're

2796
01:56:05,539 --> 01:56:09,829
gonna pile most of our bulk leaf

2797
01:56:07,970 --> 01:56:12,320
cannabis the stuff we can't sell to the

2798
01:56:09,829 --> 01:56:14,779
cookie makers on top of the pots and

2799
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:17,359
then cover it with straw and let that

2800
01:56:14,779 --> 01:56:18,949
act it's like a kind of a compost things

2801
01:56:17,359 --> 01:56:20,779
that dissolve everything in those four

2802
01:56:18,949 --> 01:56:23,149
hundreds over the season so we're

2803
01:56:20,779 --> 01:56:25,099
absolutely gonna put as much carbon from

2804
01:56:23,149 --> 01:56:26,750
the plant back into our garden we can

2805
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:29,000
that's the way to go you could probably

2806
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:31,010
throw some worms in there too over the

2807
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,750
winter and they would come alive I mean

2808
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:34,909
they would stay alive and propagate just

2809
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:37,100
just break it down stagger add to it on

2810
01:56:34,909 --> 01:56:38,960
it I've got it if you guys sent me

2811
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:40,789
follow me so I became a worm farmer this

2812
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:43,159
year and I learned that worm farming is

2813
01:56:40,789 --> 01:56:47,960
as much work as cannabis so I have these

2814
01:56:43,159 --> 01:56:49,519
giant bins out back in my house that we

2815
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:51,590
work every day for a long time but then

2816
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:53,120
we got busy so now I went down the other

2817
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:55,310
day thinking that my worms were probably

2818
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:58,309
dead and whoa they're not but what I

2819
01:56:55,310 --> 01:56:59,990
have is three boxes of slime it used to

2820
01:56:58,310 --> 01:57:02,510
be eggs and garbage and stuff and I have

2821
01:56:59,989 --> 01:57:04,969
a million worms so I figured I would put

2822
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:07,460
like a double handful in each pot before

2823
01:57:04,970 --> 01:57:10,880
I put the hay down and they'll be good

2824
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:12,529
to go that's the way to go good job I

2825
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:14,989

01:58:20,229 --> 01:58:24,399
to have sub stop in and share a little

2854
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:26,559
bit of his time I mean the guy is

2855
01:58:24,399 --> 01:58:28,479
definitely busy when you know every time

2856
01:58:26,559 --> 01:58:30,460
he comes in Sunday morning is in this

2857
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:33,658
car driving like I got to go to the

2858
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:38,078
garden just gonna harvest 120 pounds

2859
01:58:33,658 --> 01:58:40,689
alright well that's good I like making

2860
01:58:38,078 --> 01:58:44,920
his own worms and and worm castings can

2861
01:58:40,689 --> 01:58:48,578
be an issue because commercial worm

2862
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:51,099
farms often feed their worms with grains

2863
01:58:48,578 --> 01:58:52,868
and they don't have a proper way of

2864
01:58:51,099 --> 01:58:56,380
vetting the grains to know that there's

2865
01:58:52,868 --> 01:58:58,179
no glyphosate in there and it's easily

2866
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:59,859
it's possible and I bet if you test a

2867
01:58:58,179 --> 01:59:03,279
lot of the worm castings commercial that

2868
01:58:59,859 --> 01:59:05,469
are on the on the market you'll find

2869
01:59:03,279 --> 01:59:08,590
glyphosate and other residues in there

2870
01:59:05,469 --> 01:59:11,319
so what you feed the worms is absolutely

2871
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:13,389
crucial and it's not just getting worm

2872
01:59:11,319 --> 01:59:15,849
castings as being a really magic thing

2873
01:59:13,389 --> 01:59:17,529
for your gardening so once again knowing

2874
01:59:15,849 --> 01:59:19,960
your inputs is huge especially when

2875
01:59:17,529 --> 01:59:21,880
you're making hash or doing any kind of

2876
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:23,939
concentrate you really got to know what

2877
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:27,190
you put into the plant when you grew it

2878
01:59:23,939 --> 01:59:30,460
that's why I was out making what when I

2879
01:59:27,189 --> 01:59:33,848
use my rabbit poo I mix in 15 percent

2880
01:59:30,460 --> 01:59:38,529
oak leaf mulch because the worms love

2881
01:59:33,849 --> 01:59:40,690
oak leaf mulch that's so that's the

2882
01:59:38,529 --> 01:59:43,029
beauty I love that llamas alpacas

2883
01:59:40,689 --> 01:59:45,009
rabbits like the best poop on earth and

2884
01:59:43,029 --> 01:59:46,779
utilizing leaf material now that we're

2885
01:59:45,010 --> 01:59:48,639
coming into fall is tremendous you can

2886
01:59:46,779 --> 01:59:50,948
think about a tree and what it up takes

2887
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:53,118
from those deep roots they're like a

2888
01:59:50,948 --> 01:59:55,248
mineral mineral miner's

2889
01:59:53,118 --> 01:59:57,738
and if you utilize those leaves is your

2890
01:59:55,248 --> 01:59:59,538
carbon source and your lasagna layering

2891
01:59:57,738 --> 02:00:02,238
or in your worm farms you're gonna have

2892
01:59:59,538 --> 02:00:04,759
a lot of minerals and our big focus

2893
02:00:02,238 --> 02:00:06,978
right now is raising our bricks readings

2894
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:09,349
and raising our roof acto meters so that

2895
02:00:06,979 --> 02:00:11,539
we have higher mineral content in all of

2896
02:00:09,349 --> 02:00:15,288
our foods so it's more nutrient-dense or

2897
02:00:11,538 --> 02:00:17,779
your nutrient dense ganja yeah you know

2898
02:00:15,288 --> 02:00:19,550
what rabbit poo is the best food there

2899
02:00:17,779 --> 02:00:22,518
is it's better than the other ones that

2900
02:00:19,550 --> 02:00:24,918
you mentioned you can plant a seed in a

2901
02:00:22,519 --> 02:00:28,099
turd right out of a rabbits butt and it

2902
02:00:24,918 --> 02:00:30,849
won't burn and it'll grow well and so I

2903
02:00:28,099 --> 02:00:33,860
use rabbit poo and rabbit poo tea

2904
02:00:30,849 --> 02:00:36,378
extensively throughout the growing

2905
02:00:33,859 --> 02:00:39,978
season and if you look on my Instagram

2906
02:00:36,378 --> 02:00:43,099
at my buds they're thoroughly populated

2907
02:00:39,979 --> 02:00:45,619
with trichomes everywhere the buds are

2908
02:00:43,099 --> 02:00:48,409
huge some of them I've got some 14 inch

2909
02:00:45,618 --> 02:00:51,139
long tops that are eight inches at the

2910
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:54,168
bottom where they start I've had to prop

2911
02:00:51,139 --> 02:00:57,288
the plan up numerous different ways and

2912
02:00:54,168 --> 02:00:59,479
they they look like someone sprinkled

2913
02:00:57,288 --> 02:01:01,698
sugar all over them and I didn't use any

2914
02:00:59,479 --> 02:01:05,239
other chemicals or any other nonsense I

2915
02:01:01,698 --> 02:01:07,958
use rabbit poop worms I get the worms in

2916
02:01:05,238 --> 02:01:13,009
the rabbit poo from the rabbit meat farm

2917
02:01:07,958 --> 02:01:16,668
it's got rabbit urine in it and I use

2918
02:01:13,010 --> 02:01:19,219
that and I don't use any other stuff on

2919
02:01:16,668 --> 02:01:21,550
it whatsoever so I don't spray it I

2920
02:01:19,219 --> 02:01:26,198
don't put any bug stuff on it I don't

2921
02:01:21,550 --> 02:01:28,668
put any preventative mold or moisture

2922
02:01:26,198 --> 02:01:30,138
things in place because it doesn't need

2923
02:01:28,668 --> 02:01:33,859
it when they've got the right amount of

2924
02:01:30,139 --> 02:01:36,498
food they fight for themselves and they

2925
02:01:33,859 --> 02:01:38,929
do a magnificent job you've got to give

2926
02:01:36,498 --> 02:01:41,118
them what they want they need food they

2927
02:01:38,929 --> 02:01:43,158
need attention they need love they

2928
02:01:41,118 --> 02:01:46,549
reward you with the medicine it's a

2929
02:01:43,158 --> 02:01:50,208
simple paradigm that's our Instagram

2930
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:52,628
handle intro yeah yeah what's your

2931
02:01:50,208 --> 02:01:56,929
Instagram handle for those who wanna

2932
02:01:52,628 --> 02:02:01,279
it's under pure extracts John Davis on

2933
02:01:56,929 --> 02:02:06,489
Instagram that sounds good I was

2934
02:02:01,279 --> 02:02:06,488
envisioning a rabbit poop clone puck

2935
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:14,090
it would make sense rabbit poo is the

2936
02:02:10,219 --> 02:02:16,789
very best stuff I've grown everything in

2937
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:20,239
it and everything likes it nothing

2938
02:02:16,789 --> 02:02:22,698
doesn't like rabbit food except for I'm

2939
02:02:20,238 --> 02:02:26,118
not I wouldn't want to bathe in under

2940
02:02:22,698 --> 02:02:28,368
anything but as far as all my face my

2941
02:02:26,118 --> 02:02:31,098
tomatoes look at I did it bathe in it

2942
02:02:28,368 --> 02:02:34,069
probably yeah it might actually be okay

2943
02:02:31,099 --> 02:02:36,739
who knows but it'll be a while before I

2944
02:02:34,069 --> 02:02:41,210
give that a try though but as far as the

2945
02:02:36,738 --> 02:02:42,859
plants go I bathe them in it and I do a

2946
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:44,779
lot of things that other people don't do

2947
02:02:42,859 --> 02:02:46,698
I don't believe in failure feeding

2948
02:02:44,779 --> 02:02:49,849
because I think follow your feeding when

2949
02:02:46,698 --> 02:02:52,549
you're spraying manure on plant leaves

2950
02:02:49,849 --> 02:02:54,529
is the primary cause of starting mold

2951
02:02:52,550 --> 02:02:57,199
and other stuff to grow up in your lead

2952
02:02:54,529 --> 02:03:00,319
system so I don't do that instead I

2953
02:02:57,198 --> 02:03:03,319
during the season ice I water my whole

2954
02:03:00,319 --> 02:03:07,009
plant from the top down a few times and

2955
02:03:03,319 --> 02:03:09,559
keeps everything off of it and I just

2956
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:13,159
take good care of them and I keep every

2957
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:16,580
three days I put rabbit poo teeth in

2958
02:03:13,158 --> 02:03:18,948
with them and they just it doesn't burn

2959
02:03:16,579 --> 02:03:22,340
and and they just keep producing more

2960
02:03:18,948 --> 02:03:26,210
and more trichomes and by the way my CBD

2961
02:03:22,340 --> 02:03:30,529
plants are just eating that rabbit booty

2962
02:03:26,210 --> 02:03:33,739
up like crazy I'm not seen CBD buds like

2963
02:03:30,529 --> 02:03:35,750
I seen on the to CBD plants I'm growing

2964
02:03:33,738 --> 02:03:40,218
this year from feeding them the rabbit

2965
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:42,948
food ate so I don't know what all is in

2966
02:03:40,219 --> 02:03:45,230
rabbit poop exactly but I've been using

2967
02:03:42,948 --> 02:03:47,210
it for 58 it probably has a lot to do

2968
02:03:45,229 --> 02:03:48,979
with what's getting fed to the rabbits

2969
02:03:47,210 --> 02:03:50,569
that's what you should be looking at you

2970
02:03:48,979 --> 02:03:54,669
know I bet you that rabbit poo is full

2971
02:03:50,569 --> 02:04:01,759
of rabbit [ __ ] I knew you were gonna say

2972
02:03:54,670 --> 02:04:03,889
tear knows stuff as well is that the

2973
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:06,199
rabbits have an immaculate digestive

2974
02:04:03,889 --> 02:04:08,779
system so that no seeds pass through

2975
02:04:06,198 --> 02:04:10,698
their manure so you can feed them almost

2976
02:04:08,779 --> 02:04:12,380
anything seeded plants and then you're

2977
02:04:10,698 --> 02:04:13,848
gonna get a really high phosphorus in

2978
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:17,239
that manure you know whenever there's

2979
02:04:13,849 --> 02:04:19,460
seeds or flower heads then that's pulled

2980
02:04:17,238 --> 02:04:21,109
out all of the phosphorus out of the

2981
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:22,489
soil

2982
02:04:21,109 --> 02:04:24,408
and you know the green plants are gonna

2983
02:04:22,488 --> 02:04:26,029
be working on your nitrogen so you can

2984
02:04:24,408 --> 02:04:28,549
actually feed your rabbits in

2985
02:04:26,029 --> 02:04:30,380
conjunction with what's going on with

2986
02:04:28,550 --> 02:04:32,510
your gardens and you're not going to be

2987
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:36,380
transmitting any seeds into your garden

2988
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:39,170
here's a concept in your whole garden

2989
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:40,179
cover crop it and then rabbit tractor it

2990
02:04:39,170 --> 02:04:44,480
yeah

2991
02:04:40,179 --> 02:04:49,158
rat rat attract bees I use 50% rabbit

2992
02:04:44,479 --> 02:04:52,039
poo I use 30% really good soil that I

2993
02:04:49,158 --> 02:04:55,039
mix up myself but I mix it out of good

2994
02:04:52,039 --> 02:04:58,429
things not Kraft no chemicals and then I

2995
02:04:55,039 --> 02:05:00,289
use a 10% oak leaf mulch and I put in a

2996
02:04:58,429 --> 02:05:02,840
little blood meal and a little bone meal

2997
02:05:00,289 --> 02:05:07,310
and I throw in a small handful of

2998
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:09,409
minerals and the plants I've never had a

2999
02:05:07,310 --> 02:05:12,560
year when they didn't almost try to get

3000
02:05:09,408 --> 02:05:14,599
out of hand size wise you know the first

3001
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:17,449
time when we started growing him in the

3002
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:19,310
ground wheat we grew up 5 feet tall and

3003
02:05:17,448 --> 02:05:22,158
then we stripped all the leaves off of

3004
02:05:19,310 --> 02:05:24,500
it covered it with root tone and buried

3005
02:05:22,158 --> 02:05:26,238
it in a five foot deep hole and nothing

3006
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:28,219
happened for weeks and weeks and weeks

3007
02:05:26,238 --> 02:05:29,899
and then finally one day we went up and

3008
02:05:28,219 --> 02:05:31,908
there was a three-foot tall plant there

3009
02:05:29,899 --> 02:05:33,859
and then four or five days later there

3010
02:05:31,908 --> 02:05:36,408
was a ten foot tall plant there so

3011
02:05:33,859 --> 02:05:38,779
changing that root it changing that part

3012
02:05:36,408 --> 02:05:41,000
of the plant into a root was a big plus

3013
02:05:38,779 --> 02:05:43,759
and so then we started feeding more

3014
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:46,579
rabbit poo and then I came across the

3015
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:48,650
idea of splitting the stock in four and

3016
02:05:46,579 --> 02:05:51,859
laying them down and just growing

3017
02:05:48,649 --> 02:05:53,479
branches not growing any more topper any

3018
02:05:51,859 --> 02:05:56,149
more main stock and when you just grow

3019
02:05:53,479 --> 02:05:59,269
branches all of your buds look the same

3020
02:05:56,149 --> 02:06:02,868
if you grow 200 pounds all 200 pounds

3021
02:05:59,270 --> 02:06:05,630
looked the same and so that was an

3022
02:06:02,868 --> 02:06:10,549
extremely good method the plants respond

3023
02:06:05,630 --> 02:06:13,429
well and they I put them in 600 gallon

3024
02:06:10,550 --> 02:06:18,199
bags when I'm growing in a season and

3025
02:06:13,429 --> 02:06:21,199
half of that is the rabbit flu and a lot

3026
02:06:18,198 --> 02:06:23,779
of people are thinking wow you can't put

3027
02:06:21,198 --> 02:06:27,259
that much fertilizer in but you know

3028
02:06:23,779 --> 02:06:29,479
I've been doing it for 56 years me and

3029
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:33,930
Annie grew it forever in Southern

3030
02:06:29,479 --> 02:06:37,949
California and we are complete and total

3031
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:40,110
a rabbit poo members yeah rabbit poo is

3032
02:06:37,949 --> 02:06:41,639
fantastic I think that rabbit manure is

3033
02:06:40,109 --> 02:06:43,319
definitely one of the best things that

3034
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:45,900
you can utilize on your farm you know

3035
02:06:43,319 --> 02:06:47,909
people in BC we all dream about rabbit

3036
02:06:45,899 --> 02:06:51,599
tractors but we also have grizzly bears

3037
02:06:47,909 --> 02:06:53,909
and those damn things too they love to

3038
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:58,250
have a basket full of rabbits for sure

3039
02:06:53,909 --> 02:07:01,050
but they are and the other thing about

3040
02:06:58,250 --> 02:07:03,300
the thing about rabbit manure and also

3041
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:05,940
sheep manure because of their diet is

3042
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:07,560
that a lot of people in France and

3043
02:07:05,939 --> 02:07:09,479
people who are growing like lavender

3044
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:11,400
farms and they're utilizing it for

3045
02:07:09,479 --> 02:07:14,309
distillate for perfumery

3046
02:07:11,399 --> 02:07:16,469
is that they love sheep manure and

3047
02:07:14,310 --> 02:07:18,060
rabbit manure because of the terpenes in

3048
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:19,829
it and they believe that it does bring

3049
02:07:18,060 --> 02:07:22,410
out terpenes in your clans or you can

3050
02:07:19,829 --> 02:07:24,510
use sheep's wool for mulch yeah and the

3051
02:07:22,409 --> 02:07:26,519
rabbit manure is also already pre

3052
02:07:24,510 --> 02:07:28,890
digested enough that it doesn't have to

3053
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:30,870
read compost so it doesn't it's not

3054
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:33,030
doesn't get hot so that's why it's such

3055
02:07:30,869 --> 02:07:36,149
a fantastic addition into your pots or

3056
02:07:33,029 --> 02:07:38,849
into your soil Larry what I learned

3057
02:07:36,149 --> 02:07:40,920
about it exactly was I was extracting

3058
02:07:38,850 --> 02:07:44,370
lavender for her birthday for seven

3059
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:47,940
years in our plant in Kansas and their

3060
02:07:44,369 --> 02:07:51,300
main scientist dr. Daniel Julian flew

3061
02:07:47,939 --> 02:07:54,379
over on a jet to come see our factory he

3062
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:58,980
only got it built up in Kansas and he

3063
02:07:54,380 --> 02:08:03,480
related the story of how they use rabbit

3064
02:07:58,979 --> 02:08:08,269
poo with the lavender and we got the

3065
02:08:03,479 --> 02:08:13,399
oils to bring out the oils yeah well I

3066
02:08:08,270 --> 02:08:15,540
get into Robert Hayes supply line by

3067
02:08:13,399 --> 02:08:17,309
bugging them for two years about

3068
02:08:15,539 --> 02:08:19,350
extracting some lavender and they

3069
02:08:17,310 --> 02:08:21,600
wouldn't ever pay attention to me

3070
02:08:19,350 --> 02:08:23,490
finally to get rid of me they sent me a

3071
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:25,980
package of three-year-old lavender

3072
02:08:23,489 --> 02:08:28,050
flowers and said okay when you can

3073
02:08:25,979 --> 02:08:30,419
expect this and we like it we'll call

3074
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:32,970
you otherwise you know you don't call

3075
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:35,220
back anymore okay so I expected it in

3076
02:08:32,970 --> 02:08:37,650
four days later I got this crazy French

3077
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:39,510
guy on the phone trying to speak English

3078
02:08:37,649 --> 02:08:41,549
and French mix up at the same time

3079
02:08:39,510 --> 02:08:43,409
telling me it was the best lavender

3080
02:08:41,550 --> 02:08:45,449
extract he ever saw in his life and they

3081
02:08:43,409 --> 02:08:47,460
want to know how in the world I did it

3082
02:08:45,449 --> 02:08:49,559
so a life-long

3083
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:51,359
relationship with dr. Julia on the

3084
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:55,620
20-year long relationship with him

3085
02:08:51,359 --> 02:08:58,469
figured big-time into what I know know

3086
02:08:55,619 --> 02:09:01,559
about flavor and fragrance extracting

3087
02:08:58,470 --> 02:09:03,690
and oils and so I got to work with him

3088
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:07,920
for a very long time and I can tell you

3089
02:09:03,689 --> 02:09:09,899
that there's a lot more to the rabbit

3090
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:12,720
food than we really even know about

3091
02:09:09,899 --> 02:09:15,539
every birthday but they studied it for a

3092
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:19,380
long time and whatever it is that the

3093
02:09:15,539 --> 02:09:22,140
rabbits what you call an immaculate diet

3094
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:26,510
is usually alfalfa and stuff like that

3095
02:09:22,140 --> 02:09:29,550
sometimes unfortunately glyphosate -

3096
02:09:26,510 --> 02:09:31,949
yeah well it hasn't been showing up yet

3097
02:09:29,550 --> 02:09:35,250
but maybe it shows up in everything it's

3098
02:09:31,949 --> 02:09:37,590
oh no it shows up in rabbit dung and

3099
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:39,989
there's been studies that I've been done

3100
02:09:37,590 --> 02:09:42,810
on it so this is actually you know one

3101
02:09:39,989 --> 02:09:44,939
of the concerns about using using it as

3102
02:09:42,810 --> 02:09:47,760
again rabbits will eat just about

3103
02:09:44,939 --> 02:09:50,159
anything follower and glyphosate those

3104
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:52,010
pass through their system well it's too

3105
02:09:50,159 --> 02:09:55,260
late mark because they've already found

3106
02:09:52,010 --> 02:09:57,869
that same crap in mother's breast milk

3107
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:59,789
so it's a little late to be worrying

3108
02:09:57,869 --> 02:10:03,840
about what rabbit food does at this

3109
02:09:59,789 --> 02:10:07,470
point in time I just act like it's good

3110
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:10,319
unfortunately as so people have studied

3111
02:10:07,470 --> 02:10:12,630
glyphosate in rabbit poo but they've

3112
02:10:10,319 --> 02:10:16,049
studied glyphosate in animals so you

3113
02:10:12,630 --> 02:10:18,539
know just bringing them and the number

3114
02:10:16,050 --> 02:10:21,539
one diet of commercial rabbits is is

3115
02:10:18,539 --> 02:10:23,789
often alfalfa pellets and alfalfa

3116
02:10:21,539 --> 02:10:27,479
pellets are being tremendously sprayed

3117
02:10:23,789 --> 02:10:32,100
by you know glite as well as GMO crops

3118
02:10:27,479 --> 02:10:34,079
so we have to be careful knowing you

3119
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:36,329
know it really is easy to raise your own

3120
02:10:34,079 --> 02:10:38,309
rabbits because you can actually take a

3121
02:10:36,329 --> 02:10:40,260
small little rabbit tractor right along

3122
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:42,660
your lawn if you only even have a small

3123
02:10:40,260 --> 02:10:44,489
lawn and you can create a tremendous

3124
02:10:42,659 --> 02:10:47,159
amount of rabbit manure in a really

3125
02:10:44,489 --> 02:10:49,920
small space leave it or not there's a

3126
02:10:47,159 --> 02:10:52,739
lot of totally organic rabbit meat farms

3127
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:55,560
around and that are springing up that

3128
02:10:52,739 --> 02:10:58,229
only feed their rabbits the stuff that

3129
02:10:55,560 --> 02:11:00,270
they grow that as organic I've been

3130
02:10:58,229 --> 02:11:01,000
using some of them for years and some of

3131
02:11:00,270 --> 02:11:02,890
them

3132
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:05,229
you go to them and the way they take

3133
02:11:02,890 --> 02:11:09,160
care of the rabbits is heartwarming you

3134
02:11:05,229 --> 02:11:10,929
know and so I don't recommend anything

3135
02:11:09,159 --> 02:11:12,880
commercial because everything that's

3136
02:11:10,930 --> 02:11:15,820
been commercialized unfortunately at

3137
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:18,819
this point in time has been left me

3138
02:11:15,819 --> 02:11:20,829
wanting for the most part I don't use

3139
02:11:18,819 --> 02:11:25,389
any chemicals or stuff in any of the

3140
02:11:20,829 --> 02:11:28,329
plants that I grow and really I've been

3141
02:11:25,390 --> 02:11:32,560
expecting for a long time and and the

3142
02:11:28,329 --> 02:11:34,989
fact that insecticides and sulfur

3143
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:38,350
compounds and micro butanol and other

3144
02:11:34,989 --> 02:11:42,279
stuff started showing up in plants is a

3145
02:11:38,350 --> 02:11:44,800
very disturbing trend we're trying to

3146
02:11:42,279 --> 02:11:47,019
defeat it by putting filtration systems

3147
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:49,270
in our system that gets rid of it but I

3148
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:53,350
wish everybody out there would stop with

3149
02:11:49,270 --> 02:11:55,240
the spraying of bug spray and powdery

3150
02:11:53,350 --> 02:11:57,340
mildew spray and stuff on the plants

3151
02:11:55,239 --> 02:11:59,619
because people have to ingest this stuff

3152
02:11:57,340 --> 02:12:01,539
and you guys want to make a dollar but

3153
02:11:59,619 --> 02:12:04,809
if you're gonna make a dollar and cause

3154
02:12:01,539 --> 02:12:06,670
more discomfort and more upset I think

3155
02:12:04,810 --> 02:12:08,950
you should try to find something else to

3156
02:12:06,670 --> 02:12:15,880
do in your time yeah and don't call it

3157
02:12:08,949 --> 02:12:18,359
medicine part bye-bye steep hill where

3158
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:20,949
they're talking about eighty-six percent

3159
02:12:18,359 --> 02:12:24,750
of all the clones tested

3160
02:12:20,949 --> 02:12:27,670
we're contaminated with pesticides or

3161
02:12:24,750 --> 02:12:30,300
just saw that just saw that that's crazy

3162
02:12:27,670 --> 02:12:32,949
we have an idea FM we call it an

3163
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:35,289
integrated pest and fungal management

3164
02:12:32,949 --> 02:12:38,439
program that we put out to the community

3165
02:12:35,289 --> 02:12:41,949
anyone that asks us about it and

3166
02:12:38,439 --> 02:12:43,419
predator mites and predators are so darn

3167
02:12:41,949 --> 02:12:45,279
easy to use that's not really something

3168
02:12:43,420 --> 02:12:46,989
you use in a cloning situation as much

3169
02:12:45,279 --> 02:12:48,789
well we're starting to feel like you

3170
02:12:46,989 --> 02:12:49,960
know the only clean clones out there are

3171
02:12:48,789 --> 02:12:55,000
the ones that actually come with

3172
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:58,659
predators we've had to destroy 53% of

3173
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:00,939
our extract and donate extract from

3174
02:12:58,659 --> 02:13:02,470
organic farms this year for Michael

3175
02:13:00,939 --> 02:13:05,949
butanol and a lot of those come with

3176
02:13:02,470 --> 02:13:09,190
flour tests that show clean and as soon

3177
02:13:05,949 --> 02:13:12,010
as we take that and extract it all of a

3178
02:13:09,189 --> 02:13:14,559
sudden it starts popping and it's been a

3179
02:13:12,010 --> 02:13:16,900
real problem and a lot of people get up

3180
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:19,150
when we share those results back to him

3181
02:13:16,899 --> 02:13:21,129
but you know I like nothing I can do

3182
02:13:19,149 --> 02:13:23,349
about that but it one of the good things

3183
02:13:21,130 --> 02:13:25,869
is it's caused people to really question

3184
02:13:23,350 --> 02:13:28,240
their clone sources in the nursery

3185
02:13:25,869 --> 02:13:29,529
practices a little more so I'm hoping

3186
02:13:28,239 --> 02:13:31,989
this isn't as big a problem as it is

3187
02:13:29,529 --> 02:13:34,449
this the last couple years in the future

3188
02:13:31,989 --> 02:13:36,670
but it's there's products we make a

3189
02:13:34,449 --> 02:13:39,099
nasal spray for kids with epilepsy that

3190
02:13:36,670 --> 02:13:42,550
really needs a actually needs a high THC

3191
02:13:39,100 --> 02:13:43,780
low other compounds sort of profile and

3192
02:13:42,550 --> 02:13:46,360
we haven't been able to get one the test

3193
02:13:43,779 --> 02:13:48,699
the high THC gardens are just failing

3194
02:13:46,359 --> 02:13:59,219
left and right we haven't able to get

3195
02:13:48,699 --> 02:14:02,590
one the pass in a couple months so it's

3196
02:13:59,220 --> 02:14:04,600
is that what you're looking for yeah

3197
02:14:02,590 --> 02:14:08,110
yeah so basically with the nasal spray

3198
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:10,320
we want the highest THC ratio we can

3199
02:14:08,109 --> 02:14:13,149
because we want to use this little

3200
02:14:10,319 --> 02:14:14,199
cannabis oil as possible this side we

3201
02:14:13,149 --> 02:14:15,729
don't have to go down this rabbit hole

3202
02:14:14,199 --> 02:14:17,769
but it has to do with the viscosity and

3203
02:14:15,729 --> 02:14:19,419
being able to aerosol eyes and the lower

3204
02:14:17,770 --> 02:14:20,770
the percentage the more oil you have to

3205
02:14:19,420 --> 02:14:22,420
put in which ends up making it thicker

3206
02:14:20,770 --> 02:14:25,360
so it's just it that's kind of the

3207
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:27,640
thought behind it okay well I can supply

3208
02:14:25,359 --> 02:14:30,670
you with some of that and plus I have a

3209
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:33,910
process that I use that I've developed

3210
02:14:30,670 --> 02:14:38,409
to take very thick cannabis oil and make

3211
02:14:33,909 --> 02:14:40,269
it very motile very easy I need I need

3212
02:14:38,409 --> 02:14:44,319
to drive up and we need to visit here

3213
02:14:40,270 --> 02:14:45,760
soon it sounds like yeah oh one thing

3214
02:14:44,319 --> 02:14:48,609
that I wanted to mention here is that

3215
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:50,530
was the reason why and a lot of other

3216
02:14:48,609 --> 02:14:53,049
community members created the peer

3217
02:14:50,529 --> 02:14:55,840
certification it goes beyond Omri it

3218
02:14:53,050 --> 02:14:58,090
goes beyond NOP so to be able to find

3219
02:14:55,840 --> 02:15:00,460
flowers of people that have a peer

3220
02:14:58,090 --> 02:15:04,060
certification it means that they're only

3221
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:05,980
growing off of a closed loop system so

3222
02:15:04,060 --> 02:15:07,930
all of the claims are made they're on

3223
02:15:05,979 --> 02:15:09,729
their property all of the seeds are made

3224
02:15:07,930 --> 02:15:12,490
they're on their property all of the

3225
02:15:09,729 --> 02:15:14,349
inputs are all what they have created on

3226
02:15:12,489 --> 02:15:17,439
their own property to keep it totally

3227
02:15:14,350 --> 02:15:19,000
closed loop and or knowing their inputs

3228
02:15:17,439 --> 02:15:20,559
that that come from off of their

3229
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:22,989
property and working together as a

3230
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:24,850
community and working together to keep

3231
02:15:22,989 --> 02:15:27,609
the medicine clean and knowing our

3232
02:15:24,850 --> 02:15:30,260
sources so within the pure

3233
02:15:27,609 --> 02:15:32,269
everyone's communicating with each other

3234
02:15:30,260 --> 02:15:34,430
on how to create the cleanest medicine

3235
02:15:32,270 --> 02:15:36,380
for the masses before the medicine and

3236
02:15:34,430 --> 02:15:38,720
everybody's flowers and concentrates are

3237
02:15:36,380 --> 02:15:40,100
coming up totally pure which is really

3238
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:42,289
helpful so it's a way that the community

3239
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:44,840
can help one another and sort of step

3240
02:15:42,289 --> 02:15:46,039
outside of the current organic standards

3241
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:49,250
that are going on right now and

3242
02:15:46,039 --> 02:15:51,979
consumers it that's obviously needed the

3243
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:54,770
other thing that's needed is we need to

3244
02:15:51,979 --> 02:15:58,909
take each one of these compounds of

3245
02:15:54,770 --> 02:16:00,140
pesticides and fungicides and spray a

3246
02:15:58,909 --> 02:16:03,069
mother plant

3247
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:06,920
grow it big test it if it comes out

3248
02:16:03,069 --> 02:16:09,409
contaminated make clones from it well as

3249
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:11,869
a big mother plant before we flower it

3250
02:16:09,409 --> 02:16:15,649
test the clones if those are

3251
02:16:11,869 --> 02:16:17,750
contaminated clones those clones test it

3252
02:16:15,649 --> 02:16:20,359
until we can find out how many

3253
02:16:17,750 --> 02:16:24,319
generations does it really take to get

3254
02:16:20,359 --> 02:16:27,619
rid of these goddamn things and it's a

3255
02:16:24,319 --> 02:16:30,619
warning for growers if people realize

3256
02:16:27,619 --> 02:16:34,879
this they're much less likely to have

3257
02:16:30,619 --> 02:16:36,170
anything to do with them in any way it's

3258
02:16:34,879 --> 02:16:38,269
powerful because you're not making a

3259
02:16:36,170 --> 02:16:40,129
dollar and like Indra was saying I

3260
02:16:38,270 --> 02:16:42,350
believe it's you know people are like

3261
02:16:40,129 --> 02:16:43,819
you know I'm gonna leak this out and

3262
02:16:42,350 --> 02:16:46,030
make a dollar when you end up losing a

3263
02:16:43,819 --> 02:16:49,209
dollar and making people sick so it's a

3264
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:53,480
really powerful wake-up call for

3265
02:16:49,209 --> 02:16:56,839
recreational FAR's to not become w r ck

3266
02:16:53,479 --> 02:16:59,689
what creational well people don't be

3267
02:16:56,840 --> 02:17:05,120
compassionate there's the variance

3268
02:16:59,690 --> 02:17:06,950
idiots take it off today and then not

3269
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:09,770
spraying it again for three years and

3270
02:17:06,950 --> 02:17:11,690
three years down the road take a sample

3271
02:17:09,770 --> 02:17:13,399
of the soil in your greenhouse and it'll

3272
02:17:11,690 --> 02:17:16,270
still be severely contaminated with the

3273
02:17:13,399 --> 02:17:20,779
spray from three years ago but that

3274
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:23,989
depends on what the spray is also

3275
02:17:20,780 --> 02:17:26,450
doesn't become contaminated forever both

3276
02:17:23,989 --> 02:17:29,329
ultraviolet light and just soil

3277
02:17:26,450 --> 02:17:33,320
microorganisms can disperse and destroy

3278
02:17:29,329 --> 02:17:35,389
the some of these chemicals and that's

3279
02:17:33,319 --> 02:17:37,819
real and we're working with some farms

3280
02:17:35,389 --> 02:17:40,189
that did use pesticides and some

3281
02:17:37,819 --> 02:17:41,179
chemical fertilizers in the past and

3282
02:17:40,190 --> 02:17:43,519
they had

3283
02:17:41,179 --> 02:17:46,279
using Korean natural farming and also

3284
02:17:43,519 --> 02:17:48,460
just clothes micro remediation

3285
02:17:46,279 --> 02:17:50,840
closed-loop systems part of the reason

3286
02:17:48,459 --> 02:17:52,369
another aspect of closed-loop systems

3287
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:53,960
that work is in the part of having a

3288
02:17:52,370 --> 02:17:56,329
closed-loop is that you're digesting

3289
02:17:53,959 --> 02:17:59,718
organic material and you're doing that

3290
02:17:56,329 --> 02:18:03,529
with microorganisms that excuse me that

3291
02:17:59,718 --> 02:18:06,558
clean the land and and and transform you

3292
02:18:03,529 --> 02:18:08,449
know those terrible compounds so I don't

3293
02:18:06,558 --> 02:18:09,829
know if we would ever know exactly how

3294
02:18:08,449 --> 02:18:12,920
long it takes we know that they're

3295
02:18:09,829 --> 02:18:15,109
they're very vigorous compounds to get

3296
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:16,670
rid of but um so are some of the

3297
02:18:15,109 --> 02:18:18,380
mediating compounds so we're getting

3298
02:18:16,670 --> 02:18:22,189
some soil tests back that are showing

3299
02:18:18,379 --> 02:18:24,259
clean after one year now 200

3300
02:18:22,189 --> 02:18:25,760
two and a half years and so we're

3301
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:27,859
showing some promise on that and we're

3302
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:32,148
looking but we're using pretty serious

3303
02:18:27,859 --> 02:18:34,939
micro remediation with it I think not

3304
02:18:32,148 --> 02:18:39,939
that many people grow in the ground to

3305
02:18:34,939 --> 02:18:43,519
be honest I mean it's what I prefer but

3306
02:18:39,939 --> 02:18:46,099
what I'm interested in is showing the

3307
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:48,800
the mother clones once once you've

3308
02:18:46,099 --> 02:18:52,010
sprayed them you know are they really

3309
02:18:48,799 --> 02:18:55,009
safety to use that year are they really

3310
02:18:52,010 --> 02:18:58,790
safe to make clones for the next year's

3311
02:18:55,010 --> 02:19:02,929
crop etc etc and that wouldn't be that

3312
02:18:58,790 --> 02:19:06,219
hard to do the science with it but it

3313
02:19:02,929 --> 02:19:06,219
hasn't been done yet

3314
02:19:06,699 --> 02:19:11,149
you'd be contaminating your land so I

3315
02:19:09,318 --> 02:19:13,459
know for me I would be like oh [ __ ] I'd

3316
02:19:11,148 --> 02:19:18,039
have to leave it can be done indoors

3317
02:19:13,459 --> 02:19:18,039
under light I mean right yeah

3318
02:19:20,829 --> 02:19:24,819
probably be a good idea for someone to

3319
02:19:22,630 --> 02:19:27,309
get on it eventually you know how far

3320
02:19:24,819 --> 02:19:32,171
does it pass it's kind of a frightening

3321
02:19:27,309 --> 02:19:35,591
thought well it's true but a lot of this

3322
02:19:32,171 --> 02:19:38,530
should have to pay for the testing of it

3323
02:19:35,591 --> 02:19:40,180
they should have be I mean from my point

3324
02:19:38,530 --> 02:19:42,489
of view the pharmaceutical companies and

3325
02:19:40,180 --> 02:19:45,159
the chemical companies that make

3326
02:19:42,489 --> 02:19:48,069
fungicides and pesticides are running an

3327
02:19:45,159 --> 02:19:51,550
ongoing science experiment on humans and

3328
02:19:48,069 --> 02:19:53,649
our environment and I think that this

3329
02:19:51,550 --> 02:19:56,079
one of the things that cannabis can do

3330
02:19:53,649 --> 02:19:58,690
for us as a culture is help us

3331
02:19:56,079 --> 02:20:00,251
understand that all these compounds were

3332
02:19:58,690 --> 02:20:02,501
putting into our environment putting

3333
02:20:00,251 --> 02:20:04,870
into our bodies putting on the plants

3334
02:20:02,501 --> 02:20:10,149
that we eat giving to the animals that

3335
02:20:04,870 --> 02:20:13,721
we eat it's it's a it's a it's we are

3336
02:20:10,149 --> 02:20:16,989
the guinea pigs in a giant experiment as

3337
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:20,109
my I personally agree with you but yes

3338
02:20:16,989 --> 02:20:25,181
that said the majority of Americans eat

3339
02:20:20,110 --> 02:20:27,730
chemically grown food and GMO corn GMO

3340
02:20:25,181 --> 02:20:34,810
everything else it's just the way it is

3341
02:20:27,729 --> 02:20:36,699
and I don't hate to agree I think the

3342
02:20:34,810 --> 02:20:39,489
guinea pigs are probably insulted by

3343
02:20:36,700 --> 02:20:43,980
that you think well I don't want I'm not

3344
02:20:39,489 --> 02:20:43,979
saying that we are all pigs we are all

3345
02:20:44,521 --> 02:20:51,521
okay I'm poking fun at the euphemism

3346
02:20:48,101 --> 02:20:55,181
guinea pig that song yeah well I just

3347
02:20:51,521 --> 02:20:57,040
want us to it's a point of view about

3348
02:20:55,181 --> 02:21:00,040
what's going on the early organic

3349
02:20:57,040 --> 02:21:01,961
chemists who first worked out that oil

3350
02:21:00,040 --> 02:21:04,921
petroleum could be used to make

3351
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:07,659
fertilizer for example or weapons

3352
02:21:04,921 --> 02:21:09,579
recognize that their lab assistants were

3353
02:21:07,659 --> 02:21:12,101
coming subject to all kinds of cancers

3354
02:21:09,579 --> 02:21:13,479
and they decided that it wasn't really

3355
02:21:12,101 --> 02:21:16,001
going to be that big a problem because

3356
02:21:13,479 --> 02:21:17,380
medicine would solve the problem by the

3357
02:21:16,001 --> 02:21:21,489
time it became an issue in the

3358
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:23,229
population and I want us and I it from

3359
02:21:21,489 --> 02:21:25,841
my point of view it's still going on

3360
02:21:23,229 --> 02:21:27,761
that way we're really putting all these

3361
02:21:25,841 --> 02:21:29,739
compounds out there like glyphosate

3362
02:21:27,761 --> 02:21:32,950
because it has some properties about

3363
02:21:29,739 --> 02:21:33,969
being able to kill plants as if that's a

3364
02:21:32,950 --> 02:21:37,689
benefit

3365
02:21:33,969 --> 02:21:39,129
and cannabis I think is the conversation

3366
02:21:37,689 --> 02:21:41,189
that we're having that I think is really

3367
02:21:39,129 --> 02:21:43,719
important is that if you really want

3368
02:21:41,189 --> 02:21:45,760
medicinal cannabis cannabis that you can

3369
02:21:43,719 --> 02:21:48,969
assure the people that you're providing

3370
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:51,960
it to is clean and free of issues you

3371
02:21:48,969 --> 02:21:55,599
really have to follow these practices of

3372
02:21:51,959 --> 02:21:58,568
sourcing everything from your own work

3373
02:21:55,600 --> 02:22:00,399
if you will your own place I feel very

3374
02:21:58,568 --> 02:22:03,728
fortunate to have a piece of land where

3375
02:22:00,398 --> 02:22:06,159
it's I've got enough space to have begun

3376
02:22:03,728 --> 02:22:08,108
the process that the folks that

3377
02:22:06,159 --> 02:22:10,420
dragonfly farms are exemplifying so

3378
02:22:08,109 --> 02:22:13,800
beautifully I think the mushrooms play a

3379
02:22:10,420 --> 02:22:16,238
part in it but a really huge thing is

3380
02:22:13,799 --> 02:22:18,849
sourcing the inputs that you're using

3381
02:22:16,238 --> 02:22:22,270
and all these various processes yes sir

3382
02:22:18,850 --> 02:22:25,180
wait don't you find this everybody every

3383
02:22:22,270 --> 02:22:29,649
large grower has gotten clones from

3384
02:22:25,180 --> 02:22:32,620
somebody else I get comments from other

3385
02:22:29,648 --> 02:22:35,019
people but they're always suspect I have

3386
02:22:32,620 --> 02:22:37,149
to recognize that the plants that I work

3387
02:22:35,020 --> 02:22:39,729
with if I haven't bred them and gotten

3388
02:22:37,148 --> 02:22:41,379
them here myself or that I'm working

3389
02:22:39,728 --> 02:22:43,000
with someone that I can trust the

3390
02:22:41,379 --> 02:22:46,238
cuttings they're providing are clean

3391
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:49,359
that that that that plant if I haven't

3392
02:22:46,238 --> 02:22:51,670
if it's not my plant I don't know that

3393
02:22:49,359 --> 02:22:53,529
but yet in this work that I've been

3394
02:22:51,670 --> 02:22:55,840
doing for years one of the things that's

3395
02:22:53,529 --> 02:22:58,090
happened is people had gifted me

3396
02:22:55,840 --> 02:23:00,939
examples of things that they've found

3397
02:22:58,090 --> 02:23:02,770
that might be of benefit and more than a

3398
02:23:00,939 --> 02:23:07,630
few times though it turned out they were

3399
02:23:02,770 --> 02:23:09,670
a benefit and it's part of why I feel so

3400
02:23:07,629 --> 02:23:12,009
interested in how different cultivars

3401
02:23:09,670 --> 02:23:14,379
respond to the circumstances that I'm

3402
02:23:12,010 --> 02:23:16,450
able to give them and I've tried to

3403
02:23:14,379 --> 02:23:19,898
refine the circumstances if you will

3404
02:23:16,450 --> 02:23:23,020
again one of the reasons I'm interested

3405
02:23:19,898 --> 02:23:25,750
in how many generations can you clone a

3406
02:23:23,020 --> 02:23:27,909
mother plant and then a clone of the

3407
02:23:25,750 --> 02:23:31,659
clone and a clone of the clone before

3408
02:23:27,909 --> 02:23:35,619
there is no parts per trillion parts per

3409
02:23:31,659 --> 02:23:37,510
billion and it's truly cleaned up again

3410
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:39,460
I think that would be a great thing to

3411
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:41,710
do and I think it would be even more

3412
02:23:39,459 --> 02:23:44,108
interesting to try different soil

3413
02:23:41,709 --> 02:23:46,929
recipes in on that and different foliar

3414
02:23:44,109 --> 02:23:47,690
recipes and just to see what different

3415
02:23:46,930 --> 02:23:50,030
tech

3416
02:23:47,690 --> 02:23:52,159
you could use to speed up that process

3417
02:23:50,030 --> 02:23:54,110
because I do believe that it would be

3418
02:23:52,159 --> 02:23:55,959
different based off whatever environment

3419
02:23:54,110 --> 02:23:59,360
you are using I mean it could be

3420
02:23:55,959 --> 02:24:01,880
environmentally trained as well yeah I

3421
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:03,950
mean I Hayes's are some of the land

3422
02:24:01,880 --> 02:24:05,630
races we get through it faster because

3423
02:24:03,950 --> 02:24:08,120
their genetics are closer to the earth

3424
02:24:05,630 --> 02:24:09,890
and maybe the hybrids would hang on to

3425
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:13,280
it more that's just made up in my mind I

3426
02:24:09,890 --> 02:24:16,489
have no idea but yeah also maybe maybe

3427
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:20,989
like viruses if you took just the very

3428
02:24:16,489 --> 02:24:25,101
very top atypical Mears tips maybe they

3429
02:24:20,989 --> 02:24:28,159
wouldn't have the contaminants or or

3430
02:24:25,101 --> 02:24:32,780
viruses in them yet and then reproduce

3431
02:24:28,159 --> 02:24:36,351
somebody in vitro yeah what happens I

3432
02:24:32,780 --> 02:24:39,200
plant corn take the corner you can buy

3433
02:24:36,351 --> 02:24:41,421
now corn seed and go out and plant it

3434
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:44,141
and don't spray it and don't put like a

3435
02:24:41,421 --> 02:24:46,399
phosphate on it and don't do any of the

3436
02:24:44,140 --> 02:24:48,440
petrochemical stuff you have to do and

3437
02:24:46,399 --> 02:24:51,649
just watch it grow on its own in the

3438
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:54,801
wild what do you think you get a smaller

3439
02:24:51,649 --> 02:24:59,079
corn claim very much smaller and

3440
02:24:54,800 --> 02:25:03,199
probably not a survivable plant so we

3441
02:24:59,079 --> 02:25:06,591
have the idea that we could put enough

3442
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:09,471
poison in our foot to fend off other

3443
02:25:06,591 --> 02:25:12,851
stuff it's a little bit insane it's like

3444
02:25:09,470 --> 02:25:15,890
putting all of us on chemotherapy and

3445
02:25:12,851 --> 02:25:18,921
it's making a kind of a crazy assumption

3446
02:25:15,890 --> 02:25:20,841
which it doesn't make sense I know the

3447
02:25:18,921 --> 02:25:23,000
world needs food but there's been many

3448
02:25:20,841 --> 02:25:25,940
many studies showing that organically

3449
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:28,851
grown food can be grown on a large

3450
02:25:25,940 --> 02:25:31,431
enough scale to provide the food without

3451
02:25:28,851 --> 02:25:33,739
the petrochemical thing all of the

3452
02:25:31,431 --> 02:25:35,000
plants that rely on petrochemicals if

3453
02:25:33,739 --> 02:25:38,181
you try to grow them on their own

3454
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:41,000
without anything except rain fail

3455
02:25:38,181 --> 02:25:44,149
dismally and so we're like one season

3456
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:47,030
away from starving to death and and

3457
02:25:44,149 --> 02:25:49,550
people don't realize it I mean what

3458
02:25:47,030 --> 02:25:52,341
happens if the petrochemicals aren't

3459
02:25:49,550 --> 02:25:56,510
available one year all of a sudden and

3460
02:25:52,341 --> 02:25:59,631
then now now you're looking at all the

3461
02:25:56,511 --> 02:26:01,109
crops putting out next to nothing or

3462
02:25:59,630 --> 02:26:03,180
dying off

3463
02:26:01,109 --> 02:26:04,680
and I think it's a dangerous spot we put

3464
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:07,620
ourselves in instead we should be making

3465
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:11,059
our plant stock strong healthy organic

3466
02:26:07,620 --> 02:26:14,340
able to put up with things without

3467
02:26:11,059 --> 02:26:17,039
petrochemicals it that that is available

3468
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:20,370
all you have to do is use heirloom

3469
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:24,030
varieties and join groups like the Seed

3470
02:26:20,370 --> 02:26:26,040
Savers Exchange well I do they pass

3471
02:26:24,030 --> 02:26:32,069
around heirloom varieties were worldwide

3472
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:34,229
and I buy all the time I buy the seeds

3473
02:26:32,068 --> 02:26:36,600
in the little seed vault thing so that I

3474
02:26:34,228 --> 02:26:39,779
have them in case of a zombie apocalypse

3475
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:42,210
I have all the dry and organic food and

3476
02:26:39,780 --> 02:26:47,310
stuff in case of a zombie apocalypse but

3477
02:26:42,209 --> 02:26:49,438
still all in all the the people who

3478
02:26:47,309 --> 02:26:52,049
produce the majority of the food are not

3479
02:26:49,439 --> 02:26:54,809
doing that they're using petrochemicals

3480
02:26:52,049 --> 02:26:56,549
and that's the problem a lot of the

3481
02:26:54,809 --> 02:26:58,010
stuff that we've got going on in our

3482
02:26:56,549 --> 02:27:01,349
bodies as a result of these

3483
02:26:58,010 --> 02:27:03,210
petrochemicals being in our food it's ok

3484
02:27:01,350 --> 02:27:05,370
they they don't want you to smoke

3485
02:27:03,209 --> 02:27:08,728
anything that might have insecticide on

3486
02:27:05,370 --> 02:27:13,740
it but here's a tomato that is so loaded

3487
02:27:08,728 --> 02:27:16,559
with chemicals that if bugs try to eat

3488
02:27:13,739 --> 02:27:19,260
it die and fall off on the ground

3489
02:27:16,559 --> 02:27:28,639
hey John so quitting your intestinal

3490
02:27:19,260 --> 02:27:32,398
flora it okay I just won't let you know

3491
02:27:28,639 --> 02:27:34,920
butane is a petrochemical and just to be

3492
02:27:32,398 --> 02:27:37,260
accurate just to be yeah Gannett we

3493
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:40,260
don't use petrochemicals as crop

3494
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:43,439
protection agents you know fungicides

3495
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:45,359
insecticides are not petrochemical they

3496
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:47,130
might be petrochemical base but that's

3497
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:49,649
really you know sort of irrelevant

3498
02:27:47,129 --> 02:27:51,358
really it's not a relevant when you

3499
02:27:49,648 --> 02:27:56,219
putting it on the food mark how can you

3500
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:58,739
say that ok she seems like he's in the

3501
02:27:56,219 --> 02:28:03,449
generation of these chemical things yeah

3502
02:27:58,739 --> 02:28:08,189
uh just to be accurate petrochemicals or

3503
02:28:03,450 --> 02:28:12,600
chemicals of derived Trillium and all of

3504
02:28:08,189 --> 02:28:14,680
us rely on infrastructure and airplanes

3505
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:17,949
and automobiles and

3506
02:28:14,680 --> 02:28:21,100
trains that all need petrochemicals to

3507
02:28:17,949 --> 02:28:24,010
push things through the sky and through

3508
02:28:21,100 --> 02:28:25,899
over the ocean and had sucks that we

3509
02:28:24,010 --> 02:28:28,478
burn a lot of petrochemicals and we've

3510
02:28:25,898 --> 02:28:31,978
heard a lot of gasoline but all that

3511
02:28:28,478 --> 02:28:34,299
organic food still uses a lot of

3512
02:28:31,978 --> 02:28:37,629
petrochemicals in all the refrigeration

3513
02:28:34,299 --> 02:28:40,000
required for it and and all the impact

3514
02:28:37,629 --> 02:28:43,568
that society I mean let's face it we're

3515
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:45,159
addicted to oil and part of it is yeah I

3516
02:28:43,568 --> 02:28:47,409
mean I'm not like you know saying that

3517
02:28:45,159 --> 02:28:50,469
this is how it has to be forever but as

3518
02:28:47,409 --> 02:28:53,889
long as there's cheap oil the reason why

3519
02:28:50,469 --> 02:28:55,688
you know I had a lettuce cost you know a

3520
02:28:53,889 --> 02:28:58,959
dollar ninety-nine at the grocery store

3521
02:28:55,689 --> 02:29:01,720
is because they're able to produce it

3522
02:28:58,959 --> 02:29:04,568
cheaply and you know that's what the

3523
02:29:01,719 --> 02:29:07,959
working family can afford that a four to

3524
02:29:04,568 --> 02:29:09,609
eight dollar had a level support I'm not

3525
02:29:07,959 --> 02:29:11,559
saying that organic is going to be you

3526
02:29:09,609 --> 02:29:15,550
know eight dollars a head but the point

3527
02:29:11,559 --> 02:29:20,139
is is that you're right the controls now

3528
02:29:15,549 --> 02:29:21,039
that any quantity 'he's use these

3529
02:29:20,139 --> 02:29:25,988
chemicals

3530
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:28,120
there's micro no use that are out there

3531
02:29:25,988 --> 02:29:30,879
and the reason why we have an

3532
02:29:28,120 --> 02:29:33,790
environmental protection agency was to

3533
02:29:30,879 --> 02:29:36,759
register the active ingredients for

3534
02:29:33,790 --> 02:29:38,739
those uses and again we've been stymied

3535
02:29:36,760 --> 02:29:42,100
by the current administration because

3536
02:29:38,738 --> 02:29:45,430
the current director the EPA will not

3537
02:29:42,100 --> 02:29:49,120
allow even companies to approach them

3538
02:29:45,430 --> 02:29:52,210
with a registration for use on cannabis

3539
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:54,399
so again an heiress is kind of left in

3540
02:29:52,209 --> 02:29:56,459
the dark because they're not going to

3541
02:29:54,398 --> 02:29:58,988
regulate just saying that oh it's

3542
02:29:56,459 --> 02:30:01,809
federally illegal and none of these

3543
02:29:58,988 --> 02:30:03,850
companies again can basically make a

3544
02:30:01,809 --> 02:30:05,889
product with any claims on it or

3545
02:30:03,850 --> 02:30:08,109
register it and when you get it

3546
02:30:05,889 --> 02:30:11,079
registered the you know thing about that

3547
02:30:08,109 --> 02:30:13,809
is typically with the EPA is that you

3548
02:30:11,079 --> 02:30:15,670
have to show both safety and efficacy so

3549
02:30:13,809 --> 02:30:18,159
you have to show that for the intended

3550
02:30:15,670 --> 02:30:20,978
market like if you're you know intending

3551
02:30:18,159 --> 02:30:23,728
us to be played on food or whatever that

3552
02:30:20,978 --> 02:30:27,829
it is safe and everything and so you're

3553
02:30:23,728 --> 02:30:30,199
for I mean all of these things what may

3554
02:30:27,829 --> 02:30:32,989
a crop protection chemical tip today is

3555
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:35,480
one that breaks down and is very very

3556
02:30:32,989 --> 02:30:38,260
safe and is a very very safe profile but

3557
02:30:35,479 --> 02:30:41,329
it's very effective at controlling the

3558
02:30:38,260 --> 02:30:44,360
corn worm or whatever they're applying

3559
02:30:41,329 --> 02:30:48,979
it to be used for and yeah this is large

3560
02:30:44,360 --> 02:30:51,590
and the opposite of a systemic but yeah

3561
02:30:48,979 --> 02:30:55,250
yeah I mean kind of opposite of systemic

3562
02:30:51,590 --> 02:30:58,430
because a systemic what what they're

3563
02:30:55,250 --> 02:31:00,920
using now is active on like grams per

3564
02:30:58,430 --> 02:31:04,280
acre as opposed to grams per acre which

3565
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:05,989
were the large broadcasted DDT and

3566
02:31:04,280 --> 02:31:08,780
things where they were just spraying

3567
02:31:05,989 --> 02:31:10,430
entire fields now they can reduce the

3568
02:31:08,780 --> 02:31:11,930
amount that they're spraying but now

3569
02:31:10,430 --> 02:31:14,090
what they're finding again with some of

3570
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:16,550
these new things like the Neo Knicks for

3571
02:31:14,090 --> 02:31:24,079
example is it's having deleterious

3572
02:31:16,549 --> 02:31:26,629
impact on on off target off target

3573
02:31:24,079 --> 02:31:28,850
insects like the bees right so everyone

3574
02:31:26,629 --> 02:31:30,560
knows about colony collapse disorder I

3575
02:31:28,850 --> 02:31:33,110
mean this is one of the things that

3576
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:36,170
again is problematic with the use of

3577
02:31:33,110 --> 02:31:40,970
things like imidacloprid which has a

3578
02:31:36,170 --> 02:31:42,649
really human safety thing which is what

3579
02:31:40,969 --> 02:31:45,739
the manufacturers were concerned about

3580
02:31:42,649 --> 02:31:47,359
if we spray this on produce our people

3581
02:31:45,739 --> 02:31:49,670
gonna get cancer are people gonna crawl

3582
02:31:47,360 --> 02:31:51,230
over right turns out people aren't at

3583
02:31:49,670 --> 02:31:53,329
the use rates that they're using it

3584
02:31:51,229 --> 02:31:56,149
because it's very effective at low use

3585
02:31:53,329 --> 02:31:59,690
rates but now after it's been used for

3586
02:31:56,149 --> 02:32:04,100
10 20 15 years that are finding now this

3587
02:31:59,690 --> 02:32:06,739
off target just like with with with with

3588
02:32:04,100 --> 02:32:10,790
glyphosate with glyphosate the target

3589
02:32:06,739 --> 02:32:13,879
enzyme in glyphosate is something called

3590
02:32:10,790 --> 02:32:18,771
epsp synthase which has to do with the

3591
02:32:13,879 --> 02:32:20,719
shikimate pathway to make aromatic amino

3592
02:32:18,771 --> 02:32:23,360
acids and so it completely inhibits that

3593
02:32:20,719 --> 02:32:27,469
and yet that doesn't have an impact on

3594
02:32:23,360 --> 02:32:29,750
on on mammals and humans or mammals but

3595
02:32:27,469 --> 02:32:32,989
what it does have an impact on is the

3596
02:32:29,750 --> 02:32:34,909
gut bacteria that's in our gut and in

3597
02:32:32,989 --> 02:32:37,430
the gut of other animals and select when

3598
02:32:34,909 --> 02:32:39,260
these rabbits are foraging and they're

3599
02:32:37,430 --> 02:32:41,748
foraging in fields that maybe weren't

3600
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:43,248
sprayed directly with

3601
02:32:41,748 --> 02:32:46,429
the safe but maybe it was sprayed

3602
02:32:43,248 --> 02:32:49,699
downstream from where you know there was

3603
02:32:46,429 --> 02:32:52,238
either drift or erosion and you know

3604
02:32:49,699 --> 02:32:55,099
there could be again persistence of of

3605
02:32:52,238 --> 02:32:58,548
glyphosate in in in the environment but

3606
02:32:55,099 --> 02:33:00,529
most chemicals today will microbially

3607
02:32:58,549 --> 02:33:03,109
and physically degrade in the

3608
02:33:00,529 --> 02:33:04,759
environment by the time that produce

3609
02:33:03,109 --> 02:33:09,109
makes it to market and there's no

3610
02:33:04,759 --> 02:33:11,498
residuals or whatever residuals on the

3611
02:33:09,109 --> 02:33:14,179
produce they've done tests to show that

3612
02:33:11,498 --> 02:33:17,418
human exposure at those levels even

3613
02:33:14,179 --> 02:33:20,148
chronic exposure is not problematic but

3614
02:33:17,418 --> 02:33:22,248
none of this has been done with cannabis

3615
02:33:20,148 --> 02:33:23,689
and so as you know cannabis unlike

3616
02:33:22,248 --> 02:33:26,988
produce is not lost

3617
02:33:23,689 --> 02:33:29,389
and at least most of us don't watch

3618
02:33:26,988 --> 02:33:31,728
cannabis I know mark and all the hash

3619
02:33:29,388 --> 02:33:33,318
makers know no dude we watch no but the

3620
02:33:31,728 --> 02:33:38,118
point is is that you don't normally wash

3621
02:33:33,318 --> 02:33:39,978
cannabis but anything that is is

3622
02:33:38,119 --> 02:33:41,889
hydrocarbon like is the best way to

3623
02:33:39,978 --> 02:33:45,198
describe it in Juris so it's not

3624
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:47,268
petrochemicals but most of these active

3625
02:33:45,199 --> 02:33:50,209
ingredients that are in crop protection

3626
02:33:47,269 --> 02:33:53,269
chemicals today are very fat soluble

3627
02:33:50,209 --> 02:33:57,429
will stick to the trichome and we'll end

3628
02:33:53,269 --> 02:34:00,379
up concentrating in any concentration

3629
02:33:57,429 --> 02:34:03,918
process and so you may not see it in the

3630
02:34:00,379 --> 02:34:06,319
flower like Forrest was saying when they

3631
02:34:03,918 --> 02:34:08,209
tested flower it came back clean but lo

3632
02:34:06,318 --> 02:34:10,189
and behold we test to concentrate and

3633
02:34:08,209 --> 02:34:12,049
now it's coming up because you're

3634
02:34:10,189 --> 02:34:14,209
concentrating it so the last point I'll

3635
02:34:12,049 --> 02:34:16,219
make is this goes back to the smokey

3636
02:34:14,209 --> 02:34:18,979
comment earlier that sub pool is making

3637
02:34:16,218 --> 02:34:21,348
which is if you distill it and if the

3638
02:34:18,978 --> 02:34:23,418
distillation is done in the right way

3639
02:34:21,349 --> 02:34:25,398
theoretically you could remove the

3640
02:34:23,418 --> 02:34:28,488
cannabinoids from anything that's left

3641
02:34:25,398 --> 02:34:31,458
behind including pesticide residuals or

3642
02:34:28,488 --> 02:34:33,168
smokey tasting residuals so this will be

3643
02:34:31,459 --> 02:34:34,999
the year of the distillate I think just

3644
02:34:33,168 --> 02:34:36,798
because of all the fires that are

3645
02:34:34,998 --> 02:34:39,498
happening out west I think you'll see a

3646
02:34:36,799 --> 02:34:41,629
lot of I know just from my phone's

3647
02:34:39,498 --> 02:34:44,148
memory officer a lot of interest in

3648
02:34:41,629 --> 02:34:46,369
making distillates this is here it seems

3649
02:34:44,148 --> 02:34:48,039
light and you guaranteed if there's that

3650
02:34:46,369 --> 02:34:50,860
many people making distillate

3651
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:53,430
gonna be some smoky distillate in the in

3652
02:34:50,860 --> 02:34:56,319
some of these pens yeah well really

3653
02:34:53,430 --> 02:34:58,809
identify what those smoky compounds are

3654
02:34:56,319 --> 02:35:01,119
because actually some of the smoky

3655
02:34:58,809 --> 02:35:05,559
compounds are athlete's actually plant

3656
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:08,130
growth regulators the essence of what

3657
02:35:05,559 --> 02:35:12,489
the forest released when it does burn

3658
02:35:08,129 --> 02:35:14,949
actually initiates new seed germination

3659
02:35:12,489 --> 02:35:17,409
so some of those compounds have actually

3660
02:35:14,950 --> 02:35:19,960
been explored as plant growth regulators

3661
02:35:17,409 --> 02:35:22,539
and things that up regulate things for

3662
02:35:19,959 --> 02:35:25,119
seed germination that happen and also

3663
02:35:22,540 --> 02:35:27,521
you know you're just talking about with

3664
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:29,860
organic you know if you bring a

3665
02:35:27,521 --> 02:35:33,850
refractometer into a health food store

3666
02:35:29,860 --> 02:35:35,771
and you're you know testing the the

3667
02:35:33,850 --> 02:35:38,050
ratings on a lot of these foods they

3668
02:35:35,771 --> 02:35:40,659
really actually have zero nutrients you

3669
02:35:38,049 --> 02:35:42,909
know a lot of these organic foods that

3670
02:35:40,659 --> 02:35:44,771
are even local in our area that we feel

3671
02:35:42,909 --> 02:35:47,049
like are really healthy and good for us

3672
02:35:44,771 --> 02:35:49,030
are coming up really low on the roof

3673
02:35:47,049 --> 02:35:51,189
refractometer you know the idea of

3674
02:35:49,030 --> 02:35:53,560
nutrient-dense food is starting to

3675
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:55,300
become a thing of the past unless we

3676
02:35:53,559 --> 02:35:57,520
really take a hold of this and start

3677
02:35:55,299 --> 02:35:59,439
adding Andry adding minerals into our

3678
02:35:57,521 --> 02:36:01,720
soil you can take a little garlic press

3679
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:02,829
to the store to your cannabis farms or

3680
02:36:01,719 --> 02:36:05,260
to the place where you're getting your

3681
02:36:02,829 --> 02:36:07,120
alfalfa and just press it a drip out

3682
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:09,430
onto the refractometer

3683
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:11,560
and make that decision on where you're

3684
02:36:09,430 --> 02:36:14,590
gonna get your alfalfa from or your

3685
02:36:11,559 --> 02:36:16,899
chard or your carrots or whatever you're

3686
02:36:14,590 --> 02:36:18,760
doing it's one way of testing it and

3687
02:36:16,899 --> 02:36:20,409
even just with us here out on our farm

3688
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:22,750
you know we feel like we have an amazing

3689
02:36:20,409 --> 02:36:24,610
soil we have all closed-loop systems

3690
02:36:22,750 --> 02:36:27,309
everything that we put into our farm is

3691
02:36:24,610 --> 02:36:30,521
from our farm here and you know when we

3692
02:36:27,309 --> 02:36:33,909
first your 10 years ago our vegetables

3693
02:36:30,521 --> 02:36:35,739
and fruits were very low and now over

3694
02:36:33,909 --> 02:36:37,569
time by adding a lot of minerals into

3695
02:36:35,739 --> 02:36:40,629
the soil adding more and more leaf

3696
02:36:37,569 --> 02:36:42,940
material you know oak leaf maple leaf

3697
02:36:40,629 --> 02:36:45,369
these kinds of things that are our

3698
02:36:42,940 --> 02:36:47,980
nutrient density is raising up a lot

3699
02:36:45,370 --> 02:36:50,640
higher in our food so the idea of just

3700
02:36:47,979 --> 02:36:54,010
organic doesn't really mean anything

3701
02:36:50,639 --> 02:36:56,049
unfortunately also organic means that it

3702
02:36:54,010 --> 02:36:58,899
has a tremendous amount of blood and

3703
02:36:56,049 --> 02:37:00,629
bone meal in that you know you talk to

3704
02:36:58,899 --> 02:37:02,609
organic farmers and there

3705
02:37:00,629 --> 02:37:04,559
number one and number two ingredients

3706
02:37:02,610 --> 02:37:06,689
that they're adding into their soil is

3707
02:37:04,559 --> 02:37:08,609
blood and bone meal and when you test

3708
02:37:06,689 --> 02:37:11,579
that blood and bone meal it may be

3709
02:37:08,610 --> 02:37:14,670
registered for organic youth but it

3710
02:37:11,579 --> 02:37:16,469
isn't organic and that's a loophole that

3711
02:37:14,670 --> 02:37:18,840
people are continuously using in the

3712
02:37:16,469 --> 02:37:25,170
cannabis industry and also in the

3713
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:27,750
organic food industry and we would also

3714
02:37:25,170 --> 02:37:29,790
like to say we do use plastic for our

3715
02:37:27,750 --> 02:37:32,760
greenhouse but other than that we have

3716
02:37:29,790 --> 02:37:34,950
no other inputs coming in and we're

3717
02:37:32,760 --> 02:37:37,020
growing amazing food I mean we're just

3718
02:37:34,950 --> 02:37:39,420
using it you don't have to go for

3719
02:37:37,020 --> 02:37:41,880
petrochemicals or nothing you can wear

3720
02:37:39,420 --> 02:37:43,770
it is taking the the weeds that were

3721
02:37:41,879 --> 02:37:45,779
weeding out of our garden and putting

3722
02:37:43,770 --> 02:37:49,020
them in the water liquefying them and

3723
02:37:45,780 --> 02:37:50,909
watering them back into the earth and we

3724
02:37:49,020 --> 02:37:56,220
have the biggest plants in the world and

3725
02:37:50,909 --> 02:37:59,280
well I just know I'm not understand we

3726
02:37:56,219 --> 02:38:01,049
have amazing food and potatoes and I

3727
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:03,210
can't wait to harvest our squash patch

3728
02:38:01,049 --> 02:38:05,549
because it's like phenomenal amazing and

3729
02:38:03,209 --> 02:38:07,978
it's possible and it can be done on

3730
02:38:05,549 --> 02:38:09,750
large scales and organic isn't

3731
02:38:07,978 --> 02:38:11,099
necessarily ant the answer and as a

3732
02:38:09,750 --> 02:38:13,620
community we really need to challenge

3733
02:38:11,100 --> 02:38:14,579
ourselves to to do more in order to say

3734
02:38:13,620 --> 02:38:17,189
are there what about what about

3735
02:38:14,579 --> 02:38:19,110
closed-loop vegetables and fruits you

3736
02:38:17,189 --> 02:38:21,148
know so that we know that the people are

3737
02:38:19,110 --> 02:38:25,800
remineralizing by utilizing what they're

3738
02:38:21,148 --> 02:38:27,809
taking off of their farms man I'll tell

3739
02:38:25,799 --> 02:38:29,969
you we've done this earth in pretty good

3740
02:38:27,809 --> 02:38:31,799
we got to figure some [ __ ] out here in

3741
02:38:29,969 --> 02:38:34,289
the next couple of generations because

3742
02:38:31,799 --> 02:38:37,590
it's really crucial it's actually really

3743
02:38:34,290 --> 02:38:39,720
simple it's called give more than you

3744
02:38:37,590 --> 02:38:43,350
pay there it is

3745
02:38:39,719 --> 02:38:45,209
give more than you take beautiful Sam

3746
02:38:43,350 --> 02:38:47,100
that's exactly what it is I feel like

3747
02:38:45,209 --> 02:38:49,949
you know even organic farming is that

3748
02:38:47,100 --> 02:38:52,470
they're taking a lot and even even farms

3749
02:38:49,950 --> 02:38:55,200
that may be utilizing you know maybe

3750
02:38:52,469 --> 02:38:57,420
their cover crop or whatever but they're

3751
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:59,340
still growing it out of the same soil so

3752
02:38:57,420 --> 02:39:01,648
that those cover crops can only uptake

3753
02:38:59,340 --> 02:39:03,120
what's in the soil already so if we're

3754
02:39:01,648 --> 02:39:05,519
not getting back to the soil and

3755
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:06,450
continuously taking from it it's just

3756
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:09,000
not going to be helpful

3757
02:39:06,450 --> 02:39:12,409
cover crops are good at fixing nitrogen

3758
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:12,409
- from the air

3759
02:39:14,149 --> 02:39:20,189
but like you said earlier Sam that takes

3760
02:39:17,069 --> 02:39:23,760
a few years to really kick in yep that's

3761
02:39:20,189 --> 02:39:30,059
absolutely true because I bet an organic

3762
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:34,079
biodynamic farmer for since 1972 and you

3763
02:39:30,059 --> 02:39:38,840
know it it takes time to build up really

3764
02:39:34,079 --> 02:39:41,159
really nice soil it's work worth doing

3765
02:39:38,840 --> 02:39:43,978
here in California there's actually

3766
02:39:41,159 --> 02:39:45,450
funding for farmers to build soil

3767
02:39:43,978 --> 02:39:47,728
content and what they're really talking

3768
02:39:45,450 --> 02:39:51,329
about is the same sort of thing we're

3769
02:39:47,728 --> 02:39:55,438
talking about is strive to add organic

3770
02:39:51,329 --> 02:39:56,670
content to the soil of course if your

3771
02:39:55,439 --> 02:40:02,370
cannabis farmer they're not willing to

3772
02:39:56,670 --> 02:40:03,960
talk to you but yeah and I got to sign

3773
02:40:02,370 --> 02:40:07,620
off here pretty soon

3774
02:40:03,959 --> 02:40:12,089
but I wanted to say thank you Marcus for

3775

we just want to know how we can support

3798
02:41:02,010 --> 02:41:06,200
you in forests that's that's that's

3799
02:41:04,079 --> 02:41:09,510
really the base of it and how we can

3800
02:41:06,200 --> 02:41:11,280
continue your garments and then in turn

3801
02:41:09,510 --> 02:41:13,020
helping to support forests and what he's

3802
02:41:11,280 --> 02:41:14,729
doing we're a hundred percent behind you

3803
02:41:13,020 --> 02:41:16,530
guys and whatever we can do we're in

3804
02:41:14,728 --> 02:41:18,869
well that sounds like another trip

3805
02:41:16,530 --> 02:41:23,150
things that happen yeah Cheers

3806
02:41:18,870 --> 02:41:26,100
ciao thank you guys

3807
02:41:23,149 --> 02:41:27,898
yeah come on up to Canada forests all

3808
02:41:26,100 --> 02:41:29,550
I'll be there for that trip oh it's

3809
02:41:27,898 --> 02:41:30,028
happening it's gonna happen the next

3810
02:41:29,549 --> 02:41:35,459
year

3811
02:41:30,029 --> 02:41:38,010
nice amazing clatters Network world tour

3812
02:41:35,459 --> 02:41:40,169
okay of course well you know Canada

3813
02:41:38,010 --> 02:41:42,779
Canada has a federal program so you

3814
02:41:40,170 --> 02:41:46,170
could get into some pretty good spots I

3815
02:41:42,779 --> 02:41:47,670
think to get that information out yeah

3816
02:41:46,170 --> 02:41:49,079
I've been looking at a few events and we

3817
02:41:47,670 --> 02:41:50,699
will talk about this another time but

3818
02:41:49,079 --> 02:41:52,260
yeah we're gonna time it right maybe for

3819
02:41:50,699 --> 02:41:55,050
next summer and there's some things

3820
02:41:52,260 --> 02:41:58,920
going on and hopefully because right

3821
02:41:55,049 --> 02:42:00,658
yeah absolutely so there's so much

3822
02:41:58,920 --> 02:42:02,340
information out there these days that

3823
02:42:00,658 --> 02:42:06,449
people actually have a hard time finding

3824
02:42:02,340 --> 02:42:10,469
the good information yeah so this is if

3825
02:42:06,449 --> 02:42:12,239
you can imagine a problem it's that's

3826
02:42:10,469 --> 02:42:14,488
why it's good to push that good

3827
02:42:12,238 --> 02:42:16,709
information up to the top every time you

3828
02:42:14,488 --> 02:42:18,420
find it get it out there so it makes it

3829
02:42:16,709 --> 02:42:20,669
a little bit easier for people to find I

3830
02:42:18,420 --> 02:42:22,290
you know I'm so deep into this to me it

3831
02:42:20,670 --> 02:42:24,689
doesn't seem that hard to find at all

3832
02:42:22,290 --> 02:42:26,699
but I know so many of the histories and

3833
02:42:24,689 --> 02:42:28,738
so many of the backgrounds of where the

3834
02:42:26,699 --> 02:42:32,158
information is coming from that that is

3835
02:42:28,738 --> 02:42:34,020
also very helpful to know what kind of

3836
02:42:32,158 --> 02:42:36,029
what the quality of the information that

3837
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:38,130
you're getting is so I think once you

3838
02:42:36,029 --> 02:42:40,140
have a good foundational understanding

3839
02:42:38,129 --> 02:42:42,118
you're able to sift through things more

3840
02:42:40,139 --> 02:42:46,228
quickly you know you don't waste a lot

3841
02:42:42,119 --> 02:42:49,229
of time on bad you know papers and

3842
02:42:46,228 --> 02:42:50,849
articles and info but it's giving people

3843
02:42:49,228 --> 02:42:54,299
up to that level where they can just be

3844
02:42:50,850 --> 02:42:56,279
competent enough to be able to sift

3845
02:42:54,299 --> 02:42:59,818
through some of the nonsense that is the

3846
02:42:56,279 --> 02:43:01,590
you know negative part of the wonderful

3847
02:42:59,818 --> 02:43:03,868
thing we call the internet and free

3848
02:43:01,590 --> 02:43:06,270
information you know which is even doing

3849
02:43:03,869 --> 02:43:08,069
research on the sites that are releasing

3850
02:43:06,270 --> 02:43:10,140
that information in the first place you

3851
02:43:08,068 --> 02:43:11,789
know like there's definitely like you

3852
02:43:10,139 --> 02:43:13,590
know is it a trusted source of

3853
02:43:11,790 --> 02:43:18,149
information or is it one of these sort

3854
02:43:13,590 --> 02:43:21,299
of just like people fishing for for

3855
02:43:18,148 --> 02:43:25,408
attraction just not necessarily sharing

3856
02:43:21,299 --> 02:43:27,028
truths so we had one question that got

3857
02:43:25,408 --> 02:43:28,770
posted a few times I don't know mark if

3858
02:43:27,029 --> 02:43:31,020
you want to talk about it here on the

3859
02:43:28,770 --> 02:43:34,890
side chat because they asked a few times

3860
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:37,189
about cancer and preventative cannabis

3861
02:43:34,889 --> 02:43:37,189
use

3862
02:43:38,459 --> 02:43:45,579
you see there yeah I mean I asking for

3863
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:49,420
was research reference articles that

3864
02:43:45,579 --> 02:43:51,159
dealt with that issue and I think some

3865
02:43:49,420 --> 02:43:54,370
of the better ones are coming out of

3866
02:43:51,159 --> 02:43:56,829
Spain yeah well for those who can't read

3867
02:43:54,370 --> 02:43:58,660
the question the question is is there

3868
02:43:56,829 --> 02:44:02,260
evidence for cannabis as a preventive

3869
02:43:58,659 --> 02:44:05,649
medicine against cancer yes yes the

3870
02:44:02,260 --> 02:44:10,090
answer is yes unequivocally yes in fact

3871
02:44:05,649 --> 02:44:12,310
the US patent on cannabis proves it

3872
02:44:10,090 --> 02:44:15,299
right so it does have neuroprotective

3873
02:44:12,310 --> 02:44:17,799
activity in that it's a fat soluble

3874
02:44:15,299 --> 02:44:21,459
antioxidant so it deposits in the fatty

3875
02:44:17,799 --> 02:44:24,009
tissue like the brain and it quenches

3876
02:44:21,459 --> 02:44:25,869
free radicals free radicals form

3877
02:44:24,010 --> 02:44:30,670
mutations that lead into cancer

3878
02:44:25,870 --> 02:44:32,470
so yes yeah absolutely it does so in the

3879
02:44:30,670 --> 02:44:34,090
pancreas and does so in the liver as

3880
02:44:32,469 --> 02:44:35,739
well the other thing that it doesn't

3881
02:44:34,090 --> 02:44:38,680
deliver and we were talking about CBD

3882
02:44:35,739 --> 02:44:43,090
before one of the things that CBD how

3883
02:44:38,680 --> 02:44:46,060
CBD works is it lowers the metabolic

3884
02:44:43,090 --> 02:44:49,271
activity of metabolic degradation of

3885
02:44:46,060 --> 02:44:51,869
other component that's in the liver so

3886
02:44:49,271 --> 02:44:55,510
basically that's what's called

3887
02:44:51,870 --> 02:44:57,641
cytochrome p450 and related oxidative

3888
02:44:55,510 --> 02:45:00,060
enzymes and deliver that basically start

3889
02:44:57,640 --> 02:45:03,310
creating all kinds of things in the body

3890
02:45:00,060 --> 02:45:06,010
so part of the activity that CBD has it

3891
02:45:03,310 --> 02:45:08,890
basically lowers the degradation of

3892
02:45:06,010 --> 02:45:12,040
what's already in your in your blood a

3893
02:45:08,890 --> 02:45:15,690
good example of that is with THC you

3894
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:19,840
take CBD and THC together and it makes

3895
02:45:15,690 --> 02:45:24,690
the combo last longer the effects right

3896
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:27,250
exactly for that reason yep exactly

3897
02:45:24,690 --> 02:45:30,489
well I think you know although there's

3898
02:45:27,250 --> 02:45:33,700
not papers on this that what we know

3899
02:45:30,489 --> 02:45:37,449
about how cannabinoids interacts with

3900
02:45:33,700 --> 02:45:40,180
the cb2 receptor how they trigger

3901
02:45:37,450 --> 02:45:41,860
apoptosis and other cell death cycles

3902
02:45:40,180 --> 02:45:43,989
you know cancer is happening in our

3903
02:45:41,860 --> 02:45:45,730
bodies all the time the nerve our knees

3904
02:45:43,989 --> 02:45:47,379
are fighting them so you know

3905
02:45:45,729 --> 02:45:48,729
supplements of these cannabinoids

3906
02:45:47,379 --> 02:45:49,539
although I don't have a reference paper

3907
02:45:48,729 --> 02:45:51,549
to

3908
02:45:49,540 --> 02:45:54,220
point you to logic would suggest I do

3909
02:45:51,549 --> 02:45:56,109
then my wonderful I'd love to see it but

3910
02:45:54,219 --> 02:45:58,000
you know lo it would suggest that you

3911
02:45:56,110 --> 02:45:59,710
know any assistance you can have and

3912
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:01,860
triggering that system and cancer cells

3913
02:45:59,709 --> 02:46:04,379
in the body is going to be beneficial

3914
02:46:01,860 --> 02:46:06,489
yeah absolutely so it's also

3915
02:46:04,379 --> 02:46:10,270
anti-angiogenic so you know the way that

3916
02:46:06,489 --> 02:46:12,369
tumors survive is in the what's called

3917
02:46:10,271 --> 02:46:14,350
extracellular matrix they emergent

3918
02:46:12,370 --> 02:46:17,710
growth factor and the growth factor

3919
02:46:14,350 --> 02:46:21,159
stimulates blood cell or blood vessel

3920
02:46:17,709 --> 02:46:24,579
formation from an existing artery or or

3921
02:46:21,159 --> 02:46:28,809
existing vein or a paleri to basically

3922
02:46:24,579 --> 02:46:31,629
sprout an artery or vein to the the

3923
02:46:28,809 --> 02:46:35,049
tumor itself and so if you can inhibit

3924
02:46:31,629 --> 02:46:37,299
the tumors ability to reroute vascular

3925
02:46:35,049 --> 02:46:41,049
plug feed itself it's one way of choking

3926
02:46:37,299 --> 02:46:43,719
tumor so it's it's anti it's also an

3927
02:46:41,049 --> 02:46:46,539
anti proliferative so they've also shown

3928
02:46:43,719 --> 02:46:50,829
and this is primarily the work by Manuel

3929
02:46:46,540 --> 02:46:55,560
Guzman in Spain it was probably Sam

3930
02:46:50,829 --> 02:46:58,899
arguably the lead researcher in terms of

3931
02:46:55,559 --> 02:47:02,109
cannabinoids and their impact on cancer

3932
02:46:58,899 --> 02:47:05,079
and actually looking to see molecular

3933
02:47:02,110 --> 02:47:08,140
mechanisms and fundamental markers that

3934
02:47:05,079 --> 02:47:13,510
show the impact that cannabinoids have

3935
02:47:08,139 --> 02:47:15,849
on tumors and you know anecdotally you

3936
02:47:13,510 --> 02:47:18,280
go to the you know internet and you'll

3937
02:47:15,850 --> 02:47:20,079
see yeah Rick Simpson oil you put it on

3938
02:47:18,280 --> 02:47:22,450
a tumor you keep putting it on

3939
02:47:20,079 --> 02:47:23,979
eventually it goes away so there is

3940
02:47:22,450 --> 02:47:28,050
something about this that you know

3941
02:47:23,979 --> 02:47:30,250
cannabinoids do have basically make

3942
02:47:28,049 --> 02:47:33,129
cancer go away is it a cure for cancer

3943
02:47:30,250 --> 02:47:35,950
maybe not has to be defined I think more

3944
02:47:33,129 --> 02:47:38,679
in the terms that medical science can

3945
02:47:35,950 --> 02:47:41,430
actually see it in terms of dosing and

3946
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:45,250
understanding what the appropriate

3947
02:47:41,430 --> 02:47:48,010
medicine in terms of form and delivery

3948
02:47:45,250 --> 02:47:49,989
is a very very key thing I think that

3949
02:47:48,010 --> 02:47:53,139
I've said this before many times on

3950
02:47:49,989 --> 02:47:54,819
church I think the US pharmaceutical

3951
02:47:53,139 --> 02:47:59,170
industry has got the world believing

3952
02:47:54,819 --> 02:48:01,659
that whatever it is there's a pill for

3953
02:47:59,170 --> 02:48:03,280
it and so to me it's like you have to

3954
02:48:01,659 --> 02:48:05,079
get beyond that paradigm

3955
02:48:03,280 --> 02:48:06,730
something that you're gonna eat that

3956
02:48:05,079 --> 02:48:08,289
you're gonna ingest that's gonna go down

3957
02:48:06,729 --> 02:48:11,229
into your stomach that's going to

3958
02:48:08,290 --> 02:48:13,750
dissolve and have some miraculous effect

3959
02:48:11,229 --> 02:48:16,299
on your health you know if cancer is

3960
02:48:13,750 --> 02:48:17,860
here you put the medicine here on your

3961
02:48:16,299 --> 02:48:20,590
arm if that's where it is

3962
02:48:17,860 --> 02:48:23,140
so again localized delivery is really

3963
02:48:20,590 --> 02:48:25,030
really important because that aligns as

3964
02:48:23,139 --> 02:48:26,619
we know are not very water-soluble so

3965
02:48:25,030 --> 02:48:28,659
they have to be delivered in such a way

3966
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:31,380
that can they can get to where they're

3967
02:48:28,659 --> 02:48:34,420
you know basically gonna be effective

3968
02:48:31,379 --> 02:48:35,769
you know we see I hear people some of

3969
02:48:34,420 --> 02:48:36,670
the people who come and ask for health

3970
02:48:35,770 --> 02:48:39,069
or saying well we're thinking about

3971
02:48:36,670 --> 02:48:40,809
cannabis but the type of cancer that we

3972
02:48:39,069 --> 02:48:42,879
have doesn't really respond well to

3973
02:48:40,809 --> 02:48:44,350
chemotherapy our doctor said but they

3974
02:48:42,879 --> 02:48:46,929
said they might have these new drugs

3975
02:48:44,350 --> 02:48:48,520
that help block the blood flow to the

3976
02:48:46,930 --> 02:48:50,290
cells and they actually caused some the

3977
02:48:48,520 --> 02:48:52,300
die by some word they trigger it may

3978
02:48:50,290 --> 02:48:55,300
trigger the cell death that's like wow

3979
02:48:52,299 --> 02:48:56,590
that's exactly what we do know and we're

3980
02:48:55,299 --> 02:48:57,819
still learning new things it does but

3981
02:48:56,590 --> 02:48:59,500
what things worse right now

3982
02:48:57,819 --> 02:49:01,869
that's what cannabis does it blocks

3983
02:48:59,500 --> 02:49:04,120
blood flow so it slows the duplication

3984
02:49:01,870 --> 02:49:06,130
of these rapidly duplicating cells and

3985
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:08,140
it causes them to have a lifespan kind

3986
02:49:06,129 --> 02:49:09,729
of takes away their immortality that and

3987
02:49:08,139 --> 02:49:11,949
that's essentially what cancer is is

3988
02:49:09,729 --> 02:49:15,939
this rapid duplicating non dying cell

3989
02:49:11,950 --> 02:49:18,970
until it kills you and it's it's great

3990
02:49:15,940 --> 02:49:20,050
to see that there people are starting to

3991
02:49:18,969 --> 02:49:22,000
understand that a little better but it's

3992
02:49:20,049 --> 02:49:23,909
kind of sad when you know they're not

3993
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:26,290
being encouraged to at least try it as a

3994
02:49:23,909 --> 02:49:27,219
benefit you know not necessarily cure

3995
02:49:26,290 --> 02:49:30,430
but something that could be beneficial

3996
02:49:27,219 --> 02:49:31,750
and told to hold off for the newest

3997
02:49:30,430 --> 02:49:33,639
pharmaceutical drug they're trying the

3998
02:49:31,750 --> 02:49:36,850
design that does the exact same thing

3999
02:49:33,639 --> 02:49:39,099
maybe the other thing that I wanted to

4000
02:49:36,850 --> 02:49:41,860
mention too is the fact that cannabis is

4001
02:49:39,100 --> 02:49:44,620
an adaptogenic you know along with a lot

4002
02:49:41,860 --> 02:49:46,870
of other plants and in you know the

4003
02:49:44,620 --> 02:49:49,630
plant kingdom as well as a lot in micro

4004
02:49:46,870 --> 02:49:52,930
mycology you know mushrooms are also

4005
02:49:49,629 --> 02:49:54,939
Anacapa genic so the cannabis decides

4006
02:49:52,930 --> 02:49:58,540
you know a lot of times when people

4007
02:49:54,940 --> 02:50:00,100
utilize with our immune systems with our

4008
02:49:58,540 --> 02:50:02,380
own intelligence and our own bodily

4009
02:50:00,100 --> 02:50:05,200
intelligence it really decides on how

4010
02:50:02,379 --> 02:50:07,899
it's going to help and heal us and along

4011
02:50:05,200 --> 02:50:10,300
with that adaptogenic in our body it

4012
02:50:07,899 --> 02:50:13,149
also becomes ad adaptogenic to our minds

4013
02:50:10,299 --> 02:50:15,489
I believe that cannabis helps us make

4014
02:50:13,149 --> 02:50:16,810
better decisions because it is an

4015
02:50:15,489 --> 02:50:18,909
adaptogenic it makes

4016
02:50:16,810 --> 02:50:21,909
us more adaptable beings on the planet

4017
02:50:18,909 --> 02:50:24,341
as well which I think you know it's

4018
02:50:21,909 --> 02:50:27,460
giving us a higher intelligence along

4019
02:50:24,341 --> 02:50:29,440
with the other adaptogenic mushrooms and

4020
02:50:27,460 --> 02:50:30,909
you know vegetation that's given

4021
02:50:29,440 --> 02:50:32,950
directly by Mother Nature they really

4022
02:50:30,909 --> 02:50:35,470
gotta just eat your immune system I mean

4023
02:50:32,950 --> 02:50:37,659
number one in us all the things we can

4024
02:50:35,470 --> 02:50:39,479
do just how many can we find that are

4025
02:50:37,659 --> 02:50:42,251
immune boosting you know that's that's

4026
02:50:39,479 --> 02:50:45,040
along with the cannabinoids and a line

4027
02:50:42,251 --> 02:50:47,560
with these adaptogenic things that

4028
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:49,210
Mother Nature has given to us well don't

4029
02:50:47,560 --> 02:50:52,841
you think there's a connection into

4030
02:50:49,210 --> 02:50:56,770
music because I'm a musician I've played

4031
02:50:52,841 --> 02:50:59,229
music I think just about the same time

4032
02:50:56,771 --> 02:51:00,521
as I've been getting high so I begin I

4033
02:50:59,229 --> 02:51:02,109
just as long as I've been playing music

4034
02:51:00,521 --> 02:51:05,079
so for me the two things are very

4035
02:51:02,110 --> 02:51:09,280
connected and I what I get from one I

4036
02:51:05,079 --> 02:51:12,130
put into the other I feel that like my

4037
02:51:09,280 --> 02:51:14,440
spirituality and my ability to reach to

4038
02:51:12,130 --> 02:51:17,529
other people has to do with both the

4039
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:20,471
plant but both music - so to me it's

4040
02:51:17,530 --> 02:51:25,239
like there's this universe that's been

4041
02:51:20,470 --> 02:51:28,810
created that creates you know like when

4042
02:51:25,239 --> 02:51:31,511
I express myself in my music I'm doing

4043
02:51:28,810 --> 02:51:33,640
so because my cannabinoid receptors are

4044
02:51:31,511 --> 02:51:36,190
firing and I'm John Cole trading and I'm

4045
02:51:33,640 --> 02:51:38,979
trying to let it come out man I'm doing

4046
02:51:36,190 --> 02:51:41,681
my best Garcia I'm just like letting it

4047
02:51:38,979 --> 02:51:44,619
go man and then when I look out in the

4048
02:51:41,681 --> 02:51:47,591
audience and I see like this dude just

4049
02:51:44,620 --> 02:51:49,091
totally like doing his thing - so he

4050
02:51:47,591 --> 02:51:50,739
just took a hit of some weed and he's

4051
02:51:49,091 --> 02:51:53,110
just he's getting into it - so it's like

4052
02:51:50,739 --> 02:51:54,819
to me I'm connecting with this guy right

4053
02:51:53,110 --> 02:51:57,011
I've never I don't even know this dude

4054
02:51:54,819 --> 02:51:59,739
right but we're connecting and we're for

4055
02:51:57,011 --> 02:52:01,841
that moment like we're on a different

4056
02:51:59,739 --> 02:52:04,421
level of spirituality and so I think

4057
02:52:01,841 --> 02:52:06,341
it's like yeah it's like I always tell

4058
02:52:04,421 --> 02:52:11,021
people it got us drawn on the walls of

4059
02:52:06,341 --> 02:52:14,351
the cave and what got you know musicians

4060
02:52:11,021 --> 02:52:16,120
I think especially jazz musicians when

4061
02:52:14,351 --> 02:52:18,190
they realized that maybe I mean the

4062
02:52:16,120 --> 02:52:20,771
stresses of life and the stress of the

4063
02:52:18,190 --> 02:52:22,989
worlds around them they could just you

4064
02:52:20,771 --> 02:52:25,360
know get nice and then a sudden it just

4065
02:52:22,989 --> 02:52:27,251
comes out in triple bars and comes out

4066
02:52:25,360 --> 02:52:30,011
and cheats because they're able to kind

4067
02:52:27,251 --> 02:52:30,760
of de-stress themselves to bring things

4068
02:52:30,011 --> 02:52:33,340
down

4069
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:36,670
to where their creativity just overflows

4070
02:52:33,340 --> 02:52:39,250
into that other space that may not have

4071
02:52:36,670 --> 02:52:45,670
been there if you didn't consume you

4072
02:52:39,250 --> 02:52:47,170
know I don't know maybe and when you

4073
02:52:45,670 --> 02:52:48,850
stimulate your immune system you're

4074
02:52:47,170 --> 02:52:50,799
gonna stimulate all of those happy

4075
02:52:48,850 --> 02:52:53,109
receptors as well and that's why I just

4076
02:52:50,799 --> 02:52:56,019
can't see you know in separating

4077
02:52:53,109 --> 02:52:58,809
recreational from from you know

4078
02:52:56,020 --> 02:53:01,569
medicinal distressing you know I mean

4079
02:52:58,809 --> 02:53:03,250
last night we did a little bit of a test

4080
02:53:01,568 --> 02:53:04,478
trial we had a gathering with our

4081
02:53:03,250 --> 02:53:07,090
community we live in a really small

4082
02:53:04,478 --> 02:53:09,789
community and we handed out um probably

4083
02:53:07,090 --> 02:53:11,290
over 30 joints to everybody and I'll

4084
02:53:09,790 --> 02:53:13,600
tell you it was the best party that we

4085
02:53:11,290 --> 02:53:15,100
have had in a really long time it just

4086
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:17,409
like a lot of people who might not

4087
02:53:15,100 --> 02:53:19,029
normally smoke or people who you know

4088
02:53:17,409 --> 02:53:20,920
might be smoking something that's not so

4089
02:53:19,029 --> 02:53:22,689
great I mean really everybody was

4090
02:53:20,920 --> 02:53:24,068
hugging one another last night and it

4091
02:53:22,689 --> 02:53:28,620
was like an ability to come together

4092
02:53:24,068 --> 02:53:31,929
through cannabis people love free joints

4093
