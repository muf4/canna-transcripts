1
00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:19,480
[Music]

2
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,358
All right.

3
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,920
Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World

4
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,880
and I want to welcome my two guests. We

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,880
got uh Golden Bear Hades on Instagram if

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,879
you want to check him out and Winds

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,359
West. And I was with these guys the

8
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,000
other day for Hashurch. And uh we kind

9
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,519
of had all this epic glass together and

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
had this feeling like we wanted to have

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,840
a session, but really the session was

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,039
hash church. The focus was hash church.

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,199
So today we've decided that uh 420

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,879
session is in session and it's going

15
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,960
down. These guys have come down from

16
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:02,640
Whistler and uh we're here right on the

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,840
beautiful House Sound and we've got what

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,680
I would call a pretty damn epic lineup.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,799
Pretty stacked up there by anyone's

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,840
standards. Perfect. So, we've got uh on

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,520
the far left here, your lookers right,

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,759
we've got the Swiss Perk, which is a

23
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,560
gift uh from Nate Dizzle years ago when

24
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,239
I went to Holland with him and we uh

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,079
drove down to Germany along with uh

26
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,000
Steve Hops to do some collaborations.

27
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,798
Those guys did some collaborations with

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,599
Martin from RU. Uh next to that we've

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,159
got a prototype uh Fab Egg from Scott

30
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,798
Deppy's company, The Mothership. And

31
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,000
then uh I'll let you explain your piece.

32
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,560
Third in line there. So this is a Marcel

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,118
um Dale Smer's collab. It's

34
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,399
a pretty epic. It's got uh some big

35
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,959
thick flat cane on it. some of Marcel's

36
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,960
readies on the base and in the center

37
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,039
and on the disc mouth. I don't know if

38
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,839
you can see. Yeah, that disc mouth is

39
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,000
ridiculous. And and the slide for it,

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,680
too. It's pretty awesome. So beautiful.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,040
Marcel actually explained a little bit

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,640
about this piece if you guys want to get

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,360
some of the history on the last episode

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,919
of Hashurch episode 29. I think he comes

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,239
in around 18 or 19 minute mark and he

46
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,079
starts talking about it. So, uh, next in

47
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,400
line after that is another clear proto

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
from Mothership. Uh, this one being the

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Taurus, Scott Deppy's design on the

50
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:27,199
recycler. Uh, it's got a DC glass

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,680
banger. And then, uh, next in line, next

52
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,679
in line is an Aaron Colbert uh, Dutch

53
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
pump. Uh, Aaron just started working on

54
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,560
these designs this year and he's been

55
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,560
killing it. Super functional. Uh, and

56
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,000
the color way is uh, lemonrop over

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,360
pomegranate. And then the guy after that

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,280
is uh, Mothership Elite Ball Rig. Uh the

59
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,840
color is

60
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,680
Equinox. Uh the guy after that is an AK

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,400
absolute crunk uh

62
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,360
recruit. And uh then a blue Stardust

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,480
little stack low

64
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,000
recycler. And then after that you got a

65
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,719
Dosa part of the mother ship and it's

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,759
his little tube. It's a his rainbow

67
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:12,158
ready over the crushed opal. Um it's

68
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,120
really thick um because of the layering

69
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,359
of the crush and the opal. Um, it's

70
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,840
uranium, so under black light, it glows

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,360
like crazy. Yeah, it's beautiful. Yeah,

72
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,039
it's one of those sleepers. You don't

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,519
really know what it does until you

74
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,959
actually put that light onto it. And

75
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,319
then after that, you got a slop cup.

76
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:36,479
It's actually a collab between Zach P

77
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:38,000
and Slop. Um, it's a nice little ripper.

78
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,560
And then beside that, it's a little

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,318
Snick. Uh, it's his new line. It's the

80
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,239
the Trill Jammers is what he's calling

81
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:49,439
them. It's uh double cup purple with

82
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,200
slime and peach. So, it's a it's a

83
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,878
little pocket right kind of. Yeah.

84
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,878
Beautiful. And then finally to finish it

85
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,759
off, we've got the straight fab. A

86
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,079
pretty big beast of a straight fab. Uh

87
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,919
they're not making these any longer. The

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,439
holes, the perk holes are put in really

89
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,518
low, which I really like about this

90
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,000
piece. Really adds to the chug. It's got

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,080
a Cory Cottenum uh drop down that was a

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
gift from Flav. and it has the new

93
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,239
silicon carbide um hybrid titanium nail

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
plugged into the dabinator. So, we've

95
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,719
got the D nail on this side plugged into

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,720
the mother ship with the Pooking B um

97
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,240
quartz bowl. And then also I we didn't

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:30,880
mention that this um Dutch pump is

99
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,240
rocking a double XL banger from DC

100
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,839
Glass. So, we're going to hit that one

101
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,600
today. Super excited. Yeah. Maybe

102
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,319
towards the end we'll just drop some

103
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,560
huge rip that we can all drop a ribbon

104
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,319
in there. I'm not really like a guy to

105
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,600
take a 2 g rip, but I'll definitely

106
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,199
share a big giant double XXL rip with uh

107
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,120
with you guys. No problem. Sounds good

108
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,560
to me. So, yeah, we also put a little

109
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,000
bit of treats out on the table here.

110
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,399
We've obviously got our beautifully

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,800
cleaned water with some ice, but we've

112
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,758
also got some organic strawberries and

113
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,120
some uh bread with some oil and vinegar.

114
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,280
I thought it would be a good kind of way

115
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
to cleanse our pallet between some of

116
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,198
the rips that were taken. It's awesome.

117
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,240
And then you guys went and did uh outdid

118
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,840
yourselves over here, didn't you? A

119
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,879
bunch of work the last couple days. We

120
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,799
made a fat slab of rosin. A fat slab of

121
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,639
rosin, you don't say. Another fat slab

122
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,400
other than the one we had on Hashurch,

123
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,319
right? Well, that's definitely got to be

124
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,120
qualifiable as a fat slab. Strip it

125
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,120
open. A forearm

126
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:30,959
even. That's how you guys post the

127
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,959
picture. Oh yeah. Let's

128
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,519
see. Yep. That is quite something. I

129
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,600
just uh have a new

130
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:42,639
appreciation knowing for 100% sure that

131
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,199
there's no solvent or, you know, parts.

132
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,360
And the flavor profile is unlike any oil

133
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,600
I've ever had in my life. Yeah, it's

134
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,960
literally pretty unique, isn't it? We've

135
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,680
also got some Horatio Delbert. Um his

136
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,120
latest lemonine, I guess, distillation.

137
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,360
He's literally I don't know if it was

138
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,879
like a rosin type process, but basically

139
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,120
he cleaned up his LHO to a new level and

140
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,478
this is very very very new and will

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,600
probably take a couple of dabs of that

142
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,758
as well. Really good medicine. This is

143
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,240
decarboxilated fully 100% activated

144
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,160
before you heat it up and take a rip. So

145
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,038
you can rub it on your skin, you can

146
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,360
consume it orally, or you can dab it,

147
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,959
which is to me that's that's that raw

148
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,240
raw. That's the real medicine right

149
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,159
there. Yeah, absolutely. And then of

150
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,120
course I got a little bit of D420K dry

151
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,600
sift. We'll be hitting some

152
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,319
dabs dunks of that. So between the hash,

153
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,439
the rosin, and the oil, I think uh I

154
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,680
think we're good to go. It's just a

155
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,719
matter of uh where do we begin,

156
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,240
gentlemen? Where do what would you pick

157
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,400
if you had your pick? Because you do.

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,038
That's tough. You know, it'll be an

159
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,038
interesting thing without any sort of

160
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,639
what piece. Are we start at one end of

161
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,240
the table or do we just start picking

162
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
off? You could literally start anywhere

163
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,360
you want. I'm I might start in the

164
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,720
middle and just kind of Hey, I don't

165
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,759
mind starting in the middle because the

166
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,800
middle puts me right around here. Yeah,

167
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,319
it's not a bad spot to start.

168
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,160
Start in the mini section. Yeah,

169
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,800
literally these two are both the six the

170
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,720
the sixth piece. They both meet right in

171
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,038
the middle. So, I guess what I should do

172
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,479
is hit them both simultaneously out of

173
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,399
each nostril. Totally joking. That's not

174
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,758
what you do with elites. What do you

175
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,120
guys What do you What's your take on

176
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,360
people flipping rigs? Uh, it hurts my

177
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,800
heart. Oh my god, does it hurt my heart?

178
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,120
What is that? Did someone just want to

179
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,759
like, hey, we should infuse some massive

180
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,519
stupidity into a really kind of cool

181
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,759
like thing. It's tough to say, right?

182
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:41,120
Uh, it sounds cool. Like, my ships do

183
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,439
flips. And the idea of like flipping a

184
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,519
piece before you take a rip is cool, but

185
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,160
the idea of losing potentially that

186
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,560
piece that breaks breaks my heart. and

187
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,319
just uh yeah, I must just be too old

188
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,879
because I can't even wrap my head around

189
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,879
it at all. I I haven't seen much of it.

190
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,800
Some guy posted in the Mothership group

191
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,960
today and he had flipped a piece and

192
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,560
then took the rip and I was like, it had

193
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,000
one of these on it and I was literally

194
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,680
like, did he just put that on afterwards

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,038
or did he flip it with it? And I watched

196
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,319
the video again. I was like, he flipped

197
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,120
it with that. It's probably nicely

198
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,598
resined in there though, too. Even if it

199
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,959
is, I've seen people put buckets in

200
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,560
after they flip it and then I've seen

201
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,359
people with, you know, flip it with

202
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,038
buckets in and it's crazy. Yeah, it is

203
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,560
crazy. I've seen people flipping their

204
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:28,478
AKs as well. I think that's just it's

205
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,199
hard to handle for sure. Yeah, I

206
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:34,240
couldn't imagine flipping that thing.

207
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,240
All right. Well, I'm

208
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,519
thinking I think I'm going to hit this

209
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,519
little guy. Your boy blue. Yeah, the

210
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,399
Equinox. It's right in the middle. I'm

211
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,320
in the

212
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,159
middle. And what better piece to start

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,839
off with? That color pull is amazing.

214
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,120
I've never seen another elite with that

215
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,680
color pull. There isn't one. It is very

216
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,000
unique. The human in it is uh what sets

217
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:02,000
it off any blue as well. It's like an

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,080
absolute champ, too, doesn't it? So, now

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,839
to figure out, do I want to torch

220
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,360
quartz? Do I want to hit silicon

221
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,680
carbide? So many choices now. You've

222
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,600
narrowed down the rig. Yeah. Well, you

223
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,719
know what I did? I've only ever hit this

224
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,639
rig with the banger. A banger. So, I

225
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,480
think what I'll do, um, you don't mind

226
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,720
quartz going indirect? No, should be all

227
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,800
right. Yeah, quartz is is generally

228
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,800
pretty darn

229
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:28,719
good. Just bring that over this

230
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:31,120
way. Hold on to that for a second. I

231
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,560
love the quartz cuz it doesn't get hot.

232
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,919
Yeah. We'll give it a little wipe with

233
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:38,199
this just for cleaning. Yeah.

234
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,079
Just to make sure nothing goes into

235
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,160
the into the

236
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:47,440
rig. Yes, I will clean my quartz before

237
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,439
I put it into your

238
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,679
elite. God, that just made a lovely

239
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,320
sound. Oh, you want to go behind? I

240
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,799
think it's a good

241
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,680
idea. All

242
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:04,799
right. Now, what do I hit? What do I

243
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,239
hit? Do I hit Horatio's oil? Do I hit

244
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,399
the I think I hit the rosin. I mean,

245
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,959
that's a giant [ __ ] tub of rosin. I

246
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,759
would start with some rosin. Definitely

247
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,958
rosin, bro.

248
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,159
Lo, not get too much out of this right

249
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,599
there. There it is. Right there. I'll

250
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:21,000
give you yours. Want to grab me a little

251
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,839
a little

252
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,078
rosen. Yeah, that's nice. That looks so

253
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,839
sweet with the little nail on it. Yeah,

254
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,879
fits it. What would be incredible is if

255
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:36,440
you could get a quartz bowl with this

256
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,439
color pull. Could you imagine?

257
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,600
But it's just the perfect distance away

258
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,919
to to not be too close. You know what I

259
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,800
mean? It's it's border, but it's like

260
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,719
just got to watch your hat. Yeah. Thank

261
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,639
you. My pleasure. All right. Well, here

262
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,240
we go. Feel free to pick pick a p piece

263
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,120
as well, guys. I mean, it's uh we can

264
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,120
hit multiples at a time.

265
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:22,278
Oh, that's cushy. Oh, yeah. Very cushy.

266
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,800
That is really awesome. Now, if one of

267
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,720
you have an interest on hitting this

268
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,039
with a nail on it, I will pass it over.

269
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,600
I was going to ask for that next. Yeah.

270
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,879
Start in the center. Keep it going.

271
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,040
Might as well, cuz that's actually a

272
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,439
real nice

273
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:51,319
hit with the electric nail on there.

274
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,320
Going for the straight fab.

275
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,480
Yep. Now, the straight fab I have set up

276
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,958
right now. It's sort of in an

277
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,320
experimental phase in the sense that oh

278
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,799
I know what it's doing what we're doing

279
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,959
wrong actually why you're going to get a

280
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,199
super low temp hit although it might not

281
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,719
necessarily be wrong but I'll tell you

282
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,120
this particular head that I have on here

283
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,480
you see how it's big it fits a 20 mm ah

284
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,759
and you got the flat coil on it and I've

285
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,600
got the flat coil on because the other

286
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,559
one I have the silicone carbide is just

287
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,680
the head and it come this middle piece

288
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,239
isn't in it so we could potentially try

289
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,559
that out

290
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,399
here. And that is some strong rosin.

291
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,399
That's very nice. Love that rosin.

292
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:43,559
Mhm. Oh yeah. Such a treat to be in uh

293
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,799
presence of such beautiful

294
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:49,518
glass with great

295
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:52,000
hash, great solvent free oil.

296
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,039
It was uh quite an experience going over

297
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,078
to Horatios the other day and getting to

298
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:01,278
play around in his lab. Yeah, it really

299
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,958
was uh it was you know it's a lot of

300
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,039
people are hard on him in the sense that

301
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,958
oh he's not sharing his concepts and his

302
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,519
ideas. Well, it's like because he's he

303
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,119
feels very responsible that he doesn't

304
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,399
want to share anything that's generally

305
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,519
going to be dangerous to people.

306
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,799
Absolutely. You know, you share

307
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,360
something the wrong way and then all of

308
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,679
a sudden that can be it can it can have

309
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,680
a bad outcome. So, he's really put his

310
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,479
energy and time into making sure that

311
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,719
everything is 100% safe and efficient

312
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,879
and well, like you said, if you don't

313
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,639
have, you know, any knowledge in

314
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,879
chemistry or a degree in chemistry, the

315
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,720
process might, you know, not be on the

316
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:39,200
level that you're extracting at or that

317
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,000
you're used to uh you're proficient at,

318
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,560
rather. Yep. Yep. Exactly. What a great

319
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,958
rip. Starting it out strong with the

320
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:51,518
mini ball rig. My goodness. I need a

321
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,518
strawberry. That's what I

322
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,879
need. Yeah, that's pretty sweet looking

323
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,159
uh little unit you got there. All of

324
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,559
them so unique and so different in their

325
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,559
functionality from It's interesting how

326
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,039
we have the pillars on either side. The

327
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,679
Swiss Perk, which I mean, I don't know

328
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,278
if it had it did, but it must have

329
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,719
inspired.

330
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,480
That's why I said before we started all

331
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,560
this. I was it has to have the

332
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,680
inspiration kind of it has to have it

333
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,919
on. When I first had the Fab Egg and the

334
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,679
Straight Fab described to me without

335
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:31,120
seeing them, I had them described to me

336
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:32,719
as a 360 degree Swiss perk, right? Mhm.

337
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,078
And I'd say that's pretty accurate.

338
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,839
Yeah, it really is. Exactly. I uh when I

339
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,958
first saw the Swiss Perk, I have to say

340
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,199
I was somewhat like I was like, "Oo, I

341
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,759
don't know if I can really deal with

342
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:48,719
that." Like it looked so strange. And

343
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,879
then I was smoking it out of it. This

344
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,399
piece was my daily driver for a long

345
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,240
time. Like to the point where I took it

346
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,159
camping. Oh, cool. That piece has been

347
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,759
punted into the bushes multiple times.

348
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,719
Like in the pitch black, people getting

349
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,198
up by the fire and just being

350
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,639
like Oh, it's so thick. Yeah. Super

351
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:08,399
thick. Yeah. So, it's a real sort of

352
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,959
wellused piece. I always got to shout

353
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,559
out Nate Dizzle for uh for the gift

354
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,198
because it it blew me away and I

355
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,599
remember it blowing S away. Him being

356
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,599
like, "Why is He's like, "Why do the

357
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,320
hits taste better out of that pipe?" Cuz

358
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,560
I sold S like the Jason Lee double and

359
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,360
triple bubbler marble sllingers back in

360
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,119
01, 02, 03. S's always been on the ball

361
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,600
with the newest, latest, greatest,

362
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,879
right? More for function than art. He's

363
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,040
really more into the just the

364
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,360
functionality, at least from my

365
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:41,198
perspective. He couldn't believe how

366
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,800
much the Swiss Perk made the hit taste

367
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:46,000
better.

368
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:48,078
So interesting. Functionality all the

369
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,078
way. Function over fashion. But if you

370
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,679
can get fashion with your function,

371
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,159
that's what kills it, dude. There you

372
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,719
go. Right.

373
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,600
Make this more

374
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,360
accessible. Drinking out of the bottle.

375
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I brought extra water for when ours gets

376
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,800
low. Yeah. Nice.

377
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,480
Top it up there,

378
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:11,838
brother. Have a little piece of bread

379
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:14,240
and I love the idea of um cannabis

380
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,399
tapas. Just having nice things out on

381
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,399
the

382
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:26,278
table. Definitely makes the session that

383
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,278
much nicer, you know. It sure does.

384
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,879
And often the only thing that

385
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,519
really ends a session for me

386
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:38,278
is becoming too hungry or too thirsty.

387
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,159
It's true. To want to continue. Very

388
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:45,679
true. Got to fill the hunger gap. Mhm.

389
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:48,078
I'm going to torch this guy up. AK. And

390
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:51,479
what fills the hunger gap better than

391
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,479
bread and strawberries?

392
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:57,838
That's my favorite of my uh AKs right

393
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,399
there. It's got the nice booty to it.

394
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,639
Nice fat. The shaping of these older

395
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,638
ones is uh definitely one of my

396
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,639
favorites.

397
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:18,399
Sweet. You

398
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,759
want triple torch threat. The torch

399
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,759
torch works quick though.

400
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,240
I just do a dump of

401
00:17:27,098 --> 00:17:31,639
[Applause]

402
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:35,759
[Music]

403
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,759
this. Nothing wrong with a little

404
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,240
dump. Proper crowd cap for that. Do we

405
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
have a FZ? I didn't see one on the

406
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,000
table. I have one. There's that right

407
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,400
there in front of you. Is that what? Oh,

408
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,038
no. I didn't pull it out. There's one in

409
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,038
my case.

410
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,359
Grab a low temp top from there.

411
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,239
So, what kind of times do you guys like

412
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:40,160
to leave your quartz for? say in regards

413
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:42,720
to oil versus hash, rosin being oil, um

414
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,640
the LHO being oil, anything else oil

415
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,279
wise that you hit? I have my timer that

416
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,960
I use at

417
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:53,240
uh dab.ninja

418
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,240
um hooked up. It's uh

419
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,200
I typically go for He's on his phone.

420
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,960
Yeah, I was just pulling my timer to set

421
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,960
it up for, you know, for those best

422
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,640
flavors. I typically we had a funny

423
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,279
conversation off camera. You had to be

424
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,679
there. I typically hit about 42 to 45

425
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:14,038
seconds for all my oil. And I tend to

426
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,960
not dab hashes um other than rosin I

427
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:20,798
guess

428
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:24,319
um on quartz. Any full melt I dab uh

429
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:27,279
with an enamel with a screen. Uh that

430
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:29,200
was so good though. Best flavor. I I was

431
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,160
coughing and exhaling the awesomeness of

432
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,319
that riff while you were I tried not to

433
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:39,080
hit dab hashes on and I was like I was

434
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:41,599
like you should

435
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:43,839
try. That was a really nice little rip.

436
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,519
Maybe I'll give it a whirl.

437
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,399
I mean, it is in a sense from an oil

438
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,079
perspective, you're going to have that

439
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,280
pain in the ass of being like, "Fuck,

440
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:55,119
that's like a lot of char left over

441
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,119
compared to like the clean oils that

442
00:19:55,119 --> 00:20:00,399
leave nothing." You're always going to

443
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:02,399
get that leftover with tricom heads.

444
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Whatever that membrane, whatever that is

445
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,038
that you're maintaining in the screen

446
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,798
when you press rosin, that ends up on

447
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,038
the nail. It's there right now. And it's

448
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:13,119
just a matter of torching it for a few

449
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,279
seconds. Uh few seconds extra. I might

450
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,439
have to try some of that D420K.

451
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,639
Yeah, please do. Dump it up, dab it up,

452
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,360
do whatever you need. You're welcome to

453
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,520
press it. Torch me. Yeah, there you go.

454
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,678
It's a torch.

455
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,798
Well, this is nice. We have uh also the

456
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,840
invitation to go see Flav later on. So,

457
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,879
we may potentially, you know, continue

458
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:36,480
this uh session for a bit here and

459
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,080
hopefully instill some positive

460
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,240
conversation that can somewhat uh lead

461
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,000
people to learning and whatnot. That's

462
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,440
what Bubble Man's World is all about.

463
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,599
Absolutely. Get that information out

464
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,000
there. Absolutely. But at the same time,

465
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,719
a real appreciation for a part of the

466
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,960
community that comes directly from the

467
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,319
smoking

468
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,519
aspect, which often people, you know,

469
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,960
they'll say, "Oh, your channel would be

470
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,359
more educational if you weren't just

471
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,360
sitting around smoking like teenagers."

472
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:06,158
Try to remind people that the smoking

473
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,798
aspect of cannabis is how a lot of us

474
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,760
came to learn a lot of what we know

475
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,519
about cannabis. the love for well the

476
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,480
passion and then literally like you

477
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:19,279
start seeking it out like why did we why

478
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,279
did Jack Herrer compile his book why

479
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,440
what led him to you know what I mean

480
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,119
like there's this fire within people

481
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,558
that seems to be ignited through the

482
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:31,038
smoking and the intake even orally of

483
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:33,678
cannabis that creates a love for it

484
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:36,640
creates this sort of you know and this

485
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,960
is one aspect of that love and what an

486
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,919
incredible aspect it is like Marcelo was

487
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,840
saying But the head is all it's not

488
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,559
really about the piece, but it's about

489
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:49,359
the story of how the piece came to be

490
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:52,798
and totally what it's gone through and

491
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:55,599
where it's um how you can sit down and

492
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,359
talk about different pieces and

493
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,839
different techniques that these artists

494
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,918
do and function and fashion of the

495
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,918
pieces

496
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:06,000
and the whole business end of it too.

497
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:10,360
And it's like well even the pieces

498
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,679
themselves are they're unique constructs

499
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:15,798
of fractioned aspects of learning that

500
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,640
are shared through specific

501
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:21,279
groups. So this guy learned I mean for

502
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,600
instance Jason Lee learned the double

503
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:28,519
bubbler can that second can weld. It was

504
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:31,918
a big deal when he just shared that with

505
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:33,440
Slinger and a host of other people. all

506
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,720
of a sudden that was at the forefront

507
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,240
and that's what everyone was selling.

508
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,839
Like Jason could have tried to hold on

509
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,159
to that in a way, but he really just put

510
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,599
it out there right away in a way that I

511
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,039
bet you a lot of people don't even know

512
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:45,279
that he was one of the first people to

513
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,359
really I didn't really know but produce

514
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,200
it. And then not only that, well, I had

515
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,519
a unique relationship with Jason back in

516
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,159
the day that he would send me the odd

517
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,679
time like prototype pieces. Like I

518
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,480
probably got six or seven of them over

519
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,400
the years, kind of clear or sometimes

520
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,720
somewhat worked prototype pieces that

521
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,360
were just

522
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,798
literally ways that he was I guess using

523
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,798
you know the piece was really just an

524
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,879
experiment to come up with whether that

525
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:13,599
seal works or whether it chugs properly

526
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,200
or here I tried this. Yeah, exactly. And

527
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,959
and because he's Jason, if he was

528
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,120
sending it to me, that it means he liked

529
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,880
it enough that it wasn't for sure, you

530
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,158
know, one that was going. A lot of

531
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,679
people don't understand that guys like

532
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,600
Jason, guys like Sling, Marcel,

533
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,360
uh, and then there's, you know, a host

534
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:35,038
of other glassers going back way before

535
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:37,439
them. Uh, you know, guys like Dan K,

536
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,798
Snodgrass, Hugh, all those guys. I had a

537
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,798
Huegh. That was my first piece. Yeah.

538
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:44,000
Like no one understands that all these

539
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,359
techniques, the shapings, the the seals,

540
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,038
everything evolved from everything those

541
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,599
guys were was crushing or were crushing

542
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,759
out back then. Absolutely. And uh that's

543
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,399
how it goes. Things didn't start at

544
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,240
Mothership. These guys, you know, had to

545
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,240
evolve to this point. The glass had to

546
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,240
evolve to this point. They bounce ideas

547
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,480
off of each other and see how things

548
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,120
went. And sure, everybody evolved into

549
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,640
their own things and kind of took ideas

550
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,239
from people and went their ways and

551
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,640
was killed it on their own levels. I'm

552
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,400
happy the hedges are coming back. Mhm.

553
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,320
Now, they never really went away, but

554
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,759
the appreciation

555
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:22,599
got lopsided, I think, for sure. It sure

556
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,278
is beautiful to see a a row of

557
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:27,839
them. Just nice, beautiful pieces.

558
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:30,000
Absolutely. Couple clear protos in

559
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:34,158
there, but they got the function to

560
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,159
them. Yeah. Right. They're respectable.

561
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,400
Well, do what say ye, dosa?

562
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:53,079
I'm passing that banger there, Jack.

563
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:53,079
Yeah, man. Try a little dab of harashio.

564
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,720
What am I going to dab? Mhm. I don't

565
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,080
know. Oh, yeah. I think I'm going to

566
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:06,480
take that. What are you going to dab on?

567
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:07,918
Let's go for three of those, I guess.

568
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,159
Three of those. Well, I'll start the

569
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,880
party.

570
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,880
I'll start the

571
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:20,640
party. This Dose is such a beautiful

572
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,880
piece. I kind of fell in love with it

573
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,480
the first time you showed it to me in

574
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,840
Whistler at the uh actually if you guys

575
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,319
want to check out the first time I seen

576
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,678
this piece. It's uh it's the Whistler

577
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:34,839
video with uh with Aaron from DNA and

578
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:38,400
Matt the Great Gardener and

579
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,399
uh Flav

580
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,720
421. You're there. Who else was there?

581
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,480
That guy might Yeah, Devin might have

582
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,079
been there too. It's hard to remember

583
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,599
but it's worth checking out the video.

584
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,158
We have a good session and there's as

585
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,319
well a beautiful lineup of headies. Just

586
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,360
the ridiculous pipes that Flav had alone

587
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:01,599
were like he he brought a lineup. We had

588
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:03,359
a few doses out that Yep. 100%.

589
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,798
Let that go for a little bit longer.

590
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,278
Yeah. It's always nice to get that low

591
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:09,119
time.

592
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,759
And so a lot of people, you know, this

593
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,439
is a personal thing, but it's pretty

594
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:16,400
easy to figure out on your own level

595
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,519
what's too hot as opposed to what's too

596
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,600
too low. if that's possible for you. And

597
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,720
uh I noticed it a lot with the CBD

598
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,719
Renee. I was dabbing CBD Renee dry sift

599
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,278
through quartz and I was just finding

600
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,839
that at certain temperatures it was so

601
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,839
candied out and if you went too hot it

602
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,918
just all that candy flavor was gone.

603
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,720
I've only had CBD oil, but I noticed

604
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,240
that as well. higher temperatures, super

605
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,679
cherry-l like flavors, lower

606
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,038
temperatures, super floral

607
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:49,259
notes, and uh just

608
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:52,298
that contrast in flavor was

609
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,298
[Music]

610
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:00,240
incredible. God, that just completes the

611
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,960
piece. That was super low temp and it

612
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,720
was

613
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,720
nice. I know people can't see the baby

614
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,440
dabs of this LH show that we're doing,

615
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,400
but they are absolutely tiny and they

616
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,360
hit like freight trains. I can't It

617
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,038
does. I can't even explain it. Like, it

618
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,319
totally does. Bman gave me a dab a bit

619
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,079
earlier on and I was like, "Okay, well,

620
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,119
I'll take this little dab here." It was

621
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,439
a little bit smaller than I would

622
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,239
normally dab and it just crushed me and

623
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,640
I was like, "Wow." Like, big ups to

624
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,159
Horatio. Stuff is amazing. Yeah. Doing

625
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,440
the good work. Decarved already. We were

626
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,200
saying the highlight. There's something

627
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,798
about that. It definitely feels

628
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,919
medicine-in-y in the way that it goes in

629
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:39,599
and just feels like a very strong

630
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,159
edible. It Yeah, it feels like right

631
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,079
away it melts your muscles. Any type of

632
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,039
any sort of like discomfort that you

633
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:50,519
have just gets taken away right away.

634
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:53,919
That is extremely that is the difference

635
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:57,119
between making hash in your you know in

636
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:00,240
your basement as opposed to you know now

637
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,839
going into the lab and producing

638
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,960
literally a neutrautical to

639
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:08,480
pharmaceutical level medicine. It even

640
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,079
smells very very herbal in the scent to

641
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,720
it. Yeah, it really does. It is pretty

642
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:18,000
strong. What do you need? Yeah. Thank

643
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,000
you. Caparoo.

644
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:25,158
Kaparooi. Ah, this is

645
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,759
L. So many nice pieces. What to hit

646
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,600
next? And then go meet up with Vlad. And

647
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,960
I'm sure he's going to be like

648
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:35,678
more heavy to the heavy. The table could

649
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,960
be so ridiculously heavy, which it kind

650
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:42,080
of already is.

651
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,840
I'm I mean, I puff out of prototypes or

652
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,918
pro production pieces, uh, you know,

653
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,918
clear glass most of the time.

654
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,440
I love the Elites. I think they're

655
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,159
awesome and amazing. And for whatever

656
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,320
reason, I just haven't focused my

657
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,039
attention in the collecting of them. I,

658
00:28:54,319 --> 00:29:00,158
you know, Flav and Higherend Row, they

659
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:03,519
have such beautiful pieces that it

660
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,480
almost feels like enough to just be

661
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,558
exposed to them, you know? I think if I

662
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,640
Those collections just inspire people. I

663
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,720
mean, clothes collections inspired me

664
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,440
for sure. different inspired. I love

665
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,720
them. West over here like Yeah. No, I

666
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,798
love the collection, but for whatever

667
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,319
reason, what made me get a Marcel is

668
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,599
definitely Flav's collection for sure.

669
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:23,439
Oh, yeah. Flav's got some beautiful

670
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,918
Marcel's. Collecting glasses been

671
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,798
something that I've loved for uh a few

672
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,480
years now. It's good fun. It's amazing.

673
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,960
You know what I mean? It's brought me to

674
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,278
uh to meet some incredible people, to

675
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,038
have some uh pretty incredible memories.

676
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,359
Maybe we'll pull out my headies. I've

677
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:41,278
got like the 99 Marcels. Oh, please.

678
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:42,719
Let's do it. I would love to see I would

679
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:44,079
love to see those are in my office. But

680
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,278
those are the true hedies. We go into

681
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,678
the city. It's true. They are

682
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:49,919
ridiculous, dude. That's where started

683
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,840
for people that don't really know glass.

684
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,360
It was my first head. It was I mean I

685
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,519
had a Hugh Grass and it was nice and

686
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,678
there I'd seen Snodgrass pieces and I'd

687
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,839
seen all those style of pieces but it

688
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,759
was like and maybe they were even

689
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,158
considered heady and I even met Jason

690
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:06,319
Lee in 1998 when I picked up Marble

691
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,720
Slinger Hitchhiking and Jason Lee was

692
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,480
the guy that was with him and he showed

693
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,000
me what he called a 420 piece and I was

694
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,880
like what do you mean 420? was like,

695
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,960
"It's $420 bucks." And I was like, "

696
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,278
$420 for a pipe back then?" That must

697
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,120
have been so like mindblowing, right?

698
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,599
And it was like this crazy beautiful

699
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:28,798
piece that he had like blown this clear

700
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:31,519
orb of glass around the bowl. The whole

701
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,359
top of the bowl was just clear glass.

702
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:34,960
And he had put a little hole in it and

703
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,079
filled it with water. Like filled it

704
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,360
right up. I was like, "How did you do

705
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:38,798
that?" He's like, "Oh, it took a long

706
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:40,398
time." It's like eventually you get all

707
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,398
the air out. It's all full of water and

708
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,359
the one little drop of air plugs the

709
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:48,239
hole so it doesn't leak. Crazy. It's

710
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,959
crazy. And anytime you put a nug in the

711
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,519
bowl, it magnifies the bud like a

712
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,600
picture all the way around the pipe. So

713
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,200
I was just like, "Oh my god, dude. That

714
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,359
is [ __ ] maybe the greatest thing I

715
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,038
ever seen." In fact, if we do end up at

716
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,519
my office later looking at some of my

717
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,599
headies, I have a chillum and it says

718
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,759
bubble man and it's made by Jason Lee

719
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,079
and the whole top of it is a clear glass

720
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,919
piece that you fill with water. So mag

721
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,439
the reason he did that for me was cuz

722
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,799
when I met him he had that piece and I

723
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,798
was just like what? But then in 99 when

724
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,759
Marcel came out with the stacked

725
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:23,359
sculpture piece, I don't pretend to say

726
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,200
that he was the first person to ever do

727
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:28,678
that, but it was definitely the first

728
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,480
time me or any of the people I knew

729
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:34,080
around everywhere I took it had had ever

730
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,319
seen. And I'd pull that thing out of a

731
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:38,398
box and people would just be like, "Are

732
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,759
you kidding me?" I can imagine. They'd

733
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,398
be like, "How much was that? How much

734
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:47,519
was that piece?" be like, "Oh, like 4G's

735
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:50,558
$4,000 pipe in 1999." It was really

736
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,319
insanity. Insanity, dude. Yeah. And I

737
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,480
dropped that. I was like, "Dude, I'm

738
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,038
like I remember meeting Marcel." I was

739
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,640
like, "How?" Like I'm like, "How can you

740
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,960
expect someone to pay that? That's just

741
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,679
so ridiculous." An hour and a half

742
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,440
later, I was I was offering him to break

743
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,440
it in cuz I I I bought it.

744
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,839
That's how it is. That's how it is with

745
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,399
that. Like you see it and you're like,

746
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:16,158
"Oh, that's awesome." But that I don't

747
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:17,439
know if I can afford it, but you can't

748
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,120
sleep and then all of a sudden, yeah,

749
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,200
you can't sleep on it and it just keeps

750
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:26,479
you up at night. Makes your palms sweat,

751
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,679
affects how you eat the collectors, to

752
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,519
me anyways. Like, wow, that's heavy

753
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,960
duty. It's a real thing and we're

754
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,640
talking about it here on Bubble Man's

755
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,038
World. You know, the glass addiction.

756
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,559
Yeah. just that that collecting is an

757
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:42,720
addiction. Collecting is an addiction

758
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:45,278
and I and people like literally to the

759
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,319
point where it could could bankrupt you

760
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:50,720
the way like uh you know going to the

761
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:53,200
casino. Absolutely. Because I've seen it

762
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,960
on a certain level. Absolutely. you

763
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,640
know, within within range. The

764
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,079
particularly what I like about

765
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,679
collecting is it teaches you

766
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,519
responsibility.

767
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,798
And at the same time, when I when I try

768
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,240
to have the discussion with people that

769
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:05,278
are outside of the community or the

770
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,038
scene and they're just like, "Well,

771
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,319
that's just ridiculous." And I'm, you

772
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,599
know, like, "You could buy a car with

773
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:15,038
that." And I'm like, "Well, yeah, or you

774
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:17,359
could buy that piece and sell it in two

775
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:20,480
years and make profit. That could buy

776
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,558
you two cars." It's very true. So, but

777
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,480
it's it's like playing the stock market.

778
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,359
It is. Sometimes you get lucky and

779
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,960
sometimes you don't. Uh, but the thing

780
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,439
about collecting the piece, the thing

781
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,278
about collecting that I want to say is

782
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,278
don't buy a piece for its resell value.

783
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,480
Sure. Buy the piece because you love the

784
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:42,240
piece. Collect it for you. Y, that's why

785
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,519
I've collected what I have. That's

786
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,640
generally why you would want to collect.

787
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,919
I mean, there's always people that are

788
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,120
going to buy it. How long have you had

789
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,519
your AK for? I've had my AK since 2009,

790
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:53,199
2010. Um, people don't know about AK

791
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,278
until like what, maybe two years ago.

792
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,960
Like a lot of the people, it's tough to

793
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,440
say. It's tough to say when, you know,

794
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,519
the hype started, but you know, I've had

795
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,720
my mother ship the So, this has gone up

796
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:09,159
in price like 18,000%. A ridiculous

797
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,159
amount compared to what I paid for it.

798
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:15,918
That's awesome. Um, but you know, like

799
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:17,918
you buy for love, you don't buy for you

800
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,799
don't buy for resale value. And then,

801
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,638
you know, well, you don't usually

802
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,399
someone does. A lot of people do. And I

803
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,559
I made a post about this on my Instagram

804
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,078
lately, and it wasn't, you know, a bunch

805
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,799
of collectors received it very well. And

806
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,399
a bunch of people who flipped didn't who

807
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,519
flipped glass, you know, didn't receive

808
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:34,878
it very well because they thought they

809
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:36,800
were getting called out. And, you know,

810
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,799
I'm not trying to hurt any feelings. I

811
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,200
just there's a lot of art that gets

812
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,119
flipped and that's part of the reason

813
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,039
why glass is so expensive these days.

814
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,200
Yeah, that's the art world though in

815
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:53,119
general. People always anything that can

816
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,638
can fetch a price in those ranges is

817
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,399
going to have a group of people that

818
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,838
hone in on it. Especially because what

819
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:02,239
they're feeding on is feeding off of is

820
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:04,799
that energy of you like wanting that

821
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:07,118
peace and you know what I mean? want to

822
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,119
grab like people desiring these pieces

823
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,079
so much that of course someone's going

824
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,760
to try to step in

825
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,039
and profit off of it. And then with

826
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,599
regards to what you just said about

827
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,920
people desiring the glass like glass thy

828
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,079
has gone up in the last which is just

829
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,320
terrible. It's the most gut-wrenching

830
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,560
thing. I mean I I have way more like

831
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,480
that that's something that really to me

832
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,078
I would call out. You know what a lot of

833
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,800
pieces have come back through the help

834
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,560
of the community though a lot. What did

835
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,160
you even What do you do with it? A piece

836
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:37,519
like that once you've, you know, like

837
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:38,639
you've stolen a piece. Great. What are

838
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,719
you going to do with it? I heard about a

839
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,879
mother ship getting stolen and the

840
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:46,639
person who stole it was rolling into a

841
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,640
into a lounge and dabbing out of it for

842
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:50,159
the same day they stole it. That's

843
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,639
crazy.

844
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:55,199
Yeah, that's insane. Like mothership

845
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:57,039
groups on Facebook, they it got shared

846
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,118
super quick. Somebody noticed it was

847
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:03,838
gone and it's wicked. It got brought

848
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,838
back. This thing's pretty sick, eh?

849
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,119
Super mini cup.

850
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:14,358
I just know for me certain things get

851
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,440
into my collection and they don't

852
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:18,799
leave. And that's what collecting is.

853
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,480
You know what I mean? It's not holding

854
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,640
on to something for 5 months and then

855
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,280
being like, oh, in order to afford

856
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,960
something else, I need to sell this. You

857
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,640
know, that's one way to do it. I'm not

858
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,199
I've done that. I'm not Yeah. Like I'm

859
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:33,199
not I'm not smiting anyone. I'm just

860
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:36,078
saying like that's there's collecting

861
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:37,919
and that's the base that I come from and

862
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:44,039
I must come from that base too cuz I

863
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:47,920
have glass from 9798 99 and we're now in

864
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:49,759
2015. So yeah 17 18 year. That's

865
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,079
incredible. Even that orb I showed you

866
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,079
earlier was from ' 06. Oh this thing

867
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,079
mind

868
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,960
thing is pretty crazy. So I yeah I've

869
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:01,358
been offered so much money over the

870
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,119
years for that Marcel number one and

871
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,440
I've always just been like oh you know

872
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,119
like Marcel actually always made sure

873
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,358
that I don't know if he feels this way

874
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,119
anymore but back in the day he

875
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:12,880
definitely said if you ever consider

876
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,800
selling it I would appreciate it if you

877
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,480
contacted me before

878
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,760
uh you know anyone else. I think for

879
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,159
certain pieces that's especially like

880
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,200
meaningful pieces I think that's cool.

881
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:29,440
Mhm. I've made some trades and some some

882
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:30,879
sales with close friends and that's been

883
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,920
one of the conditions. It's like listen,

884
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,480
if this ever gets sold, I'm the person

885
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,920
that you talk to about selling it. Uh it

886
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,320
has to come back to me if it goes

887
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,320
anywhere. And I think that's especially

888
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,760
between friends, between uh people that

889
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,000
have respect each other. I think that's

890
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,160
definitely something that's uh good to

891
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,039
do. Well, Marcel's the blower of the

892
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:53,679
piece. It was a historic piece and his

893
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,119
steps of blowing glass. Absolutely.

894
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,440
Makes total sense that if you were going

895
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,280
to,

896
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,639
you know, you know, want to move it that

897
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,800
you would just approach him and goes

898
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,078
back into his vault if anything. Yeah.

899
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,039
And just be like, work out the, you

900
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:10,079
know, hey, I would like to um I would

901
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,159
like to have a piece of or pieces of

902
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,640
this stature. Cuz I'll tell you, that

903
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:17,279
piece was expensive back then, but now

904
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,039
it's priceless. But now it's Yeah.

905
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,560
Like if there was a Heavy Glass Museum,

906
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:25,279
that would be a cornerstone piece, dude.

907
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:28,320
You know, Yep.

908
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,119
I do know. Absolutely. And I smoked it

909
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,920
with so many people. That's another

910
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:37,480
piece of history. Incredible. The big

911
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,320
shot. The big shot. Big shot coming

912
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,320
up. Sloth is real nice. Yeah. Yeah.

913
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,320
Yeah.

914
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,920
I can't remember

915
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:57,440
this. It doesn't

916
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,440
matter. No, it has to be in

917
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:03,399
order. All right. Well, someone's got to

918
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:07,440
hit the XL. Double

919
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,440
XL. Yeah. Get the Duchy

920
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,000
roll. That thing is ridiculously huge.

921
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,359
We don't even have anything to carve

922
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,159
this thing. It's uncarvable, man. Oh,

923
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:22,880
wait a minute. Oh, that kind of guy.

924
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,078
Fits. Maybe that'll fit. That's a big

925
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,320
one. It's a little bit better than that.

926
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,599
That's for the silicone carbide. So,

927
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,119
even though it doesn't look that big,

928
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,599
it's pretty big. It's massive. Yeah,

929
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,440
it's massive.

930
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,838
It's massive. I'm not going to be taking

931
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,358
a monster massive rip right off the bat,

932
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,799
but I am going to hit this giant double

933
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:42,719
XL bowl just to see how she hits. I

934
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,800
won't be putting two grams of anything

935
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,799
in it.

936
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,039
Just yet.

937
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,039
Just yet.

938
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:54,879
There is still daylight. So, a little

939
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,480
bit early for that. There is still day

940
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,599
daylight. Yeah. I hope we really do make

941
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,760
it into the city and bump into Flav

942
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,440
because it would

943
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,200
sure just step it up. You know, this is

944
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,880
a good fun chunk of video looking at all

945
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,319
this glass, all this glass, talking

946
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,160
about the different

947
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,039
uh aspects of their functions and the

948
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:16,399
glass blowers and the

949
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,920
community even from the collecting

950
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,519
standpoint because obviously these two

951
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,800
guys are collectors and in a sense I've

952
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:23,759
never really thought of myself as a

953
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,760
collector but as winds here was talking

954
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,200
I thought geez I am a collector. Yeah,

955
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,359
you got a pretty good collection

956
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:32,239
stashed. It all started kind of uniquely

957
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:34,480
for me. They were my friends. Mhm. I met

958
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:38,399
them and they were kind of young upand

959
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,159
cominging glass blowers and I just loved

960
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,559
what they were doing. I felt like it was

961
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,639
like a form of

962
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:47,279
activism that they chose to, you know,

963
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,279
because they could have done any aspect

964
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,760
of glass blowing, but they chose to do

965
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,880
the form of glass blowing that produced

966
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,760
pipes for smoking,

967
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,079
hash and consequence, cannabis. The

968
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,560
stories of how you met them was or are

969
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,240
rather incredible. You know what I mean?

970
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:06,318
Right.

971
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,239
Good old fish tours and stuff. It's over

972
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,880
the top. Pulling Yui just because some

973
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:13,598
guy looks like he needs a ride. Yeah. On

974
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,720
the wrong side of the street, bro.

975
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,800
Pulling a Yui.

976
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,879
Hey, I think I want to pick that guy up.

977
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,599
Whatever.

978
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,318
Turns out it's Jay Lee. Holy [ __ ] Yeah,

979
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,318
it was Slinger, but then he was with Jay

980
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:30,199
Lee.

981
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:35,000
male version of this.

982
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:35,000
Uh, we can only hope.

983
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:41,559
Yeah. 20 mil coil might Jesus Christ. Is

984
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,199
it

985
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:46,880
raging? There. Is it raging? Uh, yeah.

986
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,559
Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty hot. Can I have

987
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,838
a hobo fire? Like if I put this in there

988
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,719
right now, I think it would burst into

989
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,639
flames. My buddy did that with the dabs

990
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:57,598
ball toss. He got it on the first try.

991
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,199
Have a hobo. whole thing went like one

992
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,079
of

993
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:03,159
these. I'm totally not doing it. Not

994
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,720
going to do

995
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:09,279
it. All right. Where are we going

996
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:11,519
here? Little dry sip from D420K through

997
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,160
the Dutch pump.

998
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:14,159
Shout out to

999
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,879
[Music]

1000
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,639
Aaron. Oh, that was really nice.

1001
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:34,000
Super smooth kind of hit that thing,

1002
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:37,719
huh? Tell you that hit like a like a

1003
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,719
freight train, too.

1004
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,760
size dab and uh he doesn't even look

1005
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
like it touched a quarter of that

1006
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,760
bucket. Yeah, not even close. I still do

1007
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,838
feel the need to want to like scrape

1008
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,280
away the leftovers.

1009
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,199
This thing's still raging, by the way.

1010
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,000
You can probably take like eight low

1011
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:01,199
temp temp. That's probably one thing

1012
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,639
where this thing will come in really or

1013
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:04,318
Yeah, you just light it up once and then

1014
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,159
just pass it around. It's like, no, no,

1015
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,960
dude. It'll be good for everyone's in a

1016
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:10,358
corner. It's good for like an hour, bro.

1017
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,800
It's good for an

1018
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:15,039
hour. I'll blow that out and clean it

1019
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,039
out

1020
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,079
later. That was super nice. What was

1021
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,078
this guy over

1022
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:26,079
here? Like a

1023
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:28,359
spaceship. Park these beasts with

1024
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,960
precision and

1025
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:35,199
accuracy. We won't be flipping ships

1026
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:37,318
here today. No, it's the ship flip free

1027
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:41,919
zone.

1028
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:43,279
Flip flip free. I like it. Pretty

1029
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,760
stoned. I had to think about that for a

1030
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,760
second. Kind

1031
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:54,239
of feel like I'm good talking. Then LH

1032
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,200
just kind of taps you on the shoulder.

1033
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,679
It's like, "No, you're going to trip

1034
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,679
over the next three words." Yeah.

1035
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:05,480
Right. Decarbed medicine. Yeah.

1036
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:12,318
What hasn't gotten? It says for oral use

1037
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,838
only syringe here.

1038
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:15,920
I don't know about that. Did a Swiss

1039
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:18,000
perk get ripped? I don't think the Swiss

1040
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,240
perk's been ripped. No, I don't in front

1041
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,400
of me, but I might switch it up. Could

1042
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:25,759
hit the Swiss perk. Dizzle

1043
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,480
up. Um, what have I hit? I've hit the

1044
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,599
Dutch pump. I've hit the Equinox and

1045
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:35,039
ship. I've hit the zop. I hit the dosa.

1046
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:38,000
I hit the stack low.

1047
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:40,279
Huh. I've been doing pretty good. Hit it

1048
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,159
pretty far down the line. Not too bad at

1049
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,160
all. Might have to hit the

1050
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:51,598
monkey. The slop cut banger fits on

1051
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:54,239
that. Hey, what's up, buddy? That's

1052
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:58,318
pretty wicked, actually.

1053
00:44:54,239 --> 00:45:00,239
Like, it's bizarre yet awesome. And it's

1054
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:03,039
got some good function to it. Oh, I can

1055
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,598
tell right off the bat just by the size

1056
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:05,599
of it and

1057
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:14,160
stuff. Pretty tight,

1058
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:16,880
too. I often find these little rigs to

1059
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,960
be the ones that will often give you

1060
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,760
that look kind of like I almost fell off

1061
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,650
my chair. So, which one are we doing on

1062
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,780
this guy?

1072
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,119
Yeah. Wow. This is a new thing. He's

1073
00:45:55,039 --> 00:46:01,119

1075
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,640
A couple nice little opals in it. What

Yeah. He comes through and sits by my

1084
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:28,159
bed for a while and he was back in his

1085
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:31,838
case. I see.

1086
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,838
Excellent. I'm I'm excited to hit

1087
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:38,559
it cuz I have a little

1088
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:42,279
Yeah. Just got that low temp. Nothing

1089
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,279
like that Swiss function.

1090
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:50,960

1096
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:20,280
now. Trying to pull on. Oh, it did drop.

1097
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:24,280
I thought I felt it on my hand.

1098
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,280
Uhhuh. Fixed.

1099

cool. Yeah, the marbles are dope.

1105

[ __ ] thing.

1107
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:04,079
It is crazy. So funny to put it in small

1108
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:08,400
rings, too. Yeah. Stick your thumb right

1109
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,240

Awesome.

uh that will go three, four dabs before

1115
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,639
it's cooled down. If you want to dab

1116
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,960
your whole stash at once, that's the way

1117
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:27,960
to do it.

1118
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:36,630

00:48:57,159 --> 00:49:02,558
ferocity. Cool monkey. Have you seen my

1125
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:07,279
mink? Anyone else want to hit the

1126
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,200
monkey? Yeah. Pass up this way. I'll

1127
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,519
take Yeah. Come on. Give me another dab

1128
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:13,279
before you do.

1129
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:17,838
Give me another dab before you do,

1130
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:19,599
please. Of what? LHO. No. Rosin. Rossin

1131
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:21,318
them up.

1132
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:25,680
Can't stop dabbing

1133
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:28,400
that. I shouldn't purpos.

1134
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,719
Why should you stop? Damn it. Feel like

1135
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,200
when I first started dabbing oil way

1136
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:35,399
back, it's like that same kind of like I

1137
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:38,719
just want that taste in my

1138
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:41,200
mouth constantly.

1139
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:44,199
So much cleaner. Never thought I'd say

1140
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,199
that.

1141
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:50,480
Well, you know what? We're probably just

1142
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:54,400
going to continue on doing this for

1143
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,719
quite some time. So, we'll wrap it up

1144
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,358
with the last rip here that Winds is

1145
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:02,558
about to take. And uh hopefully we pick

1146
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:04,960
right back up with a simple transition

1147
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,680
into hanging out with Flav downtown

1148
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,960
Vancouver. It's going to be fun. Yeah,

1149
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:10,639
absolutely. And you know what? This has

1150
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,679
just got me all inspired to go like

1151
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:16,400
order some Goldies pizza or something.

1152
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:17,679
Goldies before? I've never had Goldies.

1153
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,280
So, before we go, I just want to say a

1154
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:22,318
few things about Golden Bear Hades has

1155
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,400
never had Goldies. Yes, please do. Um,

1156
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:25,679
so Aaron is a new up andcoming Well,

1157
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,119
he's not new. He's been on the tour

1158
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,799
since 2012, but he's uh this is kind of

1159
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,519
like his breakout year. He's really

1160
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:37,280
hitting it hard. Uh, he's a good friend

1161
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:38,119
of mine, local to Colona.

1162
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,480
And

1163
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:43,760
uh yeah, these Dutch pumps are the

1164
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:46,760
[ __ ] Now you get on the boat. 40

1165
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,359
seconds now. Yeah, about 40

1166
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,319
seconds. So Puff Canada just had two of

1167
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:55,358
these and sold

1168
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:59,039
them instantly basically. Uh I'll have a

1169
00:50:55,358 --> 00:51:01,519
few for sale and then uh Hetty Shops

1170
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:05,279
around North America. hit Aaron Colbert

1171
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:08,480
up uh or me up and uh we'll take care of

1172
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,280
you. So that's Aaron Colbert, Dutch

1173
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,760
disc, Dutch

1174
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:16,079
punk. It's cool. It's definitely cool.

1175
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:20,160
They're all [ __ ] cool. Swiss Perk

1176
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:23,240
into Fab Egg into Marcel Old School into

1177
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:28,399
Taurus into Ball

1178
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:28,399
Rigg AK Zlop Dosa

1179
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,880
Stacklo and that little guy the Snick

1180
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,838
and of course the Straight

1181
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:39,280
Fab. So many different cool

1182
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:40,639
functions. Instagram's really cool that

1183
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,280
you can get in touch with so many of

1184
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,799
these different artists directly. It's

1185
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,119
one of the great things about it. I

1186
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,280
think I I know most artists aren't able

1187
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,720
to deal with all of that aspect of the

1188
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,000
business and they just pass it on to

1189
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:54,480
different people and businesses that

1190
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,838
they do business with. Y, but it's neat

1191
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,079
for the collector to be able to have

1192
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:01,440
that chance to get in touch with the

1193
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:04,559
artist and acquire glass direct. It

1194
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,000
surely is very cool. All right, guys.

1195
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,519
We're going to see you soon. Thanks for

1196
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,400
watching Bubble Man's World.

1197
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:14,800
Yeah,

1198
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,440
I put all the tall pipes and he's just

1199
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,920
gone. Yeah, he's washed out. It's just

1200
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,079
like my Marcel's wearing a hat. Hey,

1201
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,480
what's up? How's it going guys? Hey man,

1202
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:27,680
you guys want to hit some dabs? He's

1203
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,318
just that uh off camera voice. It's the

1204
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:33,199
off camera voice for sure.

1205
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:35,838
Hey guys, welcome back. Uh we of course

1206
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:37,598
are not downtown Vancouver, but we did

1207
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,838
go outside and get some pretty sick

1208
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,800
pictures of the glass lined up outside

1209
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:44,880
on the top of the banister. Probably

1210
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,559
enough to give, you know, a normal

1211
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,680
person a heart attack probably. Yeah,

1212
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,559
they were hanging out there a little

1213
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:52,239
bit. Stacking G's on the uh and we even

1214
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,240
went off and ate while they just sat

1215
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,159
over there. We did. We did indeed. We

1216
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,838
had a little uh barbecue action there.

1217
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:59,118
So, we are well famished and we thought,

1218
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:00,558
you know what? Rather than leave you

1219
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,920
hanging and just end the video, we

1220
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,359
thought, let's go back and have another

1221
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,760
mad session and hit a bunch of that

1222
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:09,039
rosin and that dry sift and that LHO.

1223
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:12,240
So, what do you say, gentlemen? Let's do

1224
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:15,358
it. Shall we do this? Let's do it. I

1225
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:17,358
say, oh boy.

1226
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:21,119
And let's start with this little guy. He

1227
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:24,519
was quite fun. Put this on there.

1228
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,519
Yep. Perfect.

1229
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:29,039
See the difference? Put it on upside

1230
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:32,078
down. Pretty funny how this has been

1231
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,759
sitting out here and Yep. It's nice

1232
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:36,400
kindness that gloss over to it. Let's

1233
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,680
smoke that. Head it up. No, I mean all

1234
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:43,000
of it in the double XXL. All right. I'm

1235
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:46,799
just joking. Just drop as much

1236
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,358
as Oh, that cuts out nice. It really

1237
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,800
does, dude. Miss melled straight. Whoa.

1238
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:55,119
Look at that. E. Holy

1239
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:58,240
mol. That's insane, dude. It's so tacky.

1240
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,240
Like, that's insane.

1241
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:03,118
We did vary temperatures a little bit.

1242
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:07,000
So, one side is slightly tackier and one

1243
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:10,480
side is slightly more like shatter

1244
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,280
almost, but it's all tasty as hell. You

1245
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,960
definitely have to rip it. Yeah, mine my

1246
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:20,640
reach. Mind my reach, man. But I really

1247
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,800
need this effing dab.

1248
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,719
Come on now. Throw me that tool in your

1249
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,318
hand. Tripping. Someone really had that.

1250
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:28,598
Look at you guys going for the uh right

1251
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:34,079
as I'm about to light the torch

1252
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:34,079
up. Good old hand. The three uh

1253
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:38,639
stooges. Luckily, we're not the three

1254
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:40,558
stooges. I haven't hit this guy yet,

1255
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,639
too. Oh, well, you better hit that. Have

1256
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,640
I hit that yet?

1257
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:46,960
Hit once. Oh, well, that's not enough.

1258
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:48,318
No, no, no. I'm about to hit I mean, I'm

1259
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,318
mostly hitting the pieces I don't have

1260
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,920
access to, and I definitely want to hit

1261
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:54,920
that Marcel, but I'm going to hit all of

1262
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:58,159
these again real quick here.

1263
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:01,358
Shoop torch. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, nice.

1264
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:01,358
You're going

1265
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:06,039
car for you guys.

1266
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,880
Oh, this

1267
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:15,759
guy. Love this little

1268
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:22,480
guy. Look at the size of the dab he's

1269
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,160
taking.

1270
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,358
I'm taking like a little tiny baby. Just

1271
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:28,358
really wanted to rip this. Mhm.

1272
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:56,240
[Music]

1273
00:55:53,318 --> 00:55:58,960
Booyah. Teamwork makes the dream work.

1274
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:01,759
That was really nice. It was very small,

1275
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,760
but it was very

1276
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:08,640
nice.

1277
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:08,639
Snake

1278
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:16,760
respect. All right, Stacklo, come here.

1279
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:18,960
Come here

1280
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:22,559
you. Uh, what are we going to drop in

1281
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,559
the stack? Let's do a tiny little bit of

1282
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,250
LH. Just enough

1283
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:29,960
to get the dabber

1284
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:33,440
[Music]

1285
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:35,599
sticky. Do a little bit of a dipping. I

1286
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,639
love that sift.

1287
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:39,640
A small dip

1288
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:45,358
in. That'll

1289
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:45,358
do. All right. Torch. Beautiful. Thank

1290
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:57,079
you. Stack those are really nice. You

1291
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:59,559
did well with uh with getting this

1292
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:01,680
guy. You're like, "Yeah, give me a

1293
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:02,680
dozen." You order 10 of them. Oh, yeah.

1294
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:05,118
I got

1295
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:07,199
10. Bet you wished you got a dozen, huh?

1296
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,599
Oh, I wish I got like 30 of them. I had

1297
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,519
people lined up for them.

1298
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,359
I kept them all local, though, which was

1299
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:15,920
nice. Yeah. And yeah, I pretty much

1300
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:19,039
tried keeping them all. Uh, most of them

1301
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:21,280
are all in Vancouver. Um, a couple of

1302
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,599
them went out to the east coast. They're

1303
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,519
great. I wish I Canada. I missed the

1304
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,720
boat on it, but I would have grabbed

1305
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:27,679
one. I remember when I first saw it, I

1306
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:31,279
was like, "Dude, I grabbed one of

1307
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:33,279
those." Dude, shaping, function, size,

1308
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,280
color, everything is really nice about

1309
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,280
them.

1310
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,960
You want to throw me the

1311
00:57:54,599 --> 00:58:01,798
Marcel and a banger. We don't flip

1312
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,798
ships, but we definitely flip Marcel's.

1313
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:08,480
You flip it to me and I'll flip it to

1314
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:10,558
him. Uh, no.

1315
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,000
Such a nice piece. Hey. Oh, gorgeous.

1316
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,519
That's a solid piece of glass right

1317
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
there. It's a nice tabletop piece. Look

1318
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:19,679
at the ribbons of

1319
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:22,639
Dro made the base. That's just insane.

1320
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:23,480
Readies are off the wall.

1321
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:27,598
So

1322
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:31,119
wicked. And this air trapping is

1323
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:32,640
to magnify all the ready. Yeah. And this

1324
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,798
is part of the ridiculousness, of

1325
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,879
course. Yeah, that slide is awesome.

1326
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:42,159
It's pretty epic. It's huge.

1327
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:46,480
Totally epic. It's like Rosame.

1328
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:48,318
That was nice. The uh LHO dry sift combo

1329
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:52,318
was maybe the strongest hit I've hit

1330
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:56,159
since we here. I might have to uh do a

1331
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:57,920
rosin LHO dry sift rip. I think that's a

1332
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:59,639
good idea.

1333
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,119
I think that's a really good

1334
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:05,358
idea. Why not? I mean, this is a

1335
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:08,720
session, right? Started out as a 420

1336
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:10,719
session. Well, it is now potentially 7

1337
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:12,798
puff hard Wednesday session. It is a

1338
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,159
puff hard Wednesday session. I guess

1339
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:15,759
that's the reality of it. People have

1340
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:18,960
been asking for a puff Wednesday and in

1341
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:23,040
reality this was a puff Wednesday. Puff

1342
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:27,199
tough. Yep. Indeed. All right. And in

1343
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,199
the torch, brother. Thank you,

1344
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:32,039
sir. I like it.

1345
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,000
So

1346
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:44,879
sweet. He

1347
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:49,838
says this

1348
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:57,318
is the pick. One of Nate Dizzle's last

1349
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:00,480
handspun

1350
00:59:57,318 --> 01:00:02,719
perks. Really? Yeah. He got a lathe

1351
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,599
after Germany.

1352
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:07,919
kind of ship change the game plan for.

1353
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,440
Yeah. So, I guess these guys does do

1354
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,358
Mothership also have some pretty

1355
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,760
incredible high precision tools that are

1356
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:15,358
kind of like that's what I've heard. A

1357
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,280
few people have mentioned that they have

1358
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:20,400
access to these really high precision

1359
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,200
tools which right off the bat shows why

1360
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,440
they would, you know, it's kind of why

1361
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:27,480
ROR stood out back in the day just

1362
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:31,119
because it was

1363
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:33,838
100,000 100,000 euro lathe torch very

1364
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,680
expensive lathe. There's almost like a a

1365
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:38,599
level of precision that is not going to

1366
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:43,759
be exhibited in most tubes that are

1367
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:43,760
blown, but RER definitely is still

1368
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:50,400
here. Yeah. Martin from RER will be

1369
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,760
coming out here in the next few days.

1370
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,318
We're looking forward to having a visit

1371
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:58,480
with him. Been waiting to see him out

1372
01:00:54,318 --> 01:01:01,440
here for oh 15 plus years, maybe almost

1373
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,199
20 years. been friends a long time.

1374
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,440
Always had a relationship with Roar, of

1375
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:07,358
course. It was one of my first I used to

1376
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,679
hit their pieces a lot. I mean, I still

1377
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:11,440
do have my Roar collection. I just uh I

1378
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:14,159
used to hit them a lot before Glass

1379
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,838
turned into what it turned into. And now

1380
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:18,960
there's so many aspects of it I find

1381
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:21,078
that it's uh it's hard to keep up. Thank

1382
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:25,079
god I know a lot of

1383
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:25,079
people. Wow.

1384
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:37,760
That was a crazy figure. I punched to

1385
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:42,119
the face. Right. Triple triple the

1386
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,119
whammy. Right.

1387
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:48,000
That's so sick with the banger on it.

1388
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:50,078
I normally hit it with a bucket. This

1389
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,639
This piece could could also hold the

1390
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:55,359
double XXL banger. Well, I think very

1391
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:56,798
well. It would look more appropriate.

1392
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:59,598
Yeah, this one looks a little kind of

1393
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:01,838
like shrunken head style. It looks a

1394
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:03,440
little Oh, no. That's not even it.

1395
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:04,639
That's awesome. You're like, "Hey." Oh,

1396
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,480
I don't even have to try. That's like

1397
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:09,118
way bigger.

1398
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,318
That one's hot. Probably just torched it

1399
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:13,880
up pretty good from all

1400
01:02:11,318 --> 01:02:16,639
angles and quartz

1401
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:19,079
well, which does tend to hold that heat.

1402
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:21,598
But yeah, that'll be

1403
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:24,960
uh that's exactly how that's going to

1404
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:27,119
look. It's a monster. It is. whole thumb

1405
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,639
in there. Oh, yeah. And you can fit like

1406
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,880
a big person can fit their whole thumb

1407
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:30,879
in

1408
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,880
here. It's pretty

1409
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:40,639
sweet. Don't need that amount of uh

1410
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:42,720
surface area. It kind of is nice. And

1411
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,798
I'm sure that there could be some

1412
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:46,558
There's still so many unknown factors

1413
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:48,559
really. People know what they like and

1414
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,240
they're convinced of what they like

1415
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:52,160
through different discoveries of

1416
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:53,519
temperature and low temp and higher temp

1417
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:56,159
and this that and the other thing, but

1418
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,920
they're all being experiencing them

1419
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:59,920
through different variables. So it's at

1420
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,400
this point it hasn't really been like in

1421
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,798
my opinion properly documented. Not at

1422
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,318
all. to the point where, you know,

1423
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:07,920
wouldn't it be cool to just have a list

1424
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:09,838
like, oh yeah, like for chords, these

1425
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,920
are the temperatures and these are the,

1426
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:13,519
you know, like a a proper explanation

1427
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,240
like, well, I noticed the taste change

1428
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:17,599
from candy to more of a spicy. That's

1429
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:19,358
where the email comes in though, right?

1430
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,920
Oh, absolutely. You can dial it down.

1431
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:24,239
But also the names of the turppins and

1432
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,838
knowing when those turppins, like which

1433
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:27,679
ones are the most volatile, meaning

1434
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:29,838
which ones do you taste first? I saw

1435
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:32,159
someone put up a list on Instagram a

1436
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:34,639
couple weeks ago and I had a list of the

1437
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:36,558
turppines and their temperatures. It's

1438
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:37,838
just like, hey, just so everyone can

1439
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,519
understand. Yeah, there's good

1440
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:40,960
information out there on that. You can

1441
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:43,519
find it for sure. It just doesn't seem

1442
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,280
to be available enough. I would sure

1443
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:46,639
like to see it more. I would agree. Like

1444
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,160
even right now, I'm sure people will go

1445
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:50,798
and search for that picture that you saw

1446
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:52,798
on Instagram and they'll be like the

1447
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:55,119
toast sandwich. No, not the toast

1448
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:58,480
sandwich.

1449
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:58,480
Where is your ha?

1450
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:06,760
Golden's all beared out.

1451
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:10,319
Very good. What did I just hit last? I

1452
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:13,359
hit the stack.

1453
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:15,358
No. Did you hit the the troll jar? This

1454
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:17,119
one? Yeah. Yeah, I did. I thought I hit

1455
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,119
another one right after that though.

1456
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,559
Stack one. Yeah, it was a stack. Stack

1457
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,838
one. Yeah. No, I took the banger out of

1458
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:25,920
the stack. That's right. Nice.

1459
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:28,000
Yes. Put it in the Marcel. The last hit.

1460
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:31,838
really was quite [ __ ] rocked after

1461
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:35,358
that last hit. Wonderful. Yeah,

1462
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:37,519
everyone should try a triple threat. Y

1463
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:41,558
All right, triple threat number one.

1464
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:41,559
This is your triple threat.

1465
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,679
I don't want to put too much of this

1466
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:49,519
stuff on there. You might want to. It's

1467
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:51,519
definitely the one that uh Well, they

1468
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:53,759
all the combination, the synergy of the

1469
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:56,239
three. Like, it's so heavy. That's

1470
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,799
serious uh canabonoid profile stacking

1471
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:00,558
right

1472
01:04:57,798 --> 01:05:03,960
there. We don't flip ships, but we do

1473
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,960
stack profiles.

1474
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,880
It's the truth. How's that for a

1475
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:10,558
t-shirt? Oh, it's delicious. Tastes

1476
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,280
good.

1477
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:14,798
Yep.

1478
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:17,119
Damn. What did I do? Bring my water

1479
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:21,280
outside? Yeah, I think when we were

1480
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:25,640
eating. You want to fill up? Yeah, cuz

1481
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,640
then I'm drinking the rest out of there.

1482
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,920
Nothing like a nice glass of water while

1483
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:37,200
puffing dabs. Sir, man, that first rosin

1484
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:39,838
dab I did just grip me too hard.

1485
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:41,838
That's awesome. This one takes a hold of

1486
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:43,838
you, too. Trust me. All right. When am I

1487
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:46,000
going to hit it? Oh, did you dip it in

1488
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:47,440
dry sift? Yeah. Oh, yeah. He says,

1489
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,440
"Yeah, absolutely." What are you going

1490
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,318
to hit it out of? Well, I mean it's

1491
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:55,679
Marcel sitting right here. Yeah, there

1492
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:58,719
we go. Go very nicely.

1493
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:02,000
I know cuz I'm hitting it as well. My

1494
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:04,239
triple of that as well. So,

1495
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,559
it's always nice to hit nice glass. It's

1496
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:09,838
even nicer to hit a bunch of nice glass

1497
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:12,559
in a row. Yeah. Go back to my one weekly

1498
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:15,199
piece. So, you just visiting out here?

1499
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:17,599
Yep. Nice. Yeah, I'm living in Colona.

1504
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:28,000

1505
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:31,039
that was uh super welcoming. Very cool.

1506
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,960
Yeah. Very cool. Well, I'm in Colona

1507

1508
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,480
Yeah. Let us know. Come to the studio.

1509
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:40,798
Got my friend that owns a a winery just

1510
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,159
in West Bank. Oh, cool. Yeah. Pretty

1511
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:43,440
close to the bridge. Beautiful area.

1512
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:44,879
Yeah. It's good. It's right behind the

1513
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,079
gas station. Actually, on the way down

1514
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,440
to the bridge, there's that little gas

1515
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,920
station off to the right. It's just

1516
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,960
right above there. Oh, cool. It's he

1517
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,639
used to breed cannabis, so he's doing

1518
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:58,480
playing around with grapes. Nice. Yeah,

1519
01:06:54,639 --> 01:07:00,639
it's pretty cool. For sure. K Town has

1520
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,079
ever thought about coming back now just

1521
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:03,920
becoming so much money. You know, he

1522
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,640
just came back out on Instagram. You can

1523
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,079
follow him at breeder

1524
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:09,400
Steve. One word. Why does it sound

1525
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,000
familiar?

1526
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:15,680
Oh, he's well involved. tastes, you

1527
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,920

Yeah. Like he's spice of life.

1529
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:26,760

01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,239
Yeah. And that LH.

1533
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:43,879
Yeah. And that comes through. Kind of

1534
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:43,879
ridiculous, isn't it?

1535
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:47,318
Yeah.

1536
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:51,919
Yeah. I was kind of spaced out for about

1537
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,119
a minute or two after I took that dub.

1538
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,400
All the viewers are going to be like,

1539
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:59,519
"Wow, he's just spaced out." I I am

1540
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,519
spaced out to a degree.

1541
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:05,078
Yeah. That's

1542
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:09,318
awesome. All

1543
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:09,318
right. Dric sift.

1544
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:16,640
We got the whole thing all lined

1545
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:18,318
up, dabbed out. That is I don't know. I

1546
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,279
love what I own, but like that's my

1547
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:24,719
favorite piece maybe in the table. Huh?

1548
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,719
I said I love what I

1549
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,960
own. All

1550
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:32,920
right. Yeah, it's hard not to love a

1551
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,920
Marcel. I mean, come on.

1552
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,719
He's really like not only like pioneered

1553
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,560
a big chunk of the game into this new

1554
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:43,640
millennia of glass blowers, but he's

1555
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,640
also like stayed up.

1556
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:52,039
Yeah, it's hard to

1557
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:54,960
do it. That's what I mean, man. It's

1558
01:08:52,039 --> 01:08:56,798
incredible. Very much.

1559
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,158
So, this is a mix hit. How long did you

1560
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:02,399
wait? Uh, I waited about 354 seconds.

1561
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:04,318
Well, that long, eh? Yeah. All right.

1562
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:08,399
Cool. I felt that it retained good

1563
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:13,159
amount of heat off this big shot blazer.

1564
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:13,158
Perfect torch, especially for a banger.

1565
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,400
All right, here we go. Finishing it off.

1566
