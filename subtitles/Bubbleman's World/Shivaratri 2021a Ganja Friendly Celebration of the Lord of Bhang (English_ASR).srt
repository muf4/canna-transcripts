1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,719
use of cannabis and uh Mark Richardson

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:07,359
and kig love they can also attest to

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,960
this in a moment and so what we've done

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,638
is we've I've I've adapted a very simple

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:19,039
Ritual from the 19th century by this guy

6
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:21,600
Chandra Ananda Khali and he in 1867 came

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,920
up with a a three chilling ritual it's

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,560
dedicated to the three phase Shiva we've

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,519
got a three-face Shiva right here uh um

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,799
smoking a Chillum drinking this holy

11
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:33,479
bong and preparing B right here right

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,039
and uh um he would have been us they

13
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,479
would have been using Chums much like

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:41,238
this antique Chillum from India and uh

15
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,799
um what what what uh Ananda Chandra

16
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:47,320
Khali's view was uh as he wanted to come

17
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:50,078
up with a form of Shiva worship that

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,640
included all the different casts of of

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,359
India so that they weren't separated uh

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,480
uh um through these racial divisions you

21
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,359
know the color of their skin and things

22
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,679
like that and so he came up with the the

23
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,480
three CH the three CHS for the

24
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,239
three-phase Shiva and the three-phase

25
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,840
Shiva in his time was Brahma Vishnu and

26
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,239
Shiva which were the three main deities

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,640
which kind of broke up uh uh the cast

28
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,519
system but the three-phase Shiva he goes

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,239
way back in history that goes way back

30
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,359
to the kusam period when the cians uh uh

31
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,319
were dominating Northern India uh the

32
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,319
three-face Sheba was worshiped as well

33
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:27,239
then so it's a very very old God and

34
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,158
very cannabis connected as well and so

35
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,560
uh um what we're going to do first is

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,799
I'm going to um invite everybody to like

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,118
load a pipe or a Chillum you know the

38
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,240
beauty of the three Chillum ritual is

39
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,719
the Simplicity of the ritual that was

40
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:44,039
the basis of it something that didn't

41
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:46,519
take a lot of preparation something that

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,280
uh everybody could partake of in

43
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:50,000
together and that's that's kind of what

44
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,280
we're going for here it's something very

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,718
simple and basic and we're gonna in have

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,079
a kind of a overview of Shiva in between

47
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,239
the three children we've got different

48
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,118
speakers coming up throughout the next

49
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,280
couple of hours and uh we're g to then

50
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,800
we're going to do a simple uh um um bong

51
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,598
pouring on the Lingham ritual as well at

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,120
partway and so let's start it all off by

53
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,799
uh loading up a Chillum or a pipe or a

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,000
joint you can use whatever you want but

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,000
the idea is the three things and uh I'm

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,878
gonna let Marcus Gary Richardson hey why

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,598
don't you pipe in you know you've been

58
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,318
to India and you've been to the big

59
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,959
celebration of the

60
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,159
Kumba uh which is like the the the the

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,680
huge hugest celebration in the world

62
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:38,639
longest Contin continual celebration I

63
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,680
believe as well as probably the largest

64
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,318
human gathering on Earth and you've

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,879
partaken of the Holy ganja with sadus

66
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,119
worshippers of Shiva right there in

67
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:47,959
India why don't you tell us a little bit

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,319
about

69
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,800
that yeah well what an amazing

70
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,238
experience it was to be able to uh to be

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,080
able to have that experience in the

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,360
first place and I kind of

73
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,040
remember you know I think it was the

74
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,080
year that Tre you know I was really into

75
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,598
fish and I was traveling and cruising

76
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,560
around and checking out fish I kind of

77
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:08,679
missed the Grateful Dead scene just by a

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,000
little bit Jerry passed away in 95 I

79
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,599
ended up on this fish Road and around

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,158
1998 the guitarist from fish was like

81
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,280
you know what guys like I love that

82
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:19,919
you're here every night and in so many

83
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,878
words he basically said go do something

84
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,280
else like honestly stop following us

85
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:26,120
around stop doing this go do something

86
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,680
else and I was like you're right I need

87
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,759
to do something else and I was like what

88
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,760
would be a cool like thing for me to go

89
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,959
like travel like for tour like I'm going

90
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:40,399
to see fish but it's not fish it's like

91
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:42,479
a multi year old ancient ritual you know

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,519
taken place by millions and millions of

93
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,318
people over the course of our lifetimes

94
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,799
and certainly even over the course of

95
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,359
just my visit there was over three

96
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,200
million people in the town that I went

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,040
to so I did go to the Kumba MAA I was

98
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,719
lucky enough to go for those of you that

99
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:58,519
know a little bit about the Kumba it is

100
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:01,878
a festival that happens uh every three

101
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:05,680
years in four different holy cities so I

102
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:07,759
believe it's Jaipur alabad uh varasi and

103
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,519
haridwar I could be wrong I may have

104
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,000
gotten that wrong but I ended up in

105
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,759
harir where it re does every 12 years

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,399
you end up for what is called the Maha

107
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:24,079
Maha Kumba now they also have a a Maha

108
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:26,359
Maha Maha Kumba which is the 144 year

109
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,918
cycle so when you get into a rituals

110
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,080
like this with a group of people that

111
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:33,079
have had history like this I mean for me

112
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,079
it was the most incredible thing and to

113
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,680
compare it to fish and the Grateful Dead

114
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:39,839
lot was very cool because when I got

115
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,478
there and I was you know overwhelmed by

116
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,279
all of these incredible people you know

117
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,279
we started you know we started oh let's

118
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,119
go smoke some Charis with these guys

119
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:50,319
let's go smoke and we were smoking with

120
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,120
all of these different sects the brahmas

121
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,319
and the bishnu and the you know the the

122
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,280
the eventually the shites but before I

123
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,599
met the shites I met the nagas and that

124
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:03,519
was probably some of my most intense

125
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,720
experience because that was there was

126
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,560
some massive cultural differences I mean

127
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,800
I don't even think people in like not

128
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,360
everyone in India hangs out with the

129
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,759
nagas you know because there's even

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,038
cultural differences in that culture but

131
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,560
from for me I found that it was just

132
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,478
they were just really the most out there

133
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,720
from anything that I understood or knew

134
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:26,399
and I really thrived on hanging out with

135
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,759
them I mean it was archaic hanging out

136
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,120
with a bunch of kind of new dudes that

137
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,680
were you know that we they knew we

138
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,439
didn't speak their language so they were

139
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,959
kind of grunting and using body

140
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,360
languages and we were just in these

141
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,799
little almost like cave like huts and

142
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,080
they've got their bodies covered in

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,520
ashes and they don't own anything and

144
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:45,399
we're smoking this napali Charis that

145
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,639
you know me and my buddy brought to the

146
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:51,120
Kumba MAA and it was just incredible I

147
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,759
remember leaving there I remember

148
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,120
leaving the Naga tent if you will and

149
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,560
there was uh a Hari Krishna who was

150
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,038
outside and he was quite educated and uh

151
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,079
you know he looked I I could tell he'd

152
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:06,079
been to like University but he was also

153
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,839
very you know he was following his his

154
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,758
spiritual path but I was really kind of

155
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,799
offended by what he said because he said

156
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,840
oh what were you doing in there and I

157
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,280
said oh we were just you know meeting

158
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:19,839
and interacting and sharing energy and

159
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,959
he said did you eat any food and I said

160
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,478
yeah of course they offered us some food

161
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:28,079
and we ate it oh you will surely be

162
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:31,439
poisoned he he says to me and I was just

163
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:34,680
like I was like all right so even here

164
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,879
at the Kumba MAA there's this same Petty

165
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,800
energy that you find on fish tour you

166
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,759
know like this is this is something

167
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,879
we're just recreating these rituals in

168
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,038
our own rights through because we lack

169
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,639
the culture in North America so we

170
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:51,000
recreate these gatherings and I really

171
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,639
found my people when I met pasupati the

172
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,839
shivi Baba that I connected with in

173
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,960
harir the one that I continue to smoke

174
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,598
with every day on the banks of the ganes

175
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,359

178
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:12,598
nose he found us like you Chris would

179
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,280
find the Dank on dead tour you know

180
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,079
amongst three million people and on a

181
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,239
side note this guy spoke over 50

182
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,359
languages he would pull people off the

183
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,038
ganes he'd just be like that guy there

184
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,960
go go get him go get him and then he

185
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,719
would just speak their language didn't

186
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:30,799
matter where they were from North Korea

187
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,960
South Korea Thailand China Vietnam he

188
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,360
just spoke like I didn't even know that

189
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,279
one person could know that many

190
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,720
languages and in the meantime his story

191
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,839
was that he was caught stealing uh as a

192
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,240
young boy nine years old he had a choice

193
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:48,679
to go to prison or to become the helper

194
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,120
of the Babas and so he started helping

195
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,199
Babas and traveling with Babas he he was

196
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,959
from rajastan so he ended up meeting

197
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,240
some really colored colorful character

198
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,318
shite Bubbas and they took him under

199
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,720
their wing and he would you know create

200
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,919
and and the the clay cups in the morning

201
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,440
so that they were all ready for the chai

202
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,799
throughout the day and he would keep the

203
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:11,240
fire stoked and he would sweep the area

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,598
on the banks of the river and so doing

205
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,478
that for many years he that's how he got

206
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:19,478
onto the spiritual path of the shite

207
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:21,839
Bubba and uh just really connected with

208
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:23,519
the shites while I was in hardar I never

209
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,239
snubbed my nose at hanging out with

210
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,439
anyone CU I was so interested in

211
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,519
learning from all these different

212
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,120
cultures but it took me two days to

213
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:34,079
realize who my people were at the maaha

214
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,639
Kumba he was the motorcycle Baba too I

215
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,959
think he was known as as well wasn't he

216
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,158
that is a different Baba that's Shiva

217
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,278
that's Shiva jiri and Mark Rose can

218
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,399
speak of Shiva jiri later and that was

219
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:50,000
Doc Atomic who actually

220
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,000
introduced Mark Rose to Shiva jiri and

221
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,799
I'm sure he has incredible stories

222
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,159
because you know he that was a heavy

223
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,479
Bubba that he was hanging out with and

224
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,559
he hung out with him for a lot more than

225
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,560
a month here and a month there he was he

226
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,078
was invited into caves that like no

227
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,639
white person has been invited into maybe

228
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:07,439
ever you know like for sure at least for

229
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,639
a thousand or 2,000 years caves that

230
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,959
cows were allowed in but uh just not

231
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,360
foreigners and so I I hope he tells

232
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:16,199
those stories later yeah yeah I wish I'd

233
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,399
invited doct at Tom like I didn't really

234
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,959
think of it I I I actually now that you

235
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,519
mentioned it I should have he had taken

236
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,599
when my son was born he'd taken a

237
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:28,320
picture to Shiva Jerry and had it had it

238
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,240

239
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,800

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,480
man like let's get a picture of I

241
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,359
actually asked Mark Rose to do that and

242
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,159
he was like oh I'm too afraid to ask

243
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,000
Shiva jiri so then I asked Dr Atomic and

244
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,240
he was kind of like oh man like I don't

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,639
know and I'm like dude what are you

246
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,799
talking about like of course like this

247
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,919
guy's full of love like just tell him

248
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,838
the story and you know two days later

249
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,679
there's there's Shiva jiri in the cave

250
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,920
holding the picture of your son yeah was

251
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,439
so incredible dude yeah incredible and

252
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,078
his son is called Shiva too

253
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,079
sha it was so cool trust me I went out

254
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:07,599
of my way to make that one happen and so

255
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:09,559
did Doc Atomic and so did Mark Rose they

256
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,278
were both just afraid to ask him and I

257
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,799
thought well come on I get it that you

258
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,679
rever and look up to this man but you

259
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,519
know listen if he's emanating the love

260
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,639
that you're saying he's emanating then

261
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,200
it's not going to be a question he's

262
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,000
gonna say of course Mark Rose was

263
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,959
surprised when he just said of course

264
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,679
yeah give me the picture let's take you

265
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,119
know it's surprising like these these

266
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,000
guys would they're basically Street

267
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,278
people a lot of times but then they're

268
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,679
great figures of respect in India as

269
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,919
well you know and and with full of full

270
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,919
of mojo as well so it's like a real

271
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,599
dichotomy it was uh it was really hard

272
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,919
for for the British to understand when

273
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,278
they first went in to India that these

274
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:47,559
naked Beggars were were commanding the

275
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,078
respect of the town's people more so

276
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,119
than they could with their weapons and

277
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,439
horses and chariots and all that type of

278
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,679
stuff they must have missed those

279
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,920
chapters in the Bible that said Jesus

280
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:00,078

294
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,919
um I don't have to say what I'm about to

295
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:37,119
say but I want to say it because I have

296
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,599
a lot of gratitude and so traditionally

297
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,159
we think our gurus but because I

298
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,879
normally EMB break with tradition I'm

299
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,679
going to do it anyway because out of

300
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:48,159
gratitude right and so the first person

301
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:51,039
I want to thank is Chris because growing

302
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:54,240
up Chris was a major figure for me like

303
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,679
I grew up uh in Christianity and I broke

304
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,839
away from Christianity like my heart was

305
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:01,199
broken and a major reunification with my

306
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,399
theolog my theology with Christianity

307
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,519
was Chris's work Chris kind of like gave

308
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,039
me back the romance that I lost with

309
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,078
Christianity because he he made me

310
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:11,439
realize that this plant and what Christ

311
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,559
was saying and the and the Jewish

312
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,600
Mysteries were this continuous message

313
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:18,559
from ancient times that I eventually

314
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,079
connected to Kashmir because in Kashmir

315
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,599
we have a mixing of the Jewish Mysteries

316
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:26,078
and the shite Mysteries it it was there

317
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,480
where I found this big Melting Pot

318
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,479
ancient ancient times where you could

319
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,000
see the Jews and the leites sharing

320
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,240
cabala and shavis side by side mixing

321
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,600
their Theology and so the modern cabala

322
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,759
and the modern shabis that we have today

323
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,839
came from that mixing came from that

324
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,958
that inner mixing of ideas from shavis

325
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,079
so everything Chris has been doing from

326
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,679
the start has been leading up to this in

327
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,638
the same way and it's been like a

328
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:53,519
Confluence of rivers just like the

329
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:56,600
yamuna the sarasvati and the ganji meet

330
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,560
at the at this this triple point um one

331
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,839
of the main figures that connects all of

332
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,078
our traditions

333
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,199
is uh it's called trium bakana which is

334
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:08,719
dianis dianis is know as thos the the

335
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:12,519
Thrice great one right the winning one

336
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,759
the triumphant one so TR Baka connects

337
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,360
us to that River TR bakan is also the

338
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,838
the God who is married to the triple

339
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,519
Rivers the three over and over again the

340
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,560
triple the triple Rivers the triple

341
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,320
Powers the triple PR prongs the triple

342
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,679
goddesses he's also the God who is

343
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,320
married to the triple goddesses so the

344
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,958
this special meaning of triak also is

345
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,320
not only three eyes it's three rivers

346
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,759
and three wives it's three meanings in

347
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,320
one this idea that three meanings exist

348
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,399
in one repeats itself over and over

349
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,600
again even in like a Jewish Jewish text

350
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,278
where you're supposed to interpret it

351
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,440
there's a a three-fold meaning in one so

352
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:50,120
in the same way these shite texts is

353
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,839
three meanings in one there's the Shambo

354
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,959
interpretation there's the shaki

355
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,399
interpretation and there's the

356
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,958
individual interpretation we're dealing

357
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,519
with the highest level in Kashmir with

358
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:02,719
the monistic with the first one with

359
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Shiva himself where we identify directly

360
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,519
and simply with Shiva so when we talk

361
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,639
about Simplicity and bringing back

362
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,879
Simplicity this particular time right

363
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,600
now Shiva ratri is the union of the of

364
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,879
the future and of the past together

365
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,199
where the Sun and the Moon come together

366
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,559
where the in and out breath come

367
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:19,919
together where we realize now at this

368
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,599
moment that everything's opening up and

369
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,078
we get that understanding of the true

370
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,480
potential of the future where it was the

371
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,239
same potential that came from the past

372
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,079
that shiva's that that consciousness of

373
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,000
potentiality that has infinite Evolution

374
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,638
infinite potentiality here at this

375
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,240
moment now we're experiencing a radical

376
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,039
revolution of Consciousness this

377
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,198
psychedelic research has been like at

378
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:41,958
the Forefront of this this is why I

379
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,799
thank you and I consider you part of

380
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,799
that lineage of gurus I see you just as

381
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,039
much as somebody that I honor as I I do

382
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,679
Swami G thank you very much for your

383
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,958
work and in the same way uh Swami lakman

384
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,758
jeu he opened up the tradition in this

385
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,039
age he opened up tradition so everybody

386
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,839
gets initiation anybody can can open

387
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,879
open up these texts anybody can listen

388
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,720
to what we're saying and be initiated

389
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,360
right now that that everything has

390
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,879
changed the future is open to us all of

391
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,600
us are going to become Shiva if we want

392
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,919
to if we so desire and it's that simple

393
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,920
in the 18th uh in 9th century was it was

394
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,519
one of the Masters uh utala DEA he is

395
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,000
the master of the master of the master

396
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,839
he he's one of the the starting masters

397
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,720
of this tradition he opened this

398
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,800
tradition up to everybody he said no

399
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,480
doesn't matter who you are women all

400
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,599
casts all creats all race anybody if you

401
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,159
can understand these words that's how

402
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,800
simple it can be it can be as simple as

403
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,000
understanding because it is as simple as

404
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:40,359
recognition this is the school of

405
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,679
recognition it is the highest and the

406
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,720
easiest path and when we say easy we

407
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:47,559
mean we laugh because it's like it's

408
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,720
deceptively easy because it requires a

409
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:51,119
level of mental fortitude that can only

410
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,240
be facilitated by something like

411
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,078
cannabis so back again cannabis is

412
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,959
important because cannabis facilitates

413
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,838
the forgetting of the world and the

414
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:03,799
focusing on Consciousness on meditation

415
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,639
on the higher elevation of the mind so

416
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:08,039
cannabis once again brings us into the

417
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,919
moment into the focus into the

418
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:13,480
one-pointed awareness so when Swami G

419
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,360
taught me how to pray he was quoting the

420
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,278
Gita he was quoting a vava text but he

421
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,919
was like it doesn't matter if it's a

422
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:21,439
vishna text we we'll use the vnaa text

423
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:23,559
and we'll say you know in it's a chapter

424
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,759
three of the Gita verse 14 where he

425
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:28,599
talks about rain food sacrifice in the

426
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,480
beginning God created the world through

427
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,278
sacrif

428
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,399
we sacrifice to the Lord the Lord Reigns

429
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,559
blessings unto us well whenever we light

430
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,958
up that same fire is the same fire of

431
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,439
sacrifice that fire in the joint is the

432
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,758
yagna that same AG is the same Agy in

433
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,079
the in the vitic fire rituals we're

434
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,639
performing thetic fire rituals when we

435
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:51,359
light up and we say to ourselves this is

436
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,639
Shiva this the fire is Shiva we are

437
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,959
Shiva I offer Shiva to Shiva who is Lord

438
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,120
Shiva Lord Shiva is consuming Lord Shiva

439
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,638
and you don't have to say it a lot you

440
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,959
could just recognize it as your smoking

441
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,480
your joint as you're inhaling and

442
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,798
exhaling both of these movements it it

443
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,240
represents that that constant throbbing

444
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,359
that constant awareness that Shiva is in

445
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,880
everything and and that direct

446
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,798
recognition is what what I keep trying

447
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,919
to bring up with this uh with this

448
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:21,000
school he's saying paa says the direct

449
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,120
constant recognition of the Lord is the

450
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,720
highest form of devotion no nothing else

451
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,959
is necessary just constantly remember

452
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,519
that Lord Shiva is shining in everything

453
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,160
all the time and that becomes like this

454
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,720
constant understanding that that that

455
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,759
you do in everything so you our yoga is

456
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,919
focused on going outside and working

457
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,919
doing help helping the

458
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,839
world

459
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,759
e

460
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,759
e e

461
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:34,720
this missing piece of Kashmir of Christ

462
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,960
cannabis the Jewish Myster is like this

463
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,880
is a continuation of our heritage my

464
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,919
Heritage my what I was raised in what

465
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,880
I've been researching what you've been

466
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,038
researching like this is a continuation

467
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,280
of of the dichotomy and what I feel is

468
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,000
the the resolution of the dichotomy of

469
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,119
this world in which most of the world

470
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
keeps fighting this fight where it seems

471
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:56,319
like it's the Scholars versus the

472
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,038
Warriors right but in ancient times they

473
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,839
were friends and so like why it seems

474
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,279
like we've degenerated into this fight

475
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,959
between like um the Jewish Mysteries and

476
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:07,399
the Aryan Mysteries but what if they

477
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,798
were one in the same at one point if

478
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,519
they just all degenerated into this

479
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:14,240
stupid fight this ignorance of the kuga

480
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,679
has made us forget that the the scholars

481
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,839
existed to facilitate the Warriors and

482
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,600
then we have we have to come together

483
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,119
and realize that we're brothers and

484
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:24,158
share in that Unity understand that

485
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:25,759
we're specialized in different ways but

486
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,080
not restricted from the

487
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,038
knowledge see I'm I'm not trying to push

488
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:33,079
cast I'm just saying that we have to

489
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:34,519
realize that the vas talk about how well

490
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:36,359
what what's good for you isn't good for

491
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,319
me because I was built to do this and

492
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,240
you were built to do that so we

493
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,839
shouldn't criticize each other if you're

494
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,720
in the mode of this like like you were

495
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,158
talking about the nagas right the nagas

496
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,798
are a completely different mentality a

497
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:49,400
different way of thinking right well the

498
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:52,079
Kashmir shavis comes from nagas it comes

499
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,798
from thinking Swami lakshman jeu he

500
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,119
doesn't identify with Rama he identifies

501
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:00,079
he identifies with lakshman and lakshman

502
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,959
is considered um aaga he's considered

503
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:04,000
the The Reincarnation of patanjali who

504
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,840
was a Naga he's considered the the

505
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,720
Incarnation of shesha Naga he's in he's

506
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:13,038
uh considered the the direct incarnation

507
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,319
of the tamas Guna so this whole Naga

508
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,798
teaching is very dark it's very Sinister

509
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:19,759
it's intense it's Primal it was here

510
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:21,440
before humans was here it was here when

511
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,599
the reptiles were here it is an

512
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,440
extension of this primordial and that's

513
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:29,240
why in the myid we always see um the

514
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,919
Naga and the human Krishna and brother

515
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,759
balarama Rama and his lakshman you know

516
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,000
there's always the human teaching and

517
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,640
the Naga teaching and so here here we

518
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,640
are realized that Shiva is is friends

519
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,919
with the nagas friends with the Naga

520
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,840
teaches that's why Shiva is bowling off

521
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,400
because he'll be friends with anybody

522
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,798
he'll be friends with the with the with

523
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,038
the nagas with the ghosts with the

524
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:52,480
demons and and he's e easy to please

525
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:53,798
anybody can come offer anything to Shiva

526
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,880
and he will give them bounds he will

527
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:59,639
accept it that's why we can come with

528
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,440
not only cannabis but any herb any any

529
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,679
plant that we offer with love to Lord

530
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,038
Shiva is a means and an access to Lord

531
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:09,480
Shiva that's why I love the word eny

532
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:12,200
because truly it is that Theos that

533
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,640
Shiva that we're trying to generate

534
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,159
whether we do it through yoga or whether

535
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,360
we do it through a preparation or an

536
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:19,000
Elixir a

537
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:21,879
plant whether we do it through Mantra or

538
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,640
japa or Kundalini Awakening like all are

539
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,440

yogic powers to to to to achievement of

561
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,839
whatever it is that you want Devotion to

562
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,759
Lord Shiva in everything that you do is

563
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,639
the means to attain whatever it is that

564
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,119
you desire and that's why it is so

565
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,200
simple bolanath is always my favorite

566
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,959
because he is so simple I strive for

567
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,480
that Simplicity that's why going forward

568
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,880
I want to make things as simple as

569
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,839
possible for everybody I feel that I

570
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,760
feel that let's let's open everything up

571
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,158
let's make it simple it should be simple

572
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,519
that's the promise of Technology right

573
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,400
like people take for granted clean power

574
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,558
clean energy right but that's something

575
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,240
if you go to India that's not something

576
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:49,440
people have that's something that that

577
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,599
that's been there a huge leap sanitation

578
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,720
all these things we should be as shites

579
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:56,038
coming back like the gods introducing

580
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,278
all this beauty just in the same way

581
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:01,240
they gave us Beauty we give Beauty back

582
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:03,359

583
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,839

spent seven years in India I originally

617
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,159
went there because I

618
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:40,278
uh I was in the pop business in the

619
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,799
early 70s and uh everything became

620
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:46,200
commercial so I decided I'd go look for

621
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:48,759
the hash Fields so I had I went to India

622
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,798
and uh when I was there I met some

623
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:52,640
incredible people and had some

624
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,879
incredible experiences I rode a

625
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,600
motorcycle from one end of India to the

626
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:02,919
other and uh I lived up in a place

627
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:04,879
called uh Kulu uh in Himachal Pradesh

628
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,600
mostly was my base even though I was all

629
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,799
over India and in Himachal Pradesh I

630
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:13,439
lived in a valley called the Kulu Manali

631
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:16,278
Valley Parvati Valley and it's very

632
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,440
famous for Quality hashish and and in

633
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:21,839
one Valley Parvati Valley who is the

634
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:24,360
consort of Lord Shiva in a little town

635
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:27,798
called a village actually called

636
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:30,759
manikaran uh is a home of Lord Shiva and

637
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:34,440
there's a Mander there as well as the

638
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:37,079
Kara and uh I lived in this area for

639
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,159
years and years and I I became friends

640
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:43,599
with this nagab Baba who is a nagab

641
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,559
Babas are priests of Lord Shiva they

642
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:50,798
were they don't have much they only have

643
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:53,558
a blanket and Lungi and they have a fire

644
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:56,359
and they don't touch material things

645
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:59,918
money or anything like that you know but

646
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:03,278
this one nagab was the most powerful man

647
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,600
in a 500 mile radius his name was gopal

648
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:10,079
G Maharaj and uh which is funny because

649
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:12,759
he has a v naava name but he was a nagab

650
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:16,038
baba Shiva Baba and he lived next to

651
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:20,599
this little temple in in a place called

652
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:22,398
out Au T it's it's spelled and uh he

653
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:25,000
lived in a little Shack beside the

654
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:28,479
temple and he was like he was like the

655
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,278
counselor the merry counselor the the he

656
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,159
he was the doctor the he was the ruler

657
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:36,960
even though he owned no possessions at

658
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,600
all he was the most powerful man

659
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,519
everyone respected this

660
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:45,398
man m to the max like the pope or

661
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:47,839
something and uh he lived next to this

662
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:51,558
little Shiva Temple which I found really

663
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:54,678
interesting because it had two altars

664
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:57,398
and the first alar was a buwan and buwan

665
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:59,759
is a Yoni and Lingham or translated in

666
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:04,000
English a Vina with a penis in the

667
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:06,440
center and and on Shiva roty everybody

668
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,640
bathes the lingum and the Yoni with

669
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,960
yogurt or or

670
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:16,840
or uh milk uh usually with a combination

671
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,840
of cannabis like a a bang lassi kind of

672
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:22,038
thing and uh flowers and garlands and

673
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,398
they have a feast and and it's the one

674
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:26,000
day in India where cannabis is legal

675
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:29,518
being a

676
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,558
Sacrament and the nice thing was this

677
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,200
little Temple next to him the first

678
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:36,798
altar was a bakwan and then the second

679
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,120
altar was a lifesized deity of Lord

680
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:43,480
Shiva and Parvati and Lord Shiva is

681
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:46,558
standing there and he has a meter long

682
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:50,038
penis and Parvati has her arms wrapped

683
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:52,678
around the penis smiling so

684
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:55,240
sweet I used to love to take Christians

685
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,880
there because they would they would uh

686
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,319
they would go oh that's perverted and

687
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,799
I'd say oh but what's perverted you you

688
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,480
worship a monkey on a stick come on

689
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,038
isn't that

690
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,200
perverted just to make them realize that

691
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,558
the different concept is not bad it's

692
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,319
just different and it's a very sweet

693
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:17,879
concept because the buck one goes back

694
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:21,720
to the union of the male and female

695
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:25,039
which begins life and and in India it's

696
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,278
uh the oldest temples are buan temples

697
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:30,398
actually and uh but I used to love to

698
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:33,038
take people there just to just to show

699
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:36,839
them to make their mind see a different

700
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:38,759
light a different view you know you know

701
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,519
also this ngab buub and I we got really

702
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:43,278
lucky I uh when I went to India I went

703
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,240
back and forth a few times I lived in

704
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:49,880
Boston at the time in the states and uh

705
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,960
my doctor gave me a big bag of

706
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,640
tetracyclin eye cream and other

707
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,640
medicines like uh there was some

708
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,080
penicillin also right and anyway

709
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,000
I took her with me to India I didn't

710
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:04,759
know you know why I had it all this

711
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,880
medicine but to show you that Shiva has

712
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:10,679
a plan I when I got to India there was I

713
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,799
was living in this little village on the

714
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:16,480
side of a mountain and uh there was a ey

715
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:18,200
flu then this eye flu took over all of

716
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,519
India and it made people they couldn't

717
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,798
see they couldn't function in the light

718
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,720
for for like two weeks right and this

719
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:28,960
nagab babba and I we went from Village

720
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,558
to Village to Village

721
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,480
and we treated people with this

722
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:36,839
tetracyclin eye cream which reduced the

723
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,399
sickness to like two days and we were so

724
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:41,359
lucky to do this to be able to help all

725
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:44,359
these people and I realized the doctor

726
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:49,319
gave me this without knowing but it it's

727
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:51,879
it it's the God's plan and uh as a

728
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:54,359
result I would wake up every morning in

729
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,519
my little village I lived in and there

730
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:59,599
would be potatoes and carrots and all

731
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,839
these cauliflower all these veggies on

732
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,558
my doorstep and this is the way the

733
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:07,678
people repaid me they're a very very

734
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:11,038
sweet place to live it was around 3,000

735
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,960
meters up in the Himalayas and uh it was

736
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,558
a great experience I I have many many

737
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,278
stories but I don't want to take up all

738
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:21,359
your time I thought just to share one

739
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:23,599
story would be nice give that to them

740
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,839
pardon was that just an intuition to

741
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,480
give that to them or like something told

742
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:29,558
you that that would be a good medicine

743
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,038
for them or how did you come up with the

744
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:34,038
idea I didn't I just wanted to take

745
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:36,119
anything that was valuable back to India

746
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:39,240
that I could take I took seeds I took

747
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:42,000
grain I took wheat I took all different

748
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,880
things with me right but the because my

749
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,159
doctor gave it to me I thought well I'm

750
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,240
going to the third world maybe this will

751
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:52,039
come in handy and it was it was ey drops

752
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,159
Tetra cycl ey drops of all things and

753
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:57,200
when the nagab bab babba told me this

754
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,639
flu was taking over The Villages I was

755
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,679
happy to go with him and we went out all

756
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:03,759
for the next few days Village to Village

757
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,480
to Village treating people with

758
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:09,359
tetracyclin eye cream and curing them of

759
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,159
this horrible I flu you made some pretty

760
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:15,278
good oil in India as well didn't you

761
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,919
blew a lot of uh sados Minds with the

762
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:20,839
potent oil you were making yeah I was

763
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,519
actually turning hashish into honey oil

764
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:25,918
using a petrolium ether as an extract

765
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,558
and uh activated charcoal to clean it up

766
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:33,519
and I had a great big leeching pot that

767
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:36,678
held four kilos of hashish and

768
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,720
uh and I was making oils and living very

769
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:40,960
comfortably in India and and and the

770
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,120
nagab Baba who was my friend he loved my

771
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,679
oil

772
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:48,678
he I was feeding with my oil and and uh

773
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:51,159
he told the police not to not to bother

774
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,320
me that if they did bother me they would

775
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,480
have to deal with him and of course

776
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:58,359
everyone was very much even the police

777
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,679
very much afraid of this man because he

778
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:02,759
was the most powerful man and he had all

779
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:04,600
the people behind him so the police

780
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,038
never ever bothered me and I was sitting

781
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:08,759
up in this Village it was illegal to

782
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,200
make alcohol in this Village but I was

783
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,119
sitting there making oil because oil is

784
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,399
a

785
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:16,638

00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:36,038
the police busted them and my and my

794
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,480
nagab Baba friend went into the police

795
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:41,119
station he took the hashish and says

796
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,440
this belongs to Shankar and walked

797
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:47,479
out and the police couldn't touch him of

798
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,240

799
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,079
the to the people that the police took

800
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,079
it

801
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:56,240

were you know going in there taking over

808

this is like during the British Raj but

809
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,519
they would like be cruising down the

810
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:16,878
streets in their in their wagons and

811

things like that and uh a naked Bob

812
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,480

813
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,959
the street and stand in their way and if

814
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,358
they would try to get physical with them

815
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,480
it was a real line cross for the people

816
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,039
you can push people so much but you

817
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,119
start AR like messing with their

818
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,759
religious world and they will Rebel in a

819
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:35,879
heartbeat right you know what I mean so

820
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,800
it was this tenuous situation where they

821
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:39,759
were able to main control with a certain

822
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,399
amount of respect but if they cross that

823
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,480
line then the people would uprise you

824
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,960
know and so they were trying to figure

825
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,358
out what to do with these sadus and

826
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,119
stuff like that and this is where this

827
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:54,679
scientific explanation of oh well

828
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:58,240
cannabis you know quasy scientific

829
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:00,358
explanation of uh cannabis makes you mad

830
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:01,719
uh uh first originated and so they

831
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:04,759
started saying well these guys are

832
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:07,799
insane and once they put a medical term

833
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,640
on it was less of an offense to the to

834
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,000
the locals and stuff like that and they

835
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:14,559
just started grabbing up all these sadu

836
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,400
and stuff all over the place it's a and

837
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:21,119
it changed it changed the Indian

838
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:24,358
relationship with this hoi herb and the

839
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:28,680
Resonance of that British Raj

840
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:31,199
prejudism against ganja is really still

841
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:34,319
there now in bread into the people of

842
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:37,199
India and India should be leading the

843
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,838
world in medical marijuana and in

844
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,480
cannabis science and they would be

845
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:43,920
leading if it wasn't for that earlier

846
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,119
influence of the British Raj demonizing

847
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,720
shiva's holy plant that's right you're

848
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,119
correct there they demonized the plant

849
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:54,118
but the thing is in India the Naga Babas

850
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:58,280
are very powerful and they had the

851
00:35:54,119 --> 00:36:01,358
backing of the people so if the police

852
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,280
don't have any control of nagas because

853
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,719
the people believe the nagas are are are

854
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,800
saintly

855
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:11,838

seconds let me yeah no for sure man

874
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,160
we'll talk a little bit about the lingum

875
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:59,039
you know um you you know uh uh uh um

876
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:02,559
Doug mentioned the lingum there and this

877
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:06,480
is a classic example of the lingum uh uh

878
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:10,159
inside the Basin of of the Yoni you know

879
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,318
and uh um is also and this is a cobra I

880
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,399
don't know if you can see that yeah

881
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:15,960
representative like Kundalini energy

882
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,639
which is like the power of sex Instinct

883
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:22,838
you know um and this is a uh a

884
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:26,318
three-phase Sheba and it actually has

885
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:29,559
over his uh uh phus area an aat Cobra

886
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:32,199
serving as a lingam you you know and uh

887
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:34,679
um I like this particular Shiva a lot

888
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:36,279
because I just ended up with it my shop

889
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:39,318
I don't even know where it came from you

890
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,960
know when I have my shop I had a lot of

891
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:42,639
uh different things come through but

892
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,318
he's got like a Chillum right here on

893
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:48,519
his belt ready to go and then he's got

894
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:51,960
right here you know

895
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:54,358
erected with the Cobra and he's also the

896
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:58,119
the three-face Shiva which goes with the

897
00:37:54,358 --> 00:38:01,559
the three-phase Shiva Chillum ritual um

898
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,680
but uh the lingum is like you know

899
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:06,920
although it represents a phus it's like

900
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:10,519
the Primal Force the driving force of

901
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:13,200
the universe you know and that's uh uh

902
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:15,920
um really like you know like just the

903
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:19,399
the the drive for Life man you know like

904
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:23,159
the the the the Primal force of it all

905
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:25,318
and um there's an interesting story in

906
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:26,399
in the Piranhas I think it is and you

907
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:28,199
know one of the things I like about

908
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,639
Shiva is it's kind of almost like a folk

909
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:34,159
tradition as well and you're not stuck

910
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:36,159
with the dogmatic kind of uh uh view of

911
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,799
some of the other aspects you know some

912
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,318
of the more like fundamental aspects of

913
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,720
Hinduism you know what I mean and so

914
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,599
there's all sorts of folk tales and folk

915
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,199
songs and and and that that type of

916
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:50,119
stuff around Shiva and I'm this is kind

917
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:53,399
of an adaption of of a panic myth as it

918
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:56,079
was told to me but uh the story is that

919
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,800
uh Shiva was wandering through the

920
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,920
jungle and uh there was Brahman women

921
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,119
and they were at a a pond washing their

922
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,880
clothes and stuff like that and Shiva

923
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,000
comes out of the Jungle naked as he

924
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,559
often you know generally was with his

925
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,199
erect phus and the wom like oh my God

926
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:15,239
what's this you know and uh um so they

927
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,439
uh go running off to their husbands

928
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:19,358
brahin and they they say oh we were

929
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,880
washing clothes and this naked man

930
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:24,679
showed up a wild man with an wck Palace

931
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,519
you know I'm like oh this is terrible oh

932
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:28,118
what the heck you know and they go down

933
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:29,920
to where this guy they see him and they

934
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,838
call a curse down on him in the name of

935
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,079
Brahma and his Fus falls off and it

936
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:37,199
starts ripping through the forest

937
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:38,760
burning everything in his path and

938
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,519
destroying and they're like what the

939
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,800
heck you know and they go running the

940
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:44,920
Brahma and they go Brahma Brahma and

941
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,680
they tell him the story of the the their

942
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,599
wives washing clothes and the Naked

943
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:52,440
Jungle Man with the erect fallace and he

944
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:55,760
goes oh no that was Shiva man and that

945
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,280
is the procreative force of the universe

946
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,560
you should built a baby in the shape of

947
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:04,880
a vagina and bathed it and worshiped it

948
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:08,759
you know and this is like kind of true I

949
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,480
think in a lot of ways of the unbalanced

950
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,920
phallic age that we're in this

951
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,400
patriarchal age that we're in and the

952
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:19,119
unbalanced nature of of of the drive of

953
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,039
the patriarchy whether it being swords

954
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,960
for piercing and penetrating or bullets

955
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:26,599
or Torpedoes or rockets for penetrating

956
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,720
it's all about dominating and

957
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:33,400
penetrating other cultures and uh that

958
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:36,639
is why this sacred herb energy you know

959
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,800
the the the the Yoni energy which is

960
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:43,440
present in cannabis we grow ganja for

961
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:46,240
its its female qualities you know and

962
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,318
this is what the symbolism of the

963
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:52,118
pouring of the bong on the linga is

964
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:55,679
about is is restoring that balance is

965
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:59,280
cooling it Shiva was introduced to ganja

966
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:01,440
by pvar to Cal him down to stop his

967
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,079
wanderings to chill him out when they

968
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,720
were having a fight you know those are

969
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:09,280
what the folkus say about it and so it's

970
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:12,399
a really potent relationship this this

971
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,160
relationship between ganja and and the

972
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:18,639
male God because the ganja balances the

973
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:23,159
male god with the female energy you know

974
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:26,559
yeah you're very right there in India

975
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:28,559
uh Parvati before she was Parvati her

976
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:32,039
name was sat

977
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:35,599
and she was embarrassed by her father

978
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:37,440
Daka and Shiva tends to get very angry

979
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,160
and this is why Parvati introduced him

980
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,480
to ganja because he got so angry he

981
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:45,279
chopped off daa's head her father's head

982
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,760
because she burned herself up because

983
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,880
she was

984
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,040
so disrespected by her father her father

985
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,838
disrespecting Lord Shiva so she burnt

986
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:58,440
her body up and took another body later

987
00:41:54,838 --> 00:42:01,199
as perati but she tend to get very angry

988
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,480
and he replaced her father's head with a

989
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:06,719
head of a

990
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:11,000
goat as he did with his own son

991

lovers so wonderful to be

1021
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:47,838
here you know I have Indian Roots I was

1022
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:50,920
born in Uganda Africa raised mostly in

1023
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:53,719
Canada but I've been many times to India

1024
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,880
and I had a wonderful sharing years back

1025
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:58,439
with Chris Chris and I go back I've been

1026
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:01,000
totally enthralled by work but more

1027
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,920
valuable is who he is as a being as a

1028
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,239
person who cares about the illumination

1029
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:08,880
of society not just his scholarly

1030
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,598
capacity which is brilliant but the root

1031
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,559
of where that comes from and I believe

1032
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:15,880
that's the root of Shiva itself now

1033
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:18,440
there's a term we have all heard of in

1034
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,720
the Western World Shiva as portrayed as

1035
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,838
the

1036
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:24,039
Destroyer but I would like to give you

1037
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:27,159
another offering of the translation of

1038
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:31,679
the term shiv and that is not as the

1039
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:34,799
destroyer in the har sense but a more

1040
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:37,199
accurate Artful translation would be

1041
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:42,119
taking into account the sound the energy

1042
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:44,838
the language is the kind k i n d the

1043
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:44,838
kind

1044
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:51,079
disolver so first of all if I can invite

1045
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:55,118
us to rescript our way of thinking slash

1046
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:58,039
burn kill destroy and look at it as what

1047
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,559
within our personal existence and

1048
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:03,519
reality what is within our personal

1049
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:05,800
existence and reality that we fear in

1050
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:08,759
this time of Letting

1051
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,599
Go this is a huge time the whole world

1052
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,000
on multiple Dimensions is being

1053
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:17,720
rescripted up leveled uh corruption

1054
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,440
craziness ego all these factions are all

1055
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:26,358
up yes it I also feel and I invite us to

1056
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:28,480
feel a profound unifying sacred energy

1057
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:30,358
that is allow owing the impurities to

1058
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,440
rise to the top the churning the

1059
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:36,000
churning to rise all the [ __ ] to the

1060
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,880
top which we see which Chris is a great

1061
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,599
advocate of sharing the [ __ ] on the

1062
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:44,240
planet right so but underneath it we

1063
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:47,800
must recognize that Shiva this energy

1064
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:51,558
within us is not an external

1065
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:54,559
God this is the God within and this is

1066
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:57,160
the aspect of the Triune aspect of God

1067
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,119
there's the arising from the void into

1068
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:01,799
Consciousness the Brahma this creation

1069
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:04,640
we looking at each other moment to

1070
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:07,119
moment being recreated moment to [ __ ]

1071
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,598
moment from nothing and our bodies are

1072
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,920
sticking together we have some [ __ ]

1073
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,519
continuity which is unbelievable if you

1074
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,000
look at it as subatomic level how the

1075
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:19,159
hell do we even have continuity that is

1076
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,920
Vishnu the continuity of existence

1077
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:24,598
matter energy time and space is the

1078
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,119
Vishnu quality the arising out of the

1079
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:31,800
Void into existence into temporal

1080
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:35,160
dimensionality is considered Brahma now

1081
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,960
what is Vishnu or shiv shiv represents

1082
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:41,000
that which in our being which is

1083
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:44,159
returning back into the void returning

1084
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,400
back to the source of creation so the

1085
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:50,199
traditional yogic Warrior approach in

1086
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,960
the Kumba the yogis taught me the nagab

1087
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:55,399
Baba has taught me says don't be scared

1088
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,400
of Shiva don't be scared of dissolving

1089
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,079
how can you be scared of the ultimate

1090
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,559
benevolent love on the

1091
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:05,079
planet love also shows up in a way which

1092
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,720
allows things to dissolve and return

1093
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:10,960
back into the primordial elements of

1094
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:13,239
being so I ask you on a pragmatic level

1095
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,838
not just esoteric all of us friends

1096
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:19,879
watching listening what in our life is

1097
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:23,239
Shiva yanking us with right

1098
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:27,920
now how is Shiva putting his Trident in

1099
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:31,598
US shaking us up pinching us pointing us

1100
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,639
it's three points the heart the mind and

1101
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:37,720
the belly the soul the sex those are the

1102
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:41,440
three Trident when Shiva is active is

1103
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:43,838
poking the [ __ ] out of us what four he's

1104
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:48,400
looking for us to look for where are we

1105
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:50,719
holding on to something that deserves to

1106
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,440
dissolve is it a business we're holding

1107
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:55,519
on to is it a relationship we're trying

1108
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:59,000
to resurrect resurrect resurrect

1109
00:47:55,519 --> 00:48:02,639
resurrect but it's much better off to

1110
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:08,440
let go and let go into the kind

1111
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:10,639
dissolving is it um uh uh um an ambition

1112
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,559
that you've been working on and you know

1113
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,639
what it's just going flat flat flat

1114
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,160
you're putting so much energy into it

1115
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,000
but you're not getting the return from

1116
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,879
the universe that's Shiva is saying this

1117
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,079
is not your path many of us have chosen

1118
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,880
and walking down paths that our parents

1119
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,760
have chosen our society has imprinted

1120
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,760
into us that we should walk we should

1121
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,160
take this is a sacred time my friends

1122
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,319
that I've experienced more than any

1123
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:37,440
other time in my life where the

1124
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:40,000
willingness if we can find that

1125
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:43,720
willingness to what's the fear what do

1126
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'm holding on is it my home my

1127
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:47,719
location you know I know my brother

1128
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Chris has gone through this of letting

1129
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:52,279
go of his home base for years and moving

1130
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,798
into a whole new dimension but I'm sure

1131
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:57,200
there was Shiva involved he had to face

1132
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:59,559
within himself all the attack M ments

1133
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:02,239
for years of a home base that means

1134
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:04,160
something brings you brings you calm

1135
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:07,719
confidence brings you a sense of

1136
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:10,480
home where in ourselves are we [ __ ]

1137
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:14,039
holding on to fear what's the biggest

1138
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,599
thing that Shiva is saying it's time for

1139
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:18,719
this to

1140
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:22,039
dissolve is it a bad

1141
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:24,519
habit is it a limited thought I'm not

1142
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:28,239
good enough I have no value in the world

1143
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:30,559
let Shiva burn it

1144
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:33,318
maybe you think you're too big oh I need

1145
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:36,680
to be this and grandis myself be this

1146
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:39,279
and this we see this in the world Shiva

1147
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:42,239
will burn that down anyways Shiva comes

1148
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,798
for those who self angiz and tears them

1149
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:48,000
down and what is that that is the force

1150
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:49,480
of the kind the benevolent dissolving

1151
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,159
might not look like it in the moment but

1152
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:55,440
it is the other form rather than

1153
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:58,199
self-aggrandisement that Shiva comes to

1154
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:01,679
purify within our being to return back

1155
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:04,960
to the void is self-depreciation

1156
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:07,480
where are we holding ourselves small

1157
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,400
where are we holding ourselves less than

1158
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,079
who we are are you a smarter than are

1159
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,079
you a smart in a way that needs to come

1160
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,559
out are you radiant and beautiful in a

1161
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:19,359
way that needs to be expressed what

1162
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:22,400
needs to be expressed that fear is

1163
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:25,519
holding you back with this to me is the

1164
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,720
heart of Shiva so let's take a few deep

1165
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:29,599
breaths and I'd like you to feel into

1166
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:32,959
your

1167
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:36,599
being like to feel into your being what

1168
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:39,240
you know right now you need to let go of

1169
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:41,920
that you haven't built up enough courage

1170
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:44,598
confidence time contemplation but in

1171
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,440
your soul you know it's time it's time

1172
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:48,798
to let go it's time not to be ruled by

1173
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,119
the fear of

1174
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:54,599
smallness what's the one thing you can

1175
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:54,599
let go

1176
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:02,280
of when you have that let that percolate

1177
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:04,399
Feel the fear within feel the what would

1178
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:07,839
it mean if you let go of that husband

1179
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:11,880
that wife that dog that business that

1180
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:14,039
that uh coworker that boss that employee

1181
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,039
that

1182
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,920
relationship and then rather than trying

1183
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:24,199
to do this on our own through our own

1184
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,960
personal will let's connect with the

1185
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:32,519
grand will of Shiva in side be in

1186
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,519
communion with that energy of the kind

1187
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:38,838
dissolving and rather than Valiant

1188
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:41,200
ourselves become push ourselves into the

1189
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:43,078
relinquishment of the fear how about if

1190
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:48,639
we just offer the

1191
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:52,720
fear to Shiva in a sacred flame a sacred

1192
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,719
smoke breathing in the Life

1193
00:51:54,119 --> 00:52:01,160

exhalation the sacred offering even your

1198
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,358
fear Shiva will

1199
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:20,319

1200
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,400
and yearns

1201
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:27,039
to absolve from

1202

that is being looked at for Co you know

1300
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,240
and it was probably good for malaria

1301
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,960
back in the day as well but I think that

1302
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:23,679
you know on this Shiva ratry that we

1303
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:27,199
should really all say a prayer for Shiva

1304
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:29,639
to release Humanity from the bonds of

1305
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:31,919
this cruel covid which has taken loved

1306
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:33,838
ones from some of us which we've seen

1307
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,798
spread around the planet and change

1308
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:40,199
things you know maybe it's given

1309
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:43,480
Humanity a pause for reflection in a lot

1310
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:44,719
of ways you know maybe it's shiv's will

1311
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,079
that this has

1312
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:49,078
happened but I think that it's time to

1313
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:53,000
move past this you know and I think that

1314
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:56,760
we can all join together in a prayer

1315
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,358
pouring bong on the linga

1316
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,799
let's all focus and think of the

1317
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:01,639
suffering that this Co has caused around

1318
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:05,358
the

1319
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:06,879
world the half a million people dead you

1320
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:11,440
know in America

1321
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:15,200
alone millions of people dead around the

1322
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:17,920
globe from this cruel cruel disease

1323
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:20,199
unable to visit with our grandparents

1324
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:23,400
and our and our older people in

1325
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:26,318
isolation in their last years because of

1326
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:29,440
the cruelness of this disease

1327
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:33,599
let's all ask Lord

1328
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:35,920
Shiva uh um to to to release US release

1329
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,640
Humanity from this

1330
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:42,480
fever and uh pour some bong on the

1331
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:45,960
lingam and uh my Shi is going to take

1332
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:48,280
the honors here and pour bong on this

1333
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,798
Ling so I'm just gonna actually show

1334
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,160
what the bong looks like because people

1335
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:54,280
might not have seen it before I'm just

1336
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:56,078
going to show yeah if you're joining it

1337
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,839
you don't have no idea what's going on

1338
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:00,440
bong is a traditional drink prepared

1339
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:02,558
with cannabis in India it's shiva's

1340
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,880
favorite drink and people have been

1341
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:08,559
preparing bong for for thousands of

1342
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,960
years the the the vtic Soma may have

1343
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:13,798
been a drink very similar to Bong

1344
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:16,400
certainly evidence indicating that and

1345
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:19,480
so this is sh Sha's sacred drink since

1346
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,760
time Memorial the way he sought relief

1347
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:23,880
and we're going to pour some bong on

1348
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,880
Shiva Lingham as people have done for

1349
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,880
centuries

1350
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,039
bomo

1351
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:47,000
Mahadev boom

1352
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:56,400
balling releases from this fever

1353
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:15,598
well we can kind of chitchat for a

1354
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:17,759
little while uh um Richard's not up for

1355
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,960
for a few minutes yet did you ever get a

1356
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:23,079
hold of Mark Rose Marcus no I sent him

1357
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:26,119
like three messages to three different

1358
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:27,839
numbers and Skype you know saying what

1359
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:30,599
happened and that what we're doing and

1360
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:32,558
that he's invited but uh I don't even

1361
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:34,119
know where he is in the world right now

1362
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,839
well there you go it's a whole other

1363
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:38,160
it's a whole other country over there in

1364
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:40,038
Nepal where he is so we'll just think of

1365
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:42,358
him here and say a prayer for him has

1366
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:45,280
anybody got anything they want to add in

1367
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:48,759
here or prayer or anything like

1368
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:51,079
that I wanted to talk a little bit about

1369
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:54,319
um what R shockd plays in the Kashmir

1370
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:56,160
sha tradition and I just want to say as

1371
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,838
quickly as I can because there's a lot

1372
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:01,118
of information but in reality we're

1373
01:00:58,838 --> 01:01:03,798
we're actually shaki worshippers um we

1374
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:06,519
worship svati or sharat Devi which is

1375
01:01:03,798 --> 01:01:08,440
one in the same sharata is the the

1376
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:10,119
goddess of knowledge and of language

1377
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:11,920
sharat is actually the three main

1378
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:13,000
phenomes the three mother phenomes put

1379
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,318
together

1380
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,119
Shara so when we have sharada when we

1381
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:20,119
say we have faith Shada we actually have

1382
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:23,280
sharada which is we possess knowledge

1383
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:25,440
knowledge gives us Faith because when we

1384
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,559
have knowledge we have certainty and

1385
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,119
that certain certainty of will that

1386
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:33,519
willpower is shaki so in our tradition

1387
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,920
shaki is willpower but it is Lord

1388
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:38,679
shiva's willpower to do whatever he

1389
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,680
wants so in this way we understand that

1390
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:43,118
there's no such thing as Maya there's

1391
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:44,879
only the Free Will of Lord Shiva

1392
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,838
everything is Lord shiva's free will all

1393
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:50,318
the time including your free will in

1394
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:53,400
fact in chapter two of the Shiva strali

1395
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:56,038
it says Lord shiva's infinite power is

1396
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:58,559
found in every bit of Lord Shiva so

1397
01:01:56,039 --> 01:02:01,160
shaki which is Lord shiva's power is so

1398
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:03,559
infinite that she can reproduce herself

1399
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:06,480
infinitely even in the tiniest Speck of

1400
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:08,680
shaki can produce the most infinite

1401
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,119
potential of shaki so even the tiniest

1402
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:13,519
graen of sand has Infinity in it has

1403
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:15,880
Shak the infinite in it right well our

1404
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:18,358
own willpower is like that grain of sand

1405
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:21,480
that can expand into the grandness of

1406
01:02:18,358 --> 01:02:24,519
shaki herself the the Lord is so Grand

1407
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,318
that each of us can become a Shiva

1408
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:28,960
himself this is a secret teaching of

1409
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:32,000
shivas s this is means that we become

1410
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:34,559
ontologically distinct shivas ourselves

1411
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,679
I you me all of us can become our own

1412
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:39,200
shivas because Shiva is so Grand that he

1413
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:43,000
can infinitely reproduce to infinite

1414
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:46,480
shivas if you desire if you will and

1415
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:50,079
that willpower is shaki that willpower

1416
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:52,559
is Maya they're one and the same so this

1417
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,920
this bondage is not bondage it is

1418
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,798
willpower when you realize that is that

1419
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,960
it's all your will power you're never

1420
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:02,038
going to be bound it is infinitely your

1421
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:05,079
freedom to create anything but you got

1422
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:06,839
to put that willpower into it and that's

1423
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:10,039
that in our in our tradition Shiva is

1424
01:03:06,838 --> 01:03:12,960
that Vira he is that fire that he puts

1425
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:15,400
into the Shak but then shaki turns it

1426
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,960
into everything good she is the sacred

1427
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:20,079
cow if if it is the proper worship of

1428
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:22,159
shaki that produces all the beautiful

1429
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,359
things in this world so it's like we

1430
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:26,038
must learn how to turn that fire into

1431
01:03:24,358 --> 01:03:28,480
love I think that's why more than

1432
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:30,960
anything cannabis teaches us how to turn

1433
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:33,318
that Viva into something beautiful that

1434
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,278
blossoms into something that's that's

1435
01:03:33,318 --> 01:03:37,440
like a something that allows us to see

1436
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:40,039
beauty I I more than anything want us to

1437
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,920
understand that shaki is Beauty and she

1438
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:46,720
shines in everything and she is power

1439
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:48,159
and she is so infinite that all of us

1440
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:50,558
have access to that

1441
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:53,639
infinity and then she is everywhere if

1442
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:56,278
we allow her to enter our life in every

1443
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:58,440
space beautiful man you know there's

1444
01:03:56,278 --> 01:04:01,159
some one of the guys I really like that

1445
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:03,838
writes about Shiva is this guy elain

1446
01:04:01,159 --> 01:04:06,719
downo and this book here is dionisius

1447
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:08,318
and Shiva about the connections uh uh

1448
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:11,239
between Shiva and dionisius and I'll

1449
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:12,880
maybe go into bit that a bit later and

1450
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:16,118
uh um here's another one of his books

1451
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:18,278
Shiva and the primordial tradition and

1452
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:20,079
uh the the well the gods play the Shiva

1453
01:04:18,278 --> 01:04:22,798
oracles which are all about Shiva in

1454
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:24,559
this time predictions about Shiva in the

1455
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:25,719
C stuff is particularly different

1456
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,599
because he gives a different time

1457
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:29,519
timeline he says that he went along with

1458
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,559
actual yogis into the mountains to

1459
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:33,759
actual Naga yogis right and he writes

1460
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:35,960
that he talked to them about the real

1461
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:39,000
time cycles of the kuga and he says no

1462
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:40,960
we are at the end of the kuga this 43

1463
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,159
this 400 year thousand stuff that's just

1464
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,079
vava misinterpretation [ __ ] the

1465
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:47,480
shites have the real dates and we're at

1466
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:49,119
the end and Swami G says the reason why

1467
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,599
we opened up the tradition is because

1468
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,278
we're at the end we're at paralia we're

1469
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:54,640
at the [ __ ] end right now the world

1470
01:04:52,278 --> 01:04:56,838
is [ __ ] reciting it's time to open

1471
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:58,558
open everything up because people are

1472
01:04:56,838 --> 01:05:00,358
going to need these teachings this is

1473
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,240
like this is literally the armor this is

1474
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:05,199
like the the Lifesaver we got to come

1475
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:06,479
out and be like hey guys this is simple

1476
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:08,159
we C we can give everybody what they

1477
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,079
need right now in the moment where they

1478
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:14,199
most desperately need it oh you brother

1479
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:16,400
you said something so [ __ ] powerful

1480
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:19,038
they just landed like like everything

1481
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:22,559
for me and that is there is no

1482
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:25,119
Maya that what was determined or or

1483
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:27,760
called Maya in some ways of perception

1484
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,960
is actually the the the embodiment of

1485
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,240
the will of Shiva this is our

1486
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:35,838
opportunity and this is Shu the

1487
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:38,159
expressing itself not some illusion to

1488
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:42,000
overcome or to kill or destroy or to

1489
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:44,480
robe or to heal you know and that to me

1490
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,960
is the essence it's so beautiful what

1491
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:50,440
you said and so needed now with a world

1492
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,440
where most religions many uh systems

1493
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:54,440
have an idea that ah there's the

1494
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:57,318
illusion we must move Beyond and

1495
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:59,960
transcend and the problem is is that we

1496
01:05:57,318 --> 01:06:02,119
need to enter whatever the thing we want

1497
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:04,880
to move away from that we think is

1498
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:07,240
illusion and find the freaking truth of

1499
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,798
the willpower of who we are how we are

1500
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:13,399
generating this we are generating this

1501
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:16,119
so I join you in recognizing this whole

1502
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:19,039
existence as the Forum of

1503
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:20,640
shui our next our next speaker let me

1504
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,599
just introduce yeah we we'll cut pick

1505
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:24,960
this up again our next speaker is an

1506
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,760
important speaker in this thing you know

1507
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,960
one of the things I mentioned about the

1508
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:32,720
three chillim ritual was that uh uh

1509
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:36,720
Chandra Baba Chandra Kali there he

1510
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:38,278
invented it to be inclusive you know and

1511
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:39,679
I think that's a really important

1512
01:06:38,278 --> 01:06:42,318
important message you know and Shiva

1513
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:44,919
represents everything between the two

1514
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:47,960
poles of the masculine and feminine you

1515
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:50,559
know everything in between that every

1516
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:53,119
everybody and a lot of religions in this

1517
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:56,480
cuga age have

1518
01:06:53,119 --> 01:07:00,119
rejected people that stand between those

1519
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:02,760
two poles of the masculine and

1520
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:05,318
feminine they persecuted them they burnt

1521
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,920
them at the stake they've made them

1522
01:07:05,318 --> 01:07:11,880
illegal shiva's always embraced them

1523
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:14,159
it's always been part of Shiva energy

1524
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:18,358
and our next speaker Richard they're

1525
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:19,239
gonna talk to us about this dual aspect

1526
01:07:18,358 --> 01:07:22,199
of

1527
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:23,439
Shiva Richard thanks Chris thanks for

1528
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:25,798
having me I appreciate being here I

1529
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:27,480
really enjoyed the conversation so far

1530
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:29,480
um so one thing to kind of disclose

1531
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:31,039
about myself is I identify as androgine

1532
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,798
I identify as both masculine and

1533
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,760
feminine myself and in my spiritual

1534
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:36,199
practice Chris knows I'm athelite I have

1535
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,000
a lot of involvement with Otto the

1536
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:39,798
Gnostic mass and particularly the the

1537
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,599
teachings of Alistar Crowley and you

1538
01:07:39,798 --> 01:07:44,400
know I live in Baltimore and I work in

1539
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:47,000
Washington DC and um I actually went to

1540
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,639
an exhibit on uh on Tantra and things

1541
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,358
like that over at the Smithsonian they

1542
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:52,159
they acknowledge croley's role in kind

1543
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:53,440
of bringing a lot of these ideas into

1544
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:54,960
Western culture in that time you know

1545
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,358
he's one of those figures who really

1546
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,838
made it more accessible and it it really

1547
01:07:57,358 --> 01:08:00,719
shows in a lot of his work and the

1548
01:07:58,838 --> 01:08:03,199
things that I study so um I wanted to

1549
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:05,078
bring that up the the two um things I

1550
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:07,879
wanted to talk about with my time today

1551
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:10,200
was um of course Arana rishar the the

1552
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,680
androgine aspect of Shiva and Parvati

1553
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:14,399
the combined aspect of that and another

1554
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:16,679
um deity you know I'm I'm honestly still

1555

1556
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:22,039

01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:17,719
my screen

01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:19,238
there yes is okay so that's um bahuchara

1578
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:21,239
mat and she's the Hindu goddess of

1579
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:23,559
Chasity fertility and her maiden aspect

1580
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:26,278
and of incarnation of the mother aspect

1581
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:28,319
of Shakti and she's as I mentioned the

1582
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:30,560
um considered the Patronus of the hedra

1583
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,679
community and I have some images of the

1584
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,798
hedra it's a really interesting I I just

1585
01:09:32,679 --> 01:09:38,719
recently started to study about it um so

1586
01:09:35,798 --> 01:09:41,238
in the Indian subcontinent uh the hedra

1587
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:44,119
are Unix intersex people and transgender

1588
01:09:41,238 --> 01:09:46,158
people um and the hedri community in IND

1589
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:48,079
India prefer to call themselves kinar

1590
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:50,719
kiner referring to the mythological

1591
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,479
beings that excel at song and dance and

1592
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,119
um one of the other things that's

1593
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:56,000
interesting about them culturally is

1594
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:58,359
they're officially recognized is a third

1595
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,760
gender in India um being considered

1596
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:02,039
neither completely male or female and

1597
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:04,760
they have a recorded history in the

1598
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:06,560
Indian subcontinent um since Antiquity

1599
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:08,840
um suggested by the Kamas Sutra so I

1600
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:13,159
bring them up as um a contrast these are

1601
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:17,000
some images of some of the the hedra um

1602
01:10:13,158 --> 01:10:20,319
Community there and these are some more

1603
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,359
images that I bring this up as a a a

1604
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:25,399
contrast to what I'll talk

1605
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:27,399
about um with the androgine aspect as

1606
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:30,559
for comparison so I was interested to

1607
01:10:27,399 --> 01:10:32,519
learn about these two with

1608
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:36,400
ardhanarishvara so I'll move over to the

1609
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:36,400
images um of the androgine

1610
01:10:38,198 --> 01:10:44,279
next and so these are some of the images

1611
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:47,880
of Shiva Parvati together in the arar

1612
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:50,079
Arana rishar form um where the male and

1613
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:52,119
female is split equally in

1614
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:54,119
half and some of the other things that

1615
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:56,399
correspond in in Western occultism I

1616
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:57,920
have some images in here um of for

1617
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:59,158
instance the devil card we were talking

1618
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,800
about you were talking about the

1619
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:02,839
patriarchal phallic energy that kind of

1620
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,480
is permeating the world and Shiva in the

1621
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,679
masculine sense is considered the the

1622
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:08,839
ultimate masculine entity but in this

1623
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:10,840
androgine form it's an equally balanced

1624
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,119
masculine and feminine so one of the

1625
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,960
other things you see in Western

1626
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:16,519
occultism of course the imagery of bamat

1627
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:18,239
the androgine um of Arcane Perfection so

1628
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,600
the breast of the female the phus of the

1629
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:22,839
male again kind of um bringing these

1630
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,920
contrasts in unison and in alchemy the

1631
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:27,239
alchemical Rebus is um symbolic of the

1632
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:29,039
magn Opus the great work the idea of

1633
01:11:27,238 --> 01:11:31,119
blending the male and the female in one

1634
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:33,119
and so I wanted to talk about um what

1635
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:35,880
that means conceptually so we talked

1636
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:39,079
about um let me see if I can stop

1637
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:41,039
sharing my screen for a minute um the

1638
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:43,000
idea of becoming one with Shiva and so

1639
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:45,000
but who does Shiva become one with Shiva

1640
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,560
becomes one with Parvati in that sense

1641
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,119
and so like how do we emulate that how

1642
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,159
do we incorporate that masculine and

1643
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:52,119
feminine energy in ourselves and you

1644
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:54,399
were talking about the influence it has

1645
01:11:52,119 --> 01:11:56,479
on our world today Chris and also how

1646
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:58,399
Shiva is some who is a caretaker of

1647
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:59,959
those people but those people are all

1648
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:02,319
people because every human being whether

1649
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:03,920
you identify as male or female have

1650
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:06,759
those components of that masculine

1651
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:10,480
feminine energy within them and this um

1652
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:14,719
this um form of of Shiva is

1653
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:16,319
Arash is uh kind of uh symbolizes that

1654
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:18,000
and one of the things that's happening

1655
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:20,198
um you know Alistar Curley talked about

1656
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,880
the ages of the eons the Eon of Isis the

1657
01:12:20,198 --> 01:12:24,839
matriarchal age the Eon of Osiris the

1658
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,880
patriarchal Age and what we're in now he

1659
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:29,000
would call the Eon of Horus the Eon of

1660
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,679
the child and the child was interesting

1661
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,319
Isis is very obviously feminine

1662
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:35,239
matriarchal Osiris was symbolic of um

1663
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:37,559
very masculine patriarchal and we're

1664
01:12:35,238 --> 01:12:39,359
still we're still moving out of that age

1665
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:41,280
of of Osiris and that that kind of

1666
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:43,198
speaks to that masculine influence you

1667
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:46,079
were talking about and in in some ways

1668
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:48,158
manifesting in intense toxic masculinity

1669
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:50,760
and and the solution to that isn't

1670
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:52,799
necessarily to erase masculinity or to

1671
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,880
to get rid of it it's actually to that

1672
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,639
blending and balancing with the feminine

1673
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,400
and what Horus represents and when

1674
01:12:56,639 --> 01:13:01,560
Crowley wrote about Horus he actually

1675
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:04,319
said um the defining feature of the Eon

1676
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:06,560
of Horus is this idea of both sexes in

1677
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:08,079
one person and a child is considered

1678
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,719
epicene they're not fully they haven't

1679
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:11,359
hit puberty so they're not fully male or

1680
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:13,279
female and that's this eon of the child

1681
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:14,399
and that kind of imagery and I think a

1682
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:16,319
lot of that I think Croley was

1683
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:17,559
influenced by a lot of these ideas on

1684
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:19,519
what what it means to blend the

1685
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,159
masculine and feminine and what that

1686
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,719
creates in a person's Consciousness

1687
01:13:21,158 --> 01:13:25,198
their view of the universe and

1688
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:29,760
understanding of self and others so I

1689
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:32,359
wanted to um there's a description of

1690
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,600
arish that I wanted to uh read off real

1691
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:37,399
fast it says talking about how the two

1692
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:39,280
Shiva Parvati combine each other you

1693
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:42,198
understand he has to accommodate her in

1694
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:44,639
his own body he has to shed half of

1695
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:47,319
himself so he shed half of himself and

1696
01:13:44,639 --> 01:13:50,880
included her this is the story of hard

1697
01:13:47,319 --> 01:13:52,519
Aran Shara this is basically trying to

1698
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,319
manifest that the masculine and The

1699
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:57,120
Feminine are equally divided within

1700
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:59,479
yourself when he included her he became

1701
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:01,319
ecstatic what is being said is that the

1702
01:13:59,479 --> 01:14:03,479
inter masculine and feminine meet you

1703
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:05,880
are in a Perpetual state of ecstasy you

1704
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:07,919
do it to try to do it on the outside and

1705
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,560
it never lasts and all troubles that

1706
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,840
come are that are an ongoing drama

1707
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:15,239
essentially it is not two people longing

1708
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:17,440
to meet it is two dimensions of Life

1709
01:14:15,238 --> 01:14:19,678
longing to meet outside as well as

1710
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:23,039
inside if you achieve it inside the

1711
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:25,319
outside will happen 100% by his choice

1712
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:26,960
if you do not achieve it inside the out

1713
01:14:25,319 --> 01:14:28,759
will be a terrible compulsion this is

1714
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,480
the way of life this is the reality

1715
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:33,400
which is being expressed in a beautiful

1716
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:35,718
dialectical form Shiva included her as a

1717
01:14:33,399 --> 01:14:38,319
part of himself and became half woman

1718
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:40,600
half man this is a symbolism to show

1719
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:42,799
that if you evolve in your ultimate

1720
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:46,600
context you will be half a man and half

1721
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:49,199
a woman not a neuter a full-fledged man

1722
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:51,159
and a full-fledged woman that is when

1723
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:53,119
you are a full-blown human being you are

1724
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:55,399
not skewed development you are not just

1725
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:57,880
masculine or feminine you have allowed

1726
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:59,920
both these things to grow masculine and

1727
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:01,719
feminine does not mean male and female

1728
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:03,560
the feminine and masculine are certain

1729
01:15:01,719 --> 01:15:05,719
qualities only these two qualities

1730
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:08,400
happen in Balance within can a human

1731
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:10,079
being live life of fulfillment so I

1732
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:11,839
thought that was an interesting um kind

1733
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:14,119
of perception of it I'm gonna move back

1734
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,319
to share my screen one more time for a

1735
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:17,960
few more Imes I think I got a few

1736
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:20,119
minutes right yep a few okay let me see

1737
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:22,520
if I can share this again real

1738
01:15:20,119 --> 01:15:25,960
fast um just to kind of talk about some

1739
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:29,840
of the Theology and that kind of

1740
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:33,520
think so I I pulled up a few charts um

1741
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:37,079
that kind of talk about this idea

1742
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,080
of I can zoom

1743
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:46,239
in peria and pro uh prti so perusia is

1744
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:48,000
the unmanifested formless passive Beyond

1745
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:50,559
attributes Beyond cause and effect space

1746
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,960
and time and so perusa is is is Shiva

1747
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:56,320
the pure existence and prui is um

1748
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:58,198
Parvati the you know his his Goddess

1749
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:59,759
that he combines with pakui is the

1750
01:15:58,198 --> 01:16:02,719
creative force of action the source of

1751
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,960
form manifestation attributes in nature

1752
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:08,359
and mahad is the cosmic intelligence or

1753
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:11,560
budy aamar is ego the sense of I am and

1754
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:13,920
then satva rajas and Thomas um come into

1755
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:17,520
manifestation and then Thomas breaks

1756
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:19,920
down into the topas of um you know earth

1757
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:21,480
air fire water and ether as well and

1758
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,560
it's this idea that everything forms

1759
01:16:21,479 --> 01:16:24,919
from the interaction of these two and

1760
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,719
these two are symbolized by that

1761
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:29,239
androgine concept of Shiva but I think

1762
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:32,560
what's interesting is we are meant to

1763
01:16:29,238 --> 01:16:34,198
incorporate that into ourselves um it's

1764
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,880
kind of like a model you know like

1765
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:37,678
looking at that form and reflecting on

1766
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,359
it meditating upon it synchronizing

1767
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:40,679
yourself with it how do you balance the

1768
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:42,519
masculine and feminine in yourself what

1769
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:44,480
does that even mean to you what is

1770
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,600
masculinity to you what is femininity to

1771
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:47,959
you how do these parts exist within you

1772
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,320
and how do you temper yourself to

1773
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:52,639
balance them and and radiate them and

1774
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:54,599
exude them and and live them so I wanted

1775
01:16:52,639 --> 01:16:56,840
to also kind of draw your attention to

1776
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:59,440
something interesting uh to me at least

1777
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,800
um the manifesto of of cley's Gnostic

1778
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:02,719
Catholic Church the whole point of the

1779
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,679
Gnostic masses you know I've had some

1780
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:06,198
history of politics over this because I

1781
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:07,600
used to be able to be a priestess and

1782
01:17:06,198 --> 01:17:08,799
Gnostic masses because when I read

1783
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,560
Crowley's works I said oh that's what

1784
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,000
I'm supposed to do you know I should be

1785
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,039
able to do any of these roles and they

1786
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,399
put a bunch of really silly gender

1787
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:17,039
restrictions on it they don't want me

1788
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:18,479
doing public masses as a priestess so of

1789
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:21,560
course I don't but anyway here's their

1790
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:24,359
Manifesto that um cley authorized in

1791
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:26,520
1944 kind of relates to this idea of the

1792
01:17:24,359 --> 01:17:29,359
ages the masculine feminine so the world

1793
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:31,080
has entered March 1904 the new Eon the

1794
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:33,319
age of the crowned and conquering child

1795
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:35,279
the predominance of the mother Eon ofis

1796
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:37,198
and the father Ian of Osiris are of the

1797
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:38,719
past many people have not fully

1798
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:40,638
completed those formula and they are

1799
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:42,319
still valid in their limited spheres but

1800
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:43,960
the Masters have decided that the time

1801
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:46,439
has come for the administration of the

1802
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:49,480
sacraments of the Eon of Horus to those

1803
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:52,079
capable of comprehension the Sexes are

1804
01:17:49,479 --> 01:17:55,119
equal and complimentary every man and

1805
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:58,039
every woman is a star the Priestess must

1806
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:59,960
Now function as well as the priest the

1807
01:17:58,039 --> 01:18:01,880
expression of the above thesis in public

1808
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:03,800
ritual is to begin by the establishment

1809
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,520
of the Gnostic Mass which while adhering

1810
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:07,239
to the vital elements of the most

1811
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,040
ancient and true tradition fixes his

1812
01:18:07,238 --> 01:18:13,039
attention on and aims most firmly in the

1813
01:18:10,039 --> 01:18:15,560
future and lastly I just wanted to read

1814
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:17,319
a quick quote if I can find it these are

1815
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,920
some things Crowley wrote In Magic Libra

1816
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:21,639
ABA book four God is above sex and

1817
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,199
therefore neither man nor woman as such

1818
01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:25,960
can be said fully to understand much

1819
01:18:24,198 --> 01:18:28,039
less represent present God it is

1820
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:30,039
therefore incumbent on the male magician

1821
01:18:28,039 --> 01:18:32,158
to cultivate those female virtues

1822
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:33,840
virtues in which he is deficient and

1823
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:35,119
this task he must of course accomplish

1824
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:37,239
without in any way impairing his

1825
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:39,198
virility it will then be lawful for a

1826
01:18:37,238 --> 01:18:41,319
magician to invoke Isis and identify

1827
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:43,119
himself with her if he fail to do this

1828
01:18:41,319 --> 01:18:45,279
his apprehension of the universe when he

1829
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:48,000
attains samadi will lack the conception

1830
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:50,920
of maternity and last quote before I

1831
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,760
just talk a bit about um discussion this

1832
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:55,600
constitutes a profound riddle of

1833
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:57,239
Holiness this is a comment on um

1834
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:59,760
one of the Holy books of the

1835
01:18:57,238 --> 01:19:01,839
Lima those only understand it who

1836
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,920
combine in themselves the extremes of

1837
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:06,520
moral idea identifying them through

1838
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,560
transcendental overcoming of the antomy

1839
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:10,679
they must have gone further yet beyond

1840
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,840
the fundamental opposition of the Sexes

1841
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:15,239
the male must have completed himself and

1842
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:18,039
become androgine the female and become

1843
01:19:15,238 --> 01:19:20,718
Gander this incompleteness imprisons the

1844
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:23,359
soul to think I am not woman but man or

1845
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:25,480
vice versa is to limit oneself to set a

1846
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:27,000
bar to one's motion it is the root of

1847
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:29,119
the shutting up which culminates in

1848
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,840
becoming a maryan violet or a black

1849
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:33,599
brother so let me HP off my screen

1850
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,400
sharing I just wanted to say um

1851
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,360
connecting this to the real world what's

1852
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:39,359
happening in the real world around lgbtq

1853
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:41,198
issues right now in the United States

1854
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:44,238
there are tons of bills in the states

1855
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:45,359
right now um on transgender athletes in

1856
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:47,039
high schools and things like that saying

1857
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:49,559
we don't want transgender girls

1858
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:51,238
competing in sports you know um we also

1859
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:53,320
you know it's not even that longer that

1860
01:19:51,238 --> 01:19:55,718
the united states legalized same-sex

1861
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:57,238
marriage like 2015 it hasn't even been

1862
01:19:55,719 --> 01:19:58,840
like what six years or something like

1863
01:19:57,238 --> 01:20:00,519
that but this progress is happening and

1864
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:02,679
to me that's kind of that current of the

1865
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:04,760
Eon of Horus that progress that's

1866
01:20:02,679 --> 01:20:06,800
happening that Spirit that's guiding the

1867
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:08,520
evolution and the acceptance of people

1868
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,000
and as we do that I think in order to

1869
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,360
have that acceptance where we're moving

1870
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,719
away from where we were historically you

1871
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:15,639
were talking about people it's true Joan

1872
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:17,359
of Arc why was she burned at the stake

1873
01:20:15,639 --> 01:20:18,960
because she broke gender Norms you know

1874
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:21,319
what I mean people if you break a

1875
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:24,039
[ __ ] gender Norm society's going to

1876
01:20:21,319 --> 01:20:26,639
come get your ass so for me breaking the

1877
01:20:24,039 --> 01:20:29,079
Priestess uh taboo over in in Crowley's

1878
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:30,719
Church they came after me I just got off

1879
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:33,439
bad report you know what I mean they

1880
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:35,279
they they were so pissed at me uh and

1881
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:37,198
why just because I said no I'm not g I

1882
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:39,679
said you guys this is how I understand

1883
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:41,119
my spirituality I know that you some

1884
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,520
some people understand me over there of

1885
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:43,920
course but the people that write the

1886
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,960
rule book said no you know we don't

1887
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:48,960
accept you sorry do what we say or get

1888
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:51,000
out um I think that what we're seeing

1889
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,880
the Eon of Horus that the idea of the

1890
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,639
child and the and both sexes of one it's

1891
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,400
incumbent on every person kind of how

1892
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,520
ear it's incumbent on every man to

1893
01:20:56,399 --> 01:20:59,879
invoke Isis identify with her we're

1894
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:02,440
talking you could we're talking about

1895
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:04,119
the same idea of balancing Shiva Parvati

1896
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:06,759
in that form that you can reflect on

1897
01:21:04,119 --> 01:21:08,399
with that andrine aspect um how do we

1898
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:10,480
bring that into ourselves because that's

1899
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:12,879
sort of that 93 current to me that that

1900
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:14,599
theic energy has a very androgynous

1901
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:17,600
bomatic Vibe the Gnostic mass is

1902
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:19,440
numbered Libra 15 and tarot card 15 is

1903
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,800
the devil card it's baffet who crowy

1904
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:23,399
called the androgine who is the

1905
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:25,000
hieroglyph of Arcane Perfection so to me

1906
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:27,279
I think it's incumbent on us to reflect

1907
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,238
upon what androgyny means what the

1908
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:31,359
balance of the male female forces mean

1909
01:21:29,238 --> 01:21:33,079
and and what what we can do with that

1910
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:35,198
power in our lives to help change the

1911
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:36,559
world but anyway um I'll wrap up thank

1912
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:38,158
you for the opportunity to talk

1913
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,560
hopefully it was uh was

1914
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:42,399
interesting absolutely thank you so much

1915
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,639
Richard you know and it's interesting

1916
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:46,198
you know you talked about Crowley saying

1917
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:48,679
we had to bring into balance the

1918
01:21:46,198 --> 01:21:51,359
masculine and The Feminine to achieve

1919
01:21:48,679 --> 01:21:55,239
some and what's interesting about that

1920
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:57,599
is is the very first time that aliser

1921
01:21:55,238 --> 01:22:00,000
Crowley achieved

1922
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,800
samade he was on

1923
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,840
hashish uh in 1904 It Was Written in his

1924
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,600
Diaries this wasn't known until after

1925
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:09,639
his death when his Diaries were revealed

1926
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:13,079
because Crowley feared that people would

1927
01:22:09,639 --> 01:22:15,800
reject is a demon of somati if they

1928
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:18,679
realized it came through drugs this is a

1929
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:21,440
very special drug it's very special drug

1930
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:23,480
that's full of female energy it's a very

1931
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:25,519
special drug that was recognized as the

1932
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:27,919
goddess the Tree of Life in the ancient

1933
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:31,679
world and it's here

1934
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:34,719
now to balance the out of control

1935
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:38,760
masculine energy it's here now to pour

1936
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:41,560
the bong on the Eternal lingum of us all

1937
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:44,800
all male energy you know and that's

1938
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:47,840
what Sacrament as well this is why this

1939
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,039
herb was so special to crley you know

1940
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,840
was because it you know his his

1941
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:55,039
psychology of hashish is all about the

1942
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:56,279
attainment of samade with God and

1943
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:59,000
practice you know what I mean it takes

1944
01:22:56,279 --> 01:23:00,439
more than just ganja was that easy we'd

1945
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,279
all be doing it there's got to be some

1946
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:07,198
intention in that as well you know and

1947
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:09,719
uh um you know it's I was going to talk

1948
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:12,198
a little bit about uh I recently wrote

1949
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:15,520
an article you can find online it's uh

1950
01:23:12,198 --> 01:23:18,719
the cannabis infused wine of

1951
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:20,480
dionisius when I was going over that one

1952
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:22,399
of the things I was really looking you

1953
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:25,039
know come across is I I've known about

1954
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:26,839
this connection between dius and sh

1955
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:29,238
because of other books but I never

1956
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:32,239
realized just how

1957
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:34,319
intense the connection between dius and

1958
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:37,599
shba was you know this like is a

1959
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:41,880
historical fact like it at 4 or 500 BC

1960
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:43,520
when Alexander went into India he saw

1961
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,679
people there worshippers of Shiva

1962
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:48,760
pressing the grape and making

1963
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:51,000
wine and he thought that he you know the

1964
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:53,239
Legends were that that dius had come

1965
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,679
from this place Nisa which was one of

1966
01:23:53,238 --> 01:23:57,000
the places they thought it was wasn't

1967
01:23:54,679 --> 01:24:00,719
Indian and in Alexander's mind when he

1968
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:04,560
came into India he stumbled on to the

1969
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:06,520
birthplace of Nisa and it's no lie that

1970
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,639
the devotees of

1971
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:11,560
Shiva and the devotees of

1972
01:24:09,639 --> 01:24:15,279
dionisius

1973
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:18,840
recognized this was the same deity this

1974
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:22,960
deity of ecstatic celebration this deity

1975
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:24,440
that you know accepted women power man

1976
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:29,000
you know that was a big part of the

1977
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:31,960
dionan revolutes right uh um and uh this

1978
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,198
is like not some fancy of of new authors

1979
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:36,639
like the 20th century like a down alow

1980
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:38,238
agent authors wrote about this

1981
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:40,679
Roman

1982
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:43,559
historians of that time period wrote

1983
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:45,920
about this connection of dionisius you

1984
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:49,719
know and and there's connections between

1985
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:52,158
dionisius and Yahweh as well ad donus

1986
01:24:49,719 --> 01:24:55,520
this is like there's coins

1987
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:58,399
minted with Yahweh and is becoming the

1988
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:00,520
same God basically right and it used to

1989
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:03,839
be quite an ecstatic religion at one

1990
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:06,520
time it's much much like Shiva religion

1991
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,639
you know in in that sense of that that

1992
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:12,880
ecstasy that that was based around you

1993
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:15,679
know and uh um yeah it's it's really

1994
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:18,480
really really really powerful stuff man

1995
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:20,399
and uh um has Swami joined us yet is he

1996
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:23,519
on board here

1997
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:26,439
or that oh I don't know it looks like a

1998
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:30,520
couple of people maybe have not made the

1999
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:33,039
technological leap to uh to get on here

2000
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:35,159
I was expecting a few other other

2001
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:38,719
speakers but we can all talk has anybody

2002
01:25:35,158 --> 01:25:38,719
got anything they want to say here

2003
01:25:40,039 --> 01:25:47,359
or in the in the Kashmir shavam

2004
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:51,279
tradition um the goal the goal is uh

2005
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:55,880
Sadi like yoga is somati right and so

2006
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:58,519
when we when we uh think of the the

2007
01:25:55,880 --> 01:26:01,600
culmination of yoga as being samadi and

2008
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:03,199
then samadi stabilizing we call it sesa

2009
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:06,119
we call it the absorption of Shiva so we

2010
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:07,759
become Shiva himself always and but we

2011
01:26:06,118 --> 01:26:10,000
can't get to that point unless we go

2012
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:12,000
first through shaki so it's like at the

2013
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,238
beginning we're Anu we're just an

2014
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,079
individual not connected to the

2015
01:26:13,238 --> 01:26:16,799
universal life force and then we go

2016
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:18,639
through Shak and she initiates us she

2017
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,520
connects us to the life force we have to

2018
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:23,600
let her in she is like the grand teacher

2019
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,679
and she and she runs us through tests

2020
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,679
she she like gives milk and we go from

2021
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:29,199
being a little kid to then growing up

2022
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:31,679
and then we integrate her and then when

2023
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:34,279
when we once we integrate her then we go

2024
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:36,679
into the Shambo mode not Shambo is like

2025
01:26:34,279 --> 01:26:38,519
the the full culmination of accepting

2026
01:26:36,679 --> 01:26:40,399
everything in totality see when you go

2027
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:42,280
into the highest mode you're just

2028
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:43,719
blissfully accepting everything because

2029
01:26:42,279 --> 01:26:45,399
everything is shui everything is just

2030
01:26:43,719 --> 01:26:47,000
pulsating with her and so there's

2031
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:50,638
nothing to do everything's already being

2032
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,679
done Shambo just enjoys his shaki always

2033
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:54,319
making love to his shaki his shaki is

2034
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:56,279
making love back to him I'm just just

2035
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:58,279
making love to her all the time and it's

2036
01:26:56,279 --> 01:27:01,158
just Blissful it's like pulsating

2037
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:04,198
wetness everywhere just the nosis is

2038
01:27:01,158 --> 01:27:06,198
persistent it's like all the time and

2039
01:27:04,198 --> 01:27:08,559
that is that is what we seek for is that

2040
01:27:06,198 --> 01:27:11,000
to is to always be sucking on that omrit

2041
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:13,080
to always have that wine being poured

2042
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,439
into the skull the skull Bowl to always

2043
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:16,800
be having him drinking the wine of the

2044
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:19,279
senses we should she is the senses she

2045
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:22,119
is the wine she is the Bliss she's all

2046
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:24,479
of it and so when we let her into us and

2047
01:27:22,118 --> 01:27:26,158
she allows us to become it we realiz

2048
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:28,919
shaki is the very self-reflective

2049
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:31,599
awareness we say in kism that the mind

2050
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:33,800
is shaki the awareness is shaki but

2051
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:36,880
Shiva is the the core of awareness so

2052
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:38,880
when we go I that's Shiva and we go M

2053
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:40,520
that's shaki I am and Shiva shaki

2054
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,679
together it's that constant

2055
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:45,119
self-awareness but the totality of all

2056
01:27:42,679 --> 01:27:49,039
being everywhere everywhere is happening

2057
01:27:45,118 --> 01:27:51,479

01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:42,880
of pranayama breathing techniques that

2100
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:45,359
we can use to really embody everything

2101
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:48,800
that we've talked about of understanding

2102
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:51,039
Shiva and honoring Shiva tonight um and

2103
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:54,600
also honoring our plant medicine the the

2104
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:56,600
cannabis plant medicine and um

2105
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:00,000
really finding that Divine balance with

2106
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:03,600
the Shiva and the shaki energy through

2107
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,198
also uh chanting and they say uh even in

2108
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:08,000
the Bible they say in the beginning was

2109
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:11,839
the word and so some say that word was

2110
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:13,880
oh which is really a vibration and so I

2111
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,079
like to keep a foot personally in each

2112
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:18,279
world of uh sort of being the bridge

2113
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:20,519
between the scientific world and the

2114
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:22,920
spiritual world and so when you think

2115
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:25,119
about vibration uh if you look at it

2116
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:27,279
from one angle it kind is like a cosine

2117
01:30:25,118 --> 01:30:30,279
graph right and so if you turn that

2118
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:32,759
towards you it it becomes something

2119
01:30:30,279 --> 01:30:34,359
physical uh in time and space if you're

2120
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,199
familiar with Organic Chemistry you

2121
01:30:34,359 --> 01:30:38,359
might call this a confirmation the way

2122
01:30:36,198 --> 01:30:40,719
that molecules arrange themselves in

2123
01:30:38,359 --> 01:30:42,198
time and space and so the vibration of

2124
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:45,279
sound when you look at it from a

2125
01:30:42,198 --> 01:30:47,678
different perspective it becomes matter

2126
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:51,359
it becomes light something we can see

2127
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:53,520
and obtain and so M was really all the

2128
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:56,839
vibration of the creation of the

2129
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:59,199
universe so a lot of um you were

2130
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:02,279
speaking tonight about the sense of

2131
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:06,559
creation sustenance and disillusion and

2132
01:31:02,279 --> 01:31:09,800
so when we sound oh it comes from our

2133
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:13,000
own self and our body so the o sound

2134
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:15,199
really emanates from our belly and so if

2135
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:18,118
you think about your belly your belly

2136
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:20,439
button your Naval that was everybody's

2137
01:31:18,118 --> 01:31:23,920
original life force right our umbilical

2138
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:28,279
cord is where we all began uh our sust

2139
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:31,118
sustenance our creation and so um the M

2140
01:31:28,279 --> 01:31:34,399
every inhalation and every exhalation

2141
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:37,479
should in theory begin and end with our

2142
01:31:34,399 --> 01:31:39,920
Naval Center so what I'd like to invite

2143
01:31:37,479 --> 01:31:44,198
all of us to do in this moment is just

2144
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:46,920
practice feeling in to that space to our

2145
01:31:44,198 --> 01:31:50,039
space of creation and if you're familiar

2146
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:53,158
with the chakras or the uh Spinning

2147
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:55,679
Wheel of energy our Naval Center would

2148
01:31:53,158 --> 01:31:59,238
be also called called our solar plexus

2149
01:31:55,679 --> 01:32:03,158
or manora and so that represents who you

2150
01:31:59,238 --> 01:32:04,599
are who yourself is and so um I forget

2151
01:32:03,158 --> 01:32:06,359
his name as he just had to leave but he

2152
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:08,639
was saying you know what is it that you

2153
01:32:06,359 --> 01:32:11,039
want on this planet and what is it that

2154
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:14,000
you literally need to get rid of and

2155
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:16,679
remove so you can make this space but

2156
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:20,520
tonight is such an auspicious night to

2157
01:32:16,679 --> 01:32:22,520
get so clear about that that why why are

2158
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:25,679
we on this planet and it really comes

2159
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:28,560
from the breath from the vou from The

2160
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:29,960
Prana that life force so if you um I'm

2161
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:33,360
going to sit over here so everybody can

2162
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:35,560
see me you can take your middle fingers

2163
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:39,279
and bring them right to your Naval

2164
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:41,679
Center and have them touch just sitting

2165
01:32:39,279 --> 01:32:44,800
naturally and as you find your

2166
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:47,679
inhalation let it begin at the belly and

2167
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:50,239
breathe in deeply fill your whole belly

2168
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:52,199
fill your pelvic bowl and breathe into

2169
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:55,238
your wholeness into your

2170
01:32:52,198 --> 01:32:58,238
fullness as we previous prly practice

2171
01:32:55,238 --> 01:33:01,759
breathe into the whole entire room let

2172
01:32:58,238 --> 01:33:05,118
your body take up the space around

2173
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:07,280
you hold at the top of the

2174
01:33:05,118 --> 01:33:09,799
inhalation and then with your lips

2175
01:33:07,279 --> 01:33:13,279
closed again the navl initiates the

2176
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:15,679
exhalation the out breath slowly let the

2177
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:18,519
breath Escape as you draw your belly

2178
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:19,399
button back behind your rib cage toward

2179
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:21,920
your

2180
01:33:19,399 --> 01:33:25,279
spine slowly letting the air come out

2181
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:25,279
through the nostrils

2182
01:33:26,679 --> 01:33:30,880
and once you feel like you can't breathe

2183
01:33:28,439 --> 01:33:32,559
out any further try to Exhale a

2184
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:35,319
millimeter deeper it's like you're doing

2185
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:38,400
a deep clean into all the crevasses of

2186
01:33:35,319 --> 01:33:41,920
your body like we're uh dusting the

2187
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:43,799
corners of our soul with our breath so

2188
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:46,679
let's try that again when you're ready

2189
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:49,000
take a big inhalation through the nose

2190
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:52,239
slowly breathe into your wholeness into

2191
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,238
your fullness

2192
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:59,920
and exhale completely releasing it out

2193
01:33:58,359 --> 01:34:02,759
and as you breathe out you might start

2194
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:05,600
to feel your fingers cross and pass over

2195
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:09,880
one another so really letting your hands

2196
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,880
feel this embodied space that you are

2197
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:16,359
creating you can let your eyes close if

2198
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,319
that feels comfortable to you and start

2199
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:23,359
to tap into and feel your own Rhythm

2200
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:23,359
through your very breath

2201
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,199
simply breathing

2202
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,719
in and peacefully breathing

2203
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:43,638
out and now I'm going

2204
01:34:40,118 --> 01:34:48,039
to offer a little prayer for us if you

2205
01:34:43,639 --> 01:34:49,520
have your ganja with you um I have a

2206
01:34:48,039 --> 01:34:52,679
little chilling pipe I'm going to be

2207
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:54,199
using tonight and I've also made some

2208
01:34:52,679 --> 01:34:56,840
bong I've been following going along

2211
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:03,840
could see has uh rose petals and

2212
01:35:01,079 --> 01:35:06,118
cardamom and fresh ganja I use the

2213
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:08,880
flowers so it's nice and strong

2214
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:08,880
definitely feeling

2215
01:35:09,399 --> 01:35:15,158
it and when we breathe when we work with

2216
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:18,118
the cannabis plant medicine we're

2217
01:35:15,158 --> 01:35:22,000
inviting in all of the elements here so

2218
01:35:18,118 --> 01:35:24,639
the Earth being the plants itself the

2219
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,760
element of Fire we're creating

2220
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:29,719
transformation and change so when you

2221
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:32,159
bring the fire to the flower we create

2222
01:35:29,719 --> 01:35:34,880
that transformation and change that

2223
01:35:32,158 --> 01:35:37,599
creates the smoke or the ethers so we're

2224

2230
01:35:55,118 --> 01:36:01,799
Mantra 108 times so let's take a moment

2231
01:35:59,079 --> 01:36:05,118
if you're joining along with us using a

2232
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:07,480
little hempwick to give a tribute to uh

2233
01:36:05,118 --> 01:36:09,479
smoking as clean as possible as we

2234
01:36:07,479 --> 01:36:12,638
always can eliminating the butane from

2235
01:36:09,479 --> 01:36:15,718
the lighter and I'm going to take a

2236
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:15,719
moment to say a

2237
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:23,118
prayer light the fire upon your flower

2238
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:23,118
breathe in deeply

2239
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:37,440
and exhale it out to the

2240
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,440
gods om

2241
01:36:39,158 --> 01:36:46,719
shank so now I invite everybody to join

2242
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:50,279
me for 108 rounds of

2243
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:53,039
omaya so if you're wondering why 108

2244
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:55,000
there's many different reasons why this

2245
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:57,840
number is so

2246
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:02,279
auspicious that one of which is the

2247
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:04,360
Sanskrit alphabet has 54 letters and

2248
01:37:02,279 --> 01:37:06,198
each letter is seen as having a

2249
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:10,319
masculine and a feminine or a Shiva and

2250
01:37:06,198 --> 01:37:12,039
a shaki aspect um and so if you do 54

2251
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:15,599
time 2 that equals

2252
01:37:12,039 --> 01:37:17,800
108 so giving homage to each of those uh

2253
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:20,360
letters within the Sanskrit alphabet

2254
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:23,239
also if you look at the number the

2255
01:37:20,359 --> 01:37:25,559
number one may represent God or the

2256
01:37:23,238 --> 01:37:29,718
creat creation or the wholeness uh the

2257
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:31,679
number zero is uh the the sustenance and

2258
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:34,319
then the number eight looks like an

2259
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:37,480
infinity sign that sense of infiniteness

2260
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:39,759
and so together we have the creation the

2261
01:37:37,479 --> 01:37:42,439
sustenance and the disillusion um

2262
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:45,159
there's many other aspects of 108 from

2263
01:37:42,439 --> 01:37:48,919
the astrological perspective of the

2264
01:37:45,158 --> 01:37:51,238
vetas when we look at AOA uh in the in

2265
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:53,800
the sky and seeing the way that we have

2266
01:37:51,238 --> 01:37:57,359
10 uh different houses and nine

2267
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:59,840
different plants planets uh sorry 12

2268
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:03,238
different houses times nine planets is

2269
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:05,639
108 and so when We Can chant you can

2270
01:38:03,238 --> 01:38:09,039
even do a th8 as well but I thought we'

2271
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:11,319
just offer 108 for today and some other

2272
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:14,039
interesting things so on a Mala if you

2273
01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:15,799
see people wearing these beads uh today

2274
01:38:14,039 --> 01:38:18,840
they often have a lot of aesthetic

2275
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:22,480
quality but they're really have a deep

2276
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:26,599
purpose the japamala is to uh first of

2277
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:31,678
all keep track of count um when we count

2278
01:38:26,599 --> 01:38:34,760
the uh mantras in a mantra man means

2279
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:38,000
mind and TR is across so we're going

2280
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:40,119
across the Mind our minds are always

2281
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,439
speaking to oursel or having this sense

2282
01:38:40,118 --> 01:38:45,359
of chitt what we call in Sanskrit is a

2283
01:38:42,439 --> 01:38:48,598
chatter sort of that selft talk that we

2284
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:52,519
hear and quite often the selft talk can

2285
01:38:48,599 --> 01:38:55,800
be very um negative towards oursel they

2286
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:58,360
say how we speak to oursel is worse than

2287
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:01,840
we might speak to anybody else so in

2288
01:38:58,359 --> 01:39:04,598
this moment I am inviting everybody to

2289
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:06,840
just release that and see if you can use

2290
01:39:04,599 --> 01:39:08,960
that Mantra to bring in a sense of

2291
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:11,880
loving kindness and the way that your

2292
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:17,639
mind can speak to yourself from here on

2293
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:21,239
out um and so when we go across our Mala

2294
01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:22,560
beads the japamala we'll use and if you

2295
01:39:21,238 --> 01:39:24,158
have the beads you're welcome to go

2296
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,840
along if you don't have them that's

2297
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:28,839
absolutely fine you can join in the

2298
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:32,599
Chant at any time and we'll use our

2299
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:34,960
thumb and our middle finger to press on

2300
01:39:32,599 --> 01:39:37,840
each bead this Center bead here is

2301
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:39,480
called the guru bead and and this bead

2302
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:42,000
we give great thanks and can bring to

2303
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:45,238
our third eye or ajna Shakra to give

2304
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:48,840
homage to our Guru to Lord Shiva tonight

2305
01:39:45,238 --> 01:39:51,598
and uh Guru is the one who removes the

2306
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:54,039
darkness so that we may see the light so

2307
01:39:51,599 --> 01:39:56,760
in doing this chant it's really a

2308
01:39:54,039 --> 01:39:59,920
discipline right it takes discipline to

2309
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:02,679
say something 108 times it takes a

2310
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:04,960
commitment to something and when you

2311
01:40:02,679 --> 01:40:07,760
think about commitment think about two

2312
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:10,399
molecules bonding together so we just

2313
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:12,800
inhal the ganja and now we're committing

2314
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:15,759
to her to working with her as our plant

2315
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:19,079
Ally and we're committing to Lord Shiva

2316
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:21,360
to the lord of the ganja the lord of the

2317
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:24,158
bong we're giving great thanks to the

2318
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:27,439
plants to the universe for our very

2319
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:30,559
existence so give your whole self over

2320
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:33,039
this is a service that we're giving and

2321
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:34,920
the more we put into it the more you'll

2322
01:40:33,039 --> 01:40:36,760
get out of it it's just the Law of

2323
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:38,679
Attraction whatever energy that you're

2324
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:41,119
creating whatever it is that you're

2325
01:40:38,679 --> 01:40:42,800
voicing and I know for myself I just

2326
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:45,639
want to mention the first time I ever

2327
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:48,119
tried chanting I'm not a singer I was

2328
01:40:45,639 --> 01:40:52,239
very quiet you'll probably hear tonight

2329
01:40:48,118 --> 01:40:53,799
but think about it as your heart's song

2330
01:40:52,238 --> 01:40:56,678
doesn't matter what you say sound like

2331
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:59,199
it's not about being in a right tune um

2332
01:40:56,679 --> 01:41:02,800
but it's more just about letting your

2333
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:05,598
voice be heard let the gods all of the

2334
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:09,199
Divine your ancestors know that you are

2335
01:41:05,599 --> 01:41:11,599
here the theer the more from our heart

2336
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:14,559
the Baki is from that heart center the

2337
01:41:11,599 --> 01:41:18,360
more we can sing there that the more our

2338
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:20,239
prayers will be heard and answered so um

2339
01:41:18,359 --> 01:41:21,839
we'll begin together let's take a deep

2340
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:24,319
breath in through the nose and out

2341
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:27,239
through the no mouth just clean in the

2342
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:30,799
channel

2343
01:41:27,238 --> 01:41:30,799
inhale and

2344
01:41:31,158 --> 01:41:36,519
exhale we'll be chanting

2345
01:41:34,279 --> 01:41:40,880
Omama

2346
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:40,880

2347

so well thank you uh for inviting me on

2480
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:12,000
to shivaratri is quite an honor to be a

2481
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:14,719
guest here and uh yeah and the OM namash

2482
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:18,639
chant of course is H one that we always

2483
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:18,639
chant there's other ones too

2484
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:28,840
harash one of my favorite ones for uh

2485
01:47:25,079 --> 01:47:32,000
doing a Chillum or smoking ganja is uh

2486
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:32,000
you take the joy and you

2487
01:47:33,319 --> 01:47:38,479
say and behold the wonders of the world

2488
01:47:36,039 --> 01:47:40,719
revealed through the Cannabis and so

2489
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:43,959
it's a way of seeing the world as a

2490
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:47,480
magical illusion uh and taking it to the

2491
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:50,520
to the higher level that way so um

2492
01:47:47,479 --> 01:47:53,559
anyway it's uh what to say about

2493
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:56,159
shivaratri the idea that this energy is

2494
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:59,159
thou uh walking the Earth and being

2495
01:47:56,158 --> 01:48:02,000
amongst us uh that is you know

2496
01:47:59,158 --> 01:48:05,399
celebrated uh she was different uh

2497
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:10,238
incarnations or manifestations of Shiva

2498
01:48:05,399 --> 01:48:12,879
where um Shiva will just show up to you

2499
01:48:10,238 --> 01:48:14,319
at a certain place sometimes you'll look

2500
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,319
up and you'll see that little sickle

2501
01:48:14,319 --> 01:48:19,920
Moon up in the sky that little sickle

2502
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:22,238
Moon you say oh that's a sign from shua

2503
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:24,520
right or something else will grab your

2504
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:26,559
attention you realize that oh that's

2505
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:29,199
that's a message from Shiva maybe you

2506
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:30,920
see a beggar on the street or something

2507
01:48:29,198 --> 01:48:33,399
like that and there's like all of a

2508
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:35,639
sudden there's a little zap in between

2509
01:48:33,399 --> 01:48:38,920
you say oh oh that that was like that

2510
01:48:35,639 --> 01:48:41,118
was a little shaki from from Sha and

2511
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:47,760
that's the way that sha operates in the

2512
01:48:41,118 --> 01:48:50,439
world in his form as being in the

2513
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:53,280
present now he has a form of Shiva as

2514
01:48:50,439 --> 01:48:55,759
the aora Shiva who is on the burning

2515
01:48:53,279 --> 01:48:57,158
gods and infecting and being involved in

2516
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:59,520
that sort of transformation where you

2517
01:48:57,158 --> 01:49:01,719
cross over to the other side as the Lord

2518
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:04,080
Of Destruction there but the liberation

2519
01:49:01,719 --> 01:49:06,198
of the Soul through that right then he

2520
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:08,399
has this manifestation as a lingum and

2521
01:49:06,198 --> 01:49:11,519
normally on shivaratri we're pouring

2522
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:13,839
over honey and milk and melted butter

2523
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:17,239
and ghee and all these things over the

2524
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:19,400
shivaling uh that is then uh our worship

2525
01:49:17,238 --> 01:49:21,519
ceremony where you know we can go on for

2526
01:49:19,399 --> 01:49:25,000
hours and hours pouring these Libations

2527
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:27,840
over uh and then uh there's the form of

2528
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,319
sha that is beyond the expansion of the

2529
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:33,279
universe that just the very conception

2530
01:49:30,319 --> 01:49:35,639
of it doesn't even put borders on on the

2531
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:37,840
on the universe and all its multi-

2532
01:49:35,639 --> 01:49:40,520
universes uh through the time of

2533
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:43,119
creation and dissolution and the

2534
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:46,880
maintaining uh so that's sha and then

2535
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:48,920
Shiva does have a a wrathful form uh

2536
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,880
that you know is breathing fire and so

2537
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:53,199
on that's sometimes called rudra and

2538
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:55,440
then of course uh

2539
01:49:53,198 --> 01:49:59,118
Nikki just reminded me my favorite form

2540
01:49:55,439 --> 01:50:02,598
of Shiva is shaj where he's

2541
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:07,679
dancing and in the dancing uh he is then

2542
01:50:02,599 --> 01:50:11,319
creating the universe through the uh EXO

2543
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:13,920
Tanda which is the thou the 108 dances

2544
01:50:11,319 --> 01:50:16,439
uh that Shiva positions that he does in

2545
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:18,118
order to create the universe and that

2546
01:50:16,439 --> 01:50:22,319
you know we celebrate that same with the

2547
01:50:18,118 --> 01:50:26,279
108 repetitions of of the uh uh punch

2548
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:29,319
Dasa this five syllable Mantra of Shiva

2549
01:50:26,279 --> 01:50:31,399
and so Shiva is the the center and then

2550
01:50:29,319 --> 01:50:34,519
um when we think about the

2551
01:50:31,399 --> 01:50:37,559
chakras right in the muladar chakra at

2552
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:41,280
the base of the spine in that little

2553
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:44,480
triangle uh there is a sh lingum there

2554
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:46,399
and that is then you know how we focus

2555
01:50:44,479 --> 01:50:49,039
the energy in the lower chakras and

2556
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:51,960
bring them up and transform them uh

2557
01:50:49,039 --> 01:50:55,039
there's another Lig in the heart chakra

2558
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:58,960
and uh another lium in the third eye

2559
01:50:55,039 --> 01:51:01,359
chakra and that's how the energy Supreme

2560
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:04,719
and the third eye chakra is like that J

2561
01:51:01,359 --> 01:51:06,960
lingum the lingum of light uh that is

2562
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:09,599
that is absorbing all the energy of the

2563
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:12,679
universe and radiating it back out to be

2564
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:14,800
shared uh with anyone who uh it tunes

2565
01:51:12,679 --> 01:51:17,078
into that and even actually those who

2566
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:20,039
don't tune into it share in the energy

2567
01:51:17,078 --> 01:51:23,238
so that's all the forms of Shiva as a

2568
01:51:20,039 --> 01:51:26,639
beggar and as a yogi uh and then one of

2569
01:51:23,238 --> 01:51:29,919
the great forms of Shiva is with Shiva

2570
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:34,039
Parvati as the and just as I say Shiva

2571
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:39,078
Parvati who comes in but my

2572
01:51:34,039 --> 01:51:43,399
poty is her is her Sanskrit name H and

2573
01:51:39,078 --> 01:51:46,559
she is my consort and beloved and Shea

2574
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:49,359
parti and uh there's a certain place

2575
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:52,679
where Shiva Parvati joined in a space

2576
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:55,799
above the third eye uh the Shiva Shakti

2577
01:51:52,679 --> 01:51:58,279
kolini rising and joins there so you go

2578
01:51:55,800 --> 01:52:01,719
beyond the The Duality of male and

2579
01:51:58,279 --> 01:52:05,078
female in that this is called the kakala

2580
01:52:01,719 --> 01:52:08,960
chakra and in another triangle uh there

2581
01:52:05,078 --> 01:52:13,399
is the Sia and parti there United in the

2582
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:17,198
Bliss uh Beyond any time or space and so

2583
01:52:13,399 --> 01:52:20,679
uh we we use this the lingum as a way to

2584
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:23,519
symbolize the essence of the energy

2585
01:52:20,679 --> 01:52:26,000
without a physical form the lingum is

2586
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:28,920
actually a representation of a

2587
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,880
non-physical thing with a physical thing

2588
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:33,118
and the lingum is the simplest physical

2589
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:35,800
thing as a source of energy and then we

2590
01:52:33,118 --> 01:52:39,559
must always remember that the lingum is

2591
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:41,320
embedded in a Yoni all right and lingan

2592
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:42,520
is embedded in a Yoni and that is part

2593
01:52:41,319 --> 01:52:45,719
of the Sha

2594
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:47,599
Shakti and that sha without shaki yes

2595
01:52:45,719 --> 01:52:51,639
there you are thank you Chris sha

2596
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:53,960
without shaki has no power and so um

2597
01:52:51,639 --> 01:52:56,599
just okay occurred to me that we did

2598
01:52:53,960 --> 01:53:00,560
omash but there's a variation that my

2599
01:52:56,599 --> 01:53:02,679
teacher in India andiri gave me of the

2600
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:04,719
Sha Mantra and it includes the feminine

2601
01:53:02,679 --> 01:53:07,199
the Shakti and I think one of the great

2602
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:09,000
things about this day and age is that so

2603
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:11,759
much of the religion has been masculine

2604
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,840
dominated to worship the goddess and to

2605
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:16,000
worship the goddess equal with with the

2606
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:18,159
God is one of those things that our

2607
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,920
modern day wants to wants to bring

2608
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:24,439
forward so there's a form of uh this was

2609
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:24,440
given to me by Chand

2610
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:31,719
om so we put the

2611
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:35,198
syllable after OM and is the there the

2612
01:53:31,719 --> 01:53:37,359
syllable of the Bea Mantra of all the

2613
01:53:35,198 --> 01:53:40,439
goddesses taken together but

2614
01:53:37,359 --> 01:53:45,479
particularly it's the be Mantra of

2615
01:53:40,439 --> 01:53:45,479
banwari the goddess of the earth and

2616
01:53:46,078 --> 01:53:51,198
also the goddess who is the the all

2617
01:53:49,479 --> 01:53:53,598
embodiment of all the threeness of the

2618
01:53:51,198 --> 01:53:57,359
universe so when we

2619
01:53:53,599 --> 01:54:00,960
say is like om for the manifested world

2620
01:53:57,359 --> 01:54:04,118
the manifested universe om includes all

2621
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:05,840
the unmanifest and the Manifest and is

2622
01:54:04,118 --> 01:54:08,598
where we bring it down through the

2623
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:12,440
creativity of the feminine so we just do

2624
01:54:08,599 --> 01:54:14,639
a few uh of these omash since we we

2625
01:54:12,439 --> 01:54:18,559
start I came on when you were doing om

2626
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:21,159
namash so we we then incorporate the the

2627
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:23,880
divine feminine into this and so we'll

2628
01:54:21,158 --> 01:54:27,000
just do that for just a few minutes and

2629
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:29,000
we'll go so om

2630
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,158
om

2631
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,238
om

2632
01:54:31,158 --> 01:54:35,198
om

2633
01:54:33,238 --> 01:54:37,078
om

2634
01:54:35,198 --> 01:54:38,960
om

2635
01:54:37,078 --> 01:54:41,960
om

2636
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:41,960
om

2637
01:54:43,119 --> 01:54:48,920
[Music]

2638
01:54:45,158 --> 01:54:52,879
om so you can carry that on as

2639
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:55,679
108 and there's a way also to do uh

2640
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:58,159
japa as it's called there's there's

2641
01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:01,599
three forms of japa the one is the out

2642
01:54:58,158 --> 01:55:03,799
loud the viatti form of japa and that is

2643
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:07,239
great to do in a group and then there's

2644
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:09,719
a whispered form of the japa which is

2645
01:55:07,238 --> 01:55:12,519
Mia form of japa and then there's a

2646
01:55:09,719 --> 01:55:15,920
silent form of japa and the silent form

2647
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:19,560
of japa is one that you can carry on

2648
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:22,920
continuously that you it's sort of this

2649
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:25,079
base like a tamburri base note

2650
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:27,880
underneath whatever else you're doing

2651
01:55:25,078 --> 01:55:27,880
and so it just

2652
01:55:28,078 --> 01:55:31,859
becomes and you speed up the Rhythm so

2653
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:33,118
it's

2654
01:55:31,859 --> 01:55:35,880
[Music]

2655
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:38,039
like so you're creating this Rhythm and

2656
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:40,599
this and this kind of torque within

2657
01:55:38,039 --> 01:55:42,840
yourself with the Mantra and what

2658
01:55:40,599 --> 01:55:47,239
happens is as through the Mantra your

2659
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:49,440
bones start to vibrate with that tone

2660
01:55:47,238 --> 01:55:51,638
and eventually all the molecules in your

2661
01:55:49,439 --> 01:55:53,118
body vibrate with that tone and that

2662
01:55:51,639 --> 01:55:54,000
tone

2663
01:55:53,118 --> 01:55:57,880
that

2664
01:55:54,000 --> 01:56:02,238
sound is the Divine you are invoking the

2665
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:05,440
Mantra is the Divine the yantra is the

2666
01:56:02,238 --> 01:56:09,078
place for it to manifest and that's

2667
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:11,879
Tantra so uh anyway can I just say a

2668
01:56:09,078 --> 01:56:13,920
couple things I'd like to add which is

2669
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:17,118
um and I know this from personal

2670
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:20,199
experience because and it does work if

2671
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:23,839
you say om namash Shaya with full pure

2672
01:56:20,198 --> 01:56:28,158
intention a 100,000 times

2673
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:30,119
times expect big changes in your life it

2674
01:56:28,158 --> 01:56:32,839
absolutely it's because Shiva is the god

2675
01:56:30,118 --> 01:56:34,960
of transformation so when you recite

2676
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:37,039
that Mantra 100 thousand times and it

2677
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,520
doesn't have to be all on the same day

2678
01:56:37,039 --> 01:56:41,039
you know it's just when you've done it a

2679
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:43,040
100,000 times with pure intention you

2680
01:56:41,039 --> 01:56:45,158
will have transformation and the other

2681
01:56:43,039 --> 01:56:47,399
thing I wanted to say is that right now

2682
01:56:45,158 --> 01:56:50,920
as some of you probably know the um

2683
01:56:47,399 --> 01:56:53,000
Kumba is happening in hardar in utan

2684
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:55,199
state of India up on the Ganga

2685
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,840
and tonight there'll be well probably

2686
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:59,559

2687
01:56:56,840 --> 01:57:01,920

2688
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:03,639

01:57:03,639 --> 01:57:08,039

2691
01:57:06,039 --> 01:57:11,039
tonight will be a very special time in

2692
01:57:08,039 --> 01:57:13,399
India as literally millions and millions

2693
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:15,679

2694

from that direction on our globe tonight

2698
01:57:22,359 --> 01:57:26,880
is some lots of higher Consciousness

2699
01:57:24,439 --> 01:57:30,279
yeah and whenever we chant home and do

2700
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:32,560
those mantras our psyche our mind mental

2701
01:57:30,279 --> 01:57:34,719
patterns join those of all those people

2702
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:36,800
doing that not only in India but all

2703
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:39,118
around the world that's the great thing

2704
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:41,880
about chanting M just by itself is when

2705
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:44,679
you chant home you join the chorus of

2706
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:46,400
the syllable Bea Mantra of the universe

2707
01:57:44,679 --> 01:57:48,158
which has been chanted since time in

2708
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:50,879
Memorial will chant in time into the

2709
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:52,638
future and we become part of that wave

2710
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:55,800

about there's like Nikki mentioned the

2734
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:51,599
Kumba and that's when millions and

2735
01:58:49,399 --> 01:58:53,839
millions of people go try and be and be

2736
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:56,800
in the same place on the edges of the of

2737
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:58,679
the ganis right the ganga but shiv rri

2738
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:01,679
is completely different everyone goes to

2739
01:58:58,679 --> 01:59:04,039
their local Shiva Temple and so what

2740
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:06,279
we're doing here is your local little

2741
01:59:04,039 --> 01:59:09,399
Shiva Temple and that's what it is all

2742
01:59:06,279 --> 01:59:11,439
around every Shiva Temple tonight and

2743
01:59:09,399 --> 01:59:13,039
over the night every single one of them

2744
01:59:11,439 --> 01:59:15,638
has a celebration it's not like

2745
01:59:13,039 --> 01:59:18,118
everybody goes one place it's every one

2746
01:59:15,639 --> 01:59:20,039
goes to their place and that's why it

2747
01:59:18,118 --> 01:59:21,839
has that extra energy that it's your

2748
01:59:20,039 --> 01:59:24,118
neighbors and your friends and people

2749
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:25,880
who been worshiping at that Temple for

2750
01:59:24,118 --> 01:59:28,439
such a long time and there's a whole

2751
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:30,560
myth about how sheiva you know all these

2752
01:59:28,439 --> 01:59:33,479
millions of temples happened all over

2753
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:35,480
it's part of this the Hindu mythology so

2754
01:59:33,479 --> 01:59:38,718
yeah we're doing the thing in the right

2755
01:59:35,479 --> 01:59:40,959
way I like to think that in the caluga

2756
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:43,679
that you know the Iron Age the age of

2757
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:46,118
you know materiality and physicalness

2758
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:49,719
that an aspect of spirituality has taken

2759
01:59:46,118 --> 01:59:53,559
on the physical form of ganja and a

2760
01:59:49,719 --> 01:59:57,000
medicine that we take body born of Shiva

2761
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:59,280
from shiva's own body and I think that's

2762
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,599
a really powerful way to take the

2763
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:03,960
medicine you know all of its intent the

2764
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:05,719
difference between a sadu and India who

2765
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:08,198
sits down with his chilling before he

2766
02:00:05,719 --> 02:00:10,880
sits down to do his a Sonic Sonic

2767
02:00:08,198 --> 02:00:13,919
practices and some kid that's you know

2768
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:16,118
about to smoke a blunt and play uh um

2769
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:19,279
some video game is an

2770
02:00:16,118 --> 02:00:22,399
intention and it's all in how you see

2771
02:00:19,279 --> 02:00:25,158
this herb and how you visualize it and

2772
02:00:22,399 --> 02:00:27,519
what you put into that and take back in

2773
02:00:25,158 --> 02:00:30,238
with it you know and I think on this the

2774
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:32,440
final third shellum you know of of the

2775
02:00:30,238 --> 02:00:36,799

adding uh thanks for adding that in

2788
02:01:09,118 --> 02:01:13,679
about how powerful the mantras are um I

2789
02:01:12,439 --> 02:01:16,000
actually had a really powerful

2790
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:19,800
experience a couple years back with

2791
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:23,279
Mantra beads and um I had no

2792
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:25,760
idea um what that would open up I was

2793
02:01:23,279 --> 02:01:28,198
actually had such a deep experience that

2794
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:30,159
my whole yoga mat was completely

2795
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:33,359
drenched in tears like I'm talking like

2796
02:01:30,158 --> 02:01:36,118
a puddle that of just like an explosion

2797
02:01:33,359 --> 02:01:39,319
of tears that came running out of my

2798
02:01:36,118 --> 02:01:41,078
eyes and it really blasted me open and

2799
02:01:39,319 --> 02:01:43,118
it actually like was really scary

2800
02:01:41,078 --> 02:01:46,559
looking back at it was it really shook

2801
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:48,598
me up and I didn't know if I was having

2802
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:50,280
a mental breakdown or what what was

2803
02:01:48,599 --> 02:01:53,078
going to be happening and it was it was

2804
02:01:50,279 --> 02:01:54,679
very intense so um um you're right like

2805
02:01:53,078 --> 02:01:57,439
they are very powerful and I think it's

2806
02:01:54,679 --> 02:02:00,319
very important that we have tools to

2807
02:01:57,439 --> 02:02:03,559
work with because the times are really

2808
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:06,238
intense and um the times are really

2809
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:07,880
intense and we need tools right now and

2810
02:02:06,238 --> 02:02:09,598
uh just like Rachel was talking about

2811
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:11,760
with the chitter chatter and Rachel

2812

2816
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:24,238
what you talked about with M yeah that's

2817
02:02:22,319 --> 02:02:26,198
um something as well too I think um and

2818
02:02:24,238 --> 02:02:29,118
the breathing um these are really

2819
02:02:26,198 --> 02:02:32,439
important things that we have that are

2820
02:02:29,118 --> 02:02:35,078
free that we can use and access at any

2821
02:02:32,439 --> 02:02:38,198
time and um we just need to create the

2822
02:02:35,078 --> 02:02:40,559
space for it and as the feminine I think

2823
02:02:38,198 --> 02:02:43,118
you know um setting up that space and

2824
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:46,320
that time and the right setting and um

2825
02:02:43,118 --> 02:02:50,799
using these plants these medicines um

2826
02:02:46,319 --> 02:02:53,158
with uh a way of you know for self self

2827
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:56,159
awareness and the more that we become

2828
02:02:53,158 --> 02:02:58,078
more self-aware we can become uh things

2829
02:02:56,158 --> 02:03:00,359
around us become better you know it's

2830
02:02:58,078 --> 02:03:03,158
like walking in our truth and walking in

2831
02:03:00,359 --> 02:03:05,519
our um leading of especially I think for

2832
02:03:03,158 --> 02:03:07,078
the feminine the beauty that comes out

2833
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:10,520
that's kind of been lost in our world

2834
02:03:07,078 --> 02:03:12,439
it's been very masculinized and um

2835
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:15,199
remembering that beauty I think is going

2836
02:03:12,439 --> 02:03:16,919
to be another important aspect to us um

2837
02:03:15,198 --> 02:03:20,000
going forward because I think our

2838
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:22,359
society's forgotten the beauty so and

2839
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,279
when I say beauty I'm talking like

2840
02:03:22,359 --> 02:03:27,078
it's everywhere it's just we've

2841
02:03:24,279 --> 02:03:30,399
forgotten to look for it so those are my

2842
02:03:27,078 --> 02:03:30,399
words thank you

2843

um I listened to the entire thing and

2853
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:58,679

2854
02:03:56,760 --> 02:04:01,760
great all the PE I had no doubt that you

2855

2856

thank you all I know that the uh more

2857
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:08,480
than 200 people that have been watching

2858
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:11,760
have been uh enjoying

2859
02:04:08,479 --> 02:04:14,158
it can I say one more thing if we have

2860
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:15,760
time yeah absolutely so uh we talked

2861
02:04:14,158 --> 02:04:18,000
about mantras right so I want to talk

2862
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:20,880
about the secret Mantra of Kashmir

2863
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,599
shavis and we you know you were talking

2864
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:24,279
about all the different forms of Shiva

2865
02:04:22,599 --> 02:04:26,520
well there is a tricky form of Shiva

2866
02:04:24,279 --> 02:04:29,158
which there's a school of of shavis that

2867
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:31,000
we call Tria and that's appeals to the

2868
02:04:29,158 --> 02:04:33,319
tricky part of us right so if you're

2869
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:34,599
think if you think you're clever if you

2870
02:04:33,319 --> 02:04:36,558
think you're cunning if you think you're

2871
02:04:34,599 --> 02:04:37,639
a tricky person well you're going to

2872
02:04:36,559 --> 02:04:39,719
understand what I'm going to say and

2873
02:04:37,639 --> 02:04:41,359
what we're saying is that every time you

2874
02:04:39,719 --> 02:04:42,599
breathe you're reciting the Mantra every

2875
02:04:41,359 --> 02:04:44,359
time you take a breath you're reciting

2876
02:04:42,599 --> 02:04:47,800
the Mantra so if

2877
02:04:44,359 --> 02:04:49,118
you become aware of this and you realize

2878
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:51,800
that you're you're reciting the Mantra

2879
02:04:49,118 --> 02:04:54,078
48,000 times a day so if you become

2880
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:56,039
aware that you're always reciting the

2881
02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:57,399
Mantra you're doing japa all the time

2882
02:04:56,039 --> 02:05:01,319
you're doing it all the time and that's

2883
02:04:57,399 --> 02:05:04,479
the trick Swami G used to say you know

2884
02:05:01,319 --> 02:05:07,319
was that was that my my master

2885
02:05:04,479 --> 02:05:09,919
kush oh bubble man doesn't know he's

2886
02:05:07,319 --> 02:05:12,319
being on there sorry

2887
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,800
guys so if you're if you're a trickster

2888
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:15,118
and that that appeals to your mind and

2889
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:16,760
you think you can crack the trick and

2890
02:05:15,118 --> 02:05:19,238
you can always remember this trick then

2891
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:22,960
you're doing japa all the

2892
02:05:19,238 --> 02:05:25,759
time it's all the intention

2893
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:28,198
that japa is soam

2894
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:31,760
ham that's that's the syllable of it

2895
02:05:28,198 --> 02:05:34,439
soam ham and as you breathe in that's

2896
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:38,000
what it sounds like if you listen to it

2897
02:05:34,439 --> 02:05:41,359
and and the other thing is hamsa is is a

2898
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:44,559
Sanskrit word meaning the swan right and

2899
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:46,880
the swan has all sorts of uh beautiful

2900
02:05:44,559 --> 02:05:48,599
connotation symbolically you know we

2901
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:52,239
know as the ugly ducking becomes the

2902
02:05:48,599 --> 02:05:54,159
swan but the swan is also uh the swan is

2903
02:05:52,238 --> 02:05:56,919
supposed to be able to take milk that's

2904
02:05:54,158 --> 02:06:00,039
dissolved into water and just drink the

2905
02:05:56,920 --> 02:06:02,599
milk from it so it's it's it's quality

2906
02:06:00,039 --> 02:06:05,359
of discernment of being able to detect

2907
02:06:02,599 --> 02:06:07,760
the truth in the midst of of the

2908
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:10,198
falseness right and so that that that's

2909
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:12,400
hum and if you as you say if you breathe

2910
02:06:10,198 --> 02:06:14,839
that Mantra silently all day long but

2911
02:06:12,399 --> 02:06:17,359
are you conscious of it are you aware of

2912
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:19,599
living it that way uh then you ride on

2913
02:06:17,359 --> 02:06:19,598
that

2914
02:06:20,039 --> 02:06:24,439
wave I would connect that mystery to the

2915
02:06:22,559 --> 02:06:26,480
mystery of Jesus walking on water see

2916
02:06:24,439 --> 02:06:28,279
that the the swan also goes into the

2917
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:29,598
water but he's never like he comes out

2918
02:06:28,279 --> 02:06:31,719
of the water and he's fine he's like I'm

2919
02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:33,599
not wet bro I'm I'm okay I was in the

2920
02:06:31,719 --> 02:06:35,158
water but I'm out of it now I'm the

2921
02:06:33,599 --> 02:06:37,520
world doesn't even touch me I walk on it

2922
02:06:35,158 --> 02:06:40,839

02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:44,079
do yeah yeah and and actually speaking

2924
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:45,719
