some work there and they're coming in to

31
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:44,159
talk about land races and a bunch of

32
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:45,599
other fun stuff so should be uh good to

33

00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:15,119
University of Mississippi to get the

44
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:17,318
information on how to test cannabis and

45
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,480
uh they told me of course to in so many

46
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:24,439
words to um get lost and I contacted you

what kind of conversations are you

83
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,359

84
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,360
you know just because I I like to have

85
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,720
an idea when when someone new is coming

86
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,200
on that uh we figure out what kind of

87
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,120
conversations we're having and he hits

88
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:07,359
me up with well you know there's four

89
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,640
areas I'm interested in um land race

90
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,879
strains collected from isolated regions

91
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,039
chemical profiles ratios observed in

92
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:15,959
specific region regions and theories

93
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,439
behind either biodiversity or selections

94
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,478
of traits done by local cultivars

95
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,439
morphology and traits of Interest

96
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,918
pathogen environmental resistance

97
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,079
observed from various regions and then

98
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:29,079
breeding development of new F1 lines

99
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:31,719
from inbred land race heirlooms true

100
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:33,839
breeding hyd hybrid lines selection from

101
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,800
environmental pressure and stress tests

102
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,918
the pharmacology research on major

103
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:43,639
cannabinoids potential therapeutic use

104
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:45,279
other than THC I.E CBD CBG cbdv Etc uh

105
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,079
potential isolated compounds from

106
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,799
cannabis for future medical use and then

107
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,719
organic cultivation yeah no no it's not

108
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,720
it's not actually all Dr Ethan Russo

109
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,360
then he goes into organic cultivation no

110
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,639
till soil sustainability operating costs

111
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,800
cover crops pest manag via mineral

112
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,038
content in soil and beneficial insects

113
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,478
and sub irrigation benefits versus top

114
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:11,240
water sounds like he a show of his song

115
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,279

the room right now as well uh who's a

119
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,839
PhD researcher that he mentioned is

120
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,360
involved with genetics and biodiversity

121
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:27,079
at UBC and he's also interested in

122
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,439
chatting about genetics in depth uh so

123
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:31,680
welcome Chris good timing there dude you

124

129
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:48,800
going to be a doozy uh everyone's early

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,680
welcome Dr Mark shalone into the room we

131
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,079
got some Heavy Hitters in the room today

132
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,600
I like it man I like it I'm all about uh

133
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:58,240
promoting incredible dialogue that's

134
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,840
what hash church has always been about

135
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,960
uh pretty loose in the the sense but uh

136
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,198
you know we've got Dr Ethan Russo here

137
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,279
to begin with so I was figuring we would

138
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,038
start with with him and kind of let him

139
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,799
get into some of what he wants to talk

140
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,478
about Ethan uh clearly doesn't need uh

141
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,120
an introduction but I'll give him one

142
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,399
anyway it's just an awesome awesome guy

143
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,478
has always been so humble and kind and

144
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,079
helpful and facilitating and uh it's

145
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,639
just nice to have you here do Ethan

146
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:29,120
Russo so uh yeah let's get right into it

147
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,759
man what uh I I believe one of the first

148
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,478
topics you had mentioned was cbga THC

149
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:40,199
and lemon for anxiety did I get that

150
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:42,079
right yeah CBG so canab gereral anyway

151
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,439
it's a pleasure to be here on what I

152
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,519
call Ash Temple at least during my

153
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,918
appearances um but yeah you know we've

154
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:54,120
had uh two Publications this year the

155
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,519
first one that came out was uh with

156
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,319
Folks at John's

157
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,318
Hopkins um we've been trying for a long

158
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:05,360
time time

159
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,960
to do what I call a a deconstruction

160
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,960
reconstruction of cannabis components to

161
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:15,799
try and show Synergy so the idea was to

162
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:20,598
follow up on experiments that um Dave

163
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:23,840
Watson and I did more than 20 years ago

164
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:27,800
um basically to use uh different amounts

165
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:30,918
of THC and loning and show alteration of

166
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:35,079
THC effects so that's basically what was

167
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:40,000
done uh the clear result of this study

168
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:42,560
uh which lead author uh was Tori spindle

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,079
so this is available free for download

170
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,560
at Ethan russ. org at the library tab uh

171
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,598
it should be one of the top articles so

172
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,240
anybody can access it there without

173
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:58,199
going through a pay wall or anything

174
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,560
else but basically what happened was uh

175
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:04,960
a sufficient dose

176
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,680
people in the study um had anxiety

177
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:11,120
induced by THC which was vaporized and

178
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,759
this is all double blind um but with the

179
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,000
addition of lyine in a sufficient dose

180
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:21,319
there was a clear reduction in the

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,560
anxiety um and people can argue with the

182
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,199
amount that was in there um you know we

183
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,158
addressed uh this possible criticism in

184
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,959
the article because the top dose loning

185
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:34,240
was 15

186
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:37,799
milligrams uh which would be hard to

187
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,599
achieve in many types of cannabis but

188
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:44,158
there are kavars that are particularly

189
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:46,640
rich in loning and actually can equal or

190
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:51,480
exceed the amount of THC particularly in

191
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:56,439
type three plants um so what we did is

192
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,480
not Pure Fantasy also people may realize

193
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,160
that I've always been a proponent of

194
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,560
whole cannabis extracts but in this

195
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:06,519
instance again we had to separate

196
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:09,479
components um without using herbal

197
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:13,759
cannabis that uh would just have too

198
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:16,800
many other factors that would complicate

199
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:21,078
uh trying to interpret the results so

200
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:24,479
again I call this a deconstruction

201
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:27,639
reconstruction the other study um was

202
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,759
done with uh colleagues at Washington

203
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,799
State University krie C is the lead

204
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:36,958
author and again available at Ethan

205
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:39,719
russ. org at the library tab in this

206
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:43,359
study we wanted to show and really

207
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:47,560
highlight what canaberal CBG can

208
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,278
do um we done a previous survey same

209
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:54,239
team uh that was published a couple of

210
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:56,200
years ago um in cannabis and canabo

211
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,000
research and it was just a survey of

212
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,600
people using CBG predominant material

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,120
and the results were surprising because

214
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,839
uh all kinds of claims were made about

215
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,240
medical benefits um people saying that

216
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:16,399
it the CBG preparations were better than

217
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,399
conventional medicine um and very very

218
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,278
significantly help with anxiety so we

219
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:25,559
tested that

220
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:29,480
proposition and um we used uh tincture

221
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:33,599
uh that was supplied by sheno Los um it

222
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:37,480
was uh pretty pure um this was a CBG

223
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,159
without any significant amount of TC or

224
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:46,240
CBD um and the only turp of any

225
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:50,480
concentration was kopine but um really

226
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,039
not a very high Tighter and unlikely to

227
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:58,920
have psychoactive effects of its own in

228
00:10:54,039 --> 00:11:02,039
any event CBG in a double blind study

229
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:05,559
that was done over zoom on tests of

230
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:08,759
induced anxiety like counting down from

231
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:12,000
13 from a high number and restarting

232
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:15,000
every time you made a mistake um showed

233
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,559
a very significant reduction of anxiety

234
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,360
this is a with a dose of 20 milligrams

235
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:23,278
of CBG as compared to

236
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,200
Placebo um surprising result was there

237
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,879
was actually Improvement in verbal

238
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,560
memory uh with CBG so certainly no

239
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:35,600
evidence of impairment uh there was no

240
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:38,359
particular drug liking uh so it's really

241
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,560
a unique result showing an anti-anxiety

242
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,320
effect without any

243
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:47,838
sedation um we already know that CBG has

244
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,720
no drug abuse liability there's no

245
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,079
withdrawal um so this is really a

246
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,440
spectacular agent that uh deserves a lot

247
00:11:54,078 --> 00:12:00,759
more attention um particularly here in

248
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,639
the Northwest there are CBG only uh

249
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:06,639
flower preparations and

250
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,959
tinctures but additionally CBG and

251
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,079
higher

252
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:15,319
concentrations uh with THC seems to do a

253
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:18,239
really spectacular job in allaying uh

254
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,959
anxiety that's induced by THC so it's

255
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,480
possible to still be high and have all

256
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:26,638
the benefits there from uh without

257
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,639
simultaneously getting paranoid or

258
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,560
anything else um with right preparations

259
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,560
so anyway that was

260
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:39,399
long-winded interesting it's interesting

261
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,159
that something that is a precursor to

262
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:45,879
THC could be good for anxiety when not

263
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:48,559
everyone but there certainly could be

264
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:52,399
people to speak about the potential

265
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,638
anxiety induction that can happen from

266
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,278
taking

267
00:12:53,639 --> 00:13:01,879
Inc um I I've always kind of not so much

268
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:04,720
felt it on wide Leaf uh drug cultivars

269
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,600
but that terpinolene rich narrow Leaf

270
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,120
drug cultivars is where I have

271
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,480
definitely felt um a little bit of that

272
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,480
anxiety I never felt it my whole life

273
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,199
until I broke my cix and when my cix was

274
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,199
broken and my whole core was just

275
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:22,519
shattered and I was just having a really

276
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:24,599
hard time I accidentally ended up taking

277
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,720
some dabs of I think it might have been

278
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:31,959
whereas my bike which was that biker

279
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,959
cush crossed with Amnesia Hayes from uh

280
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,759
Karma genetics and I'll tell you man

281
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:38,198
that was the first time first what it

282
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,639
did was it exasperated my pain instead

283
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:43,278
of taking it away and then after it did

284
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,919
that it gave me a full-blown anxiety

285
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,838
attack which I had never had before but

286
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:51,319
I certainly became um cognitive and sort

287
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:54,279
of empathetic uh to those that had told

288
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:58,199
me that they had had this happen before

289
00:13:54,278 --> 00:14:02,320
um lately since I broke my uh clavicle

290
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:04,639
I've been taking quite a bit of THC um

291
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,560
gummies just you know maybe like 50 to

292
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,639
60 milligrams a day which is quite a bit

293
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,119
for me I take like 10 10 at a time and

294
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,680
I've had no anxiety and it's just been

295
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,639
the most incredible pain relief that I

296
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:18,399
have ever experienced clavicle is a

297
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,039
pretty shitty bone to break not that

298
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,639
there's good ones but it's a painful one

299
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,278
you don't realize how often you move

300
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,799
your shoulder and how often you you feel

301
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,919
it so I've uh it's always neat I Wade

302
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:33,399
was speaking to this last uh week in

303
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:36,120
regards to how he's able to use cannabis

304
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:38,759
for sort of really the first time in his

305
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,480
life to really feel the effects of it

306
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,839
for um you know for what he's been

307
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,120
suffering with which has uh been a a

308
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,519
form of cancer so shout out to Wade

309
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,120

currently well we're gonna do a lot more

331
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:47,159
with

332
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:50,879
CBG uh for sure Carrie Cutler uh my uh

333
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:54,600
collaborator on uh prior to CBG studies

334
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:58,240
we've got two more planned um one is

335
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,920
going to uh be with a higher dose I'd

336
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,919
point

337
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:20,559
and she's going to do this as an inlab

338
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,519
study um so uh they might be a little

339
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,599
more aggressive and trying to induce

340
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:27,919
anxiety and they'll be looking at things

341
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,519
like blood pressure and response to

342
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,599
what's called a cold pressor test how

343
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:36,679
long it takes you um to have pain when

344
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,000
your hand and arm are in uh really cold

345
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:44,039
water um and how much anxiety that

346
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,440
produces um so that one's coming up

347
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:50,679
additionally we're going to do a

348
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:53,800
clinical study of a um well it' be a

349
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:56,638
formulation of my design it definitely

350
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,078
has CBG in it and that will be to treat

351
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,480
menopausal symptoms

352
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:05,798
uh so those are

353
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:11,240
upcoming uh beyond that um we've

354
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:13,679
got uh study about uh educational needs

355
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:18,078
um in relation to

356
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:21,439
cannabis um we've got a another big

357
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:23,798
review on IM myotrophic lateral

358
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,839
sclerosis uh again we're doing a bunch

359
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:29,960
of formulation work and there's always

360
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:33,240
uh new stuff coming along on the uh

361
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,480
John's Hopkins side um we've done

362
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,240
additional studies with uh Alpha pining

363
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,480
at

364
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:44,880
THC and there's going to be one with uh

365
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:49,160
mercing in THC at UCLA with Zea Cooper

366
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:52,280
she's looking at uh beta caropine in THC

367
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,360
in relation to pain so always a lot

368
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:57,079
going

369
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:59,399
on incredible go

370
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:04,279
ahead I'd asked this question question

371
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,080
on the uh on the U um webcast that you

372
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,038
recently gave I forget I don't know it

373
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:11,839
was a webcast maybe about a month or so

374
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:15,720
ago sure this and uh first of all again

375
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:18,240
thank you for this wonderful work um so

376
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,640
uh it had to do and I think we actually

377
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,279
responded you responded by email and you

378
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,480
sent me a reference on a recent study

379
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:29,319
that looked at the pharmaco kinetics of

380
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,720
CBG

381
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:34,918
uh but I guess my other question is is

382
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:38,558
what is this hitting is this hitting 5hd

383
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,720
or do you know how it's anti-anxiety

384
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,359
mechanism yeah the anti- anxiety effect

385
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,400
it's probably complex it may have to do

386
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:51,279
with serotonin receptors but um I'll be

387
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,200
honest I've studied serotonin receptors

388
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,879
for decades um and it's ceaselessly

389
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,798
complicated because they do different

390
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,640
things different places um they can do

391
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:07,440
different things at the same uh receptor

392
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:10,200
site um so if I had to explain it I

393
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:15,840
couldn't I would just say that we know

394
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:18,759
that um CBG increases Gaba activity and

395
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,918
so the anti-anxiety effect May well be

396
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:23,480
mediated uh through Gaba which is an

397
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,600
inhibitory

398
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:30,440
neurotransmitter um so uh more work

399
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,199
needed there but the bottom line is that

400
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:36,558
this is really an amazing anti-anxiety

401
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,880
agent uh for people who are aware of

402
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,720
pharmacology just about every

403
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,240
anti-anxiety drug is simultaneously

404
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:48,558
sedating Andor addictive and that's just

405
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,640
not the case here so this really may be

406
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,879
what Society currently needs everybody's

407
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,880
been through the ringer the last several

408
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:02,960
years whether it's um economic stress

409
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:06,280
pandemic War you name it um so I think

410
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,759
personally that CBG is the answer uh to

411
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:12,960
a lot of PE what people might think of

412
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:15,519
if they need a little pharmacological

413
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,000
help with all that

414
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:22,480
stress and you think cbga too has its

415
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,240
place there I'm sure you saw this I was

416
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,679
fasinated by this and I'm surprised

417
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,240
actually this study didn't get more

418
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,360
light but about a year and a half ago um

419
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,159
a group reported that

420
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:41,000
cbga shuts down store operated calcium

421
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:44,280
entry which is part of the um

422
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,919
inflammatory sort of cascade if you will

423
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:51,038
and may actually be one of the

424
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:54,038
underlying mechanisms that canabo in

425
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:56,798
particular cannabinoid acids are are

426
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:58,919
anti-inflammatory so do you think cbga

427
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:02,240
just because that extra acidic group

428
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,880
there could be some additional and I

429
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,240
guess where I'm going after here Ethan

430
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:11,278
so if you were ingesting like cvga flour

431
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:15,240
so if you're ucing it or somehow getting

432
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:18,079
the whole flour is there a nature uh to

433
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:22,798
wanting to have both the acid and the

434
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:24,678
decarbox material I'd say yes often uh

435
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,839
these combinations of the acids and

436
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,640
neutral cannabinoids are really helpful

437
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:31,759
therapeutically

438
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,440
the problem is um as compared to the

439
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:37,119
other phyto canabo there's been

440
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,558
extremely little work done on

441
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:43,399
cbga uh so again if you ask me what are

442
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:47,000
the mechanisms of action um I'd have a

443
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,960
hard time saying very much um but

444
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,558
certainly that would be a really great

445
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:57,400
thing for some grad student out there to

446
00:21:52,558 --> 00:22:00,200
do his do his a project um but uh you

447
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,919
know I can tell you that but uh my

448
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,558
friend Dustin sulac his healer products

449
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:10,520
um they they have a preparation that's

450
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:13,200
cbga and CBG and um seemingly have a lot

451
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:16,200
lot of good results in a variety of

452
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,360
conditions how it compares to CBG

453
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,840
predominant without any cbga couldn't

454
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,119
say at this point but often we do see

455
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:30,199
added

456
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:30,199
benefits um of combining like that

457
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:34,798
you play that instrument behind

458
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,960
you colen can you sample

459
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,919
this I literally was just thinking the

460
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,919
same thing I was like

461
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,240
that when people worked really hard to

462
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,919
do

463
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,359
that and now it just happens that that

464
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,919
was absolutely skunkman Sam asking uh

465
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:00,558
you if you played that instrument behind

466
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,200
you and while welcome to Chimera dude

467
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,480
that's awesome to see you man um since

468
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,519
this was brought up that's a Turkish oud

469
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,960
and um yeah I play it um it's 11 strings

470
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:15,038
and it's not in tune so I'm not going to

471
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:18,558
indulge now but uh yeah I picked that up

472
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:21,679
at an estate sale uh several months ago

473
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:24,000
and been having fun with it that's

474
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,000
pretty

475
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:32,558
cool down here but it I need to place

476
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,559
the bridge to make it uh

477
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:40,960
playable how do you'all nice to see you

478
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,960
guys I'm sitting here with

479
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,720
Sam good to see you kir I love you bud

480
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,720
been too long to see you

481
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,720
all

482
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,319
hey well that explains the feedback from

483
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,320
Sam

484
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,599
then you can't have two mics so close to

485
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:02,079
one

486
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,480
another yeah no I had it a couple weeks

487
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,720
ago my friend Merlin showed up here for

488
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,960
the show and I was like oh my God like I

489
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,880
put everything in my headphones if I

490
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,319
don't have headphones on so I just

491
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,880
didn't speak for the entire show but

492
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:17,918
luckily uh Alec Dixon spoke for the

493
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,440
almost the entire show that that week so

494
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,278
it was it was perfect shout out to uh

495
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,159
Alec for for coming in how are you doing

496
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,640
Ryan what's uh new and different in the

497
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:30,600
world of chimera you're producing some

498
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,600
pretty nice Str cultivars for uh for

499
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:35,199
kippen team there I've seen yeah they're

500
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,158
doing that's actually a few years old

501
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,360
that stuff yeah but they're they're

502
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,840
doing some grow ups and finding some

503
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,759
winners which is always

504
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:47,639
nice I'm uh I'm I'm doing some more lab

505
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:48,839
work um working with another doctor at

506
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,919
University here we're gonna be doing

507
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:54,439
some interesting stuff coming out

508
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,919
so very nice well it'll be two years

509
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,440
probably before you can talk about it

510
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,520
and we'll hear about it but uh we'll be

511
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,759
we'll be looking forward to it yeah it's

512
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,278
a little early to give the cat out of

513
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,158
the bag at this point in time it's more

514
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:08,440
along the lines of breeding

515
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:10,720
Technologies so and I was just over in

516
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,640
Europe and my mom passed not too long

517
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,640
ago so I was brought some of her ashes

518
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,759
home and uh you know it was just across

519
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,278
the channel from David so I figured I'd

520
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,720
stop in and say hello he's been kind

521
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:26,679
enough to give me a bit of rest fite

522
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:29,798
here so it's good sorry for your loss

523
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,000
Ryan since so you're on I can ask you

524
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:34,960
and any of the other breeders there is

525
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,759
anybody uh selectively breeding for

526
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,759
turpenoid

527
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:45,119
concentration breing for terpenoids is a

528
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:47,440
[ __ ] it's really

529
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,278
hard yeah even going back to the the

530
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,320
nebor work we had um a whole bunch of

531
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:54,159
lines that were higher in in turp

532
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,599
concentration as you know it's really

533
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,640
about having the analytical method

534
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,319
that's sensitive enough to be able to

535
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,919
selecting breeding almost yeah well

536
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:05,519
you're yeah I mean like any lot of it's

537
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:09,159
epigenetic related to environmental

538
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:11,558
influences but uh perhaps

539
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:14,480
concentration uh overall concentration

540
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:17,079
of turps um I mean a lot of this hasn't

541
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,798
been worked out but I I'm just wondering

542
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:23,319
if anybody out there is concentrating on

543
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:25,240
on this line of uh

544
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:26,599
research well even like I said even

545
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,720
going back to the napro days we were

546
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:31,558
doing that we had certain Trin lines

547
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,440
that were producing significantly more t

548
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:36,038
or tpes in within a given you know

549
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,640
within a given line so we would breed

550
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:39,960
those up and and you can definitely

551
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,840
create lines that are higher like

552
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,480
overall turpenoid production I I know

553
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:48,519
Mark Lewis uh he had one in particular

554
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:53,558
was really interested in it had 2% Alpha

555
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:55,278
pining alone out of 3.9% total turps uh

556
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:57,759
so that's

557
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,440
spectacular um you know considering that

558
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:03,240
most

559
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:08,159
totals are about 1% on things that I

560
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:11,558
look at um but I I'd sure encourage

561
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:14,720
people to think along these lines

562
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:16,319
and well Ethan I've always I mean all

563
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,200
the you know I'm not a breeder but all

564
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,038
the selection work that I've done and

565
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,120
all the the cultivars I've created over

566
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:24,519
all the years have been torpal dominant

567
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:28,278
that's been my my game always been a fan

568
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:30,639
that's California well yeah well it's

569
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:32,119
big part of the world too torpol is a

570
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,960
big you know is a it's kind of an

571
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:37,158
outlier in many ways um but

572
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,159
interestingly enough it if they are all

573
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:41,840
fairly high in CBG so I over the years

574
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,159
I've realized that most of the cultivars

575
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:49,119
I've selected have been 1.5 to 3%

576
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:53,559
CBG and about

577
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:56,319
1.5 1 to 1.5% terpinolene um which kind

578
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:58,319
of gives it this really you know a

579
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,079
mellowed effect like people have always

580
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,319
assumed that like wow this is a a lower

581
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:05,439
THC variety like this is a 18 to 20 it's

582
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:08,798
like well actually 28% but it really

583
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:13,200
mitigates a lot of that that um THC side

584
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:15,720
effect um but once Ryan I was at the the

585
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,720
facility and Steve um Steve habba had

586
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,319
showed me a a variety or a cultivar that

587
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,839
he had um selected or I'm not sure

588
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:25,918
exactly if it would maybe you bred that

589
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:28,359
one but it was he said it was 5%

590
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,840
turpening yeah that was that was line

591
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:33,398
that I was talking about previously yeah

592
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,519
it um it was five the highest testing

593
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:37,959
plant that we found initially was

594
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,000
5.7% and you know I had a lot of I had a

595
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,200
lot of faith in Matt ge's analytical

596
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,599
method he really was quite insane about

597
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,080
you know correct numbers not just

598
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,038
getting a reading out of a machine and

599
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,639
yeah the there was a subset of the

600
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:54,278
trinoline plants that had that really

601
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,960
high tur uh percentage also like you

602
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:58,119
just said we also realized at that point

603
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:03,278
in time as well that there was like 10

604
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:06,518
to 20% of the of the tpine plants do

605
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:09,038
overexpress CBG like for whatever reason

606
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,000
they don't just convert all the CBG into

607
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,119
THC so you end up with a little bit of a

608
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
buffer or what we would call as a buffer

609
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:20,000
right um he did say that was paid that

610
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,319
you was that it was unsm smokable that

611
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,720
the just because the the the high

612
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,359
terpinolene was just completely

613
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,159
aggressive on your respiratory system

614
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,719
just in holding godamn just you know

615
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,039
it's so funny sitting here with Sam but

616
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,120
these are all lessons that he taught us

617
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,000
so long ago right like I mean even when

618
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,000
he was growing the Haz and in Santa Cruz

619
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,558
he had that experience where that he

620
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,240
wouldn't he'd always let plants cure for

621
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,759
a month right or at least a month before

622
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,240
you you try to smoke them because there

623
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:48,839
was you know I think that subset of tpin

624
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,319
plants that are just too much it's too

625
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:54,519
chemically right it feels too

626
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:56,278
chemically um whether that's the same

627
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:59,159
thing for the use in the extract Market

628
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:01,319
I I really see us going to a place where

629
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,320
Turpin become and other

630
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:06,278
volatiles but you know it's such an

631
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:08,240
underappreciated at least from the

632
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:10,759
analytical the way the analytics are

633
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,120
pushed in the industry but you know when

634
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:14,919
you're concentrating plants into these

635
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,239
extracts and rosins and oils and things

636
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:18,600
like that live

637
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,679
resins you you don't need to be using

638
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,879
30% plants right because there's there's

639
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,320
kind of like a a biological Maxima that

640
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,519
the plant can have in terms of total

641
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:28,759
canabo and total terpenoids they share

642
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,880
the the

643
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:35,519
common precursor pathway right and so to

644
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,080
a degree one comes at the op at the

645
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,399
opportunity cost of the other and so

646
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,398
like I think that you'd have that you

647
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:43,959
can have plants that are even you know

648
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,398
in the 20s or 15% with a really special

649
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,960
turpan profile and when that's extracted

650
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,398
that's more of a a suitable plant for

651
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,960
the market unfortunately a lot of that

652
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:53,439
stuff can't make it in a regulated

653
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,558
system where everybody gets so focused

654
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,320
on THC right and all a lot of these

655
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,839
flavor class plants that only produce in

656
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,720
the 15 to 20% range kind of get pushed

657
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:04,398
to the

658
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,839
Wayside yeah they're probably unsalable

659
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,798
most places unfortunately it's the

660
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:11,959
reality right everybody's so driven by

661
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,759
THC you know I I even see dispensary not

662
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,720
dispensaries but you know retail shops

663
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:17,679
and British Columbia and you walk in and

664
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,399
they have plants literally rated on the

665
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:24,278
menu the top is the highest percentage

666
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:27,558
THC content so I wish it were more

667
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:30,480
experiential um you know my son some

668
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:33,158
years years ago was a runner up for best

669
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,599
bud tender in Seattle and he really

670
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:38,440
tried to disabuse people of the notion

671
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:40,839
that they wanted the highest THC

672
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:45,639
possible but he didn't always gain a lot

673
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:48,798
of traction with the folks buying um so

674
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:50,839
it's too bad uh well in the olden days

675
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:51,798
you didn't buy something before you did

676
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,038
a

677
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:58,720
bioassay and

678
00:31:54,038 --> 00:32:00,398
um that model probably worked better um

679
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,440
I mean it's completely connected to

680
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,439
price right I mean this is I I can

681
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,679
remember having these conversations with

682
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,120
you guys five to eight years ago and I

683
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,798
remember I remember Debbie goldsbury was

684
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:13,518
in the room and she's like guys it's

685
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:15,918
great you know I love that you are

686
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,599
thinking the utopian ways and you want

687
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:22,320
to educate everyone but she's like after

688
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:25,439
selling weed to Californians for 30 plus

689
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:29,678
years all I can say is all they [ __ ]

690
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,120
care about is price and th see so I just

691
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,080
wonder how we'll ever escape that in and

692
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:38,479
maybe we won't maybe we're The Fringe

693
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:41,199
and again people need to try it uh if

694
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,558
they have an experience again you know

695
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,399
as I've been mentioning if you can be

696
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:50,158
high and have the

697
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:52,319
benefits without the downside of uh

698
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,559
paranoia stress

699
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:58,960
anxiety um it's just a totally different

700
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:02,278
experience um you know and I I think

701
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,639
people my age really wax prosaic about

702
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:09,200
the olden days and it's true you know

703
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:11,240
there were very high THC kavars

704
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,600
available then but they were much less

705
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:17,200
common however the experience was

706
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:21,240
different and it wasn't all THC and all

707
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,919
mercing and lot of people older people

708
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:28,919
miss those kind of experiences and don't

709
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:31,240
like a lot of what's out there currently

710
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,960
Ethan i' also also just say Al it's not

711
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,919
just it is older people and people have

712
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,079
had the opportunity but in the breeder

713
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,000
Community you know there's a lot of

714
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:44,199
people who breed and and and have smoke

715
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,038
flour that they don't sell there's a lot

716
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,759
of Growers who have flow at home that

717
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,359
they grow and smoke and and not what

718
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:53,599
they grow at work and it's it's really

719
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,359
the market dynamics to me that's really

720
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,759
taken over cannabis where people the

721
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:00,879
people I I remember at one point

722
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:03,519
um like distribution guys in California

723
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,480
were like oh we don't people don't want

724
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,519
that you know like they were making big

725
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:12,000
decisions for what people want and then

726
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:15,679
you know you've got this new really loud

727
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
overwhelming you know fruity gassy thing

728
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,000
that is so easy for them to sell on the

729
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,679
nose you know that it just takes over

730
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
the world and California I mean Lemon

731
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,878
Cherry gelato and all that stuff is just

732
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,679
so dominant in the market here and the

733
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:33,519
The Growers themselves are like I hate

734
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,519
this stuff you know like it's just what

735
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,280
the kids want to smoke it's what the dro

736
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,679
guys want and I I name it five different

737
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,440
things and sell it as five different

738
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,918
things but it's so easy for me to sell

739
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,280
this to me that's like a real Market

740
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:48,199
issue where it's like the ability as a

741
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,000
brand and as a grower and as a a a

742
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:51,358
company to say like we believe in our

743
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,559
product and we're going to actually put

744
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:56,679
out something that we think is special

745
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,119
not just following these weird market

746
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:01,838
trends and dummy down and just making it

747
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,838
easy that put us in this position where

748
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:07,199
now you know huge portions of the market

749
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:08,599
are just a few cultivars that are often

750
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,759
resold under four or five different

751
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,640
things just because they're the easiest

752
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,079
to move and people don't even

753
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:14,440
necessarily like them people have like a

754
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,440
lot of years experience don't

755
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:21,079
necessarily like smoking it they just

756
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:24,679
know it well I just wanted to say that

757
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:27,920
about turpine breeding canono breeding

758
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:30,399
is fairly straightforward I mean you you

759
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,480
have to have the background material you

760
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,119
have to do what has to be done takes

761
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,838
several years but it's fairly

762
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:43,480
straightforward uh whereas the the

763
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:47,039
breeding for tping it's not so simple I

764
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:50,400
I I suspect there's many tpine syntheses

765
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:55,079
which can express more than one kind of

766
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:58,519
tpine uh whereas with cannabinoids CBD

767
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:01,000
also makes 20 about 20% THC but most of

768
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:02,599
the other syntheses for the different

769
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,920
cannaboids they're

770
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:09,519
straightforward sure yeah it it Dave

771
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:13,119
what you said is true um a lot of the

772
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:15,880
enzymes the uh synthesis for the turps

773
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:19,960
are promiscuous can work on different

774
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:22,599
substrates and produce different uh

775
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,000
different turps down the line so it does

776
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:28,318
make it really

777
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,079
complicated um uh but again I'm hoping

778
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:34,079
that somebody out there is interested

779
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,960
enough to do the genetic work to try and

780
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,480
ascertain uh how these things are

781
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,960
controlled uh etan had his hand up so I

782
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,480
just want to sorry Colin I just want to

783
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,318
make sure etan gets his uh two cents in

784
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,719
before we stray too far away from what

785
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:50,679
he wanted to speak about go ahead etan

786
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:53,879
um well a couple of things that's also

787
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:56,159
why we carried grams earlier um for

788
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,400
people to try right because I work for

789
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:02,118
Berkeley Patients Group we're turning 25

790
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,280
years literally next month so 25 years

791
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,160
ago that's what we were doing because

792
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,960
initially the uh consumer one in

793
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:12,199
California very educated um so they knew

794
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,079
what they were looking at or looking for

795
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:18,159
or towards usually very tarpine

796
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:21,200
rich uh well-grown flower was their

797
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:23,039
preference because uh they had seen all

798
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,598
different types of cannabis and they

799
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:28,480
understood what worked for them but

800
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,480
early in our testing right when we were

801
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,599
starting to isolate THC and then when we

802
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,599
found

803
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:39,640
CBD um that's where we had the problem

804
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:41,599
because science wasn't there so we had

805
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:44,519
the problem converting what we were

806
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,280
missing from science from the effect

807
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:50,559
right because we knew that THC was

808
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,680
not the be all and all we knew it was

809
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:57,799
very important however we didn't realize

810
00:37:54,679 --> 00:38:00,399
the symbiotic relationships that were

811
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:04,359
there or science wasn't able to convey

812
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:09,639
them at the time so that we could get a

813
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:11,920
handle on the misinformation of THC

814
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:14,279
content being the Beall and all as

815
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:19,358
opposed to realizing the other

816
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,839
cannaboids were at play as well um and

817
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,880
we're still struggling with that

818
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:28,078
unfortunately and I hope that we're able

819
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:31,119
to someday get an educational

820
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:34,240
uh Outreach to the consumer so that they

821
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,160
can stop this because of the alcohol

822
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:38,799
causation that seems to be the

823
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:41,318
predominant thinking that high THC is

824
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,519
now going to get me the best high and we

825
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:47,358
know that you know therapeutically Med

826
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:50,039
medically that is not the case in any

827
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:53,759
way shape or form in fact we find lower

828
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:56,880
THC and other spikes and cannaboids Etc

829
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,720
to be very most important but to Dr

830
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,599
Russo's Point yeah early on we had to go

831
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:06,039
small so that people didn't feel the

832
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:08,000
financial ability to commit to you know

833
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:09,800
the overprice that was of course

834
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,440
cannabis which is back then you know

835
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:15,160
$4,000 to $6,000 a pound which 25 years

836
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,480
later where thankfully is no longer the

837
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:19,879
case so sorry to be so long winded there

838
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,679
but I thought some perspective for the

839
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,440
viewers might matter well maybe medical

840
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:28,480
users can drive it because uh

841
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,559
recreational uniters they're going be

842
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,559
how much DC what's the

843
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,358
price yeah um I I just wanted to say I

844
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,599
was looking through some of my coas and

845
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:42,000
some of my my testing and Ethan I I've

846
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,760
always sort of since the beginning of

847
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,760
being able to see what's underneath the

848
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,640
hood in terms of of what constituents

849
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,839
are there making up these profiles I've

850
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:52,799
always tried my best to selectively

851
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,838
breed towards things that were the you

852
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,039
know we're looking at the COA and saying

853
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:59,480
like Okay well now this translate you

854
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,838
know for instance I have lemon G13 up I

855
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,800
always believed that it was high in

856
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:04,239
lemoning and then I started working with

857
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,800
the plant really deeply and I realized

858
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:09,959
it was just really beta mercine that was

859
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:12,519
driving it and 1.79% to 1% of you know

860
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,599
lemine or line was really driving those

861
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:17,358
flavor that that the essent that I

862
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:21,519
really loved of it right and you look at

863
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:24,199
it and it's 4.3% 32% in this COA of beta

864
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:26,480
mering right and that's that's

865
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:28,439
incredibly that's that's a that's really

866
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,760
notable if you're reading towards flavor

867
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,400
profiles because merin's not something

868
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,119
you're breeding for you know you're

869
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,039
typically trying to get away from that

870
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:39,800
that to be honest sure so it's it's

871
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:42,480
really interesting but again as as we've

872
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,318
all said the the more I started looking

873
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,719
towards breeding with that methodology

874
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:49,559
it dispelled whether or not that was

875
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:51,118
really the path right so I think markers

876
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:53,719
I think last week we really talked about

877
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,720
some crisper I think things like that

878
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:57,358
are getting us closer to understanding

879
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,879
the ideologies that we can kind of

880
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,279
dispel and kind of work through to

881
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,280
better understand the path um but

882
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,680
there's so much work to be done because

883
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,880
you know if you if you cross two

884
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,759
Offspring together it's very highly

885
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:14,519
unlikely that they'll even resemble the

886
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:17,240
mom or dad um so I think it's uh as Sam

887
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:19,239
said selective breeding and um going

888
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:22,239
towards your you know the human aspect

889
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:24,358
of things is still um a big part of it

890
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,639
today listen you don't need to go

891
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:28,639
crisper to do that kind of stuff yeah

892
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,598
right of the things that that people are

893
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:31,759
not doing in cannabis breeding and I

894
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:33,079
know because I've seen this and I've

895
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,000
done it both

896
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,480
ways the reason napro and Mark Lewis are

897
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,199
having and Steve you know habba they're

898
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,480
having that kind of results with the

899
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:44,078
breeding is because they take every

900
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,358
plant and it goes to a laboratory

901
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,920
whereas the vast majority of people that

902
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:51,000
are doing this and I would say 99.9% of

903
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,440
the people growing cannabis they select

904
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,679
the few plants that suit their goals and

905
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,960
they send those to the laboratory right

906
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,399
so if you if you try to like kind of

907
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,599
come to it from a bio prospecting kind

908
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,000
of thing that's like taking a square

909
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:06,599
kilometer and digging four holes and

910
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,880
then deciding what you know is in the

911
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,800
entire Square you know Square four

912
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,440
square kilometer space right you

913
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,880
literally have to take every single

914
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,039
plant and you're looking for those

915
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,160
things that maybe the human nose doesn't

916
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:20,519
quite detect um or or really maybe we

917
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:21,838
don't detect them in the same way

918
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:24,880
whereas when you do a chemical

919
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:27,639
analytical you know kind of high

920
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,960
throughput like Brute Force approach you

921
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:32,480
might see some chemicals that are hidden

922
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,000
in the mix that you would otherwise Miss

923
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,480
and then you can pair those plants

924
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,519
together or self them and and that way

925
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,079
you can actually start driving specific

926
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:42,519
turp synes you don't have and even you

927
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:45,519
know it would be great to understand the

928
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:47,559
genetic mechanisms of these things um so

929
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,400
that we can develop genetic markers but

930
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:51,359
we don't need that like the the

931
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,200
chemicals themselves are chemical

932
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:54,920
markers right and that was something

933
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:58,558
that Mark as a chemist he really hit

934
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,639
home like the the chemical the

935
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:03,319
chemosphere of the plant like the Cho if

936
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,480
you want to call it that is really a

937
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:07,759
reflection of the genome right is what

938
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,679
genes are are produced so all you have

939
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,240
to do is look for those outliers and one

940
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:14,679
of the things that we are doing as a

941
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:17,318
global Community is growing a lot of

942
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:19,799
plants and you know some of those plants

943
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:21,679
find their way kind of to the top of the

944
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,599
cream right like they rise to the cream

945
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:26,000
and then we get these little pictures of

946
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:27,838
you know oh this is what makes this

947
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,239
plant unique be it thought Bol or

948
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,239
whatever chemical other whatever

949
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:34,879
volatile we're looking for and

950
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:37,439
considering right um but yeah it's it's

951
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,400
an expensive thing to do to take a 100

952
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,760
plants or even 500 plants and send them

953
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,000
to a laboratory that's a big old

954
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,880
analytical Bill no nobody can do it and

955
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,440
that's why you know I applaud Mark's

956
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:53,039
approach he could only do it because he

957
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:55,119
had a lab on site uh yeah yeah and I

958
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,440
think that's the way forward if this is

959
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,640
a a goal for other people it's sure

960
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,519
would be for

961
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:03,078
me yeah Mark Mark convinced the investor

962
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,800
and you know we had some really deep

963
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:07,119
conversations with the investor and came

964
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,800
he came to understand that that was the

965
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,200
way it was right that was the the

966
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,920
approach that was going to win and he

967
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,879
you know handed us the keys to the car

968
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,079
so to speak and uh you know we got to

969
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,720
take that toy out for a ride it's having

970
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,920
done it that way you can't go back to

971
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,759
the other way right because you just

972
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,318
can't make the gains that you can with

973
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,040
full lab support so

974
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:33,960
yeah it's kind of The Way It Is Well

975
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:35,800
said man yeah it's it's uh and you know

976
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,440
the one thing that I I've found some of

977
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,079
my favorite cultivars as I get into the

978
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,838
hood of them they're completely

979
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,240
different which I what I constituents

980
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:45,159
that I thought were there and to your

981
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:48,279
point you can't go back you you have to

982
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:50,719
know now it's not like it's just part of

983
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,920
the process and as it should be well you

984
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,199
realize that you're blind right you're

985
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,680
you're you're kind of blinded if you're

986
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:58,399
not doing it that way and so once you've

987
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,719
seen the light it's hard to go back into

988
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,318
the dark you can sure you can still

989
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,159
screen plants for all sorts of other

990
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:07,358
things but you know even in now that

991
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,960
there's un legal systems around the

992
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:13,078
world with universities that are working

993
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,838
you know collaboratively with industry

994
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:16,400
we're starting to figure some stuff out

995
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:19,838
it's really the game has changed so much

996
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,639
in 25 years it's remarkable yeah well

997
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:25,119
speak speaking of that I would love to

998
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:27,279
hear from uh Chris brassa as well as

999
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,000
Davis Allen they're doing some work with

1000
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,319
the University of British Colombia and

1001
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,159
uh yeah if you want to maybe start Chris

1002
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:35,800
introduce yourself and kind of give us a

1003
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:36,759
little Lowdown on what what you're what

1004
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,079
you're

1005
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,079
doing oh you're

1006
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:49,400
muted sure so um I spent about the past

1007
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,800
five years um working on understanding

1008
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,160
really kind of uh the demographic

1009
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:59,359
history of uh cannabis so um uh how kind

1010
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:01,039
of the land races and um really I think

1011
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:04,078
different species are related to each

1012
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:06,039
other um and um which kind of natural

1013
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,880
populations um the land races were

1014
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:11,960
domesticated from um and then just

1015
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:15,559
recently over the past six months or so

1016
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:18,639
um the UBC received um a permit although

1017
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:22,040
no Grant yet um uh to start some

1018
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:26,199
pre-breeding um to really take cannabis

1019
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:30,039
production um Outdoors uh breed cannabis

1020
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:33,399
um uh for outdoor cultivation um in uh

1021
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:35,318
Canadian environment um and so um you

1022
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,800
know in the Pacific Northwest we have

1023
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:41,960
some um like Downey mildew uh uh

1024
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,559
pressures uh for example um we also have

1025
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:48,240
um you know a shorter growing season um

1026
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:51,480
and so um yeah the idea is to kind of

1027
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:55,598
use his knowledge of um uh land races

1028
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:58,880
and also maybe wild plants um to breed

1029
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:03,000
some of um plants that are are good uh

1030
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:06,119
medicine also um so Davis has also been

1031
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,400
helping out with that um acquiring um

1032
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:11,640
different land race varieties and um

1033
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,400
Davis has um quite a bit of uh you know

1034
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:17,239
longtime uh medical patient and so he's

1035
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,160
able to um speak on kind of the the

1036
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:22,959
efficacy of of different varieties and

1037
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:25,679
um you know some of the uh chemical

1038
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,838
profiles that um might be good to to

1039
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,838
include in our breeding program

1040
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,760
interesting yeah i' love to hear from

1041
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:35,439
you as well Davis yeah for sure so uh do

1042
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,960
you want me to give my background as

1043
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,480
well like where yeah give give us a

1044
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,679
little little little cliff notes of who

1045
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,400
you are and what you're up to for sure

1046
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:46,879
so I've actually been a medical patient

1047
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:49,400
since 2011 since I was 17 years old and

1048
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,640
I got into the industry in 2013

1049
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,480
ultimately because I noticed that um

1050
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:55,358
just like a lot of you guys are discuss

1051
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,800
discussing like there seemed to be an

1052
00:47:55,358 --> 00:48:00,318
emphasis just on t HC and not on the

1053
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,039
full profiles of the plants what I found

1054
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:05,480
really interesting is one time I had a

1055
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:07,960
university lecture a few years after I

1056
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,039
um received my medical card and I

1057
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,880
noticed that uh there's like a different

1058
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:13,599
effect to it like I really paid

1059
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,200
attention in class all these other

1060
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,240
things because I was actually thinking

1061
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:19,919
about not even uh attending my course

1062
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:22,919
because I was having some uh autoimmune

1063
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,760
issues what was really interesting is we

1064
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,400
had lab analysis done on that variety

1065
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,000
and it had a low concentration of CBG

1066
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,960
which is really interesting that this is

1067
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,920
being talked about in this discussion as

1068
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:37,280
well and it uh it really led me to look

1069
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,880
into the chemical profiles of various

1070
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:43,160
varieties and have a strong interest

1071
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:45,640
into land races because what I noticed

1072
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:48,759
after years of collecting land races is

1073
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:51,000
that there's distinct effects that seem

1074
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:54,400
to be standing out within different

1075
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,480
varieties and it led me to want to

1076
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,318
collect land races from various regions

1077
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,039
for future medical use additionally for

1078
00:48:59,318 --> 00:49:04,199
research purposes which I'm fortunate

1079
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:06,679
enough to be sharing now with UBC and

1080
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:08,598
additionally on top of that I think that

1081
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:10,558
uh while I agree with you guys that like

1082
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:13,318
in the current market there's an

1083
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:16,079
emphasis on THC I ultimately think over

1084
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:18,199
time that's going to shift because

1085
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,920
people are recognizing more and more at

1086
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:23,759
least I believe that uh having these

1087
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:26,760
kind of distinct profiles will allow for

1088
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,680
different type of psychoactive profiles

1089
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,359
and so in turn by having this different

1090
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:32,879
effect people aren't necessarily just

1091
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,279
looking for what's the strongest

1092
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,920
ultimately I think the correlation is

1093
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,640
because there's a lack of information on

1094
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,200
uh these other uh compounds within

1095
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:45,318
cannabis all people who don't really

1096
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:48,318
have a strong educational background can

1097
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:50,159
look at is the high THC in the best

1098
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,960
price because ultimately you know we we

1099
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:54,279
live in an economy we live in a world

1100
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,039
where people have to be careful about

1101
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,798
how much they spend so they're going to

1102
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:59,358
be price con ious and ultimately when

1103
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:01,119
they don't have that information those

1104
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,239
are the two easiest things to look at

1105
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:07,039
what's the lowest price and what's the

1106
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:08,598
highest THC and so yeah I truly believe

1107
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,358
that over time that's going to change

1108
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:13,200
and it's interesting just a few things

1109
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:14,598
that I heard from uh Ryan for example

1110
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:17,118
there about

1111
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:21,359
um the you know profiles that aren't

1112
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:23,680
necessarily you know 30% THC that then

1113
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:26,400
in turn if they're like at 15 to 20 have

1114
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:29,239
these more like unique flavor profiles

1115
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,200
and uh I also co-founded uh Island

1116
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:34,719
genetics so like we're a health Canada

1117
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:36,439
licensed um cultivation company I just

1118
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:38,318
recently left the company but still

1119
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:42,119
really close with everyone involved it's

1120
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:44,119
friends of mine and um what we noticed

1121
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:47,240
is that yeah there's there's definitely

1122
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:49,280
some unique profiles that aren't

1123
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:51,118
necessarily the highest THC but they

1124
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,440
wash well and then in turn they have a

1125
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,440
really interesting effect in

1126
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:01,838
product nice thanks for Sharon Davis and

1127
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:04,119
I believe we had Brian pop in snuck in

1128
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,639
behind us from best friend Farms good to

1129
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:09,680
see you dude good to see you heyy how

1130
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:11,719
you doing nice to see you yeah very good

1131
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:13,519
got a got a Powerhouse of a room today

1132
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:16,480
it's really nice to see uh I haven't

1133
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:19,798
seen Ryan in so long it was real really

1134
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:23,440
nice to see him he's always

1135
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:25,798
uh a great source of information and uh

1136
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:29,760
what you said earlier the chemosphere of

1137
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:29,759
the plant that might be my new favorite

1138
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:34,199
quote you know I I was just thinking you

1139
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:37,519
know it seems like the one thing that

1140
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:39,239
could save the industry right now is low

1141
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:43,280
THC

1142
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:46,519
flour um just because we're we're we're

1143
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,839
we're in a supply and demand um issue

1144
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:51,559
with people overgrowing we heavily

1145
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:53,838
saturated markets and you'd think that

1146
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:57,119
what the bigger Brands would want is

1147
00:51:53,838 --> 00:52:00,078
people to smoke more flour of lower

1148
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:02,960
potency you know make more sell five

1149
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,720
grams instead of two you know and not

1150
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,280
that not that we want people smoking all

1151
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:10,598
day like cigarettes but the reality is

1152
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,119
lower potency flour of certain profiles

1153
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:15,599
is so much more applicable to various

1154
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:19,680
situations different consumers just it's

1155
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:23,200
a much broader you know approach you can

1156
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:25,399
keep your TC levels at 20% and still

1157
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:27,118
have more tpes than you know what to do

1158
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,318
with so

1159
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:33,358
it doesn't have to be extremely

1160
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:37,000
low so mve I did a study for a year and

1161
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:39,159
a half with um with a a toxicologist and

1162
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,880
two other phds I don't know if I can say

1163
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:43,598
the name of the company but I I'll talk

1164
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,680
about the study and what we did was we

1165
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,960
we tested varietals that were in the 30%

1166
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:51,440
range and then below the 20s right and

1167
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,798
we gave those patients over a year time

1168
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,920
those two varietal and we asked them

1169
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:58,679
what they thought was more potent in

1170
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,400
every single time maybe two patients out

1171
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:02,239
of the out of the the 20 that we we did

1172
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,639
this

1173
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:06,598
with every single time they were on the

1174
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:09,000
on the the Lower Side of the THC and

1175
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,720
they they thought it was it was a higher

1176
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,440
The Higher One you know so I think what

1177
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:15,558
the learnings that I walked away with

1178
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,679
was we need to do more of this because

1179
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:19,559
we need to dispel and better understand

1180
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:21,759
what patients actually want and what

1181
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:23,640
they actually believe through Placebo

1182
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,000
and two

1183
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:29,039
perception you know as we're all talking

1184
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,838
about per ction of of of value is and

1185
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:34,039
we've talked about this on the other on

1186
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:35,920
another episode where for some reason

1187
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:39,079
it's like the alcohol world is seeped

1188
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,960
into into our world and for whatever

1189
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:44,400
Rhyme or Reason we haven't found a great

1190
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,679
reason to dispel why not so I think in

1191
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,760
that way I think we have a real

1192
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:51,480
opportunity here to to develop the path

1193
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,720
forward for that um because you this is

1194
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,760
the millionth time I've had this

1195
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:57,159
conversation in the past probably three

1196
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,440
months yeah you know and I think it's a

1197
00:53:57,159 --> 00:54:00,879
it's a constant um in terms of

1198
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,480
everyone's Consciousness and what

1199
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,519
they're thinking about on a daily basis

1200
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,079
of what

1201
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:12,960
what years ago when we first tested uh

1202
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:15,920
THC levels and uh we we found the

1203
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:20,199
entries into the High Times hand cup

1204
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,920
that the 25% ones people didn't like

1205
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:24,879
them as much or think they were as

1206
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,798
strong as for example skun number one

1207
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,318
that was 177%

1208
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:33,039
and we knew we knew at that time that it

1209
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:36,920
was the whole picture rather than just

1210
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:39,838
the THC but it's it's not easy to

1211
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:42,680
convince recreational smokers especially

1212
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:44,838
younger ones I think that last part

1213
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:46,960
really well potency I think potency is

1214
00:54:44,838 --> 00:54:49,239
really important and and the fact that

1215
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,798
we can't because cannabis is so complex

1216
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:54,399
so chemically complex we can't really

1217
00:54:51,798 --> 00:54:57,000
put our thumb on what potency is but

1218
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,720
ultimately it really is important I

1219
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,480
think and that's how people navigate

1220
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:03,318
safety with consumption of substances

1221
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,480
but is by knowing how potent it is and

1222
00:55:03,318 --> 00:55:08,838
how much I need to put in my body before

1223
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:11,000
I feel unsafe and we can't do that we

1224
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:13,558
need to do it cannabis needs that to

1225
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,039
happen I mean you need to have a number

1226
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:18,400
on the bottle of alcohol you need to

1227
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:21,400
have a milligrams on the prescription

1228
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,440
drugs it's just it's just common sense

1229
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,720
but cannabis is elusive in that way that

1230
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,200
we'll never I don't think we'll ever

1231
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:30,399
really figure out potency because it's

1232
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:33,118
so abstract and people are so different

1233
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,119
but there is there is a potency scale

1234
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,720
and we can get there and and it's just

1235
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:39,200
it takes a concerted effort with

1236
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:41,558
scientists and Industry and limiting

1237
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:45,118
cultivars so that you people can learn

1238
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:46,359
like this one is this strength well it

1239
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,599
takes it takes us back to the

1240
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:52,279
conversation we had with Alec on hash

1241
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:53,960
Church 5.0 episode 3 which is how

1242
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:56,400
accurate are those numbers because

1243
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,920
that's a whole new you know Warp that

1244
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,440
you're throwing into the game you've got

1245
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,000
customers that are buying Things based

1246
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,599
on numbers on a package you've got Labs

1247
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,960
that are incentivized to give big

1248
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:08,559
numbers because they know they're going

1249
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,519
to get your your business if you do and

1250
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,079
Alec was saying there's there's a sort

1251
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:15,639
of desentized if you are giving accurate

1252
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,318
numbers and they're not the numbers that

1253
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:20,920
the companies want to see and so you you

1254
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:22,880
know that to me is also playing like an

1255
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:25,960
enormous role so now someone's like oh I

1256
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,318
only smoke 25s but they're probably you

1257
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,920
know substantially lower than that in in

1258
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:33,000
the reality so that that really throws

1259
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,119
things there's so many things going on

1260
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,559
in this conversation there's the labs

1261
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,318
there's interlab I mean Alec can talk

1262
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:41,599
about you know within laab variability

1263
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:43,000
but there's also interlab variability

1264
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,400
right like people make mistakes in

1265
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,318
method development and you mis quantify

1266
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,960
or misidentify certain compounds and so

1267
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:54,519
even when you have the numbers are

1268
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:56,880
reported on a dry weight basis and the

1269
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:58,599
plant is 90% water

1270
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,400
right so even if you have two different

1271
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:03,119
lab analytics or two different studies

1272
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,000
you can't just put those studies

1273
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,160
together and Compare the numbers as if

1274
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,679
they're the same they were they were

1275
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,399
derived through different analytical

1276
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:12,759
methods different Growers you know

1277
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,280
different varieties and one thing that I

1278
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,200
I have a theory and it kind of makes

1279
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,079
sense to me we developed or we we we

1280
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:22,159
screened a lot of plants through the lab

1281
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:24,760
okay and consumed a lot of those plants

1282
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:26,920
in my opinion there's a sweet spot in

1283
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,760
between like 8 and 12%

1284
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:32,039
that people of a certain age group

1285
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:34,240
prefer that type of high okay and then

1286
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:36,079
younger kids they never really grew up

1287
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:37,919
with those things and so they don't they

1288
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,880
don't understand the head space that

1289
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:43,039
creates they grew up in the Afghan world

1290
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,440
where like 20 plus per plants punch you

1291
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,000
in the face and that's how you know that

1292
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,000
you're high right and so like I really

1293
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,199
think that like the perception of what

1294
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
is high is different between people in

1295
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:56,199
say their 40s to 60s you know I was

1296
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,760
laughing when bve said you know the

1297
00:57:56,199 --> 00:58:01,000
young kids it's like at one point in

1298
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,559
time that was true right we're not

1299
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,039
really the young kids anymore right um

1300
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:07,119
there's a whole generation of kids that

1301
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:11,160
grow up on pre-rolls that are like 25

1302
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:14,519
30% mixed with THC diamonds right so

1303
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:17,239
like to really study this you need a

1304
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:19,559
whole bunch of uniform grown samples of

1305
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:22,679
different THC concentration and

1306
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:24,400
different cohort groups and you know not

1307
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:25,759
just reference one study and say ah this

1308
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,240
we figured it out you know there's a lot

1309
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,319
of that that goes on the Cannabis

1310
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:31,719
industry we take a little snapshot of

1311
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:33,519
something that happens in the real world

1312
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:35,879
and we make this generalization of the

1313
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:38,639
way that it is right but I think that

1314
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,920
there's so many variables and there's so

1315
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:44,000
many differences between

1316
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:46,119
consumers that it really is a hairball

1317
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,239
that is is quite difficult to tease

1318
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:51,160
apart well even even the way they sorry

1319
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:52,879
go ahead no I was just going to say that

1320
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:56,960
I think that there's plants in that 8 to

1321
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:59,119
12% THC range it's not necessarily the

1322
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,920
chemical profile of the plant it's just

1323
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:05,119
how loud you're listening to the music

1324
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,358
right and it creates a certain headspace

1325
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,480
and there really is something to be said

1326
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:13,719
I believe I really do believe that like

1327
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:15,719
that 8 to 12% on a very clear like if

1328
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:18,598
you haven't used anything else that day

1329
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:20,598
that provides that clear kind of

1330
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:23,200
euphoric effect that you hear a lot of

1331
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:25,039
people of the 60s and 70s talking about

1332
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:26,919
right and let's face it like the

1333
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:28,640
majority of the weed they were smoking

1334
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,200
back then the ties and the the

1335
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:32,239
Colombians and the the you know the

1336
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:36,318
Highland Mexicans that kind of stuff

1337
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:40,279
it's not 25% THC right A lot of it comes

1338
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:42,000
in at that 8 to 12 range yeah um so I I

1339
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,160
think it has to do with this basic

1340
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,798
effect right like with th you take a

1341
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:48,199
little bit you kind of get up right but

1342
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:49,239
if you take a whole bunch more it brings

1343
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:51,558
you back

1344
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:54,159
down I kind of think it's the difference

1345
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:56,240
between getting high and getting stoned

1346
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:58,838
you know like you these these these

1347
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:00,838
extracts are a rocket ship to the moon

1348
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:04,719
the first time I ever smoked Sam's dry

1349
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:08,119
sift like I I I had never been that high

1350
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:09,798
in my life off of a bong rip um but then

1351
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:11,318
when I started doing the hash hits and

1352
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:13,440
was kind of trying to like wrap my head

1353
01:00:11,318 --> 01:00:15,920
around oh I got to like get off my high

1354
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:19,039
horse and produce products for people

1355
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:21,639
that aren't so Rippling strong not not

1356
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:24,000
everyone wants to take a rocket ship to

1357
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:26,000
the Moon just because 90% of the people

1358
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,440
around me do that doesn't really mean

1359
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,039
it's an accurate description of what you

1360
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,960
know Society kind of wants so you know I

1361
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:34,839
started making these haset and I hadn't

1362
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,199
really smoked in a long time I was like

1363
01:00:34,838 --> 01:00:37,838
I'm G to have to smoke these things and

1364
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:39,759
I'd go out on my electric skateboard and

1365
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:43,639
I'd pull out a hashit and have a couple

1366
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:47,119
of rips of you know like a 30% T THC

1367
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:48,759
hash and it was super mellow for me

1368
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:52,760
because I was you know I'd spent the

1369
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:56,000
last 25 years just ripping the strongest

1370
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:59,440
possible you know 60 70 plus percent and

1371
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,639
super concentrated 5 to 10% tpine

1372
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:05,400
content and it what I really found was

1373
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:07,679
it was just nice it was just relaxing it

1374
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:12,160
put me into a completely different head

1375
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:14,519
space and uh yeah I appreciate uh I

1376
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:16,639
appreciate that head

1377
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:18,400
space yeah and you know there's

1378
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,598
something that happens I think with H2 I

1379
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,200
just I posted something on Twitter

1380
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:25,920
earlier today I saw this kid rolling up

1381
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:27,960
a joint where the paper was like shatter

1382
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,000
essentially it was a pliable shatter and

1383
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,720
they just stuffed it like a cone and it

1384
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,599
was not only a total waste you know they

1385
01:01:31,719 --> 01:01:35,598
weren't they were smoking it and half

1386
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:38,280
the more of the THC was going off in the

1387
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,960
side stream than Ed their lungs but it's

1388
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:42,079
like it's kind of that frat boy

1389
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,519
mentality of like you know how much beer

1390
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:47,359
can we chug right and I just I don't

1391
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:50,038
think that you get the same head space

1392
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:52,480
it's almost like headro right it's like

1393
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:54,079
it's it's when you listen to music

1394
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,920
incredibly loud it's hard to hear all

1395
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:59,640
the subtly yeah right

1396
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:02,278
say like recording music you you that's

1397
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:04,000
why we use compressors and outboard gear

1398
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:05,519
right because audibly we're looking for

1399
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,079
the harmonics right we're looking to

1400
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:09,838
shape the frequen exactly right and

1401
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:12,798
you're touching on some stuff that I

1402
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:15,880
think about a lot is we have harmonics

1403
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:18,358
are fleeting right much like these voc's

1404
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:20,519
or these volatile compounds that we talk

1405
01:02:18,358 --> 01:02:22,440
about and to capture them in their

1406
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:24,838
perfect state is almost like chasing

1407
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,559
this like forever like it's forever

1408
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:28,400
chasing your tail you're trying to get

1409
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,920
that perfect moment whether it's an

1410
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,480
extract or you're it's the perfect

1411
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,880
moment when you're going to harvest it

1412
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,920
and you're going to dry it for this set

1413
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,079
amount of time and you're trying to

1414
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:40,200
encapsulate that moment you know that

1415
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:41,680
personal um what you think as a breeder

1416
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:43,318
as a or as a grower at that point in

1417
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:44,639
time what you're trying to that that

1418
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:47,079
moment in time that you're trying to

1419
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:48,798
capture and that's that's a forever

1420
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:50,240
moment and and bringing it back to what

1421
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:52,599
you're talking about it's it the

1422
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:54,798
subtleties are it's almost like the

1423
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:56,880
music's gotten so loud to your point

1424
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:59,559
where it's just blaring Ing and I don't

1425
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,920
hear anything but just noise and what

1426
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:05,319
you're talking about is getting back to

1427
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:09,680
the subtleties of harmonics in maybe an

1428
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:12,480
F Shiner F minor or a a g sustained

1429
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:15,078
chord you know or you know or something

1430
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,798
like that that allows you to as a user

1431
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:20,200
really get in touch with why you use

1432
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:21,679
cannabis and um the things that draw you

1433
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:24,159
into the plant and keep us all here

1434
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:26,798
talking about it and those subtleties I

1435
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:28,920
think you know more importantly or what

1436
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:32,199
gets us all up in the day to think about

1437
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:34,519
this you know and you know it's it's for

1438
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:36,480
whatever reason we're not bottlenecking

1439
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:39,000
I don't think I think we're just we're

1440
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,480
not selectively thinking about the whole

1441
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,278
gene pool as a as a as an industry in a

1442
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:45,199
in a way we're trying to monetize so

1443
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:47,838
much all the time that we're almost

1444
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:50,439
losing sight of what's important so can

1445
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:52,759
I can I comment on that um follow that a

1446
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,119
little bit is and and tied into um

1447
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:57,200
something that Ryan said and also

1448
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:58,760
something maybe our in the land race

1449
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:03,199
conversation that we could go down is

1450
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:05,240
that that the subtleties in people were

1451
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,719
were selecting plants for quite some

1452
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:10,078
time and a lot of them were selecting

1453
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:11,439
individual plants because they were

1454
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,039
smoking

1455
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:18,278
flower and or they're hand rubbing

1456
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:20,200
individual plants you know and that that

1457
01:04:18,278 --> 01:04:22,440
created all these populations with all

1458
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:24,838
this chemistry all around the world

1459
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,318
these land race based populations let's

1460
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:28,599
call them because I do believe once it

1461
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:31,920
leaves the land the kind of the race is

1462
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:34,838
over um but then the Afghan Ryan

1463
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,880
mentioned Afghan like that Afghan

1464
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:39,159
population to me there's such a big I

1465
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,200
mean it's had such a huge impact on

1466
01:04:39,159 --> 01:04:43,519
Modern

1467
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:45,679
cannabis but it was it wasn't selected

1468
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:48,639
for individual plants or individual

1469
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:51,879
traits as much as it was selected for

1470
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:53,558
ability to yield lots of resin and then

1471
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:55,920
what they did to that resin over time

1472
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:58,440
and volatilizing all a lot of the aromat

1473
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,599
and abusing it with heat and time and

1474
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,159
they were consuming a very different

1475
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:06,599
product than what they were selecting in

1476
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:09,598
a way so like the fact that the thing

1477
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:13,640
that be is the driver of modern

1478
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:16,400
cannabis came from a a population that

1479
01:05:13,639 --> 01:05:19,038
wasn't selecting for all of these traits

1480
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,119
that we're talking about individual like

1481
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,359
the Nuance the the the harmony the I

1482
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,200
mean the the the color and the the

1483
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:27,159
resonance and all that stuff right

1484
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:29,118
because it was lost they were selecting

1485
01:05:27,159 --> 01:05:33,278
literally for API they were selecting

1486
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:36,599
for the bulk power of oomph of hashish

1487
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:39,079
and on top of that they were consumers I

1488
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,798
mean think about it they were the the

1489
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:44,079
heads that you're talking about Marcus

1490
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:47,159
afan hash smokers dude they smoked lots

1491
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:48,960
of hash it was like a race you know like

1492
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:51,000
you know smoking like Sam will say like

1493
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,079
smoking the hubby bubbly only certain

1494
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,960
people could do that so like it was

1495
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:58,798
embedded in their culture also to like

1496
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:01,159
produce this massive API resin product

1497
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:03,278
and consume huge doses of it to get

1498
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:06,038
large amounts of THC in your system

1499
01:06:03,278 --> 01:06:08,719
versus the guys that were handling

1500
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:09,880
individual flow and like so it's like

1501
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:13,000
what I'm getting at is like the

1502
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:15,838
selective Pro process by the people that

1503
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,159
were developing these was so different

1504
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:19,838
and maybe there's some kind of weird

1505
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:22,639
perverse Twisted you know prohibition

1506
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:24,880
Story how that made it into our modern

1507
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:28,558
gene pool that we weren't actually

1508
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:31,358
selecting those traits it just got there

1509
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:34,200
all the dry all the dry sifters were

1510
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:37,000
definitely sifting they were breeding

1511
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:39,919
for resin because they were dry sifting

1512
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,358
whole Fields not smoking individual

1513
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,480
plants yeah and uh if you smoke

1514
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:48,159
individual plants like with ganja

1515
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:50,639
smokers then uh it it becomes possible

1516
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:54,038
to select the plants that you like the

1517
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:57,838
best whether it's high THC or t

1518
01:06:54,039 --> 01:07:01,720
particular tpine taster smell and uh it

1519
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:03,798
it it it's a much better way I mean if

1520
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:06,278
you don't smoke the plants that you're

1521
01:07:03,798 --> 01:07:08,400
breeding for uh

1522
01:07:06,278 --> 01:07:10,960
individually how the hell can you breed

1523
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,920
for what you want well and they were

1524
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,318
also you got to remember they were also

1525
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,639
kind of only doing selections on one

1526
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:18,639
half of the Cross right because they're

1527
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:21,078
we were selecting the females but the

1528
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,440
males were all being nobody was doing

1529
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:24,318
any select mes you were just getting

1530
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,880
what was around in the population so

1531
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:29,239
there was a real friction or drag in

1532
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,640
that genetic selection right there

1533
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:32,479
there's been some pretty significant

1534
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:35,118
things that have

1535
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,278
happened you know growing indoors and

1536
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:40,318
allowing more controlled crosses and use

1537
01:07:37,278 --> 01:07:43,599
of clones for like back cross programs

1538
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:45,719
stuff like that but moreover like STS

1539
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:47,640
and you know breeding two females

1540
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:49,919
together that kind of thing has really

1541
01:07:47,639 --> 01:07:52,318
changed the game because it allows us to

1542
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,119
start making positive genetic selection

1543
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:59,038
on both sides of the parents on both

1544
01:07:54,119 --> 01:08:00,559
sides of the cross right so also turning

1545
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:04,920
males

1546
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:08,839
female yeah yeah

1547
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:10,838
yeah yeah Davis had his hand up yeah I

1548
01:08:08,838 --> 01:08:13,480
just had a comment about that comment

1549
01:08:10,838 --> 01:08:15,920
earlier about Afghan populations I think

1550
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,319
the I think the situation is is that

1551
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:21,000
Afghan populations and varieties from

1552
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:22,920
Pakistan you're right about the uh

1553
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,439
selecting for resin content over

1554
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,000
individual plants but I think the

1555
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:30,198
reality is that those populations are

1556
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,319
very biodiverse and high in overall

1557
01:08:30,198 --> 01:08:35,599
resin uh content which is true but it's

1558
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:38,719
actually the westerners selecting just

1559
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:41,600
for the THC content which has kind of

1560
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:43,679
like changed the uh changed from like a

1561
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,719
diverse profile into like you know

1562
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:48,679
chasing THC again so the reality is like

1563
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:52,439
those type of populations like if you

1564
01:08:48,679 --> 01:08:54,039
actually go and collect wild um Afghan

1565
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:56,000
and Pakistan populations you're going to

1566
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:58,920
find a lot of CBD

1567
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,920
actually like equal equal quantities so

1568
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:03,759
the reality is that because we've

1569
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:06,119
artificially selected in the West for

1570
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:08,279
only THC we've actually bred out a lot

1571
01:09:06,119 --> 01:09:10,318
of the traits that naturally exist there

1572
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:12,239
so it's not actually that it's like high

1573
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:16,520
cannaboid content it's that we've only

1574
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:16,519
selected one pathway from

1575
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:22,798
it

1576
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,600
yeah I have a question for Sam um you

1577
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:26,679
know out of the all the you know

1578
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,920
so-called land stuff that I've collected

1579
01:09:26,679 --> 01:09:32,359
over the years and decades I you know

1580
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,759
the stuff out of Iran of of Iran has

1581
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:36,679
been the

1582
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:39,359
most hybrid like that I've ever seen

1583
01:09:36,679 --> 01:09:40,199
like every single thing I've gotten from

1584
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,079
that

1585
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:46,519
region what do you think that's due to

1586
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:46,519
do you think that that region is

1587
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:53,920
selecting first of all I first of all I

1588
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:56,119
strongly suspect that a lot of the

1589
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:59,679
Iranian population

1590
01:09:56,119 --> 01:10:02,359
that we see today are coming from

1591
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:06,279
Afghanistan Pakistan because let me tell

1592
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:10,799
you they were heavy and hardcore on

1593
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:15,559
cannabis in in Iran in the 60s 70s 80s

1594
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:18,360
90s so where did the big population land

1595
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:20,880
races come from I think they were

1596
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:22,960
imported got it well that makes a lot of

1597
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,239
sense because I that's exactly what I

1598
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,840
always thought I was like how is this

1599
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:28,799
even possible how are these plant so

1600
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:31,000
good like there hasn't really been an

1601
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,640
ability to really grow these things the

1602
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:37,640
way that we envision them in the Western

1603
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,360
World um to laws right so Mojave said

1604
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:41,280
something really interesting earlier

1605
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:42,799
about you know once you take the plant

1606
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:45,119
out of the country it's no longer a land

1607
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,600
race it's not even that the definition

1608
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:51,439
of a land race is like a biological type

1609
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:53,960
that is maintained by a culture right as

1610
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:56,158
soon as the culture is gone they're the

1611
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,960
people yeah it's yeah exactly it's man

1612
01:10:56,158 --> 01:11:00,079
and it's it's human and environment and

1613
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,520
so once that human use like for example

1614
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:04,600
tie sticks right like they were selected

1615
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:10,000
for all those traits because that's what

1616
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:12,400
tied well to the stick yeah right um so

1617
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,079
yeah once you take a plant population

1618
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:16,198
away from its land and it's and the

1619
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:18,679
culture that is responsible for ushering

1620
01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:22,039
that breeding system you really are

1621
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:25,000
changing it yeah um and and like let's

1622
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:27,119
face it as well Farmers cannabis farmers

1623
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,719
are different than all other Farmers

1624
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:31,238
they want to grow better crops every

1625
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:32,840
year right so realistically if you're

1626
01:11:31,238 --> 01:11:34,319
thinking that you've gone to any of

1627
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:36,640
these places in the last 20 years and

1628
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:38,639
you're collecting land races you're not

1629
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:41,199
collecting the plant that was there in

1630
01:11:38,639 --> 01:11:43,119
the 60s and 70s right like people have

1631
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:46,279
been bringing in seeds and cannabis is a

1632
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:49,279
prolific outcrosser like we all know um

1633
01:11:46,279 --> 01:11:51,039
so I I really I'd be remarkably

1634
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:53,840
surprised if these things were as they

1635
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:55,279
were back in time because there's been

1636
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,480
so much money spent all over the world

1637
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:59,759
World in crushing these populations and

1638
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:03,439
crushing the cultures that produce

1639
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,600
them and also Ryan um that another thing

1640
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:08,000
happened is well not to mention all the

1641
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:10,199
all the our influence in terms of put

1642
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,639
bring sending genetics back around the

1643
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:14,119
world you know so what is the land race

1644
01:12:12,639 --> 01:12:16,520
and how much have it stayed in that land

1645
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:19,639
but if you really think about I mean my

1646
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:22,080
my uh family history with like cannabis

1647
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:24,760
in Mexico and South America was like you

1648
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:26,840
know by the 60s Americans were going

1649
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,960
down there and they were heavily

1650
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:31,679
influencing the selection

1651
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,800
process it was it was no longer just the

1652
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:35,920
local guy in aapo who's just like this

1653
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,279
is our family thing by the time they

1654
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,039
came down and said yeah we'll take some

1655
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:41,359
of this but can you plant another field

1656
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:43,679
of that over there I'll be back next

1657
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:45,920
year oh and this one was good how about

1658
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:49,920
that one it's like it really became an

1659
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:53,199
export product in the 60s and 70s so a

1660
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:56,639
lot of the the original selection forces

1661
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:59,158
had shifted towards export to a western

1662
01:12:56,639 --> 01:13:01,000
culture so getting back to like what was

1663
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:02,879
that original selective force and why

1664
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,079
did that people in that culture and that

1665
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:09,159
geography and that genan pole genan pool

1666
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:12,039
structure itself that way is really you

1667
01:13:09,158 --> 01:13:15,238
know it's it's it's so far it's such a

1668
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:18,158
Prohibition story you know um about how

1669
01:13:15,238 --> 01:13:20,799
prohibition shifted all of that and land

1670
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:22,799
how we landed where we are today and now

1671
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,400
I see like people here in California and

1672
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,880
you know I love the idea of bringing

1673
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:29,119
diversity back back into the market but

1674
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:32,119
people using the word land race to sell

1675
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:34,119
cannabis and to say this is a land race

1676
01:13:32,119 --> 01:13:36,399
or I use this land race cross it's just

1677
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:38,559
like it's I get it it's just

1678
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:40,119
bastardization of the word but it also

1679
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,840
to me there's a little bit of a cultural

1680
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:43,920
appropriation thing there's some

1681
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,760
protocols some International treaty

1682
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,679
stuff it's like you get into a really

1683
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:52,119
weird space Not only that M but how do

1684
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:54,039
you maintain a land race with less than

1685
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:57,920
thousands of males and thousands of

1686
01:13:54,039 --> 01:14:00,198
females you it changes every year well

1687
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:04,000
they were even back then they weren't

1688
01:14:00,198 --> 01:14:07,198
one thing much slower basis yeah

1689
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,560
yeah vers exitu I think is what what you

1690
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:12,119
we if you like land race population

1691
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:15,840
exitu means like we took this population

1692
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:17,319
and now we are altering it yeah so

1693
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,000
that's what brought this up ultimately

1694
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:22,158
is like I wanted to hear from the group

1695
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,719
because I out of everything I've grown

1696
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:28,638
like none it's all hybrids like I don't

1697
01:14:25,719 --> 01:14:30,600
I mean let's be real like it's there's

1698
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:32,600
nothing I've looked at was like oh yeah

1699
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,360
like I haven't seen that trait before in

1700
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:38,719
some form of a fashion or another you

1701
01:14:34,359 --> 01:14:41,880
know um it's just maybe um it that line

1702
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:43,119
could be improved um but I've I don't

1703
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,359
know I don't know if anyone on here has

1704
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:48,960
seen things they have yet to truly see

1705
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:51,158
but it seems to me like there's um a lot

1706
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,198
of social appropriation there's a lot of

1707
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:54,559
um

1708
01:14:52,198 --> 01:14:56,238
misinformation and a lot of you know

1709
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,000
quite frankly hot air that's being blown

1710
01:14:56,238 --> 01:15:01,319
around and sure these regions have great

1711
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,079
respective Gene poles and we should be

1712
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:04,880
dipping into them and and working with

1713
01:15:03,079 --> 01:15:07,479
them in some respect but we also have to

1714
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,279
recognize what they are and um what are

1715
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:10,839
we actually after here you know and

1716
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:14,719
there's a lot of Sam in there let's just

1717
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:16,600
all be honest Sam say that like G is KH

1718
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,279
okay so you know when you're around

1719
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,760
that's right everybody knows that

1720
01:15:18,279 --> 01:15:23,719
everything is half skunk okay that's

1721
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:26,400
what I'm saying okay now this

1722
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:28,920
Sam all right this is where I want to

1723
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:31,479
introduce uh a friend of mine who I had

1724
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:34,199
come in who's my mentor who I've been

1725
01:15:31,479 --> 01:15:36,238
working with at the international level

1726
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:37,919
um his name is Michael krowitz and of

1727
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:41,718
course many of you on this panel know

1728
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:44,800
him or uh know Ethan and Sam Etc because

1729
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:47,079
uh he's an OG cannabis collector but one

1730
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:50,600
of the things that has been worked on is

1731
01:15:47,079 --> 01:15:53,840
this thing called the grock treaty g r a

1732
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:56,239
KT and it's a new treaty having to deal

1733
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:59,400
with land racism those land races that

1734
01:15:56,238 --> 01:16:01,479
were stolen so I want to introduce

1735
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:03,279
Michael because he's my mentor and also

1736
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:05,839
a part of the veterans Action Council

1737
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:08,158
which is a national and international

1738
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:10,400
organization and uh have him speak on

1739
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:12,439
the grock treaty and then uh I did bring

1740
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:14,519
him on because he he's one of those

1741
01:16:12,439 --> 01:16:17,119
amazing collectors so he has some

1742
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:19,480
amazing cannabis artifacts that I just

1743
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:22,198
wanted him toh Show and Tell and bring

1744
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:26,399
him on so Michael

1745
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:29,519
welcome thanks itan I um put in the chat

1746
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:31,158
the link to that treaty um a little

1747
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:35,719
while ago

1748
01:16:31,158 --> 01:16:38,719
actually um I was answering

1749
01:16:35,719 --> 01:16:38,719
um

1750
01:16:40,359 --> 01:16:48,880
Colin uh so the um International

1751
01:16:45,158 --> 01:16:52,039
treaties have sort of slowly caught up

1752
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:54,960
to the Past um I was very very uh

1753
01:16:52,039 --> 01:16:58,719
thrilled to have um a little bit of

1754
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:01,319
input from our our Mentor inous here uh

1755
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:03,760
Sam The skunkman Who U made an

1756
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:06,759
appearance in Vienna um at the

1757
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:12,000
international meetings to speak about

1758
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:14,320
the need to work on on this um end of

1759
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,520
of I don't know what you'd call it

1760
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:21,359
sustainability paying back paying

1761
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:23,679
forward U it's uh it's about respect

1762
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:27,599
respect for indigenous peoples

1763
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:31,560
communities uh stakeholders but also

1764
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:32,920
small craft farmers and they're craft

1765
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:35,560
and they're they're not just their

1766
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:38,399
genetic resources but most especially

1767
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:40,600
and importantly the knowledge base that

1768
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:42,839
comes along with the genetic resources

1769
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:46,400
on how to turn these genetic resources

1770
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:47,960
into products and I I would go so far as

1771
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:52,000
to say everything that you've said so

1772
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:53,920
far uh has been remarkably cool but also

1773
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,800
fits into that category you know these

1774
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,920
these this is the traditional knowledge

1775
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:03,560
that you're working on building a new

1776
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:06,840
craft of traditional knowledge um the uh

1777
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:09,360
this this particular um set of treaty

1778
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:11,119
meetings culminated a

1779
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:15,439
25-year

1780
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:17,198
negotiation um to create a a first ever

1781
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:19,638
International working document that

1782
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:21,960
takes the conventional bi convention on

1783
01:18:19,639 --> 01:18:24,960
biological diversity

1784
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:29,719
the ngoya protocol and other things that

1785
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:32,119
have been designed to create u a u a

1786
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:36,520
good working relationship between

1787
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:39,880
industry and and uh stakeholders

1788
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:43,199
um and and Nations and and their

1789
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:45,600
citizens and stakeholders um and in

1790
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:48,839
Industry um but to take it one step

1791
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:51,600
further to actually come to some sort of

1792
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:53,000
agreement quantifying you know exactly

1793
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:57,120
what it is

1794
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:59,399
that that um we're talking about um and

1795
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:01,000
coming up with some concrete ways you

1796
01:18:59,399 --> 01:19:04,079
know they didn't go so far as to come up

1797
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,319
with sort of uh real you know what we

1798
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:09,198
would call real enforcement mechanisms

1799
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:12,119
but at least there is now International

1800
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:14,359
agreements that make it uh possible to

1801
01:19:12,119 --> 01:19:16,760
foreclose on those that commit fraud at

1802
01:19:14,359 --> 01:19:19,079
least and and and you know do some of

1803
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:21,560
the more egregious things that we feel

1804
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:25,279
like are being done in in that you know

1805
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:29,239
genetic um land race community this is

1806
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:31,279
about you know the seeds that we took

1807
01:19:29,238 --> 01:19:33,678
back in backpacks full of weed in the

1808
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:36,920
60s um going all the way back to the

1809
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:39,279
1860s to the 1960s so this is

1810
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:42,760
generational many many many generations

1811
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:44,439
of Damage Done by colonialism um I never

1812
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,440
thought as a cannabis activist that at

1813
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:48,799
some point I would be sort of butting

1814
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:50,198
heads with colonialism and trying to

1815
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,360
tear down some of the last

1816
01:19:50,198 --> 01:19:54,198
infrastructure that's built out of iron

1817
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:55,439
and although Rusty is not going anywhere

1818
01:19:54,198 --> 01:19:57,919
too easily

1819
01:19:55,439 --> 01:20:00,599
um but that's exactly what that

1820
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:04,440
was Michael let me interrupt for one

1821
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:07,600
second did do you know of any Seed

1822
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:10,238
Company in today's world that is

1823
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:13,280
bringing land race seeds from various

1824
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:16,919
countries which is obeying these

1825
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:19,198
treaties and kicking back to the uh

1826
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:22,440
original grow I don't know of

1827
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:24,039
any not yet and and your sentiment in

1828
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:25,599
that regard was well received at the

1829
01:20:24,039 --> 01:20:27,920
United Nations

1830
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,639
I I can tell you um and this is planting

1831
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:32,359
you know planting new seeds of of change

1832
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:35,119
that hopefully will lead to those types

1833
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:38,839
of relationships which are healthy and

1834
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:41,439
sustainable but also give us access to

1835
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:44,000
these special plants that give us these

1836
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:45,839
special characteristics that are our

1837
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,319
future well

1838
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:50,520
unfortunately we have access right now

1839
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:53,759
because people are just liberating them

1840
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:57,679
for the Revolution and uh they but they

1841
01:20:53,760 --> 01:21:01,360
don't kick back anything of any

1842
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:03,000
significance yeah yeah I I think that

1843
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:06,158
you know there was one conversation I

1844
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:09,520
had the Thai cannabis Corporation was

1845
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:12,238
very concerned that the efforts to work

1846
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:15,400
on uh these treaties and and

1847
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:17,959
negotiations might actually stifle

1848
01:21:15,399 --> 01:21:19,519
progress stifle Innovation and that was

1849
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,880
a very good question I thought about it

1850
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,080
for quite a while did some research and

1851
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,400
came back with a no it wouldn't and the

1852
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:27,479
reason why is because it moves too fast

1853
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:29,960
genetics you know you're only a couple

1854
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:32,000
of years away from the next big

1855
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:35,158
discovery of something that's very

1856
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,760
specific to a particular place you know

1857
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:41,638
a land race that hasn't been really

1858
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:43,440
discovered yet and U created yet even so

1859
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:45,400
I think the that's where the future is

1860
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:47,799
we've we've disconnected ourselves

1861
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:49,839
because of the drug war the drug war has

1862
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:53,239
very adversely affected us as a people

1863
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:55,800
and made us first smoke more weed we we

1864
01:21:53,238 --> 01:21:58,079
actually ate more C and things before

1865
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:00,600
prohibition and also growing indoors

1866
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:02,840
absolute aberration which will be

1867
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:05,480
corrected the treaty you're talking

1868
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:07,679
about in fact they want you to share

1869
01:22:05,479 --> 01:22:11,479
with the government and with the

1870
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:14,279
original Growers and it the governments

1871
01:22:11,479 --> 01:22:17,000
that were suppressing the original grow

1872
01:22:14,279 --> 01:22:18,198
so it's a bit loyy Yeah well and the

1873
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
other thing with any International

1874
01:22:18,198 --> 01:22:22,479
treaty it's kind of self voluntary if

1875
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,198
you want to be part of it right like

1876
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:26,519
North America United States and Canada

1877
01:22:24,198 --> 01:22:29,119
they're not part of the nego protocol

1878
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:30,639
good let me let me speak to that because

1879
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:32,840
that's a really interesting point that I

1880
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:35,440
also did some really intense research on

1881
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:37,719
not that long ago and uh this was in

1882
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:40,799
communication with our US Government the

1883
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:42,800
United States government uh was to say

1884
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,920
an outlier in these negotiations in

1885
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,760
Geneva would be putting it mildly they

1886
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:48,679
were a thorn in everybody's side they

1887
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,440
were a bur under the saddle of any

1888
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:51,960
progress um so they're not you know

1889
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:53,678
we're not talking about Old Colonial

1890
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:55,800
damage we're talking about ongoing

1891
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:58,800
damage from some these countries first

1892
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,880
but second um the thing is they do apply

1893
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,039
and the reason why they apply and this

1894
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,279
is coming straight from the US

1895
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:04,359
government's mouth basically I'm trying

1896
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:05,639
to quote as best I can um the reason why

1897
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:07,119
we have to comply is because the vast

1898
01:23:05,639 --> 01:23:08,560
majority of our stakeholders in our

1899
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:10,198
International Community are applying

1900
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:13,480
these treaties they're going into

1901
01:23:10,198 --> 01:23:16,119
Commerce rules and and U international

1902
01:23:13,479 --> 01:23:18,479
trade agreements that supersede you know

1903
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:20,760
that are actually Financial based but

1904
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:23,839
they're based on countries that are very

1905
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,480
willing and very we had like 35 40

1906
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,800
countries that immediately signed this

1907
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:30,079
treaty and put it into Force at the

1908
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:32,199
objection of and and over the body of

1909
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:35,279
the United States the other countries

1910
01:23:32,198 --> 01:23:37,359
are setting these rules up in their

1911
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:40,960
trade and if we can bolster that

1912
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:42,799
activity as a cannabis uh you know um

1913
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,520
industry that would be great but even if

1914
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,600
we don't the world will have to conform

1915
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,360
to these trade rules because otherwise

1916
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:52,280
you have no one to trade

1917
01:23:48,359 --> 01:23:55,158
with yeah the other thing is the Growers

1918
01:23:52,279 --> 01:24:00,319
are not really necessar necessarily the

1919
01:23:55,158 --> 01:24:04,319
Breeders they are the uh Trustees of the

1920
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:06,559
genan pool at the present time because

1921
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:09,399
the history goes back hundreds of years

1922
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:11,000
for many of the Afghan and Thai and

1923
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:13,759
Colombian

1924
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,560
varieties Chris Chris had his hand up he

1925
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:18,920
he wanted to ask a question as well see

1926
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:22,560
yeah so this ties into kind of what

1927
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:24,880
Michael and Sam have been speaking on

1928
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,159
and I was just wondering kind of what

1929
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,760
what does this benefit sharing actually

1930
01:24:27,158 --> 01:24:30,920
look like you know Sam mentioned that

1931
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:33,400
the Growers are not necessarily the

1932
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:36,119
Breeders and also that the government

1933
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:38,079
gets a cut is it solely Financial like

1934
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:40,279
um the recommendation to give back how

1935
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:42,600
do you identify who the kind of the

1936
01:24:40,279 --> 01:24:45,599
beneficiary of these of these benefits

1937
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:47,679
uh actually are and um

1938
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,920
yeah Michel

1939
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:51,960
speak yeah that that was actually

1940
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:55,239
something that uh that you got me

1941
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,800
started on Sam uh thinking about this uh

1942
01:24:55,238 --> 01:24:58,959
very hard and we actually put a

1943
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:01,119
committee together to think about this

1944
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,158
to try to figure out exactly how um

1945
01:25:01,118 --> 01:25:04,679
there's a couple of things I'll say

1946
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:07,439
about it just broadly one is that our

1947
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:09,560
our our cannabis team for what it's

1948
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:12,359
worth agreed that this was

1949
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:14,920
forward-looking that this wasn't about

1950
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:17,759
um you know coming up with sanctions to

1951
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:20,760
correct the past um that this was you

1952
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:23,360
know forward looking negotiations that

1953
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:25,239
would affect ongoing and future

1954
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:29,479
agreements so you know we're not talking

1955
01:25:25,238 --> 01:25:32,000
about you know what do you call it uh uh

1956
01:25:29,479 --> 01:25:34,198
corrective measures of the past you know

1957
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,439
monies or something like that and uh as

1958
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:39,238
far as the government um I don't see the

1959
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:42,158
government getting money either like

1960
01:25:39,238 --> 01:25:43,638
let's say uh a big company goes down and

1961
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:47,079
and comes up with some seeds for a

1962
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:50,319
cannabis product um from you know a

1963
01:25:47,079 --> 01:25:52,880
country near the equator and comes back

1964
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:54,559
with an agreement with the the actual

1965
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:57,319
breeder

1966
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:59,360
um and the and the Growers that is

1967
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:01,840
financial and the community the local

1968
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:02,920
community the the those who are in the

1969
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:05,719
that

1970
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:08,440
traditional knowledge Loop I'd say at

1971
01:26:05,719 --> 01:26:13,439
the local level would get financial

1972
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:17,359
monies and and uh shares and you know uh

1973
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:20,039
ongoing support uh product uh uh you

1974
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:21,880
know uh connection you know with this

1975
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:24,399
with this ongoing product the the

1976
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:26,639
country would get things too though like

1977
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:28,519
like from a let's say a large corporate

1978
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:31,239
player like that could easily work with

1979
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:34,719
their National museums their National

1980
01:26:31,238 --> 01:26:37,399
libraries and their National um uh

1981
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:39,960
educational programs to create uh

1982
01:26:37,399 --> 01:26:42,079
structured programs of learning about

1983
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:44,039
these peoples and these products it's a

1984
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:46,039
a point of national pride National

1985
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:48,840
Heritage and and it's important

1986
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:51,639
academically as well as uh the country

1987
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:54,279
itself benefits from the the being in

1988
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:56,880
the loop so to speak and getting the you

1989
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:59,238
know this uh type of support allows them

1990
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:02,000
to better better support their citizens

1991
01:26:59,238 --> 01:27:04,559
so you can sort of look at a carer with

1992
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,679
tourism you know the way a national

1993
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,480
government brings in tourists but then

1994
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:12,399
they put them into the local community

1995
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:12,399
it gets the funds

1996
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:18,399
essentially interesting

1997
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,238
stuff I just want to also congratulate

1998
01:27:21,479 --> 01:27:26,039
the reason why Michael's been working at

1999
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:28,799
in the United Nations since

2000
01:27:26,039 --> 01:27:31,920
1997 and uh he's been guiding me for the

2001
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:33,920
past uh four years uh there specifically

2002
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,359
but uh yeah he went there at the beest

2003
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:39,279
of Jack herrer and others uh and Dennis

2004
01:27:36,359 --> 01:27:40,920
Peron and um he is the reason why

2005
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:43,719
medical cannabis has been legal

2006
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:45,560
worldwide since December 2020 him and

2007
01:27:43,719 --> 01:27:48,960
his team helped change the law at The

2008
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:51,880
Who and at the United Nations level so

2009
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:54,560
this is the caliber uh that we're we're

2010
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:56,719
having today on and speaking we're not

2011
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,520
just talking about changing the world

2012
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:01,760
we're working toward it and the group uh

2013
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:04,440
I'm am I'm he's mentoring me as I work

2014
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:08,360
at the U we're trying to change the uh

2015
01:28:04,439 --> 01:28:10,359
international law by 2030 2029 2030 to

2016
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:14,079
remove cannabis from the most dangerous

2017
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:15,880
drug category so it will no longer no no

2018
01:28:14,079 --> 01:28:20,000
people will no longer be executed for

2019
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:22,118
cannabis around the world so that is the

2020
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,840
higher level work we're working toward

2021
01:28:22,118 --> 01:28:25,880
because last year while we were at the

2022
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:28,159
UN three people were executed in

2023
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:30,480
Singapore just for discussing they

2024
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:33,599
didn't even handle the Cannabis people

2025
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:36,799
so unfortunately um we're out there

2026
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:40,760
countering our enemy which is Kevin sbet

2027
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:45,119
who is uh the main liar who uh countries

2028
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:47,280
like China and uh Pakistan uh Russia and

2029
01:28:45,118 --> 01:28:50,118
others are using his language to

2030
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:52,639
continue to execute and kill people and

2031
01:28:50,118 --> 01:28:54,319
imprison them all over cannabis and I

2032
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:56,400
just want to give a major thank thanks

2033
01:28:54,319 --> 01:28:58,279
to Michael crowz and his team for what

2034
01:28:56,399 --> 01:28:59,759
they have done and I'm humbled to just

2035
01:28:58,279 --> 01:29:03,238
to be a part and hope that we can

2036
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:06,440
achieve what we're trying for by 2030 so

2037
01:29:03,238 --> 01:29:11,519
at the same time countries like Pakistan

2038
01:29:06,439 --> 01:29:13,599
are going to permit medical at least

2039
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,800
just the way Morocco has

2040
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,880
changed correct yeah and Morocco is

2041
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:21,039
allowing for medical now too so it's

2042
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:24,279
it's a it's a huge change and uh we we

2043
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:27,039
all owe a gret of attitude and thanks to

2044
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:30,279
Michael and others and that entire team

2045
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:33,198
the battle is battle is not done until

2046
01:29:30,279 --> 01:29:36,920
every citizen everywhere can grow for

2047
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:38,479
any reason as as long as it's safe for

2048
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:41,760
consumers

2049

01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:02,280
best conversations come from it when

01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:04,879
there's just a lot of us and we can kind

2082

2103
01:31:53,960 --> 01:32:02,399
talk quite a bit in the

2104
01:31:56,118 --> 01:32:05,799
chat but uh yeah um ATN had alluded to

2105
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:08,319
my uh sort of prehistory back in the 90s

2106
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:11,000
I I find it endlessly fascinating that

2107
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:13,359
he and I came up in the Cannabis

2108
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,760
movement completely parallel to each

2109
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:17,920
other I mean at certain points very very

2110
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:20,320
close we were actually working with uh

2111
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:22,800
cannabis Action Network and both working

2112
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:24,679
with Debbie goldsbury at the same time

2113
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,520
in the same place and but just didn't

2114
01:32:24,679 --> 01:32:30,158
cross pass that's probably the closest

2115
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:32,920
that we came um but um I came up and as

2116
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:35,679
as ATN handing out flyers at an info

2117
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:38,440
table and worked our way up to the

2118
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:41,199
higher echelons of the sort of the

2119
01:32:38,439 --> 01:32:43,919
thought process of the Cannabis movement

2120
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:46,799
um sort of the Special Forces if you

2121
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:49,118
will of the Cannabis movement uh you

2122
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:51,520
never heard about us I like to to say

2123
01:32:49,118 --> 01:32:54,479
I'm that guy you know when when you you

2124
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:58,000
say uh the Veterans Affairs policy on

2125
01:32:54,479 --> 01:33:00,519
marijuana oh that that guy or the uh you

2126
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:04,039
know International treaty and uh you

2127
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:11,080
know removing cannabis from uh schedule

2128
01:33:04,039 --> 01:33:13,880
4 yeah that guy um but uh it's it's um

2129
01:33:11,079 --> 01:33:17,079
really my prehistory to my activist

2130
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:19,639
history that comes out here and and that

2131
01:33:17,079 --> 01:33:21,880
really gives me so much uh joy and and

2132
01:33:19,639 --> 01:33:25,079
and feel so good in my heart because I

2133
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:28,039
actually was a cannabis of fishion a and

2134
01:33:25,079 --> 01:33:30,800
and lover in the 70s and if it weren't

2135
01:33:28,039 --> 01:33:32,519
for just some turns of events of you

2136
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:35,719
know the Cannabis movement sort of got

2137
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:39,080
derailed by the cocaine experience of

2138
01:33:35,719 --> 01:33:41,279
the 70s um and at that moment that's

2139
01:33:39,079 --> 01:33:43,399
when I was coming up right at the moment

2140
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:46,759
where the Cannabis movement had derailed

2141
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:48,679
and the president's cannabis uh you know

2142
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:51,000
program and legalization had been

2143
01:33:48,679 --> 01:33:52,600
derailed and there was all this Scandal

2144
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,719
so I joined the military I joined the

2145
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:56,920
machine instead

2146
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,600
and try to get a bird's eyee view I

2147
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:01,158
guess you'd say of the system from

2148
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:03,360
inside which actually worked remarkably

2149
01:34:01,158 --> 01:34:05,039
well I'll have to say you know that the

2150
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:06,960
work that I've done in the in the

2151
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:08,279
Veterans Affairs and stuff like that

2152
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,279
certainly could have never been done as

2153
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:13,158
a cannabis activist without me being a

2154
01:34:10,279 --> 01:34:15,599
veteran um and having that experience as

2155
01:34:13,158 --> 01:34:19,198
tough as it was I got broken up pretty

2156
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:21,960
bad in Guam USA uh have an artificial

2157
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:24,439
hip I no spleen some of those things as

2158
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:26,920
souvenirs of my military service

2159
01:34:24,439 --> 01:34:30,158
um but um no no combat or anything other

2160
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,880
than just uh you know poorly constructed

2161
01:34:30,158 --> 01:34:35,359
roadways on my on my way home from

2162
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:39,440
dinner and Guam but other than that but

2163
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:41,319
I think it's it's interesting um my

2164
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:42,919
childhood I grew up in the auction

2165
01:34:41,319 --> 01:34:44,799
business my father was a professional

2166
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:46,639
Auctioneer the president of the

2167
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:50,360
auctioneers Association that kind of

2168
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:53,960
stuff and uh I always have looked at

2169
01:34:50,359 --> 01:34:57,439
things from a historical perspective and

2170
01:34:53,960 --> 01:35:00,960
into the junk boxes and finding um you

2171
01:34:57,439 --> 01:35:03,319
know Antiques and things like that um

2172
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:05,399
you know that was very natural to me and

2173
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:07,198
and coming up in the Cannabis movement

2174
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:08,439
just gave me the information you know

2175
01:35:07,198 --> 01:35:10,319
this is one of my favorite little

2176
01:35:08,439 --> 01:35:15,158
bottles one of the first ones that I

2177
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:16,599
found cannabis corn medicine rwi was had

2178
01:35:15,158 --> 01:35:19,679
like a truck and they come around and

2179
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:22,079
sell you flavorings and medicines of all

2180
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:25,639
kinds and this had it was cannabis for

2181
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:27,519
corns alcohol ether and cannabis and if

2182
01:35:25,639 --> 01:35:30,800
you if it's had cannabis it was a

2183
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:31,880
painfree corn relief and that makes

2184
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:35,159
sense you

2185
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:38,039
know and cannabis wow that's got to be a

2186
01:35:35,158 --> 01:35:39,839
potent mix yeah yeah yeah ether and but

2187
01:35:38,039 --> 01:35:42,238
that wasn't to be drunk that was to put

2188
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:44,960
on your corns on your feet uh but it

2189
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:47,399
worked evidently there was like maybe 50

2190
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:51,800
different products that employed that

2191
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:53,920
that same recipe and um I think you know

2192
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:56,400
to our conversation to sort of tap into

2193
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:57,920
the conversation that's existing here I

2194
01:35:56,399 --> 01:36:01,879
think there's two things that are

2195
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:02,800
interesting um one is how they employed

2196
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:05,600
the

2197
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:08,239
Cannabis like with other herbal

2198
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:09,560
medicines this is a cannabis and talu

2199
01:36:08,238 --> 01:36:12,599
and

2200
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:15,280
Codine and these

2201
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:17,719
are specific medicines this is a pain

2202
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:21,319
relief as you can see a pharmacy siiz

2203
01:36:17,719 --> 01:36:23,760
jug um that used a low-level pain

2204
01:36:21,319 --> 01:36:26,158
reliever you could find Cannabis and

2205
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:27,960
every level of pain relief and each

2206
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:30,359
level pain relief would have a different

2207
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:32,079
herbal mix and I think that's one of the

2208
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:35,039
New Frontiers that we haven't reached

2209
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:37,719
yet as a people as a cannabis tribe if

2210
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:39,800
you will is integrating the other herbs

2211
01:36:37,719 --> 01:36:41,560
into our world and how does cannabis

2212
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:43,239
interact if you think you're having fun

2213
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:44,840
with tpin wait until you start bringing

2214
01:36:43,238 --> 01:36:48,519
the other herbs into the into the

2215
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:50,239
picture um to get a desired effect but

2216
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:52,679
they had almost you know I don't know if

2217
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:55,158
they perfected it but they certainly had

2218
01:36:52,679 --> 01:36:58,800
a handle on it back then with 75

2219
01:36:55,158 --> 01:37:00,479
different you know uh kind of gradient

2220
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:02,760
mixtures that they would apply for

2221
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:04,198
anxiety or for pain or for whatever and

2222
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:07,440
I think even more interesting our

2223
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:10,079
conversation here is how they overcame I

2224
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:12,678
guess you'd say the lack of knowledge of

2225
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:15,279
the specific cannabinoids because they

2226
01:37:12,679 --> 01:37:16,960
didn't even have a reading on THC it's

2227
01:37:15,279 --> 01:37:19,679
fun in the historical record to look at

2228
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:22,880
all the efforts to to try to isolate

2229
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:24,800
THC our our University got 12 pounds of

2230
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,600
cannabis we made extracts we did this

2231
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,760
test this test this test you can see

2232
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:31,719
them pulling their hair out in the lab

2233
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:35,239
trying to to isolate THC which of course

2234
01:37:31,719 --> 01:37:37,239
Dr micham did in the 1960s it was a long

2235
01:37:35,238 --> 01:37:41,359
time coming I'm talking about artifacts

2236
01:37:37,238 --> 01:37:45,238
in the 18 you know 1910 1930 1950

2237
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:48,319
1960 so anyway um what they did though

2238
01:37:45,238 --> 01:37:50,519
back then was they had specific Source

2239
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:52,439
material and this is really cool because

2240
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:54,639
it Taps into those land races it Taps

2241
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:57,439
into those specific spefic genetic

2242
01:37:54,639 --> 01:38:01,319
variations and and specific outcomes

2243
01:37:57,439 --> 01:38:03,000
that are uh geographically specific and

2244
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:05,079
what they did was they just used those

2245
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,520
medicines from those places they had

2246
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:09,960
cannabis indicia was from India cannabis

2247
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:12,800
africanis was from Africa and the [ __ ]

2248
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:14,679
pot cannabis Americana was uh up until

2249
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,520
the 1920s when they figured out how to

2250
01:38:14,679 --> 01:38:21,079
grow it better was pretty straggly

2251
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:24,440
looking from USA there was actually a a

2252
01:38:21,079 --> 01:38:27,118
discussion in the farm far pharmac

2253
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:29,000
pharmacological Association Journal as

2254
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:31,198
to whether they'd ever be able to grow a

2255
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,639
medicinal quality cannabis in the United

2256
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:36,000
States but uh Park Davis and Eli Lily

2257
01:38:33,639 --> 01:38:38,480
sent a team to India and learned how to

2258
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,039
do it is a a good documentary record of

2259
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:43,678
their test cases and and their efforts

2260
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:46,000
to create a quality cannabis Americana

2261
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:48,520
which evidently they they did do in the

2262
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,198
20s and 30s before it all got shut down

2263
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:54,400
by the marijon tax act but um yeah um

2264
01:38:52,198 --> 01:38:56,678
that's how they did it they

2265
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:58,439
uh Donnie worter I don't know if he's

2266
01:38:56,679 --> 01:39:00,560
published anything yet but he was

2267
01:38:58,439 --> 01:39:02,559
looking at that you know during an essay

2268
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:05,239
of the of the different products how

2269
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,800
they were employed how these specific

2270
01:39:05,238 --> 01:39:08,439
Geographic varieties and and

2271
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:11,599
geographically specific products were

2272
01:39:08,439 --> 01:39:13,519
employed in the end product um and and

2273
01:39:11,599 --> 01:39:17,039
you know sort of do a assessment of that

2274
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:18,400
and I think when you do you'll see that

2275
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:20,880
that's how they did it that's how they

2276
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:22,719
employed you know CBD predominant or

2277
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:27,199
whatever by just using the source

2278
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:30,079
material very carefully um but anyway um

2279
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:32,879
I think that the museum is particularly

2280
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:35,238
powerful I've got a couple of little uh

2281
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:38,039
sort of exhibits for you in what it can

2282
01:39:35,238 --> 01:39:41,158
do to show people their own history I'm

2283
01:39:38,039 --> 01:39:44,118
see if I can share screen here oh you

2284
01:39:41,158 --> 01:39:46,799
got a enable yes it's sorry it's a

2285
01:39:44,118 --> 01:39:49,158
default I don't know why they do that

2286
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:51,639
what I'm gonna show you here is uh I

2287
01:39:49,158 --> 01:39:54,238
actually as a collector and as an

2288
01:39:51,639 --> 01:39:57,159
antique person I came in contact with

every day you know entries like the

2304

Hindenburg crashed today I was late for

2306
01:40:38,079 --> 01:40:42,599
mind-blowing like insight into the past

2307
01:40:40,158 --> 01:40:45,598
but particularly cool and I'll show you

2308
01:40:42,599 --> 01:40:49,360
here is um being able to show people in

2309
01:40:45,599 --> 01:40:52,480
this case the people of Washington DC

2310
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:54,559
their own past and their own Collective

2311
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:56,399
history so here's this is an article

2312
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:58,400
that came out about those Diaries when

2313
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:00,238
we sort of made them work we put them

2314
01:40:58,399 --> 01:41:03,238
into action to show people their own

2315
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:05,079
history and to to make them real and and

2316
01:41:03,238 --> 01:41:06,598
have them do something this is an

2317
01:41:05,079 --> 01:41:07,519
article came out in the Washington Post

2318
01:41:06,599 --> 01:41:13,599
in

2319
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:16,560
2010 and it's got um the the

2320
01:41:13,599 --> 01:41:18,599
essence of it is this headline here us

2321
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:20,800
once studied weed at the site of the

2322
01:41:18,599 --> 01:41:21,920
Pentagon and this was something known to

2323
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:23,920
some of our researchers like Michael

2324
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:25,880
alich already knew this but the people

2325
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:29,079
of Washington DC didn't know this and

2326
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:32,440
what really helped them to know this um

2327
01:41:29,079 --> 01:41:35,279
since this header disappears here was

2328
01:41:32,439 --> 01:41:38,678
this picture that was in mixed with the

2329
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:40,960
Diaries and this is list Dewey on the

2330
01:41:38,679 --> 01:41:43,800
site that is now the Pentagon standing

2331
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:46,158
next to a stand of experimental US

2332
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:48,440
Department of Agriculture hemp plants

2333
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:50,079
and I love the Smile everybody that's

2334
01:41:48,439 --> 01:41:52,359
standing next to imp place has this sort

2335
01:41:50,079 --> 01:41:55,920
of I don't know it's a very interesting

2336
01:41:52,359 --> 01:41:58,279
sort of smile that they they have but

2337
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:00,359
that's one example of sort of making

2338
01:41:58,279 --> 01:42:02,158
this history work showing people their

2339
01:42:00,359 --> 01:42:05,559
own history and I wanted to give you

2340
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:08,079
another this is one more recent that

2341
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:11,000
came about as a result of our historical

2342
01:42:08,079 --> 01:42:12,359
work that uh led to the landmark change

2343
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,439
of the World Health Organization

2344
01:42:12,359 --> 01:42:17,719
position on medicinal cannabis this is

2345
01:42:14,439 --> 01:42:19,238
the international office on hygiene in

2346
01:42:17,719 --> 01:42:22,079
France

2347
01:42:19,238 --> 01:42:24,439
uh that they had were based in France at

2348
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:26,679
the time I think for they moved back and

2349
01:42:24,439 --> 01:42:28,638
forth to Geneva the predecessor of the

2350
01:42:26,679 --> 01:42:31,359
World Health Organization and that's the

2351
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:32,118
picture of those guys there and uh in

2352
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:35,359
this

2353
01:42:32,118 --> 01:42:37,679
article um that's an international

2354
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:41,639
Office of Public hygiene in this article

2355
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:43,760
we talk about the actual history of the

2356
01:42:41,639 --> 01:42:46,760
prohibition of cannabis because it came

2357
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:48,800
to our attention this is mostly work

2358
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:50,920
done by members of our team that spoke

2359
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,199
French because it was in the League of

2360
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:57,480
Nations artifacts and they're all

2361
01:42:53,198 --> 01:42:59,198
written in French and uh um they found

2362
01:42:57,479 --> 01:43:01,198
what would have to be called the true

2363
01:42:59,198 --> 01:43:04,359
history of international cannabis

2364
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:07,598
prohibition which started with patent

2365
01:43:04,359 --> 01:43:11,000
medicines from the United States

2366
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:13,199
specific ones uh I'm scrolling down to

2367
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
the photo here these are from my

2368
01:43:13,198 --> 01:43:17,519
collection and these are in the article

2369
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,760
the journal article I sh share the link

2370
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:23,119
um but neuralgic improved these are pain

2371
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:27,239
medicines from Park Davis made in Detro

2372
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:30,319
Detroit and um cazu Michigan um

2373
01:43:27,238 --> 01:43:34,000
neuralgic and it's got

2374
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:38,599
hyosus quinine cannabis but also

2375
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:41,800
morphine products um and and other you

2376
01:43:38,599 --> 01:43:44,520
know strict nine arsonate aconite you

2377
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:47,639
know there's a variety of different

2378
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:49,800
um you know materials that are in these

2379
01:43:47,639 --> 01:43:52,079
different products uh and again

2380
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:55,840
including things like morphine and

2381
01:43:52,079 --> 01:43:59,079
Codine as I described earlier and um the

2382
01:43:55,840 --> 01:44:01,560
thing is that they were outlawing

2383
01:43:59,079 --> 01:44:03,599
cannabis but in fact a lot of their

2384
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:05,560
complaints lined up more with the mix of

2385
01:44:03,599 --> 01:44:07,679
some of these you know rather strong

2386
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:09,760
medicines which my own personal theory

2387
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:11,760
is they were coming off of the market in

2388
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:14,599
the United States sort of surplus and

2389
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:17,159
being sold off on the street in Egypt um

2390
01:44:14,599 --> 01:44:18,760
and taken on the street and a heavy

2391
01:44:17,158 --> 01:44:21,118
patent medicine with morphine and

2392
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:24,520
cannabis drinking it like you know an

2393
01:44:21,118 --> 01:44:26,399
Elixir not a cool uh thing the police in

2394
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:28,040
Egypt were pretty freaked out about it

2395
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:29,960
the Egyptian government went to the

2396
01:44:28,039 --> 01:44:32,639
international authorities and found a

2397
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:34,039
very welcome greeting from you know

2398
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:36,279
countries like the United States with

2399
01:44:34,039 --> 01:44:39,079
our Harry anslinger and others that had

2400
01:44:36,279 --> 01:44:42,118
a very Colonial View of such such

2401
01:44:39,079 --> 01:44:44,960
activity so anyway it's interesting the

2402
01:44:42,118 --> 01:44:47,598
article is uh the Cannabis parlay at the

2403
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:50,118
League of Nations and I encourage you to

2404
01:44:47,599 --> 01:44:53,039
to check it out if you want but it shows

2405
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:56,238
you how these artifacts can be brought

2406
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:59,439
you know into life and and put into our

2407
01:44:56,238 --> 01:45:02,678
our our now and our future and that's

2408
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:04,399
the for me that's the the most fun of it

2409
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:06,480
I told ATN everybody the other day I

2410
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:08,638
feel like I'm trying to put a mosaic in

2411
01:45:06,479 --> 01:45:10,399
people's minds I feel like I'm a mosaic

2412
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:12,279
artist and I've got thousands of

2413
01:45:10,399 --> 01:45:13,719
artifacts in my mind and they fit

2414
01:45:12,279 --> 01:45:16,000
certain people certain groups certain

2415
01:45:13,719 --> 01:45:18,079
ways and when they all see what I see

2416
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,719
then I'm then I'm done then my work my

2417
01:45:18,079 --> 01:45:24,158
life work is done so but uh anyway

2418
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:26,439
that's that's the uh the cannabis Museum

2419
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:28,238
uh a little taste of the Cannabis Museum

2420
01:45:26,439 --> 01:45:31,359
anyway and I can show you this is the

2421
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:34,839
latest thing I just picked up at auction

2422
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:36,839

been a pretty good cough medicine you

2424
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:42,360
still got the cough medicine

2425
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:47,639
inside you can see the Cannabis indicia

in United

2428
01:45:50,118 --> 01:45:55,319
States so is that under 3% considered

2429
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:56,480
hemp and that's why you can mail that

2430
01:45:55,319 --> 01:46:00,359
[ __ ]

2431
01:45:56,479 --> 01:46:03,279
around um the antique medicines are

2432
01:46:00,359 --> 01:46:06,238
tricky and uh eBay for example will pull

2433
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:07,880
your items and be very mean to you if

2434
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:11,359
they find out that you're selling even

2435
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:14,599
antique medicines um so It's Tricky U

2436
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:16,479
but uh we found some our researchers

2437
01:46:14,599 --> 01:46:18,400
found what is the concentration of

2438
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:23,000
cannabis in that does it say on the

2439
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:26,839
front label yeah it's a very uh you know

2440
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:29,520
typical uh 8% alcohol five grains to

2441
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:33,880
each ounce of cannabis

2442
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:36,280
indicia yeah I mean um I got a very

2443
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:38,440
sensitive uh gas

2444
01:46:36,279 --> 01:46:40,840
chromatograph uh if you want to send me

2445
01:46:38,439 --> 01:46:42,839
a sample of that I I'll tell you how

2446
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:45,560
much is left in there be really

2447
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:47,679
interested so is that so that that the

2448
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:49,560
liquid that's in there is the original

2449
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:51,760
contents that was in the bottle you

2450
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:53,880
think yeah more than likely I mean it's

2451
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:55,639
it's uh it's been opened but it doesn't

2452
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:58,400
look like much has been removed there

2453
01:46:55,639 --> 01:47:00,960
there have been cannabis extracts that

2454
01:46:58,399 --> 01:47:02,399
we found in you know basement ofes that

2455
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,039
were in the dark for a hundred years

2456
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:06,559
that were still active I you can still

2457
01:47:04,039 --> 01:47:09,760
take them today so have you had that

2458
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:11,639
analyzed by a Cannabis Testing Lab

2459
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:14,039
everything that's in my possession is

2460
01:47:11,639 --> 01:47:15,480
going to be uh processed in the archive

2461
01:47:14,039 --> 01:47:19,639
that's the next step for the Cannabis

2462
01:47:15,479 --> 01:47:22,959
Museum on my end uh Donnie has a museum

2463
01:47:19,639 --> 01:47:25,159
exhibit up in um Ohio that you can

2464
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:27,639
actually go to it's a physical exhibit

2465
01:47:25,158 --> 01:47:29,839
also Ben jonkers has one in Amsterdam

2466
01:47:27,639 --> 01:47:31,880
and and Barcelona and then our friend

2467
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:34,920
Richard has one up in up in the hills in

2468
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:37,159
in Sonoma um at the moment those are the

2469
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:39,000
the displays but as far as working on

2470
01:47:37,158 --> 01:47:40,879
the artifacts in that way we haven't

2471
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,599
started that work yet th this has all

2472
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:45,199
been pilot work that I've been doing

2473
01:47:42,599 --> 01:47:48,599
forever I'm just I have a lot of

2474
01:47:45,198 --> 01:47:49,839
medicinal bottles of cannabis also yeah

2475
01:47:48,599 --> 01:47:52,319
yeah

2476
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:54,079
David probably the oldest artifact that

2477
01:47:52,319 --> 01:47:57,198
I know

2478
01:47:54,079 --> 01:47:58,800
a wooden cannabis container which would

2479
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:02,079
have been you what what would you say I

2480
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:06,400
was from Sam like 300 years ago it was

2481
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:09,920
like uh 1450s or 1550s something like

2482
01:48:06,399 --> 01:48:14,839
that but I have older I have seeds from

2483

2486
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:23,678
that day and I was like what are these

2487
01:48:22,158 --> 01:48:26,238

2488
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:28,239
of Millennia old cannabis seeds yeah

2489
01:48:26,238 --> 01:48:32,238
they were in the little Leather Pouch

2490
01:48:28,238 --> 01:48:35,000
found in this cinti grave PE tombs

2491
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:38,158
correct so Sam those are those are the

2492
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:40,560
Siberian or the the more alai ancient

samples is that right with the the woman

2494
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:49,599
I'd love to try to no not not from the

2495
01:48:44,198 --> 01:48:53,439
woman that work was done by uh Ethan oh

2496
01:48:49,599 --> 01:48:57,719
right with Hong and Jen right but I

2497
01:48:53,439 --> 01:49:00,799
I got seeds for helping the VIR the vavo

2498
01:48:57,719 --> 01:49:02,960
Institute St Petersburg who went visited

2499
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:06,560
and they gave me eight of the cannabis

2500
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:10,439
seeds from The Leather Pouch from the uh

2501
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:14,320
archaeologist rosino who uh excavated

2502
01:49:10,439 --> 01:49:17,198
the Pez tombs in about I think

2503
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:19,719
1949 would would you um maybe be

2504
01:49:17,198 --> 01:49:23,198
interested in sequencing the Genome of

2505
01:49:19,719 --> 01:49:26,439
those seeds that'd be um no I rather

2506
01:49:23,198 --> 01:49:29,359
keep them okay that's fine

2507
01:49:26,439 --> 01:49:32,118
too that's

2508
01:49:29,359 --> 01:49:33,799
F it's the that's insane like I'll tell

2509
01:49:32,118 --> 01:49:35,559
you when he threw them at me and I held

2510
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:39,840
them in my hand and he told me what they

2511
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:43,400
were I thought holy [ __ ] I've got maybe

2512
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:46,159
10 different ones that are you know 500

2513
01:49:43,399 --> 01:49:50,079
thousand years old but these are in a

2514
01:49:46,158 --> 01:49:53,000
unique position 2400 years

2515
01:49:50,079 --> 01:49:55,319
old saying there's a chance we could pop

2516
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,319
Sam

2517
01:49:55,479 --> 01:49:59,959
huh maybe some of the

2518
01:49:57,719 --> 01:50:02,000
500 with enough Bitcoin could we get

2519
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:06,000
them from you or what I mean I'm I'm

2520
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:08,520
just kidding no I I cannot be

2521
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:11,039
bought I'm afraid that's the way it

2522
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:15,800
works welcome to history Church ladies

2523
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:15,800
and gentlemen yeah the way it should

2524
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:23,639
be leave them in your will to be

2525
01:50:20,118 --> 01:50:26,039
uh to be explored

2526
01:50:23,639 --> 01:50:29,039
yes leave those to science if you if you

2527
01:50:26,039 --> 01:50:30,760
can there sir could those so here's a

2528
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:34,479
question for the group could those what

2529
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:37,719
could we learn from those um if there's

2530
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:40,799
if they were I mean sure we could map

2531
01:50:37,719 --> 01:50:43,399
them but what what Ethan found out when

2532
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:47,920
they analyzed the seeds which had been

2533
01:50:43,399 --> 01:50:51,319
frozen was that uh they were high THC

2534
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:56,239
variety got it you're not GNA learn a

2535
01:50:51,319 --> 01:50:58,599
ton by High I I I I me I might mean 5 10

2536
01:50:56,238 --> 01:51:03,158
or whatever percent but they had more

2537
01:50:58,599 --> 01:51:06,239
THC than than CBN or CBD or anything

2538
01:51:03,158 --> 01:51:08,598
else so they were a drug variety they

2539
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:11,759
were the highest THC for the lowest

2540
01:51:08,599 --> 01:51:14,039
dollar 2,400 years ago that you could

2541
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:16,280
that you could get this has been this

2542
01:51:14,039 --> 01:51:17,880
has gone on longer than 30 years I'm

2543
01:51:16,279 --> 01:51:20,920
sorry

2544
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:23,400
Debbie how many sexy shells does it take

2545
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:25,800
back then to get a seed

2546
01:51:23,399 --> 01:51:28,359
there was something else that the um

2547
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:31,239
this the seeds those seeds tell you from

2548
01:51:28,359 --> 01:51:33,920
their placement in the Tomb and you know

2549
01:51:31,238 --> 01:51:35,519
they in those old burial sites uh they

2550
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:39,199
had you know

2551
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:42,119
even their their slaves and and you know

2552
01:51:39,198 --> 01:51:44,158
some of their prize people you know in

2553
01:51:42,118 --> 01:51:46,158
the Tomb with them as well as some of

2554
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:47,559
their prize possessions lining the walls

2555
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:50,920
but then they'll have something right

2556
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:53,440
next to their body which is of extreme

2557
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:54,920
value to them and that's I where I

2558
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:56,919
understand those cannabis seeds were

2559
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:58,399
were found and it just reminds me of

2560
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:00,679
something you I was talking to these

2561
01:51:58,399 --> 01:52:03,000
reporters years ago and I was trying to

2562
01:52:00,679 --> 01:52:05,440
sort of you know connect with them and

2563
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,039
it just dawned on me that and this is

2564
01:52:05,439 --> 01:52:09,198
going back to my cannabis movement

2565
01:52:07,039 --> 01:52:11,319
experience and that sort of Grassroots

2566
01:52:09,198 --> 01:52:13,919
history lesson that I learned you know a

2567
01:52:11,319 --> 01:52:16,679
thousand Pages the handing out one at a

2568
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:18,880
time of Jack harr's books or whatever um

2569
01:52:16,679 --> 01:52:21,639
you know that cannabis has been involved

2570
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:23,840
in our lives as as humans in so many

2571
01:52:21,639 --> 01:52:26,319
ways over such such a continuous and

2572
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:28,960
long period of time that by telling the

2573
01:52:26,319 --> 01:52:31,519
story of the artifacts you get a sort of

2574
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:34,198
a lens into human history so it's more

2575
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:35,840
about you know what the plant and and

2576
01:52:34,198 --> 01:52:38,319
its relationship with us can tell you

2577
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:41,078
about us that this history tells us more

2578
01:52:38,319 --> 01:52:43,960
than then you know it it's own to me

2579
01:52:41,078 --> 01:52:47,439
it's amazing that there was no cannabis

2580
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:50,158
in the Americas pre- Columbus I mean

2581
01:52:47,439 --> 01:52:52,839
that's just amazing to me but it's

2582
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:55,238
apparently true yeah I thought it it

2583
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:59,119
went all the way back to gondan land too

2584
01:52:55,238 --> 01:53:03,759
but there is no reference until you know

2585
01:52:59,118 --> 01:53:05,960
L later on um uh specifically but um

2586
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,560
yeah I I can't thank you guys enough for

2587
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:10,560
sharing that that history I mean it

2588
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:13,199
helps us understand when I originally

2589
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:15,119
came to cannabis when I went in ' 89

2590
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:17,039
Jack herrer and de Debbie goldsbury were

2591
01:53:15,118 --> 01:53:19,279
at my University and when Debbie handed

2592
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:21,599
out that piece of fabric and I literally

2593
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:23,439
touched it and realized oh there was

2594
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:27,319
more to can

2595
01:53:23,439 --> 01:53:31,559
those tangible really holding pieces of

2596
01:53:27,319 --> 01:53:34,279
history have such an impact that Michael

2597
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:36,760
and skunkman Sam I mean when are you

2598
01:53:34,279 --> 01:53:39,039
guys gonna have this museum is there any

2599
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:42,000
sort of fundraising that's happening to

2600
01:53:39,039 --> 01:53:45,158
make this Museum a reality as opposed to

2601
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:48,000
all of y'all storing all houses I've

2602
01:53:45,158 --> 01:53:52,000
given up on my idea of opening the

2603
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,760
museum probably the best cannabis Museum

2604
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,880
from

2605
01:53:53,760 --> 01:54:01,000
both the medical and a uh recreational

2606
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:04,480
point of view is Ben roers in

2607
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:07,960
Barcelona that museum is pretty damn

2608
01:54:04,479 --> 01:54:10,078
cool yeah yeah Ben's done a fantastic

2609
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:12,800
job with with both the displays in

2610
01:54:10,078 --> 01:54:15,238
Amsterdam and Barcelona really um you

2611
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:17,840
know showcasing the history of cannabis

2612
01:54:15,238 --> 01:54:20,359
if you want to donate I the the couple

2613
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:22,520
museums I talked about up in Richards up

2614
01:54:20,359 --> 01:54:24,799
in Sona I don't know if he's actually

2615
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:28,239
accepting donations but I know Donnie is

2616
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:30,000
for the Cannabis Museum in Ohio um

2617
01:54:28,238 --> 01:54:31,519
Michael and Michelle Aldrich and others

2618
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,000
are working on a display in San

2619
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:36,000
Francisco which hasn't really kicked off

2620
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,520
yet but that'll be fundraising and then

2621
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,479
I'm going to be fundraising pretty soon

2622
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:42,719
here on the archive which I I'm G to

2623
01:54:40,479 --> 01:54:45,718
base unless something changes

2624
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:48,639
drastically right here where I'm at um

2625
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:51,800
in Virginia but that the archive is

2626
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:54,639
where we'll be really preserving the

2627
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:56,520
history more than anything because a lot

2628
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:58,679
of the archives of our own cannabis

2629
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:01,520
movement and stuff are being lost just

2630
01:54:58,679 --> 01:55:04,359
to entropy to to rain to water to bad

2631
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:06,040
roofs but also to like storage units and

2632
01:55:04,359 --> 01:55:08,000
and airs that don't care about things

2633
01:55:06,039 --> 01:55:09,840
that are throwing stuff out and stuff so

2634
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,679
we have a sort of a clock that we're up

2635
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:14,319
against to get this stuff into

2636
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:16,760
protective sleeves and and photographed

2637
01:55:14,319 --> 01:55:18,599
and up on archive uh once the archive is

2638
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:20,039
up and running you'll at least know what

2639
01:55:18,599 --> 01:55:21,960
we have you'll be able to go online and

2640
01:55:20,039 --> 01:55:24,238
see what's available and from that you

2641
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:26,840
can build build any number of displays

2642
01:55:24,238 --> 01:55:28,519
you know it's it this like hits really

2643
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:30,760
hard for me you know I was thinking

2644
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:33,320
about history and how we don't have

2645
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:36,520
reference points for things and you know

2646
01:55:33,319 --> 01:55:39,198
imagine if science didn't have mum or or

2647
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:43,040
something to look back on or art didn't

2648
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:45,879
have Monae to look at at perspective or

2649
01:55:43,039 --> 01:55:47,840
you know Mike lano's work to look at in

2650
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:49,480
terms of you know composition you know

2651
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:51,400
like there's just you could just go on

2652
01:55:49,479 --> 01:55:53,959
and on I could just keep talking about

2653
01:55:51,399 --> 01:55:56,799
this but the one thing I look at with

2654
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:59,279
breeding is like you know Sam you're

2655
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:01,159
respectfully in my world that for me

2656
01:55:59,279 --> 01:56:02,559
like I look at your work I try to study

2657
01:56:01,158 --> 01:56:05,279
like what did you use to make these

2658
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:07,639
things why did you I read a lot about it

2659
01:56:05,279 --> 01:56:10,198
and I think about a lot about that

2660
01:56:07,639 --> 01:56:13,039
because there's process there's there's

2661
01:56:10,198 --> 01:56:14,519
there's deep history that goes into what

2662
01:56:13,039 --> 01:56:17,000
you did and then the things that

2663
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:19,560
influence that and it keeps going and

2664
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:21,760
going and going and we seemingly have

2665
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:23,679
little snapshots much like the you know

2666
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:25,079
I think Ryan said it well like we have

2667
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:27,760
little snapshots of like what

2668
01:56:25,078 --> 01:56:29,840
individually each individual person's

2669
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:31,920
taste or what they're after is

2670
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:34,279
contributing to that said fenan or

2671
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:37,880
whatever it might be but it'd be really

2672
01:56:34,279 --> 01:56:40,840
great to understand um you know where we

2673
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:42,760
came from you know and and what did

2674
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:43,719
those individuals think about and what

2675
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:46,039
were those

2676
01:56:43,719 --> 01:56:48,039
influences and why did they make those

2677
01:56:46,039 --> 01:56:50,399
choices you know because that's

2678
01:56:48,039 --> 01:56:51,920
ultimately we're arriving at a really

2679
01:56:50,399 --> 01:56:52,799
interesting inflection point with all of

2680
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:55,399
this

2681
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:57,000
where never before have more plants been

2682
01:56:55,399 --> 01:56:59,439
growing around the world we're all

2683
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:02,960
researching racing towards lights and

2684
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:05,319
different interesting Concepts but you

2685
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:07,039
know we're forgetting you know like

2686
01:57:05,319 --> 01:57:09,519
Michael's work you know it's very it's

2687
01:57:07,039 --> 01:57:11,760
actually really important it's actually

2688
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:14,320
so important that we understand these

2689
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:16,320
reference points you know because that's

2690
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:17,719
um you know why should you have to make

2691
01:57:16,319 --> 01:57:20,078
the same mistake someone else already

2692
01:57:17,719 --> 01:57:21,800
made you know maybe that's a better way

2693
01:57:20,078 --> 01:57:23,519
of saying it maybe there's things you

2694
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:25,599
can learn from it that make your work

2695
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:28,360
that much better you know Mark imagine

2696
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:30,679
never reading Malcolm Mich right like

2697
01:57:28,359 --> 01:57:34,839
think you know like where would you be

2698
01:57:30,679 --> 01:57:37,480
you know so um you know I think it's

2699
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:39,679
important that we take this seriously

2700
01:57:37,479 --> 01:57:41,399
and we really look at it from a a real

2701
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:43,359
lens I mean you could laugh about it you

2702
01:57:41,399 --> 01:57:45,679
could say oh whatever man we're just

2703
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:48,479
crossing stuff but there's a deeper

2704
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:50,239
underbelly and under sense of of real

2705
01:57:48,479 --> 01:57:54,439
responsibility um I think we're all

2706
01:57:50,238 --> 01:57:56,238
getting at here that need that so um

2707
01:57:54,439 --> 01:57:58,839
really Michael like amazing you know

2708
01:57:56,238 --> 01:58:02,359
amazing work dude can can I comment on

2709
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:04,719
that Colin um yeah please hoping others

2710
01:58:02,359 --> 01:58:07,319
will join me with this this idea yeah no

2711
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:08,719
it's it's it's important because um I I

2712
01:58:07,319 --> 01:58:11,000
think that probably the biggest

2713
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:13,000
selective pressure in the past for you

2714
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:15,560
know land race populations and I'm sure

2715
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:18,039
Brian and Sam could you know know more

2716
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:21,679
about this than I do is um was was

2717
01:58:18,039 --> 01:58:23,000
climate and and geography right that was

2718
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:24,599
like the big big one like did it did it

2719
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,000
live or not did it survive here or not

2720
01:58:24,599 --> 01:58:28,078
that was probably a big Dynamic with you

2721
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,238
know cannabis Americana in the beginning

2722
01:58:28,078 --> 01:58:31,559
as well growing it in the wrong climate

2723
01:58:30,238 --> 01:58:33,439
and I just thought I had a comment the

2724
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:38,280
other day with with um Kevin mccaran had

2725
01:58:33,439 --> 01:58:40,678
posted some stuff on on um on LinkedIn

2726
01:58:38,279 --> 01:58:42,238
about aspergilus and aspergillosis and

2727
01:58:40,679 --> 01:58:43,800
all this stuff and all this mold and

2728
01:58:42,238 --> 01:58:46,198
total yeast and mold and it's just like

2729
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:47,719
dude it's the same thing it's like okay

2730
01:58:46,198 --> 01:58:49,919
it's it's a real simple selective

2731
01:58:47,719 --> 01:58:53,118
pressure it's like does it grow or not

2732
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:56,399
and it's like we collectively hybridized

2733
01:58:53,118 --> 01:58:58,880
all these bad genes that were for not

2734
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:00,759
meant to be grown in certain places

2735
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:03,440
because of their susceptibility to mold

2736
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:06,440
and buildu and we just because because

2737
01:59:03,439 --> 01:59:10,039
we were in a you know a bubble of pre

2738
01:59:06,439 --> 01:59:12,799
pre uh you know pre- legalization we

2739
01:59:10,039 --> 01:59:14,880
[ __ ] we we [ __ ] up the gene pool

2740
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:17,279
right we we introduced a bunch of bad

2741
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:18,920
traits that are really dangerous like

2742
01:59:17,279 --> 01:59:21,039
any farmer would say why in the hell

2743
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:23,359
would you introduce the susceptibility

2744
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:27,198
to this thing that people all over the

2745
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:29,000
world had moved away from because that's

2746
01:59:27,198 --> 01:59:31,279
what you do you know if it lives it

2747
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,800
survives so anyway that one thing is

2748
01:59:31,279 --> 01:59:35,880
like how quickly we can screw things up

2749
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:38,119
by not respecting history and not

2750
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:39,599
approaching it like agriculture or

2751
01:59:38,118 --> 01:59:42,039
approaching it like the people who came

2752
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:44,560
before us for hundreds of years you know

2753
01:59:42,039 --> 01:59:47,639
don't grow moldy weed don't grow weed in

2754
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:50,320
indoor environment in high humidity that

2755
01:59:47,639 --> 01:59:52,960
is not supposed to be grown sort of like

2756
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:55,639
the Potato Famine in Ireland

2757
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:56,960
yeah exactly it's like just read the

2758
01:59:55,639 --> 01:59:59,279
understand the past and like it's just

2759
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:00,679
amazing how prevalent that is now and

2760
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:03,679
you see all these states that have

2761
02:00:00,679 --> 02:00:07,199
really low cfu numbers which is also you

2762
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:11,920
know you know an is you see Delware 500

2763
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:13,678
cfus how about Illinois 100 100 yeah

2764
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:16,319
exactly how do you get something to

2765
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:18,920
Market D Davis has his hand up so he

2766
02:00:16,319 --> 02:00:20,880
wanted to speak on that uh yeah I just

2767
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:22,719
was going to say about the um like

2768
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:24,078
pathogen resistance I think ultimately

2769
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:26,239
what's happened is that there's just

2770
02:00:24,078 --> 02:00:28,639
been so many selections in a really

2771
02:00:26,238 --> 02:00:30,479
controlled environment we're having like

2772
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:32,118
ridiculously low humidities and

2773
02:00:30,479 --> 02:00:33,718
someone's I mean this in any

2774
02:00:32,118 --> 02:00:36,519
condescending sense but like someone in

2775
02:00:33,719 --> 02:00:39,039
their basement with like 40% or lower

2776
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:41,599
humidity in some cases so then in turn

2777
02:00:39,039 --> 02:00:43,679
there wasn't any biological reason

2778
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:46,119
generation to generation to maintain

2779
02:00:43,679 --> 02:00:48,039
that pathogen resistance so what's

2780
02:00:46,118 --> 02:00:49,639
happened is we're losing the ability

2781
02:00:48,039 --> 02:00:51,158
because we've been in such controlled

2782
02:00:49,639 --> 02:00:53,520
environments ultimately because

2783
02:00:51,158 --> 02:00:56,158
prohibition was so limiting on what it

2784
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:57,800
allowed people to grow and where to grow

2785
02:00:56,158 --> 02:01:00,719
you know you had to hide it you had to

2786
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:02,079
make it you know um not smell as much as

2787
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:04,239
well like all these kind of different

2788
02:01:02,078 --> 02:01:06,198
traits to try to hide it from from you

2789
02:01:04,238 --> 02:01:08,198
know getting in trouble for it so

2790
02:01:06,198 --> 02:01:10,078
essentially we've we've lost a lot of

2791
02:01:08,198 --> 02:01:13,158
the genetic

2792
02:01:10,078 --> 02:01:14,840
advantageous um traits that we used to

2793
02:01:13,158 --> 02:01:16,319
have from these various varieties in

2794
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:19,599
various regions because like you guys

2795
02:01:16,319 --> 02:01:21,519
are saying there was generations of

2796
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:23,560
survival needed for these things to

2797
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:26,079
maintain and to propagate and to to

2798
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:27,960
still be around today so yeah we we've

2799
02:01:26,078 --> 02:01:30,519
really been losing that unfortunately

2800
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:32,960
and it's it's the same thing about like

2801
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:35,199
I was saying earlier about um losing

2802
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:37,960
diversity in terms of uh chemical

2803
02:01:35,198 --> 02:01:39,960
profiles it's it's very similar we

2804
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:41,158
people don't have that much space so

2805
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:43,279
ultimately they're going to only be

2806
02:01:41,158 --> 02:01:46,279
selecting for a small percentage of

2807
02:01:43,279 --> 02:01:48,158
traits generation to generation that

2808
02:01:46,279 --> 02:01:50,000
fits basically what what will fit in

2809
02:01:48,158 --> 02:01:53,279
that space you can't really have a you

2810
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:55,000
know 15ot tall plant if you well in a in

2811
02:01:53,279 --> 02:01:57,039
a small place in your house you got to

2812
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,760
you got to grow that Outdoors so we've

2813
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:01,279
selected against what could have been

2814
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:03,400
advantageous traits again in terms of

2815
02:02:01,279 --> 02:02:05,439
yield or in terms of uh quality of

2816
02:02:03,399 --> 02:02:07,399
product for what's going to fit the

2817
02:02:05,439 --> 02:02:09,879
environment that you know we we've been

2818
02:02:07,399 --> 02:02:11,439
selecting for so long it's not even that

2819
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:14,239
we've left them out it's that we haven't

2820
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:16,559
considered them right so

2821
02:02:14,238 --> 02:02:17,919
it's yeah if you can't if you don't

2822
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:19,960
measure it in science if you don't

2823
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:21,359
measure it you can't manage it yeah

2824
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:24,520
right so it's just kind of like being

2825
02:02:21,359 --> 02:02:26,118
randomly selected or not and you know I

2826
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:27,760
I kind of think of chromosomes I try to

2827
02:02:26,118 --> 02:02:30,359
give people the analogy of chromosomes

2828
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:32,599
as like streets in a city or blocks of

2829
02:02:30,359 --> 02:02:35,359
streets on a city right so if you're

2830
02:02:32,599 --> 02:02:37,039
buying a house by the pictures you might

2831
02:02:35,359 --> 02:02:38,960
pick like a really nice house but the

2832
02:02:37,039 --> 02:02:41,359
one next door might be really ugly and

2833
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:42,960
shitty right run down and like or a

2834
02:02:41,359 --> 02:02:45,118
crack house or something like that and

2835
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:48,359
that's kind of what happens genetically

2836
02:02:45,118 --> 02:02:50,719
right you you select for one trait

2837
02:02:48,359 --> 02:02:53,598
heavily up until now we haven't really

2838
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:54,840
known what the next door traits are

2839
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:56,760
right or what other traits or bad

2840
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:58,920
versions of traits are on that same city

2841
02:02:56,760 --> 02:03:02,239
block yeah for example if you look at

2842
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:07,399
cannabis with mildew there's both

2843
02:03:02,238 --> 02:03:09,839
resistance and susceptibility genes

2844
02:03:07,399 --> 02:03:12,279
so you got to make sure you get the

2845
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:15,000
right set you're we're getting to the

2846
02:03:12,279 --> 02:03:16,559
point now though where we can do all

2847
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,679
these things with Canabis and it really

2848
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:21,039
is just the will of the Breeders to

2849
02:03:18,679 --> 02:03:23,118
invest in that kind of Technology like

2850
02:03:21,039 --> 02:03:24,198
you know I I was speaking with a a Prof

2851
02:03:23,118 --> 02:03:25,799
at University the other day and they've

2852
02:03:24,198 --> 02:03:28,879
got genome sequencing down to five bucks

2853
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:32,520
a sample so at five bucks a sample you

2854
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:34,359
know complete run you can grow you know

2855
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:39,199
you can grow 100 plants and it cost you

2856
02:03:34,359 --> 02:03:42,238
500 bucks to um to get your genomic data

2857
02:03:39,198 --> 02:03:43,799
but you know after four weeks you can

2858
02:03:42,238 --> 02:03:46,558
take that genomic data and select

2859
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:48,400
against 90% of the plants right yeah

2860
02:03:46,559 --> 02:03:52,239
right so for not that big of an

2861
02:03:48,399 --> 02:03:53,319
investment we can start harvesting in

2862
02:03:52,238 --> 02:03:57,399
about these

2863
02:03:53,319 --> 02:03:59,439
plants kind of Upstream right of of us

2864
02:03:57,399 --> 02:04:02,359
having to take them through the the grow

2865
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:04,638
cycle and um a lot of these technologies

2866
02:04:02,359 --> 02:04:08,000
that haven't been available to plant

2867
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:09,199
breeders are now really like we're kind

2868
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:12,760
of live like I said it the other day

2869
02:04:09,198 --> 02:04:14,960
we're living in the future right like we

2870
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:17,320
you know it wasn't that long ago when

2871
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:20,000
the first genetic markers came up it was

2872
02:04:17,319 --> 02:04:22,118
1995 when we had genetic markers that

2873
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,840
would allow us to identify male cannabis

2874
02:04:22,118 --> 02:04:27,000
plants right and it's it's been 30 years

2875
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:29,000
now and we we're way farther ahead and

2876
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:31,279
we have a lot more data and we have a

2877
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,960
lot more access to these tools so the

2878
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:34,439
question becomes like you know like I

2879
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:37,039
said with the chemical analysis and

2880
02:04:34,439 --> 02:04:38,078
analyzing every plant when do the

2881
02:04:37,039 --> 02:04:40,519
Cannabis

2882
02:04:38,078 --> 02:04:41,759
breeders you know the popular ones on

2883
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:44,199
social media when do they start

2884
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:47,039
investing in the plant because if they

2885
02:04:44,198 --> 02:04:48,638
don't the future is going to be owned by

2886
02:04:47,039 --> 02:04:50,479
corporations that do invest in that kind

2887
02:04:48,639 --> 02:04:53,800
of Technology right because if you

2888
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:56,279
invest in the technology be able to um

2889
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:59,800
harvest the gains of those Technologies

2890
02:04:56,279 --> 02:05:01,078
so you know it's kind of it's It's I

2891
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:02,520
think we're coming up to kind of a make

2892
02:05:01,078 --> 02:05:04,238
make it or break at time some of these

2893
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:06,920
people that are making a lot of money

2894
02:05:04,238 --> 02:05:09,439
selling seeds they should probably start

2895
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:11,319
putting some of that money back into R&amp;D

2896
02:05:09,439 --> 02:05:13,399
and really stepping up their game and

2897
02:05:11,319 --> 02:05:16,000
that's really will be what allows them

2898
02:05:13,399 --> 02:05:18,359
to stay in the game or not you know yeah

2899
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,078
I think what you're seeing now is is is

2900
02:05:18,359 --> 02:05:22,439
actually that I mean I've been talking

2901
02:05:20,078 --> 02:05:24,439
to a lot of guys that are like man I got

2902
02:05:22,439 --> 02:05:26,759
tractor trailer loads of seeds that are

2903
02:05:24,439 --> 02:05:30,039
not selling you know

2904
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:31,480
and that's I think that's due to that I

2905
02:05:30,039 --> 02:05:34,118
think you're you're hitting it on the

2906
02:05:31,479 --> 02:05:36,558
head and you know moreover I think it's

2907
02:05:34,118 --> 02:05:38,279
the lack of the ability for a lot of

2908
02:05:36,559 --> 02:05:41,360
these larger facilities they get off

2909
02:05:38,279 --> 02:05:44,078
cycles that are nine to 10 weeks you

2910
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:46,158
know um so they're looking for clones

2911
02:05:44,078 --> 02:05:47,599
they're looking for trays and proven

2912
02:05:46,158 --> 02:05:50,558
things that they don't have to really

2913
02:05:47,599 --> 02:05:53,239
invest in but to your point it's not

2914
02:05:50,559 --> 02:05:56,119
really the smartest thing to be doing

2915
02:05:53,238 --> 02:05:58,078
and look let's face it we're cannabis

2916
02:05:56,118 --> 02:05:59,839
breeders right like what we should be

2917
02:05:58,078 --> 02:06:02,880
doing is breeding the Next Generation

2918
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:06,360
and evolving the plant not still growing

2919
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:07,159
[ __ ] cookies and chamd right I was

2920
02:06:06,359 --> 02:06:09,719
just

2921
02:06:07,158 --> 02:06:11,158
thinking go look at anybody's menu right

2922
02:06:09,719 --> 02:06:12,480
like go look at anybody's menu if

2923
02:06:11,158 --> 02:06:14,359
they're just taking those same clothes

2924
02:06:12,479 --> 02:06:15,718
and Crossing them over they're doing it

2925
02:06:14,359 --> 02:06:18,158
and making money and they're not moving

2926
02:06:15,719 --> 02:06:20,639
the plantform I agree as long as there's

2927
02:06:18,158 --> 02:06:23,519
a lot of skunk number one in each of the

2928
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:25,559
you well Sam it's already locked in

2929
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:28,320
there in my opinion and and I would say

2930
02:06:25,559 --> 02:06:30,639
you know look KMD sour like we have no

2931
02:06:28,319 --> 02:06:33,359
historical references on that as to

2932
02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:35,679
where they came from truly what makes up

2933
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:37,238
those profiles how those even came to be

2934
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:39,480
and that's another aspect of like the

2935
02:06:37,238 --> 02:06:41,598
history I think that actually matters

2936
02:06:39,479 --> 02:06:43,399
like you know we're still talking about

2937
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:46,319
where the skunk and the skunk went right

2938
02:06:43,399 --> 02:06:49,960
it's like really guys like this is this

2939
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:54,279
is you know what I think R I can say

2940
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:54,279
that I bred the skun out of

2941
02:06:54,319 --> 02:06:59,920
skunk answer I selected toward the sweet

2942
02:06:57,479 --> 02:07:01,959
side because I like the effects I like

2943
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:04,279
the hide better yeah but listen I'm

2944
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:06,800
sitting here smoking rosin with with Sam

2945
02:07:04,279 --> 02:07:09,158
as well and I will tell you there are

2946
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:12,679
thols all up in this in the stuff that

2947
02:07:09,158 --> 02:07:14,439
we're smoking so that skunk it might

2948
02:07:12,679 --> 02:07:17,480
that chemical might not be there in that

2949
02:07:14,439 --> 02:07:20,078
variety sure but you know like to say

2950
02:07:17,479 --> 02:07:22,238
that these things are gone I think is

2951
02:07:20,078 --> 02:07:23,679
really like people just repeat eating

2952
02:07:22,238 --> 02:07:25,879
something they heard on the internet you

2953
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:27,679
know yeah well that's what I'm doing

2954
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:30,078
right now so I'm repeating that for a

2955
02:07:27,679 --> 02:07:32,639
reason because I wanted to bring that up

2956
02:07:30,078 --> 02:07:34,558
because I I like yourself I agree I

2957
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:37,960
think the skunk still is here I think

2958
02:07:34,559 --> 02:07:39,800
GMO is a good example of it I think um

2959
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:41,800
The Garlic is a good example of it I

2960
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:43,880
think KMD is a good example of it I

2961
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:47,159
think chem 91's a good example of it I

2962
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:50,480
think there's sour first skunk I bred

2963
02:07:47,158 --> 02:07:53,279
the first few plants they were so loud

2964
02:07:50,479 --> 02:07:55,839
and tpping and like a dead skunk

2965
02:07:53,279 --> 02:07:59,399
smelling that if you have them double

2966
02:07:55,840 --> 02:08:02,039
zip locked in in your pocket I mean it

2967
02:07:59,399 --> 02:08:05,319
it stunk up the whole [ __ ] house like

2968
02:08:02,039 --> 02:08:08,238
a dead skunk and I bred away from it

2969
02:08:05,319 --> 02:08:13,000
because I found that the sweeter Higher

2970
02:08:08,238 --> 02:08:16,319
One were had more iy high and I like

2971
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:18,559
strong but I like iy

2972
02:08:16,319 --> 02:08:20,118
strong I've also found like look

2973
02:08:18,559 --> 02:08:22,920
truthfully those we all know now that

2974
02:08:20,118 --> 02:08:28,000
the th as well these th uh whatever it

2975
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:29,279
is one two3 MBT way more poke it's um

2976
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:32,479
it's it's one of those chemicals that

2977
02:08:29,279 --> 02:08:34,399
just a very little bit can fill the room

2978
02:08:32,479 --> 02:08:35,799
right but again it's kind of like it

2979
02:08:34,399 --> 02:08:39,158
going back to that conversation with the

2980
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:41,279
harmonics and the outboard gear um it

2981
02:08:39,158 --> 02:08:43,279
really is Headroom right it's like when

2982
02:08:41,279 --> 02:08:44,639
you stick your bag in a in a in a you're

2983
02:08:43,279 --> 02:08:48,279
sorry you stick your nose in a bag of

2984
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:51,840
something that's heavily volatile often

2985
02:08:48,279 --> 02:08:54,479
you smell the turps but those those th s

2986
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:57,119
they kind of get lost in the mix right

2987
02:08:54,479 --> 02:08:58,678
and you can you can smell it much better

2988
02:08:57,118 --> 02:09:00,439
when somebody just brings a bag into the

2989
02:08:58,679 --> 02:09:03,158
room and you get that little whiff of

2990
02:09:00,439 --> 02:09:04,598
that tiny little amount of volatile that

2991
02:09:03,158 --> 02:09:06,558
just takes it enough to set off your

2992
02:09:04,599 --> 02:09:09,760
receptors for whatever reason right so

2993
02:09:06,559 --> 02:09:11,239
dude this this jar I just found this jar

2994
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:14,639
like the other day this is probably like

2995
02:09:11,238 --> 02:09:16,879
four years old this is garlic this stuff

2996
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:19,920
reeks of skunk I mean it's the most

2997
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:23,800
horrific stuff you'd ever see it looks

2998
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:25,440
Brown as you could ever see it but I'd

2999
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:28,039
like to get it tested to see what's in

3000
02:09:25,439 --> 02:09:30,519
there to be honest because it's some of

3001
02:09:28,039 --> 02:09:32,118
the loudest it's insane it's like I'm

3002
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:33,520
like I don't even know how this is this

3003
02:09:32,118 --> 02:09:36,439
and it's not even been kept well it's

3004
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:38,639
just been in a jar it reminds it reminds

3005
02:09:36,439 --> 02:09:40,799
me of the Renee from back in the day

3006
02:09:38,639 --> 02:09:43,279
which I called pot to get you busted

3007
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:45,119
because it was literally problematic it

3008
02:09:43,279 --> 02:09:47,118
got people kicked out of hotel rooms and

3009
02:09:45,118 --> 02:09:49,039
I'm sure that was I mean you could speak

3010
02:09:47,118 --> 02:09:51,558
to it better than me Chimera but I

3011
02:09:49,039 --> 02:09:53,399
believe that there was some skunk going

3012
02:09:51,559 --> 02:09:57,079
on in that cultivar now listen have a

3013
02:09:53,399 --> 02:10:00,759
bunch of people are just so more

3014
02:09:57,078 --> 02:10:02,639
volatile they're really really volatile

3015
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:04,880
but they're they're also in there in a

3016
02:10:02,639 --> 02:10:07,039
lot lower concentration so if you look

3017
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:09,279
at what those guys from abstracts have

3018
02:10:07,039 --> 02:10:11,960
published those things are there in

3019
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:13,599
parts per billion not parts per million

3020
02:10:11,960 --> 02:10:15,239
when you look at some of these tpin

3021
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:18,159
they're there in singled digigit

3022
02:10:15,238 --> 02:10:20,198
percentages so it's app and orang

3023
02:10:18,158 --> 02:10:22,960
exactly they don't need to be there in

3024
02:10:20,198 --> 02:10:26,039
higher percentages not necessarily their

3025
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:29,000
volatility it's how powerful they are at

3026
02:10:26,039 --> 02:10:30,679
much lower concentration I think it's

3027
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:33,599
both

3028
02:10:30,679 --> 02:10:35,639
Mark well we got to get uh Nick zegler

3029
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:38,639
on here to speak to that because he's

3030
02:10:35,639 --> 02:10:40,599
the one that you know put his multiple

3031
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:43,679
analytical machines together and

3032
02:10:40,599 --> 02:10:46,319
discovered over 1,400 thol in hops when

3033
02:10:43,679 --> 02:10:47,480
he was working at yaka ma Chief hops um

3034
02:10:46,319 --> 02:10:50,039
we have a bunch of people with their

3035
02:10:47,479 --> 02:10:52,439
hands up so it was uh Davis was going to

3036
02:10:50,039 --> 02:10:55,880
go first and then Michael had something

3037
02:10:52,439 --> 02:10:58,678
to say and then uh Mojave had something

3038
02:10:55,880 --> 02:11:00,679
to say and once those three uh speak I

3039
02:10:58,679 --> 02:11:02,078
want to because we were getting into the

3040
02:11:00,679 --> 02:11:03,800
powdery Milos and these sort of

3041
02:11:02,078 --> 02:11:06,118
susceptible things I wanted to go to

3042
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:08,000
Brian uh who wanted to talk a little bit

3043
02:11:06,118 --> 02:11:11,118
about this fungal blight that's wiping

3044
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:13,399
out Gardens in the US so uh go ahead

3045
02:11:11,118 --> 02:11:16,719
Davis oh sorry I think uh Michael was

3046
02:11:13,399 --> 02:11:19,279
actually before me um he he was when he

3047
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:21,520
put his hand up but you did the body

3048
02:11:19,279 --> 02:11:23,158
language and had your question before he

3049
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:25,159
put his hand up so trust me I'm

3050
02:11:23,158 --> 02:11:27,679
perceiving all that's going on here I

3051
02:11:25,158 --> 02:11:29,118
just wanted to make respectfully um I

3052
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:31,480
was just going to say two about when we

3053
02:11:29,118 --> 02:11:33,000
were talking about uh breeding that

3054
02:11:31,479 --> 02:11:34,399
ultimately what I think's happened as

3055
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:37,279
well is that there's like a lack of

3056
02:11:34,399 --> 02:11:39,759
available germ plasm for a lot of these

3057
02:11:37,279 --> 02:11:42,000
uh seed developers or breeders and I

3058
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:43,719
think the thing is too is that without

3059
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,840
sounding insulting here like there are

3060
02:11:43,719 --> 02:11:48,000
breeders within the space that just want

3061
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:49,679
to use other people's work I mean how

3062
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:51,920
many companies have just been you know

3063
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:53,639
developed essentially by taking skunk

3064
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:54,840
number one and Crossing with something

3065
02:11:53,639 --> 02:11:57,118
rather than just trying to make it

3066
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:58,920
something new and on one hand like I

3067
02:11:57,118 --> 02:12:00,558
think skunk is one of the best strains

3068
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:02,559
in the entire world like I have nothing

3069
02:12:00,559 --> 02:12:04,559
but positive things to say but that

3070
02:12:02,559 --> 02:12:05,719
doesn't change the fact that you know

3071
02:12:04,559 --> 02:12:07,679
there's a lot of companies just

3072
02:12:05,719 --> 02:12:09,760
profiting off of that how many companies

3073
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:12,000
just have you know cookies crosses that

3074
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:14,199
ultimately they're using and with that

3075
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,840
lack of germoplasm being available it's

3076
02:12:14,198 --> 02:12:17,759
it's also what's Limited a lot of these

3077
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:19,920
people from producing new varieties or

3078
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:22,280
producing new things but I completely

3079
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:24,599
agree with you Ryan that nowadays I

3080
02:12:22,279 --> 02:12:26,359
think the future only is going to be and

3081
02:12:24,599 --> 02:12:29,440
I really see like a Renaissance within

3082
02:12:26,359 --> 02:12:31,679
the breeding um sector that we're going

3083
02:12:29,439 --> 02:12:33,919
to see more genotyping we're going to

3084
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:37,279
see more advancement in terms of like

3085
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:39,679
identifying all the markers rather than

3086
02:12:37,279 --> 02:12:41,599
just you know Crossing what you think's

3087
02:12:39,679 --> 02:12:43,399
going to sell and the other thing I

3088
02:12:41,599 --> 02:12:45,639
wanted to state with that as well is

3089
02:12:43,399 --> 02:12:47,479
that I think a lot of with again without

3090
02:12:45,639 --> 02:12:50,078
sounding insulting like some of the seed

3091
02:12:47,479 --> 02:12:51,718
producers out there they're not truly

3092
02:12:50,078 --> 02:12:54,439
developing new lines they're just

3093
02:12:51,719 --> 02:12:56,520
crossing together varieties that are

3094
02:12:54,439 --> 02:12:58,960
popular rather than trying to develop

3095
02:12:56,520 --> 02:13:01,960
something new or trying to develop and

3096
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:04,359
improve in some way and it's it's more

3097
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:05,880
about the marketability of having a name

3098
02:13:04,359 --> 02:13:07,920
rather than actually have a product

3099
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:11,319
that's differentiated as

3100
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:11,319
well go ahead

3101
02:13:12,118 --> 02:13:17,558
Michael yeah so um just sort of

3102
02:13:14,439 --> 02:13:18,960
interjecting I'm not uh totally confus

3103
02:13:17,559 --> 02:13:20,279
confusing things but there was one other

3104
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:24,599
thing that came to mind that I wanted to

3105
02:13:20,279 --> 02:13:27,479
share with y'all this was a um 16-page

3106
02:13:24,599 --> 02:13:29,239
brochure that Park Davis

3107
02:13:27,479 --> 02:13:32,919
created

3108
02:13:29,238 --> 02:13:34,158
um I actually when I located this I was

3109
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:37,279
very excited I brought it to the

3110
02:13:34,158 --> 02:13:39,879
attention of Dr mikaria for those who

3111
02:13:37,279 --> 02:13:43,359
don't know who Dr Todd mcre

3112
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:46,679
was he was probably one of our Frontline

3113
02:13:43,359 --> 02:13:48,039
experts on medicinal cannabis um overall

3114
02:13:46,679 --> 02:13:50,279
in the in the medicinal cannabis

3115
02:13:48,039 --> 02:13:53,519
movement uh he was the point person for

3116
02:13:50,279 --> 02:13:55,920
the national in a mental health cannabis

3117
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:57,079
team back in the 60s um when they were

3118
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:59,399
look you know just beginning to look

3119
02:13:57,078 --> 02:14:02,319
into cannabis issues but anyway this was

3120
02:13:59,399 --> 02:14:05,198
a color this is black and white for our

3121
02:14:02,319 --> 02:14:08,399
um Journal article but this is a color

3122
02:14:05,198 --> 02:14:10,799
brochure in 16 Pages talking about uh

3123
02:14:08,399 --> 02:14:12,759
their cannabis product and uh that's

3124
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:14,199
their lab that would be that's a nice

3125
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:16,119
lab that would be cool if we had a lab

3126
02:14:14,198 --> 02:14:19,319
like that may I just wanted to share

3127
02:14:16,118 --> 02:14:21,238
that um with Todd Dr Todd we did this

3128
02:14:19,319 --> 02:14:24,439
article the marketing of cannabis

3129
02:14:21,238 --> 02:14:27,359
Americana we talked about basically re

3130
02:14:24,439 --> 02:14:29,879
republished the brochure in its entirety

3131
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:31,359
and uh he and I talked about it but it

3132
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:33,400
was a lot of fun I just wanted to share

3133
02:14:31,359 --> 02:14:36,880
that with you guys thank you for sharing

3134
02:14:33,399 --> 02:14:38,879
that and uh it's uh

3135
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:40,440
Mojave uh I just wanted to point

3136
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:42,319
something out because you guys were we

3137
02:14:40,439 --> 02:14:43,919
talking about Aroma and like a friend of

3138
02:14:42,319 --> 02:14:47,238
mine just told me a while ago it's like

3139
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:49,599
are you on a war against Aroma because I

3140
02:14:47,238 --> 02:14:52,118
it's a it's a it's a topic that I think

3141
02:14:49,599 --> 02:14:55,239
we kind of gloss over a little bit too

3142
02:14:52,118 --> 02:14:57,519
quickly because cannabis to me is a drug

3143
02:14:55,238 --> 02:15:00,118
and it's a medic it's a medicinal plant

3144
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:01,920
and it has a lot of value but when we

3145
02:15:00,118 --> 02:15:05,198
talk about when we put things in the

3146
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:07,118
scope of Aroma um the way things smell

3147
02:15:05,198 --> 02:15:12,000
loud cannabis that word came up it's

3148
02:15:07,118 --> 02:15:14,679
such a marketable easy easy to Market um

3149
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:17,359
strategy and we really don't know what

3150
02:15:14,679 --> 02:15:19,599
part like Ethan you know Ethan is known

3151
02:15:17,359 --> 02:15:22,399
for his work with with David on the

3152
02:15:19,599 --> 02:15:26,199
Entourage effect but we still don't know

3153
02:15:22,399 --> 02:15:28,118
really what is that what contributes and

3154
02:15:26,198 --> 02:15:31,479
there's been there's there's Ethan had a

3155
02:15:28,118 --> 02:15:34,039
i he's he did some work with um a

3156
02:15:31,479 --> 02:15:36,198
particular um paper called the nose nose

3157
02:15:34,039 --> 02:15:38,158
right and it's about how we use our nose

3158
02:15:36,198 --> 02:15:40,558
to drive our selective process and that

3159
02:15:38,158 --> 02:15:43,238
you know we know what we like we know

3160
02:15:40,559 --> 02:15:44,599
but David mentioned something or Sam you

3161
02:15:43,238 --> 02:15:46,359
mentioned something really good last

3162
02:15:44,599 --> 02:15:48,760
week I think it was last week when you

3163
02:15:46,359 --> 02:15:51,839
talked about your cross with hay and

3164
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:55,840
hemp and you made a hemp iety that

3165
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:57,559
smelled like haast right so what are we

3166
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:59,559
what do we want from it do we want just

3167
02:15:57,559 --> 02:16:01,239
Aromas is the aroma the driving force

3168
02:15:59,559 --> 02:16:04,480
because breeder every breeder I talk to

3169
02:16:01,238 --> 02:16:06,638
just talks about Aroma right so that

3170
02:16:04,479 --> 02:16:08,479
Haze that Haze smelling hemp man that

3171
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:12,000
did not get too high but it smelled like

3172
02:16:08,479 --> 02:16:13,919
it did it had all the right aroma so the

3173
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:17,960
way we're looking at like breeding and

3174
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:19,359
selection and marketing and the consumer

3175
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:21,319
I kind of feel like it's a little bit

3176
02:16:19,359 --> 02:16:23,960
dangerous and maybe even a a little bit

3177
02:16:21,319 --> 02:16:26,599
Reckless to put this big conversation

3178
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:30,880
that's cannabis chemistry solely into

3179
02:16:26,599 --> 02:16:32,398
the aroma class because that it triggers

3180
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:34,760
a different part of your brain and the

3181
02:16:32,398 --> 02:16:38,199
consumer relationship with it is so

3182
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:41,679
different than the medicinal drug effect

3183
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:43,479
side and that's really important because

3184
02:16:41,679 --> 02:16:46,840
I see people

3185
02:16:43,478 --> 02:16:49,318
choosing selecting Aroma and skipping

3186
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:52,040
over the effect in losing customers

3187
02:16:49,318 --> 02:16:53,359
losing consumers losing Pat patients

3188
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:56,200
because they're not delivering they're

3189
02:16:53,359 --> 02:16:57,800
not even seeking what we really thought

3190
02:16:56,200 --> 02:17:00,920
what we sought out from Cannabis which

3191
02:16:57,799 --> 02:17:03,840
was a drug it's not just Jolly Ranchers

3192
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:06,359
and flowers and soda pop it's the drug

3193
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:08,960
behind those Aromas and how we connect

3194
02:17:06,359 --> 02:17:11,519
those two which is still like this big

3195
02:17:08,959 --> 02:17:13,558
science thols I mean the indle

3196
02:17:11,519 --> 02:17:15,398
discussion that that abstracts brought

3197
02:17:13,558 --> 02:17:16,879
up to me is the most compelling thing

3198
02:17:15,398 --> 02:17:19,159
I've heard in years in terms of

3199
02:17:16,879 --> 02:17:21,318
Entourage effect is that there's a

3200
02:17:19,159 --> 02:17:23,879
neurotransmitter precursors that are

3201
02:17:21,318 --> 02:17:26,879
ubiquitous in all of cannabis that also

3202
02:17:23,879 --> 02:17:28,718
have a really interesting Baseline Aroma

3203
02:17:26,879 --> 02:17:30,799
that mean it's like

3204
02:17:28,718 --> 02:17:33,799
whoa you know but it's not a pleasant

3205
02:17:30,799 --> 02:17:36,799
Aroma or it's not the one that is the

3206
02:17:33,799 --> 02:17:39,159
market Lemon Cherry gelato Aroma you

3207
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:40,959
know what I mean anyway I think it's

3208
02:17:39,159 --> 02:17:42,959
from a lack of information being

3209
02:17:40,959 --> 02:17:45,598
accessible again because ultimately

3210
02:17:42,959 --> 02:17:47,879
there's what I've heard from um friends

3211
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:49,280
of mine that own dispensaries and a lot

3212
02:17:47,879 --> 02:17:51,239
of uh friends of mine who are less

3213
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:54,239
familiar with the industry is they'll

3214
02:17:51,239 --> 02:17:55,799
say how someone mentioned to them oh

3215
02:17:54,239 --> 02:17:57,280
well you know this smells this way so

3216
02:17:55,799 --> 02:17:58,679
it's going to have that kind of effect

3217
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:00,319
rather than having more of like an

3218
02:17:58,679 --> 02:18:02,760
objective conversation about the

3219
02:18:00,318 --> 02:18:05,359
complexes of all the compounds in it and

3220
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:08,000
again it's like it's easier to have that

3221
02:18:05,359 --> 02:18:09,880
be as part of an explanation than to say

3222
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:11,359
about the chemical diversity and all the

3223
02:18:09,879 --> 02:18:13,959
different compounds that are in it so

3224
02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:15,840
it's just more simplistic and I mean

3225
02:18:13,959 --> 02:18:17,879
there is there is truth to the idea that

3226
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:19,880
different cines will in turn you know

3227
02:18:17,879 --> 02:18:21,759
modulate the profile and effect to some

3228
02:18:19,879 --> 02:18:23,478
extent but I think I think what's

3229
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:26,120
happened is that that's become the

3230
02:18:23,478 --> 02:18:28,119
dominant conversation and it's easier

3231
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:30,559
for people who don't necessarily

3232
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:32,519
understand the chemistry of cannabis to

3233
02:18:30,558 --> 02:18:35,358
use that as their like driving

3234
02:18:32,519 --> 02:18:37,239
conversation or their marketing tool and

3235
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:38,960
it's ultimately too I think it's

3236
02:18:37,239 --> 02:18:41,599
especially uh like we were talking about

3237
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:43,879
with younger people um they're they're

3238
02:18:41,599 --> 02:18:45,359
less aware of like you know diversity of

3239
02:18:43,879 --> 02:18:47,318
effects because again they've just been

3240
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:49,239
led to this idea oh it smells this way

3241
02:18:47,318 --> 02:18:50,799
it's going to have a different effect

3242
02:18:49,239 --> 02:18:52,840
rather than the idea of the full

3243
02:18:50,799 --> 02:18:55,318
diversity of the profile and at the same

3244
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:57,478
time I'm not trying to dismiss um like

3245
02:18:55,318 --> 02:18:59,840
Tes I'm just trying to say that I think

3246
02:18:57,478 --> 02:19:02,159
it's just easier to communicate that to

3247
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:04,079
people it's easier to have that type of

3248
02:19:02,159 --> 02:19:07,558
understanding rather than to have the

3249
02:19:04,079 --> 02:19:09,959
idea that that's a very complex plan but

3250
02:19:07,558 --> 02:19:13,119
it's crazy and a little bit dangerous is

3251
02:19:09,959 --> 02:19:14,438
my point is that like we Market I mean

3252
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:16,040
like and this is a joke and I've said it

3253
02:19:14,439 --> 02:19:19,559
before and it's just a but if we

3254
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:22,479
marketed like opioids that way yeah oh

3255
02:19:19,558 --> 02:19:24,478
my God yeah I completely agree with you

3256
02:19:22,478 --> 02:19:26,039
easy hey dude these Vicodins are

3257
02:19:24,478 --> 02:19:27,199
strawberry flavored Vicodins and these

3258
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:29,920
are

3259
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:31,280
the want everyone's going to choose the

3260
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,359
strawberry ones but that's really

3261
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:35,880
dangerous and it takes everyone on a

3262
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:38,040
different path and it takes our brains

3263
02:19:35,879 --> 02:19:40,000
and our relationships with products

3264
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:41,639
because flavor and Aroma are so Primal

3265
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,959
and they're about safety and about

3266
02:19:41,638 --> 02:19:46,638
security where a drug thing is very

3267
02:19:43,959 --> 02:19:49,000
esoteric and requires a deeper so to me

3268
02:19:46,638 --> 02:19:51,398
it's not the consumer the dispensary

3269
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:53,520
it's kind of the Breeders and the big

3270
02:19:51,398 --> 02:19:55,879
brands that have to kind of get

3271
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:57,960
responsible and like not just not just

3272
02:19:55,879 --> 02:20:00,239
not just about it's an opportunity to me

3273
02:19:57,959 --> 02:20:02,438
it's like a drugs are you know selling

3274
02:20:00,239 --> 02:20:04,439
drugs is the thing right so there's like

3275
02:20:02,439 --> 02:20:06,239
there's opportunity with aligning with

3276
02:20:04,439 --> 02:20:09,639
that type of strategy it's just

3277
02:20:06,239 --> 02:20:11,478
harder completely right it's very much

3278
02:20:09,639 --> 02:20:13,920
deeper than that especially with

3279
02:20:11,478 --> 02:20:18,478
cannabis because it's been shown again

3280
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:22,040
beta caropine for example right uh uh

3281
02:20:18,478 --> 02:20:25,799
acts on CV2 but I think I think what

3282
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:27,960
happens in general with with tpen is

3283
02:20:25,799 --> 02:20:31,639
that they increase the fluidity at the

3284
02:20:27,959 --> 02:20:33,559
lipid bilayer and so it's likely and

3285
02:20:31,639 --> 02:20:35,879
again I think this is just still

3286
02:20:33,559 --> 02:20:38,000
hypothetical although there's a couple

3287
02:20:35,879 --> 02:20:41,559
couple articles that have shown this is

3288
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:43,680
that is that there's an outside in

3289
02:20:41,559 --> 02:20:47,239
signal that

3290
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:50,239
upregulates receptor expression at the

3291
02:20:47,239 --> 02:20:52,280
cell surface right and and that's a it's

3292
02:20:50,239 --> 02:20:55,559
a very complicated mechanism because

3293
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:58,120
what's happening is again tpes kind of

3294
02:20:55,559 --> 02:21:00,279
interpolate into the lipid by layer and

3295
02:20:58,120 --> 02:21:02,160
I've likened it to just opening up the

3296
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:04,680
windows at your house right you're going

3297
02:21:02,159 --> 02:21:06,359
to start exchanging the air between the

3298
02:21:04,680 --> 02:21:09,760
outside of your house and the inside of

3299
02:21:06,359 --> 02:21:11,559
your house so when when that happens

3300
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:13,600
again there's a lot of compounds that

3301
02:21:11,559 --> 02:21:16,600
are secondary Messengers that are coming

3302
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:19,720
in that could potentially upregulate

3303
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:21,920
canono expression so it's too bad Dr

3304
02:21:19,719 --> 02:21:25,039
Russo had to out because I think this is

3305
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:27,840
the molecular basis that could explain

3306
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:31,479
the Entourage or The Ensemble effect

3307
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:34,520
which is that how do you H like Stam has

3308
02:21:31,478 --> 02:21:38,079
said for years here on hash church that

3309
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:39,760
Turin can modulate the action and I

3310
02:21:38,079 --> 02:21:42,840
think Davis you you had just said this

3311
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:46,239
too Tes can modulate the action of THC

3312
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:50,920
at CB1 so how does that happened

3313
02:21:46,239 --> 02:21:54,478
well I also I also say that a few of

3314
02:21:50,920 --> 02:21:56,318
them can potentiate the effects of DC

3315
02:21:54,478 --> 02:21:59,318
correct potentially as opposed to

3316
02:21:56,318 --> 02:22:01,719
modulate so so what kind of mechanisms

3317
02:21:59,318 --> 02:22:04,760
just think simplistically how can that

3318
02:22:01,719 --> 02:22:07,879
potentially happen so there could be a

3319
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:10,280
confirmational change in the receptor

3320
02:22:07,879 --> 02:22:13,199
active site that makes those THC

3321
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:16,079
molecules work better but I think what

3322
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:18,319
could certainly be at play here is again

3323
02:22:16,079 --> 02:22:19,959
a signal that we don't quite understand

3324
02:22:18,318 --> 02:22:22,398
but there's something coming into the

3325
02:22:19,959 --> 02:22:24,799
cell that's basically causing an

3326
02:22:22,398 --> 02:22:28,119
upregulation of receptors so now there's

3327
02:22:24,799 --> 02:22:30,519
more CB1 receptors with more CB1

3328
02:22:28,120 --> 02:22:34,120
receptors yeah that the the effect can

3329
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:35,120
be more more pronounced and why uh a

3330
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:39,000
full

3331
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:42,680
spectrum you know medication with full

3332
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:44,879
turpine Entourage all the thols alahh

3333
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:46,520
eyeses Esters everything else that we

3334
02:22:44,879 --> 02:22:49,519
know you know we were kind of saying

3335
02:22:46,520 --> 02:22:52,720
this on hash Church a week or so ago

3336
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:53,880
that we can a live resin analysis now

3337
02:22:52,719 --> 02:22:57,519
and

3338
02:22:53,879 --> 02:23:00,159
between the tpin and between the canono

3339
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:03,079
we're accounting for

3340
02:23:00,159 --> 02:23:05,079
99.9% of the material that's in there so

3341
02:23:03,079 --> 02:23:08,760
there's yeah thol is in there at very

3342
02:23:05,079 --> 02:23:13,318
very low concentration but essentially

3343
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:15,960
we've we've identified everything that's

3344
02:23:13,318 --> 02:23:17,920
coming out of the cannabis plant you

3345
02:23:15,959 --> 02:23:19,919
know just even like a handful of years

3346
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:21,920
ago on hash church we were talking about

3347
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:24,318
this and we were still kind of like in

3348
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:26,200
the 90s so if you think about like what

3349
02:23:24,318 --> 02:23:29,398
those guys at abstracts have done which

3350
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:31,640
is they've identified that very minor

3351
02:23:29,398 --> 02:23:33,799
component that's there in an order of

3352
02:23:31,639 --> 02:23:36,239
magnitude less than the Turpin right

3353
02:23:33,799 --> 02:23:37,959
Turpin are there in single percentages

3354
02:23:36,239 --> 02:23:40,359
these things don't have to be in there

3355
02:23:37,959 --> 02:23:42,799
in a whole lot to add a whole lot of

3356
02:23:40,359 --> 02:23:45,318
flavor and it's so cool because like I

3357
02:23:42,799 --> 02:23:48,398
think the thing when Ian talks about

3358
02:23:45,318 --> 02:23:51,840
this you know they'll they'll go after

3359
02:23:48,398 --> 02:23:54,278
things like lioning d dominance in like

3360
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:57,318
a fruity or lemony kind of strain and

3361
02:23:54,279 --> 02:23:59,479
not find liony in there at all so it's

3362
02:23:57,318 --> 02:24:03,639
like man there's something else that's

3363
02:23:59,478 --> 02:24:05,840
creating a citrus kind of you know lemon

3364
02:24:03,639 --> 02:24:08,318
type fragrance that has nothing to do

3365
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:11,079
with limine so if you were just focusing

3366
02:24:08,318 --> 02:24:12,840
just on Ling itself you'd kind of miss

3367
02:24:11,079 --> 02:24:15,318
the forest through the

3368
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:17,559
trees yeah you know the one thing I was

3369
02:24:15,318 --> 02:24:19,318
thinking about the what you're saying

3370
02:24:17,559 --> 02:24:21,000
Mark and it's almost like the ozone

3371
02:24:19,318 --> 02:24:22,600
layer getting blown up for a second and

3372
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,760
then slowly repairing itself and the

3373
02:24:22,600 --> 02:24:28,079
blood brain barrier and those

3374
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:30,559
constituents going through um and when

3375
02:24:28,079 --> 02:24:32,120
when you know a lot of the the things

3376
02:24:30,559 --> 02:24:33,680
that I was doing in the last two years

3377
02:24:32,120 --> 02:24:35,800
when we were looking at a sleep

3378
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:38,920
formulation we started

3379
02:24:35,799 --> 02:24:41,278
really spent a lot of time on canabo and

3380
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:43,398
then I shifted and started spending a

3381
02:24:41,279 --> 02:24:45,640
lot of time on tpin and there was a very

3382
02:24:43,398 --> 02:24:47,719
clear reason why because it was very

3383
02:24:45,639 --> 02:24:49,318
clear that the modulating aspects of of

3384
02:24:47,719 --> 02:24:51,318
those formulations were actually more

3385
02:24:49,318 --> 02:24:53,039
important for sleep than the actual

3386
02:24:51,318 --> 02:24:55,799
canabo sure the constituent of it was

3387
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:57,120
important to get there but it wasn't CBN

3388
02:24:55,799 --> 02:24:58,799
that got you there it was like yeah you

3389
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:00,279
get to sleep with CBN but it actually

3390
02:24:58,799 --> 02:25:01,679
was like more of an antagonist when

3391
02:25:00,279 --> 02:25:03,640
you're sleeping to wake you up in the

3392
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:07,040
middle of the night than it was to keep

3393
02:25:03,639 --> 02:25:09,358
you asleep the whole time so I think the

3394
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:12,160
modulating what I learned was there's

3395
02:25:09,359 --> 02:25:14,239
just a whole lot to to learn in terms of

3396
02:25:12,159 --> 02:25:17,559
the modulation aspect and it truly keeps

3397
02:25:14,239 --> 02:25:19,639
you on your toes but we have a real

3398
02:25:17,559 --> 02:25:21,119
problem with our industry is like making

3399
02:25:19,639 --> 02:25:23,039
these formulations

3400
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:25,040
there's a real Line in the Sand of like

3401
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:27,760
you have the plant on the right and then

3402
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:29,479
you have faeron and all this other

3403
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:33,439
flavorant if you will we'll just call

3404
02:25:29,478 --> 02:25:35,358
them that that are not from the cannabis

3405
02:25:33,439 --> 02:25:37,960
plant and sure you can get these

3406
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:40,520
profiles to mimic in some

3407
02:25:37,959 --> 02:25:42,919
respect but to your point of actually

3408
02:25:40,520 --> 02:25:44,479
the modulation and and getting through

3409
02:25:42,920 --> 02:25:47,600
the BL you know brain barrier and

3410
02:25:44,478 --> 02:25:49,478
actually doing what it's supposed to do

3411
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:52,960
creating those formulations in the lab I

3412
02:25:49,478 --> 02:25:54,920
think are far more difficult than anyone

3413
02:25:52,959 --> 02:25:56,478
in their Wildest Dreams understands and

3414
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:58,920
I think you know and there's also

3415
02:25:56,478 --> 02:26:02,519
toxicology problems with that major

3416
02:25:58,920 --> 02:26:03,760
major tox problem so yeah I'd love to

3417
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:06,520
you know again I don't we don't want to

3418
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:09,279
throw Ethan under the bus but I think is

3419
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:13,040
doesn't he work or advise

3420
02:26:09,279 --> 02:26:16,079
the yeah he does right so there's this

3421
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:19,240
huge business around you know cannabis

3422
02:26:16,079 --> 02:26:21,879
Turpin or are they cannabis derived are

3423
02:26:19,239 --> 02:26:24,799
they not cannabis D you know there's

3424
02:26:21,879 --> 02:26:26,199
there's this comp there's this um Farm

3425
02:26:24,799 --> 02:26:30,318
colon I don't know if you know them up

3426
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:33,279
in um uh Oregon called tpine belt farms

3427
02:26:30,318 --> 02:26:36,199
and I think their business model is yeah

3428
02:26:33,279 --> 02:26:38,439
just to harvest steam to Ste the tpin

3429
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:41,159
and then plow the Cannabis back into the

3430
02:26:38,439 --> 02:26:44,079
fields so they're not even going after

3431
02:26:41,159 --> 02:26:45,799
they're not even going after canono and

3432
02:26:44,079 --> 02:26:47,879
and you know again kind of like what

3433
02:26:45,799 --> 02:26:50,639
Davis was saying well I think what we've

3434
02:26:47,879 --> 02:26:53,318
all been saying which is that and I

3435
02:26:50,639 --> 02:26:55,398
think Mojave mentioned the nose paper

3436
02:26:53,318 --> 02:26:57,959
and the nose paper again I think was

3437
02:26:55,398 --> 02:27:00,439
like one of those it was interesting how

3438
02:26:57,959 --> 02:27:03,799
those papers kind of came out because

3439
02:27:00,439 --> 02:27:07,840
the nose paper came out while abstracts

3440
02:27:03,799 --> 02:27:09,639
was doing their work around thol and the

3441
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:11,239
nose paper kind of like if you think

3442
02:27:09,639 --> 02:27:13,079
about it what they're saying is that

3443
02:27:11,239 --> 02:27:15,639
there's something more than just turpine

3444
02:27:13,079 --> 02:27:19,200
profile right so you can't just look at

3445
02:27:15,639 --> 02:27:21,199
oh taline dominant strains we were

3446
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:25,159
talking about the Cali

3447
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:28,479
turpine dominance and and and what what

3448
02:27:25,159 --> 02:27:30,920
that means to people and and the people

3449
02:27:28,478 --> 02:27:34,760
who like you know gassy kind of like

3450
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:36,960
chem and sour d i mean there's a certain

3451
02:27:34,760 --> 02:27:40,079
kind of flavor arom in there that's

3452
02:27:36,959 --> 02:27:43,438
really not citrusy it's more gassy it's

3453
02:27:40,079 --> 02:27:45,478
more like tastes like a Sal kind of like

3454
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:47,600
you know what what that does the

3455
02:27:45,478 --> 02:27:49,519
efficacy I think when you experience

3456
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:50,640
like you're pulling a dab you're pulling

3457
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:52,600
a vape pen

3458
02:27:50,639 --> 02:27:54,439
and you want that vape pen just to taste

3459
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:56,680
like the Cannabis from which it's

3460
02:27:54,439 --> 02:27:58,800
derived well interesting to go back to

3461
02:27:56,680 --> 02:28:01,800
Ryan's earlier discussion you know when

3462
02:27:58,799 --> 02:28:04,119
you look at these fresh frozen profiles

3463
02:28:01,799 --> 02:28:07,358
and compare it to something that's been

3464
02:28:04,120 --> 02:28:10,240
dried and then cured for several months

3465
02:28:07,359 --> 02:28:13,040
not only is the tpping content

3466
02:28:10,239 --> 02:28:14,840
completely different right right because

3467
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:17,600
you're losing a lot of those tpin and

3468
02:28:14,840 --> 02:28:20,200
drying and curing but now the whole

3469
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:22,680
profile is changed right and I think

3470
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:24,439
think like all that merine dominance

3471
02:28:22,680 --> 02:28:26,559
that you see in live resin and

3472
02:28:24,439 --> 02:28:29,000
everything I think what happens is not

3473
02:28:26,559 --> 02:28:31,920
only does the merine volatilize on

3474
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:34,840
drying but I think it probably does

3475
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:37,520
maybe chemistry and turns into other

3476
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:41,279
tpes could they be oxidizing the Turpin

3477
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:45,000
noids right so like the huge uh like in

3478
02:28:41,279 --> 02:28:47,800
fact that has hasinine hashen am am I

3479
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:51,000
not saying the molecule right I think is

3480
02:28:47,799 --> 02:28:53,719
an oxidative degradated product

3481
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:56,920
of merine right and they found that it

3482
02:28:53,719 --> 02:28:59,000
only happened in the the the outside

3483
02:28:56,920 --> 02:29:01,680
skin of the hash that was exposed to

3484
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:04,680
light so there's probably a fair amount

3485
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:07,000
of chemistry happening in the Cure that

3486
02:29:04,680 --> 02:29:10,079
you're not getting in fresh frozen or

3487
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:12,398
live resin but uh I love it all I think

3488
02:29:10,079 --> 02:29:15,959
it's great that you can do kind of like

3489
02:29:12,398 --> 02:29:17,959
a a live resin profile that captures

3490
02:29:15,959 --> 02:29:20,799
exactly the turpine profiles in the

3491
02:29:17,959 --> 02:29:23,639
plant but also do what Sam had done for

3492
02:29:20,799 --> 02:29:26,438
years which is like you can't smoke that

3493
02:29:23,639 --> 02:29:29,278
stuff until six months from now after

3494
02:29:26,439 --> 02:29:31,279
you've had a wh sale dry and then a cure

3495
02:29:29,279 --> 02:29:34,040
for at least I don't know four or five

3496
02:29:31,279 --> 02:29:35,279
months then you could smoke it right

3497
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:37,200
yeah I mean if you look at steam

3498
02:29:35,279 --> 02:29:39,439
distilled turps like the one thing I've

3499
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:42,040
learned from working with people like

3500
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:44,520
TBF and others and at scale is like

3501
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:46,399
getting those really sulfur this real

3502
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:48,319
sulfur compounds is nearly impossible

3503
02:29:46,398 --> 02:29:51,239
because you're burning them off during

3504
02:29:48,318 --> 02:29:53,278
that process and and that that's what

3505
02:29:51,239 --> 02:29:56,239
those compounds are essentially right or

3506
02:29:53,279 --> 02:29:58,439
those profiles have amount to um a

3507
02:29:56,239 --> 02:30:01,439
little bit is volatilizing right maybe a

3508
02:29:58,439 --> 02:30:03,479
little bit yeah maybe a little bit taste

3509
02:30:01,439 --> 02:30:05,760
when you taste good chem de or when you

3510
02:30:03,478 --> 02:30:08,639
taste Sour Diesel you're probably

3511
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:11,120
getting a few ppb of those sulfur

3512
02:30:08,639 --> 02:30:12,920
compounds that you say 100 yeah yeah but

3513
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:15,279
it's I guess what I'm getting is it's

3514
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:17,520
very difficult um but there's also a

3515
02:30:15,279 --> 02:30:19,279
deconomy here like someone goes into a

3516
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:21,159
store and someone said it like maybe

3517
02:30:19,279 --> 02:30:22,880
Mary said it the we have a problem with

3518
02:30:21,159 --> 02:30:25,478
marketing people are marketing these

3519
02:30:22,879 --> 02:30:27,559
profiles as such and an un UND

3520
02:30:25,478 --> 02:30:31,358
Discerning consumer goes in for Sour

3521
02:30:27,559 --> 02:30:33,959
Diesel and it's some lab concoction of

3522
02:30:31,359 --> 02:30:36,760
resemblance it of it you know that says

3523
02:30:33,959 --> 02:30:39,278
Sour Diesel but it's not nothing came

3524
02:30:36,760 --> 02:30:41,079
from the plant so therefore it doesn't

3525
02:30:39,279 --> 02:30:42,680
even resemble the profile but they walk

3526
02:30:41,079 --> 02:30:45,318
away saying like telling their friends

3527
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:48,200
this is sour diesel so and themselves

3528
02:30:45,318 --> 02:30:51,199
right so I think that's also a problem

3529
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:52,840
um within the actual um you know retail

3530
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:54,359
side of the industry and marketing

3531
02:30:52,840 --> 02:30:56,760
aspect it's

3532
02:30:54,359 --> 02:31:00,239
like have you ever bought store bought

3533
02:30:56,760 --> 02:31:02,559
turps that taste any good I've only made

3534
02:31:00,239 --> 02:31:06,159
them right from fresh plants that we've

3535
02:31:02,559 --> 02:31:08,840
grown and you never bought like from a

3536
02:31:06,159 --> 02:31:11,279
tpine vendor no one no one has been able

3537
02:31:08,840 --> 02:31:15,318
to produce anything close to the plant

3538
02:31:11,279 --> 02:31:17,640
right ATN right amazing because like all

3539
02:31:15,318 --> 02:31:20,639
those flavorants are being used in vape

3540
02:31:17,639 --> 02:31:22,318
pens today because you know you know

3541
02:31:20,639 --> 02:31:24,039
those are food grade right you're what

3542
02:31:22,318 --> 02:31:26,159
you're talking as opposed to properly

3543
02:31:24,040 --> 02:31:28,720
extracted turs like Colin is talking

3544
02:31:26,159 --> 02:31:30,760
about yeah guys I I can tell you like

3545
02:31:28,719 --> 02:31:32,760
I've audited all these guys I looked at

3546
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:34,800
all their SDS I had a really great team

3547
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:37,159
around me of of great a brilliant

3548
02:31:34,799 --> 02:31:39,438
toxicologists and what we found is that

3549
02:31:37,159 --> 02:31:42,079
almost every single formulation

3550
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:43,559
has ridiculous amounts of things that

3551
02:31:42,079 --> 02:31:47,039
from a talks perspective just shouldn't

3552
02:31:43,559 --> 02:31:48,840
even be in there at all and it's it's

3553
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:51,359
really concerning I think it's really

3554
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:52,840
something you know know these you know

3555
02:31:51,359 --> 02:31:55,239
people go in for wellness and they come

3556
02:31:52,840 --> 02:31:57,600
out with other things right and I think

3557
02:31:55,239 --> 02:31:59,760
that's the other deconomy we're in that

3558
02:31:57,600 --> 02:32:02,760
I think about and it's our job it's

3559
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:05,359
literally our job to make great products

3560
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:07,120
to serve those patients you know because

3561
02:32:05,359 --> 02:32:10,279
we are patients as well we need the

3562
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:13,079
right medicine well col I I don't know

3563
02:32:10,279 --> 02:32:15,520
if you saw that the the couple very

3564
02:32:13,079 --> 02:32:19,159
interesting pieces of legislation this

3565
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:22,359
week uh yesterday Gavin Newsome kind of

3566
02:32:19,159 --> 02:32:26,359
threw down the Gauntlet in California

3567
02:32:22,359 --> 02:32:31,040
outlawing all uh synthetic

3568
02:32:26,359 --> 02:32:34,318
intoxicating uh cannabinoids but um so a

3569
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:37,240
few months ago there was a ruling uh

3570
02:32:34,318 --> 02:32:40,318
that Rod kite had kind of poked the DEA

3571
02:32:37,239 --> 02:32:41,520
bear and got the DEA to basically say

3572
02:32:40,318 --> 02:32:45,840
that

3573
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:48,800
thco uh is schedule one and also uh the

3574
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:52,079
THC the Delta 8 and Delta 9 from which

3575
02:32:48,799 --> 02:32:55,039
it's derived is also so schedule one and

3576
02:32:52,079 --> 02:32:57,478
then yesterday uh or I think the day

3577
02:32:55,040 --> 02:33:00,359
before uh the fourth Circuit Court just

3578
02:32:57,478 --> 02:33:02,438
turned that over and they

3579
02:33:00,359 --> 02:33:05,920
basically said that

3580
02:33:02,439 --> 02:33:08,760
thco which is the acetate of thca

3581
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:11,200
qualifies as H hemp and this is kind of

3582
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:13,398
like a step in the wrong direction

3583
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:15,760
because man it's kind of like it's

3584
02:33:13,398 --> 02:33:17,920
basically giving these hemp folks now a

3585
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:20,760
leg up saying that there's Court

3586
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:23,120
precedent now that this is now hemp

3587
02:33:20,760 --> 02:33:25,960
and it's all synthetic the plant doesn't

3588
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:29,200
make this stuff at all and this feeds

3589
02:33:25,959 --> 02:33:31,438
that whole Beast of uh you know why is

3590
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:34,840
someone gonna go to ATN shop and buy a

3591
02:33:31,439 --> 02:33:38,239
$40 vape pen go down to the gas station

3592
02:33:34,840 --> 02:33:40,880
and get a $10 one right like

3593
02:33:38,239 --> 02:33:43,600
five that hemp industry is making big

3594
02:33:40,879 --> 02:33:44,959
money off of those little loopholes and

3595
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:47,840
don't think that they're not spending

3596
02:33:44,959 --> 02:33:49,959
some of that money in in h Washington to

3597
02:33:47,840 --> 02:33:52,318
make sure Ryan Ryan it's it's

3598
02:33:49,959 --> 02:33:54,239
unbelievable so the Colorado task force

3599
02:33:52,318 --> 02:33:57,199
that was looking into this and there's

3600
02:33:54,239 --> 02:34:00,199
lawsuits estimates that market just

3601
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:03,240
south of $60 billion so greater than 50

3602
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:06,040
billion the combined cannabis markets in

3603
02:34:03,239 --> 02:34:09,799
the US combined they think is only about

3604
02:34:06,040 --> 02:34:12,240
29 million so this is like 2x greater

3605
02:34:09,799 --> 02:34:14,199
than the than the Cannabis markets it it

3606
02:34:12,239 --> 02:34:17,439
it's a it's a much larger addressable

3607
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:19,920
Market they have no regulations and they

3608
02:34:17,439 --> 02:34:22,279
sell on the internet over state lines

3609
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:24,318
two clicks after saying that you're 21

3610
02:34:22,279 --> 02:34:26,560
years old they're asking you for your

3611
02:34:24,318 --> 02:34:29,559
credit card information yeah I don't

3612
02:34:26,559 --> 02:34:31,398
know how the the US cannabis industry is

3613
02:34:29,559 --> 02:34:32,559
going to compete it's well they're

3614
02:34:31,398 --> 02:34:33,920
spending like I know that they're

3615
02:34:32,559 --> 02:34:35,760
spending big money with certain

3616
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:37,120
candidates too so you know it's

3617
02:34:35,760 --> 02:34:38,639
obviously you don't want to hear it that

3618
02:34:37,120 --> 02:34:41,600
you think that that influ that money is

3619
02:34:38,639 --> 02:34:44,039
influencing uh Judicial Systems but it's

3620
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:45,359
certainly influencing political systems

3621
02:34:44,040 --> 02:34:47,880
well you're absolutely right because

3622
02:34:45,359 --> 02:34:50,720
most big Multistate operators including

3623
02:34:47,879 --> 02:34:53,959
Wana including a lot of ones are now

3624
02:34:50,719 --> 02:34:55,559
making plays into this hemp space so

3625
02:34:53,959 --> 02:34:57,839
it's kind of like you can't beat them

3626
02:34:55,559 --> 02:34:59,680
while we're going to join them and and

3627
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:02,920
again try to take some of that market

3628
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:05,760
share away so it's a it is really a [ __ ]

3629
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:08,079
show down here I mean I I I I don't know

3630
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:11,120
how the regulated market is GNA survive

3631
02:35:08,079 --> 02:35:14,439
this I really don't go ahead Davis yeah

3632
02:35:11,120 --> 02:35:16,800
it's incredibly home growing

3633
02:35:14,439 --> 02:35:18,880
oh Sam was just saying that the best way

3634
02:35:16,799 --> 02:35:21,199
to fight it is to allow home growing and

3635
02:35:18,879 --> 02:35:22,719
I can't say dis agree with that you know

3636
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:25,000
a lot of these things happen because

3637
02:35:22,719 --> 02:35:27,000
you've got one set of law for the

3638
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:28,559
federal regulations on hemp and then you

3639
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:30,478
have a bunch of different Island

3640
02:35:28,559 --> 02:35:33,119
regulations that have apply to the

3641
02:35:30,478 --> 02:35:35,719
different states and yeah man like I

3642
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:37,960
don't know it's gonna it's G to change

3643
02:35:35,719 --> 02:35:40,000
things for sure when the federalized

3644
02:35:37,959 --> 02:35:41,559
federal legalization happens but you

3645
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:44,920
know I also just want to say as a

3646
02:35:41,559 --> 02:35:46,719
Canadian and having done that you know

3647
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:48,559
regulating cannabis or legalizing

3648
02:35:46,719 --> 02:35:51,840
cannabis effectively destroyed the seed

3649
02:35:48,559 --> 02:35:54,478
Market in Canada Canada right um it's

3650
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:56,799
just not possible how so how did it what

3651
02:35:54,478 --> 02:35:59,318
do you what do you mean like for for the

3652
02:35:56,799 --> 02:36:01,159
m mostly for export like you know at the

3653
02:35:59,318 --> 02:36:03,278
same time the states has lightened up

3654
02:36:01,159 --> 02:36:06,119
and considered cannabis seed as hemp

3655
02:36:03,279 --> 02:36:08,439
seed right we we now have like a high

3656
02:36:06,120 --> 02:36:11,079
excise tax and you actually have to get

3657
02:36:08,439 --> 02:36:13,439
Federal um export license and import

3658
02:36:11,079 --> 02:36:17,159
licenses so it's really made created a

3659
02:36:13,439 --> 02:36:19,318
legal situation where we can't operate

3660
02:36:17,159 --> 02:36:21,279
whereas the opposite has happened in the

3661
02:36:19,318 --> 02:36:23,278
United States right

3662
02:36:21,279 --> 02:36:25,040
like that's going to change here in the

3663
02:36:23,279 --> 02:36:27,079
United States there's actually going to

3664
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:28,840
be a hemp Bill we've talked to people

3665
02:36:27,079 --> 02:36:31,120
behind the scenes that's coming down the

3666
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:33,799
pike in October that is going to close

3667
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:36,920
the loopholes now of course what Dr

3668
02:36:33,799 --> 02:36:39,879
scalone was talking about which is that

3669
02:36:36,920 --> 02:36:42,398
Court setting around thco just kind of

3670
02:36:39,879 --> 02:36:44,599
put a little thorn in that side because

3671
02:36:42,398 --> 02:36:48,439
of that legal precedence there is kind

3672
02:36:44,600 --> 02:36:50,680
of upset the cart because a bunch pardon

3673
02:36:48,439 --> 02:36:52,479
my language the DA's got hard on waiting

3674
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:54,880
for this to be changed so that they can

3675
02:36:52,478 --> 02:36:57,278
come bash in skulls they've been waiting

3676
02:36:54,879 --> 02:36:59,438
for so long to come in and to get with

3677
02:36:57,279 --> 02:37:01,880
people that that loophole is going to

3678
02:36:59,439 --> 02:37:04,520
close and it will be bipartisan and it's

3679
02:37:01,879 --> 02:37:06,599
coming and so we can act surprised but I

3680
02:37:04,520 --> 02:37:08,840
know people who have ramped up who are

3681
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:11,239
just getting rid of their stock now

3682
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:14,799
because the writing is on the wall it's

3683
02:37:11,239 --> 02:37:16,359
coming and when right after that comes

3684
02:37:14,799 --> 02:37:18,358
then comes the hammer and it's going to

3685
02:37:16,359 --> 02:37:21,079
come down hard and heavy and it's going

3686
02:37:18,359 --> 02:37:23,359
to be ugly

3687
02:37:21,079 --> 02:37:26,079
yeah

3688
02:37:23,359 --> 02:37:28,239
I the US is in Renaissance right now

3689
02:37:26,079 --> 02:37:31,200
it's really crazy there's a lot of drug

3690
02:37:28,239 --> 02:37:33,760
use going on and if you really I mean

3691
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:35,520
and the farm bill hemp is perfect

3692
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:38,040
example of that how it's being pushed

3693
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:40,159
through so aggressively and with little

3694
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:42,439
with Little Resistance but go to your

3695
02:37:40,159 --> 02:37:45,039
local head shops and see what's on the

3696
02:37:42,439 --> 02:37:48,200
Shelf now I mean I I ran head shops in

3697
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:51,920
La 25 years ago I managed a couple head

3698
02:37:48,200 --> 02:37:53,920
shops and there things on the Shelf now

3699
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:57,079
head shops are a

3700
02:37:53,920 --> 02:38:00,639
drugstore it's just insane nootropic is

3701
02:37:57,079 --> 02:38:03,318
a new thing in head shops no Tropic it's

3702
02:38:00,639 --> 02:38:05,119
a new way of selling psychedelics

3703
02:38:03,318 --> 02:38:06,600
somewhat legally there's a bunch of

3704
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:09,439
stimulants that they're selling there's

3705
02:38:06,600 --> 02:38:11,079
lots of Cava there's lots of katum

3706
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:13,559
there's lots of you know there's it's

3707
02:38:11,079 --> 02:38:16,520
but walls of it and the walls of weed

3708
02:38:13,559 --> 02:38:19,680
too thca flour and all every different

3709
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:21,600
vape and every different you know canabo

3710
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:24,079
everything is all on the Shelf at your

3711
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:26,318
local corner store some of it is a

3712
02:38:24,079 --> 02:38:28,398
little bit fuzzy in terms of gray area

3713
02:38:26,318 --> 02:38:31,239
some of it's fully legal because it's

3714
02:38:28,398 --> 02:38:34,639
been tested in courts but the but the

3715
02:38:31,239 --> 02:38:36,559
far out part is it is on Main Street and

3716
02:38:34,639 --> 02:38:38,959
when I when I ran head shops in the in

3717
02:38:36,559 --> 02:38:41,318
the late 90s we couldn't even call it a

3718
02:38:38,959 --> 02:38:43,719
bong called it a water pipe it was a

3719
02:38:41,318 --> 02:38:46,079
tobacco store it was it was Prohibition

3720
02:38:43,719 --> 02:38:48,239
days now those head shops which are

3721
02:38:46,079 --> 02:38:50,920
everywhere now there's way more head

3722
02:38:48,239 --> 02:38:52,959
shops than ever and they sell Walls and

3723
02:38:50,920 --> 02:38:54,639
walls of drugs and I'm not against that

3724
02:38:52,959 --> 02:38:56,879
at all I think drugs are part of you

3725
02:38:54,639 --> 02:38:59,199
know human you know Evolution we like to

3726
02:38:56,879 --> 02:39:01,199
feel different you know but it does

3727
02:38:59,200 --> 02:39:03,880
require regulation and it does require

3728
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:05,279
some Public Safety mechanisms to make

3729
02:39:03,879 --> 02:39:06,719
sure that it's done right but when I

3730
02:39:05,279 --> 02:39:07,720
talk to the guys at the head shop

3731
02:39:06,719 --> 02:39:09,639
because one of them is right next to my

3732
02:39:07,719 --> 02:39:11,760
local pizza place and I go in there and

3733
02:39:09,639 --> 02:39:14,920
just rap with the guy and he tells me

3734
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:17,079
about all the drugs he's selling all day

3735
02:39:14,920 --> 02:39:18,840
long I mean it's like you can call it

3736
02:39:17,079 --> 02:39:20,879
whatever you want man but it's drugs and

3737
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:22,880
they're not people aren't coming in for

3738
02:39:20,879 --> 02:39:27,000
rolling papers and Vapes they're coming

3739
02:39:22,879 --> 02:39:28,398
in for these weird different combo drugs

3740
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:30,639
Michael Which is far out because it's

3741
02:39:28,398 --> 02:39:32,959
like these compounded you know things

3742
02:39:30,639 --> 02:39:35,799
where it's katum and some kind of other

3743
02:39:32,959 --> 02:39:38,679
stimulant and some kind of other weird

3744
02:39:35,799 --> 02:39:41,559
thing and it's and and they're selling

3745
02:39:38,680 --> 02:39:43,120
it like hot cakes all day long and

3746
02:39:41,559 --> 02:39:45,119
that's and these are and this is and

3747
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:47,120
this is in La when you still have

3748
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:49,720
dispensaries too so you can get the

3749
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:52,160
legal weed you can get the trapper weed

3750
02:39:49,719 --> 02:39:54,840
you can get the head shop weed and you

3751
02:39:52,159 --> 02:39:58,439
can get mushrooms at the church up in

3752
02:39:54,840 --> 02:40:01,639
Oakland and you can get DMT at the other

3753
02:39:58,439 --> 02:40:03,398
place in in Santa Cruz and and then at

3754
02:40:01,639 --> 02:40:05,159
every thousands and thousands of head

3755
02:40:03,398 --> 02:40:06,278
shops all over the state you can buy all

3756
02:40:05,159 --> 02:40:09,879
these other

3757
02:40:06,279 --> 02:40:11,399
substances anyway something's going on

3758
02:40:09,879 --> 02:40:14,239
and the fact that like places like

3759
02:40:11,398 --> 02:40:16,920
Minnesota sell THC Beverages and THC

3760
02:40:14,239 --> 02:40:19,359
Vapes at almost every gas station now

3761
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:20,559
it's not going back that's all I say

3762
02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:23,239
it's just they're not we're not going

3763
02:40:20,559 --> 02:40:25,840
back and whether it's a farm bill path

3764
02:40:23,239 --> 02:40:28,719
or whatever or whatever loophole or

3765
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:31,040
whatever something's going on and it's

3766
02:40:28,719 --> 02:40:33,239
just speaking of that actually Michael

3767
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:35,960
crowz is actually G to be testifying

3768
02:40:33,239 --> 02:40:38,079
specifically on katum uh part of our

3769
02:40:35,959 --> 02:40:41,358
International Group helped keep katum

3770
02:40:38,079 --> 02:40:44,079
legal uh a few years ago when uh other

3771
02:40:41,359 --> 02:40:45,800
countries wanted to make it Michael krow

3772
02:40:44,079 --> 02:40:48,000
you want to speak on that what you'll be

3773
02:40:45,799 --> 02:40:49,840
speaking toward I think it's the 20th in

3774
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:52,959
DC well yeah

3775
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:54,960
I guess just the the basics of this

3776
02:40:52,959 --> 02:40:56,879
hearing um there's going to be

3777
02:40:54,959 --> 02:41:00,759
considerable amount of scientific

3778
02:40:56,879 --> 02:41:03,438
support some very uh top subtop medical

3779
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:05,040
experts including the head of naida

3780
02:41:03,439 --> 02:41:08,800
National Institutes of drug abuse which

3781
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:11,319
is interesting um but um my aspect of it

3782
02:41:08,799 --> 02:41:14,358
is just to talk about veterans issues

3783
02:41:11,318 --> 02:41:17,840
the difficulty of uh dealing with plant

3784
02:41:14,359 --> 02:41:20,200
material in uh you know Veterans Affairs

3785
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:22,639
hospitals are are kind of like prisons

3786
02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:24,800
in the regard that they really work on

3787
02:41:22,639 --> 02:41:27,079
label mostly uh They Don't Really Work

3788
02:41:24,799 --> 02:41:29,879
even off label let alone anything

3789
02:41:27,079 --> 02:41:34,239
outside the box so uh getting like plant

3790
02:41:29,879 --> 02:41:38,318
material inside the VA Pharmacy short of

3791
02:41:34,239 --> 02:41:41,199
an FDA approved medicine um is is really

3792
02:41:38,318 --> 02:41:43,119
a it's our challenge at our you know

3793
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:45,520
veterans Action Council basically it's

3794
02:41:43,120 --> 02:41:47,479
one of our key challenges um but that's

3795
02:41:45,520 --> 02:41:50,439
that's what we're trying to do in in the

3796
02:41:47,478 --> 02:41:53,000
end of the day and katum like cannabis

3797
02:41:50,439 --> 02:41:55,880
is helping a lot of veterans and and

3798
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:57,478
other people uh not hit rock bottom with

3799
02:41:55,879 --> 02:42:00,959
opiates and want up being one of the

3800
02:41:57,478 --> 02:42:03,398
statistics with opiate death or or or

3801
02:42:00,959 --> 02:42:05,599
suicide death as well for some of our

3802
02:42:03,398 --> 02:42:08,680
groups like like veterans you know

3803
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:11,559
police First Responders Etc so having

3804
02:42:08,680 --> 02:42:14,318
cannabis and and katum sort of pushed

3805
02:42:11,559 --> 02:42:15,799
out of the system by drug testing is not

3806
02:42:14,318 --> 02:42:17,359
that doesn't lead you to the end you

3807
02:42:15,799 --> 02:42:21,159
want you know that's basically what I'm

3808
02:42:17,359 --> 02:42:21,159
going to be telling these guys

3809
02:42:22,760 --> 02:42:26,159
I was just going to comment on um

3810
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:27,640
talking about like you know the

3811
02:42:26,159 --> 02:42:29,600
synthetic products and the other things

3812
02:42:27,639 --> 02:42:31,278
getting around I think part of that is

3813
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:33,279
because there's still legislation

3814
02:42:31,279 --> 02:42:34,840
against cannabis in so many states of

3815
02:42:33,279 --> 02:42:36,680
course people are going to try to find

3816
02:42:34,840 --> 02:42:39,239
every single way to get around the laws

3817
02:42:36,680 --> 02:42:40,920
and regulations to get it through and so

3818
02:42:39,239 --> 02:42:43,760
ultimately what I do think's going to be

3819
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:46,159
a shift is that once there's more

3820
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:48,359
Federal recognition of it once at very

3821
02:42:46,159 --> 02:42:50,760
least that we have medical marijuana at

3822
02:42:48,359 --> 02:42:53,600
a federal level the United States we

3823
02:42:50,760 --> 02:42:55,318
will start to see a shift I believe in

3824
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:57,600
terms of all these loopholes being

3825
02:42:55,318 --> 02:42:59,840
closed and that's part of the problem is

3826
02:42:57,600 --> 02:43:01,439
every time we try to you know try to

3827
02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:03,079
avoid the issue we're essentially making

3828
02:43:01,439 --> 02:43:05,159
it worse because we're getting all these

3829
02:43:03,079 --> 02:43:06,840
synthetic compounds rather than you know

3830
02:43:05,159 --> 02:43:08,959
natural cannabis derivatives into the

3831
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:11,279
market and it's leading again to more

3832
02:43:08,959 --> 02:43:13,318
and misinformation oh it's a naturally

3833
02:43:11,279 --> 02:43:15,760
derived product or something like that

3834
02:43:13,318 --> 02:43:18,079
rather than actually being from Cannabis

3835
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:19,960
and I I just wanted to comment on uh one

3836
02:43:18,079 --> 02:43:21,840
thing that was mentioned earlier when we

3837
02:43:19,959 --> 02:43:24,839
were talking about strain profiles and

3838
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:26,600
the synthetic um synthetic ones I think

3839
02:43:24,840 --> 02:43:28,398
I think there's even more than just that

3840
02:43:26,600 --> 02:43:31,000
I mean when we were talking about Sour

3841
02:43:28,398 --> 02:43:33,318
Diesel there's people that I know that

3842
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:35,239
will tell me that they have Sour Diesel

3843
02:43:33,318 --> 02:43:37,359
and I smell it I'm like this this is

3844
02:43:35,239 --> 02:43:39,318
definitely not Sour Diesel so there's

3845
02:43:37,359 --> 02:43:42,120
not even really a regulation if you will

3846
02:43:39,318 --> 02:43:44,278
in the legal Canadian Market here that

3847
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:46,600
recognizes specific varieties and

3848
02:43:44,279 --> 02:43:47,920
specific profiles and that's part of

3849
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:50,520
again the problem with all the

3850
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:53,120
misinformation within the Canabis spaces

3851
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:54,920
there's users who don't necessarily know

3852
02:43:53,120 --> 02:43:58,120
what's what I usually give this as an

3853
02:43:54,920 --> 02:44:00,120
example of um let's say pink Kush was

3854
02:43:58,120 --> 02:44:02,160
smelling really or selling really well

3855
02:44:00,120 --> 02:44:04,680
and has a specific smell to it has a

3856
02:44:02,159 --> 02:44:06,680
specific effect has a specific look well

3857
02:44:04,680 --> 02:44:08,720
if one companies having success with

3858
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:11,318
that ultimately a bunch of other

3859
02:44:08,719 --> 02:44:13,278
companies there's nothing stopping them

3860
02:44:11,318 --> 02:44:15,359
from saying oh yeah we have pink Kush

3861
02:44:13,279 --> 02:44:18,120
and just renaming a variety that they

3862
02:44:15,359 --> 02:44:20,120
have that name and ultimately it leads

3863
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:22,120
to more imiss information and then

3864
02:44:20,120 --> 02:44:23,840
additionally as well they you know let's

3865
02:44:22,120 --> 02:44:25,720
say someone sees that there's this pink

3866
02:44:23,840 --> 02:44:27,760
cush now at a more budget conscious

3867
02:44:25,719 --> 02:44:29,478
price they go and try it and they think

3868
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:31,040
oh maybe I'm building up a tolerance to

3869
02:44:29,478 --> 02:44:32,879
this variety I didn't really like it as

3870
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:34,200
much and it takes away from the market

3871
02:44:32,879 --> 02:44:36,959
share of someone who is actually

3872
02:44:34,200 --> 02:44:38,720
creating a real variety it's unfortunate

3873
02:44:36,959 --> 02:44:40,839
because it's again just leading to more

3874
02:44:38,719 --> 02:44:43,039
misinformation and more problems within

3875
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:45,000
the industry yeah that's always been the

3876
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:47,240
way it was the names travel faster on

3877
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:48,799
the internet than the cuting do and I

3878
02:44:47,239 --> 02:44:51,199
mean this was happening back with skunk

3879
02:44:48,799 --> 02:44:52,559
and Northern Lights right that those

3880
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:54,960
names would be in the magazine and

3881
02:44:52,559 --> 02:44:56,879
someone would take that name and put it

3882
02:44:54,959 --> 02:44:59,398
on a on a flower that they had that

3883
02:44:56,879 --> 02:45:00,839
wasn't selling and in that new market

3884
02:44:59,398 --> 02:45:02,318
people come to believe that that's the

3885
02:45:00,840 --> 02:45:05,359
skunk one or the northern lights or the

3886
02:45:02,318 --> 02:45:07,719
cookies or whatever the name is yeah um

3887
02:45:05,359 --> 02:45:09,720
and you know I know I I harp on this a

3888
02:45:07,719 --> 02:45:11,079
lot talk about plant registrations but

3889
02:45:09,719 --> 02:45:13,920
this is one of the things that plants

3890
02:45:11,079 --> 02:45:17,600
registration solves right because the

3891
02:45:13,920 --> 02:45:21,239
name is granted to the PBR holder upon

3892
02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:22,840
registration right so it's like you know

3893
02:45:21,239 --> 02:45:24,639
somebody in Holland one of the seed

3894
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:27,600
companies years ago ran around and tried

3895
02:45:24,639 --> 02:45:30,000
to uh to register all these names as

3896
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:33,279
commercial trademarks it's copyright

3897
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:34,959
yeah as copyrights that with recently

3898
02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:37,359
like literally recently someone did this

3899
02:45:34,959 --> 02:45:39,759
with hay now this was like in the 90s

3900
02:45:37,359 --> 02:45:41,359
right yeah yeah in the 90s and they they

3901
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:43,680
came and actually tried to enforce all

3902
02:45:41,359 --> 02:45:46,760
these things and Sam had actually put

3903
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:49,639
some of these varieties through the PBR

3904
02:45:46,760 --> 02:45:51,880
process not with the intent to

3905
02:45:49,639 --> 02:45:53,519
profit from them but in in essence to

3906
02:45:51,879 --> 02:45:57,478
keep them in the public domain so that

3907
02:45:53,520 --> 02:45:59,159
nobody could do this yeah right and so

3908
02:45:57,478 --> 02:46:01,639
but yeah like in the registration

3909
02:45:59,159 --> 02:46:04,600
process when you get a registration is

3910
02:46:01,639 --> 02:46:06,760
granted to a plant breeder that's how a

3911
02:46:04,600 --> 02:46:08,920
plant gets its name right and how a

3912
02:46:06,760 --> 02:46:11,520
plant product gets his name so you can

3913
02:46:08,920 --> 02:46:14,680
walk into a gr grocery store in New York

3914
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:16,600
City or LA or Washington DC or anywhere

3915
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:18,318
in Canada or even anywhere in Europe and

3916
02:46:16,600 --> 02:46:19,720
get a granny smith apple and they're the

3917
02:46:18,318 --> 02:46:22,519
same plant

3918
02:46:19,719 --> 02:46:24,959
yeah right it's all the same

3919
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:26,120
plant s up real quick but that those are

3920
02:46:24,959 --> 02:46:28,839
two different things of the plant

3921
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:30,399
variety protection gives the name

3922
02:46:28,840 --> 02:46:33,960
assigned to

3923
02:46:30,398 --> 02:46:35,439
that um patent or or or plant variety

3924
02:46:33,959 --> 02:46:37,318
protection but it doesn't give it the

3925
02:46:35,439 --> 02:46:40,720
name in The Marketplace that's a

3926
02:46:37,318 --> 02:46:44,719
trademark no not for an apple no but the

3927
02:46:40,719 --> 02:46:47,000
trademark is not as high as a plant

3928
02:46:44,719 --> 02:46:49,000
breeders right yeah like if it went to

3929
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:51,639
somebody if somebody tried to take a

3930
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:53,799
trademark will lose yeah the trademark

3931
02:46:51,639 --> 02:46:56,439
lasts and the plan the the patent

3932
02:46:53,799 --> 02:46:59,199
patents expire trademarks don't so the

3933
02:46:56,439 --> 02:47:02,479
reason that that Granny Smith or the the

3934
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:05,880
um the power behind the name with a uh

3935
02:47:02,478 --> 02:47:08,079
you know a um an apple variety is the

3936
02:47:05,879 --> 02:47:09,799
trademark name so the on the patent it

3937
02:47:08,079 --> 02:47:12,239
could be in the application is a name

3938
02:47:09,799 --> 02:47:13,759
and that name is defendable in court but

3939
02:47:12,239 --> 02:47:15,439
in the marketplace in terms of

3940
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:17,439
Interstate Commerce and how it's treated

3941
02:47:15,439 --> 02:47:19,000
at least in the US with a patent that's

3942
02:47:17,439 --> 02:47:20,639
handled by the trademark office and

3943
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:23,680
trademarks aren't allowed are aren't

3944
02:47:20,639 --> 02:47:25,920
granted to cannabis at all in the US

3945
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:27,960
well they are but patents are granted to

3946
02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:30,318
cannabis in the US and you have to

3947
02:47:27,959 --> 02:47:32,599
remember Mojave as well that the US is

3948
02:47:30,318 --> 02:47:34,318
like the only place other than Australia

3949
02:47:32,600 --> 02:47:36,920
that recognizes plant patents this thing

3950
02:47:34,318 --> 02:47:38,840
is not done through these things are not

3951
02:47:36,920 --> 02:47:41,040
done through patents outside of the US

3952
02:47:38,840 --> 02:47:44,200
right they're done PBR and the PBR is

3953
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:47,560
the dominant system yes the copyright

3954
02:47:44,200 --> 02:47:50,920
doesn't hold up nothing to a plant beers

3955
02:47:47,559 --> 02:47:53,398
right in the EU in Canada and in most of

3956
02:47:50,920 --> 02:47:56,600
the Civilized world yeah yeah you

3957
02:47:53,398 --> 02:48:00,318
couldn't you couldn't you couldn't take

3958
02:47:56,600 --> 02:48:02,680
um a a name of a plant of a sorry a PBR

3959
02:48:00,318 --> 02:48:05,199
protected variety and try to apply it to

3960
02:48:02,680 --> 02:48:07,680
a good you'd lose in court but my point

3961
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:10,079
is that in the US right now anybody can

3962
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:12,318
call any plant anything they want

3963
02:48:10,079 --> 02:48:14,079
legally and there's no protection

3964
02:48:12,318 --> 02:48:16,239
against that

3965
02:48:14,079 --> 02:48:17,719
whatsoever you know I think to the

3966
02:48:16,239 --> 02:48:19,318
speaker's point I'm sorry I forgot your

3967
02:48:17,719 --> 02:48:21,840
name

3968
02:48:19,318 --> 02:48:23,840
you know these these the you're exactly

3969
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:25,760
right in the marketplace people go do go

3970
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:27,719
out and do these things because these

3971
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:29,478
varieties are not protected right

3972
02:48:27,719 --> 02:48:30,840
they're not registered varieties and so

3973
02:48:29,478 --> 02:48:32,398
essentially we take these plants and

3974
02:48:30,840 --> 02:48:35,159
give them a name and you release them

3975
02:48:32,398 --> 02:48:37,680
into the public domain and what happens

3976
02:48:35,159 --> 02:48:40,119
happens variety that I can't I can't

3977
02:48:37,680 --> 02:48:41,960
attach a name to so it has a name it has

3978
02:48:40,120 --> 02:48:44,240
a name in the application but I can't in

3979
02:48:41,959 --> 02:48:47,519
the marketplace I can't claim any name

3980
02:48:44,239 --> 02:48:49,879
to it legally so mve look at in the in

3981
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:51,680
our chat I just post

3982
02:48:49,879 --> 02:48:54,318
exactly what Ryan just said this is

3983
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:56,040
gives way to exactly what I posted here

3984
02:48:54,318 --> 02:48:58,600
this guy just took a haze plant was like

3985
02:48:56,040 --> 02:49:02,240
now it's Unique flower original Haze I

3986
02:48:58,600 --> 02:49:05,640
saw that yeah I've actually communicated

3987
02:49:02,239 --> 02:49:09,239
with the guy like really man yeah I mean

3988
02:49:05,639 --> 02:49:12,239
there there was never a Sam hay original

3989
02:49:09,239 --> 02:49:15,199
hay uh original hay was the name given

3990
02:49:12,239 --> 02:49:18,159
it to to it by the Breeders and that's

3991
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:21,359
the name I stuck with but there's a a

3992
02:49:18,159 --> 02:49:24,719
Neville original Haze there's a a

3993
02:49:21,359 --> 02:49:26,680
greenhouse original Haze or Haze

3994
02:49:24,719 --> 02:49:28,719
whatever I don't think they use the word

3995
02:49:26,680 --> 02:49:31,439
original you got to remember too a

3996
02:49:28,719 --> 02:49:33,920
patent is granted but that's not the

3997
02:49:31,439 --> 02:49:35,359
final ruling on if you actually own that

3998
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:37,680
piece of intellectual property it's kind

3999
02:49:35,359 --> 02:49:39,600
of of like a stake in the ground right

4000
02:49:37,680 --> 02:49:42,279
it's like someone saying hey I own this

4001
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:44,800
thing that there is an entire process

4002
02:49:42,279 --> 02:49:46,760
for challenging patents and you know

4003
02:49:44,799 --> 02:49:49,679
essentially the court system that deals

4004
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:51,359
with just that so I that although that

4005
02:49:49,680 --> 02:49:52,359
that guy has staked you know something

4006
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:56,600
in the

4007
02:49:52,359 --> 02:49:59,200
ground and even and even like Min

4008
02:49:56,600 --> 02:50:02,359
concertive nobody has appealed it yet

4009
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:04,399
yeah if I was to appeal it I bet you I

4010
02:50:02,359 --> 02:50:07,680
could knock it down but I have no

4011
02:50:04,398 --> 02:50:10,159
interest in it uh I you know let the

4012
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:13,479
stupid people do what stupid people do

4013
02:50:10,159 --> 02:50:15,000
and so far yeah the import the important

4014
02:50:13,478 --> 02:50:17,478
thing is that they become talking points

4015
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:19,799
and we use them for Education right yeah

4016
02:50:17,478 --> 02:50:22,159
because yeah you know when we did those

4017
02:50:19,799 --> 02:50:24,639
first patents with with

4018
02:50:22,159 --> 02:50:27,639
Neo or the bhc group or whatever you

4019
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:30,278
want to call it that that everybody was

4020
02:50:27,639 --> 02:50:31,559
pretty upset about that whole thing but

4021
02:50:30,279 --> 02:50:32,880
it really spurred people to start

4022
02:50:31,559 --> 02:50:35,039
getting patents and don't get me wrong

4023
02:50:32,879 --> 02:50:37,199
Mojave like you know being in the United

4024
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:40,040
States and having that P that plant

4025
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:44,159
patent certificate is actually a pretty

4026
02:50:40,040 --> 02:50:46,800
impressive thing um because typically

4027
02:50:44,159 --> 02:50:48,840
even in you know in PBR countries

4028
02:50:46,799 --> 02:50:50,840
chemical profile is not enough to

4029
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:53,120
register a variety is different it's

4030
02:50:50,840 --> 02:50:54,920
done on morphological traits so it

4031
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:57,200
really allows that patent system in the

4032
02:50:54,920 --> 02:50:59,639
United States allows it kind of fits the

4033
02:50:57,200 --> 02:51:01,680
niche of what cannabis is right because

4034
02:50:59,639 --> 02:51:03,799
you can find these new plants that are

4035
02:51:01,680 --> 02:51:06,639
chemically unique you you Pro plant

4036
02:51:03,799 --> 02:51:10,278
breeders rights has not grown up to the

4037
02:51:06,639 --> 02:51:13,358
real world of the importance of tpin and

4038
02:51:10,279 --> 02:51:16,439
things like that you know they will it

4039
02:51:13,359 --> 02:51:21,559
it will happen and uh I just wanted to

4040
02:51:16,439 --> 02:51:25,760
mention too that I got my first uh uh

4041
02:51:21,559 --> 02:51:28,639
upup uh plant breeders rights in

4042
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:31,880
97 I had applied maybe a year or two

4043
02:51:28,639 --> 02:51:34,639
earlier but uh in 97 they were granted

4044
02:51:31,879 --> 02:51:38,119
and uh I I was the first one in the

4045
02:51:34,639 --> 02:51:39,439
world to get a a drug variety with plant

4046
02:51:38,120 --> 02:51:42,200
breeders

4047
02:51:39,439 --> 02:51:43,680
rights and we we did it we didn't do it

4048
02:51:42,200 --> 02:51:46,960
because we thought I mean we did it just

4049
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:48,359
as a as a process just to like be adult

4050
02:51:46,959 --> 02:51:50,759
about cannabis and see what it would be

4051
02:51:48,359 --> 02:51:53,318
like but we also got a you a variety

4052
02:51:50,760 --> 02:51:55,800
protected through upov as well and we

4053
02:51:53,318 --> 02:51:57,799
also Sam you probably were the one who

4054
02:51:55,799 --> 02:52:01,000
helped us do this but we got the

4055
02:51:57,799 --> 02:52:03,318
enforcement Division behind it as well

4056
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:05,200
um so we got the Dutch group their name

4057
02:52:03,318 --> 02:52:07,519
fleets me right now but they basically

4058
02:52:05,200 --> 02:52:09,000
so we have a UPA protected plant and we

4059
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:10,479
have a group that will enforce that

4060
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:12,639
protection all around the world they

4061
02:52:10,478 --> 02:52:15,398
have offices in every agricultural

4062
02:52:12,639 --> 02:52:18,559
region around the world and yes I I'm

4063
02:52:15,398 --> 02:52:20,398
I'm the one that uh that showed the

4064
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:23,639
these people I had worked with them for

4065
02:52:20,398 --> 02:52:26,799
a really long time and uh Ryan knows

4066
02:52:23,639 --> 02:52:31,639
them so does Rob I've taken both of them

4067
02:52:26,799 --> 02:52:36,719
to visit with them and uh they she her

4068
02:52:31,639 --> 02:52:38,719
office she was on the uh upupa board and

4069
02:52:36,719 --> 02:52:41,358
she's the one who kept saying they will

4070
02:52:38,719 --> 02:52:45,318
change they will add chemical profile

4071
02:52:41,359 --> 02:52:49,000
they will add Turing Etc but it still

4072
02:52:45,318 --> 02:52:51,478
hasn't broken through to youp yet

4073
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:54,079
yeah whereas in patents it is all it

4074
02:52:51,478 --> 02:52:56,238
takes is someone with the money to apply

4075
02:52:54,079 --> 02:52:59,600
to to essentially do the process to have

4076
02:52:56,238 --> 02:53:00,959
them change the system right um it's

4077
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:02,399
it's actually the type of thing that

4078
02:53:00,959 --> 02:53:05,238
would be really nice if everybody buy

4079
02:53:02,398 --> 02:53:08,238
them they all know it needs to change

4080
02:53:05,238 --> 02:53:11,238
but it hasn't changed yet so what does

4081
02:53:08,238 --> 02:53:13,600
everyone think of like a canopia prior

4082
02:53:11,238 --> 02:53:16,600
art registering

4083
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:18,120
sequencing what is that helpful for for

4084
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:19,120
the people out there that don't have

4085
02:53:18,120 --> 02:53:22,680
access

4086
02:53:19,120 --> 02:53:25,000
to you know filing their novel plants

4087
02:53:22,680 --> 02:53:28,200
and you know is that even helpful for

4088
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:29,760
people in your opinion because I I go

4089
02:53:28,200 --> 02:53:32,479
back and forth and I I think it's

4090
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:34,800
helpful to understand relationships

4091
02:53:32,478 --> 02:53:37,799
between things and it's it's neat to see

4092
02:53:34,799 --> 02:53:40,599
that um but there's just such a large

4093
02:53:37,799 --> 02:53:43,679
big picture being missed there at times

4094
02:53:40,600 --> 02:53:46,159
I'm for all cannabis science regardless

4095
02:53:43,680 --> 02:53:49,279
of their motivation regardless of

4096
02:53:46,159 --> 02:53:51,079
anything I want to know yeah I think the

4097
02:53:49,279 --> 02:53:53,840
question though is it a useful system to

4098
02:53:51,079 --> 02:53:55,719
be able to defend intellectual property

4099
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:59,478
I think other than being able to say I

4100
02:53:55,719 --> 02:54:02,238
have a time a timestamp on this with

4101
02:53:59,478 --> 02:54:03,920
this genetic at this point in time is

4102
02:54:02,238 --> 02:54:06,119
helpful but even that doesn't tell the

4103
02:54:03,920 --> 02:54:08,040
St whole story right like that doesn't

4104
02:54:06,120 --> 02:54:10,920
prove development and it doesn't prove

4105
02:54:08,040 --> 02:54:12,120
ownership yep and I think it's again

4106
02:54:10,920 --> 02:54:15,719
it's something that happens in the

4107
02:54:12,120 --> 02:54:17,359
Canabis industry a lot yes feel that

4108
02:54:15,719 --> 02:54:19,760
they can't people feel that they can't

4109
02:54:17,359 --> 02:54:21,279
participate in the legal system and so

4110
02:54:19,760 --> 02:54:23,318
they run around and they try to come up

4111
02:54:21,279 --> 02:54:25,238
with reasons why they're going to

4112
02:54:23,318 --> 02:54:26,760
develop their own system and you know

4113
02:54:25,238 --> 02:54:28,799
everybody should do what they want to do

4114
02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:32,359
and it becomes essentially

4115
02:54:28,799 --> 02:54:36,318
like it's it becomes

4116
02:54:32,359 --> 02:54:38,760
optin right and an opin system when it

4117
02:54:36,318 --> 02:54:41,199
comes to enforcement is [ __ ] useless

4118
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:43,520
excuse my do not work it's totally

4119
02:54:41,200 --> 02:54:46,000
useless right and that's that's why

4120
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:48,760
having like like like Mojave said when

4121
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:51,359
you get the registration and then you

4122
02:54:48,760 --> 02:54:53,398
sign a a a contract with a company that

4123
02:54:51,359 --> 02:54:56,399
is that takes on responsibility of

4124
02:54:53,398 --> 02:54:59,318
enforcement but like a patent patents

4125
02:54:56,398 --> 02:55:01,760
can cost a bloody Fortune to defend if

4126
02:54:59,318 --> 02:55:06,398
you get a lot of opposition with the

4127
02:55:01,760 --> 02:55:08,880
same thing with uh uh upov if you have a

4128
02:55:06,398 --> 02:55:11,439
reader rights to a particular variety

4129
02:55:08,879 --> 02:55:13,719
and you know other people have copies of

4130
02:55:11,439 --> 02:55:16,559
that variety and are growing it and

4131
02:55:13,719 --> 02:55:19,278
selling it let me tell you gr after them

4132
02:55:16,559 --> 02:55:23,238
ain't cheap yeah can I give you my poor

4133
02:55:19,279 --> 02:55:24,680
man's IP tip and and and uh I think this

4134
02:55:23,238 --> 02:55:26,799
really would work out of all the

4135
02:55:24,680 --> 02:55:28,800
different like plant registration

4136
02:55:26,799 --> 02:55:31,719
nonprotected plant registration

4137
02:55:28,799 --> 02:55:35,039
herbarium slash kind of send us in your

4138
02:55:31,719 --> 02:55:36,679
sample phos whatever this is the one

4139
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:37,960
thing that I've done for about 10 years

4140
02:55:36,680 --> 02:55:42,040
that is I think

4141
02:55:37,959 --> 02:55:42,039
foolproof is freezing your

4142
02:55:42,520 --> 02:55:46,680
Calon yeah it's like mailing your uh

4143
02:55:44,799 --> 02:55:48,438
your songs to yourself right yeah but

4144
02:55:46,680 --> 02:55:50,040
it's even better though because it shows

4145
02:55:48,439 --> 02:55:53,398
that you were the person who handled

4146
02:55:50,040 --> 02:55:55,399
that seed that it's not brilliant I I

4147
02:55:53,398 --> 02:55:56,478
really think it's a smart idea I haven't

4148
02:55:55,398 --> 02:55:59,318
heard

4149
02:55:56,478 --> 02:56:02,398
that and that way sure you don't have IP

4150
02:55:59,318 --> 02:56:05,000
sure it's not enforcable but if anyone

4151
02:56:02,398 --> 02:56:06,840
like like Sam says enforcing a patent

4152
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:08,520
like I have a patent but I don't have a

4153
02:56:06,840 --> 02:56:10,520
team of lawyers so if someone wanted to

4154
02:56:08,520 --> 02:56:12,159
challenge me and like and and just steal

4155
02:56:10,520 --> 02:56:13,640
my my plant what if they they would get

4156
02:56:12,159 --> 02:56:15,639
away with it they could outspin me

4157
02:56:13,639 --> 02:56:18,318
easily I've been outspent by before by

4158
02:56:15,639 --> 02:56:19,478
people who ripped me off you know but so

4159
02:56:18,318 --> 02:56:21,079
when you're in court and then you pull

4160
02:56:19,478 --> 02:56:22,559
out your little well okay well did you

4161
02:56:21,079 --> 02:56:24,039
plant the seed okay then do you have

4162
02:56:22,559 --> 02:56:26,278
these little leaf tissue things that

4163
02:56:24,040 --> 02:56:27,920
show it came off of a little seed L say

4164
02:56:26,279 --> 02:56:29,960
but so then say they reach into their

4165
02:56:27,920 --> 02:56:31,719
bag and they've developed the breeding

4166
02:56:29,959 --> 02:56:34,358
technology that allows them to have your

4167
02:56:31,719 --> 02:56:36,799
plant material in their seed how do you

4168
02:56:34,359 --> 02:56:40,399
prove that it came from yours right

4169
02:56:36,799 --> 02:56:44,599
like yeah yeah the trouble is that the

4170
02:56:40,398 --> 02:56:48,760
Sharks and Minnows were all minnow and

4171
02:56:44,600 --> 02:56:50,680
the sharks are out there yeah well it's

4172
02:56:48,760 --> 02:56:52,040
yeah in it's like the music industry

4173
02:56:50,680 --> 02:56:54,318
it's like the moment you show a song to

4174
02:56:52,040 --> 02:56:56,800
someone it's like it that chorus reverse

4175
02:56:54,318 --> 02:56:59,600
may end up in like 20 other songs in a

4176
02:56:56,799 --> 02:57:02,478
session right and before yours even gets

4177
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:05,359
out you're like [ __ ] I showed that guy

4178
02:57:02,478 --> 02:57:07,398
that you know doesn't matter definitely

4179
02:57:05,359 --> 02:57:09,920
seems to be part of human

4180
02:57:07,398 --> 02:57:11,879
nature yeah certainly part of the

4181
02:57:09,920 --> 02:57:15,719
Cannabis industry's nature there's no

4182
02:57:11,879 --> 02:57:16,759
doubt about it well there was no other

4183
02:57:15,719 --> 02:57:18,959
nature it's not like there were

4184
02:57:16,760 --> 02:57:21,600
germplasm institutes and is doing it

4185
02:57:18,959 --> 02:57:23,679
right that you know Sam had to go around

4186
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:26,040
and actually you know fund and support

4187
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:28,279
them and make those reality as well as

4188
02:57:26,040 --> 02:57:30,960
others otherwise you know what would we

4189
02:57:28,279 --> 02:57:33,680
have if it you know you sure the grock

4190
02:57:30,959 --> 02:57:35,919
treaty is now the Treaty of the of and

4191
02:57:33,680 --> 02:57:38,600
the reality that we experienced but what

4192
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:41,040
if it hadn't been for the Arians and

4193
02:57:38,600 --> 02:57:43,238
dronkers and others what would and to

4194
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:46,279
tell you the truth when I collected

4195
02:57:43,238 --> 02:57:49,879
seeds starting in the 70s there weren't

4196
02:57:46,279 --> 02:57:52,000
none of these laws so I could legally go

4197
02:57:49,879 --> 02:57:54,519
collect land races bring them to

4198
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:58,040
California reproduce them sell them do

4199
02:57:54,520 --> 02:58:00,200
whatever I wanted and there was no

4200
02:57:58,040 --> 02:58:02,359
regulations I think it's better that

4201
02:58:00,200 --> 02:58:04,439
there is a regulation and that the

4202
02:58:02,359 --> 02:58:06,840
caretakers and the Breeders and the

4203
02:58:04,439 --> 02:58:10,120
original Farmers should get some sort of

4204
02:58:06,840 --> 02:58:12,000
piece of the pie yeah that sounds right

4205
02:58:10,120 --> 02:58:13,399
so when you were collecting seeds so

4206
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:16,398
you've said this a few times over the

4207
02:58:13,398 --> 02:58:17,639
years where they're literally I mean

4208
02:58:16,398 --> 02:58:19,000
basically what you're saying to me and

4209
02:58:17,639 --> 02:58:20,680
what I'm hearing I'll just steal it all

4210
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:22,398
the way down is all the seeds that we

4211
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:24,559
have we shouldn't technically have

4212
02:58:22,398 --> 02:58:27,398
because we've stolen them right as a

4213
02:58:24,559 --> 02:58:32,439
community no that's not

4214
02:58:27,398 --> 02:58:34,318
1,00% but uh I'd say so what is it

4215
02:58:32,439 --> 02:58:36,840
that's probably true look it's exactly

4216
02:58:34,318 --> 02:58:38,760
like colonialism I mean you were born in

4217
02:58:36,840 --> 02:58:40,799
America you're an American citizen but

4218
02:58:38,760 --> 02:58:43,200
your genetic Roots come from there you

4219
02:58:40,799 --> 02:58:45,920
you were essentially a seed of the evil

4220
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:48,960
spawn of colonialism does that mean you

4221
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:51,200
you're wrong or you can't

4222
02:58:48,959 --> 02:58:53,159
do you owe the blacks a bit bunch of

4223
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:55,439
money because you're white do you owe

4224
02:58:53,159 --> 02:58:57,879
the American Indians a bunch of money

4225
02:58:55,439 --> 02:59:00,159
because you're white uh that's a hard

4226
02:58:57,879 --> 02:59:03,000
nut to crack here's an interesting thing

4227
02:59:00,159 --> 02:59:06,359
is that in in a lot of the

4228
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:08,600
Cannabis so more I think more cannabis

4229
02:59:06,359 --> 02:59:12,840
germ plasm came from export than from

4230
02:59:08,600 --> 02:59:16,359
people sourcing it from location so they

4231
02:59:12,840 --> 02:59:18,639
exported illegal weed and US peasants

4232
02:59:16,359 --> 02:59:22,318
collected the seeds out of it that's

4233
02:59:18,639 --> 02:59:25,920
absolutely true I think that that forced

4234
02:59:22,318 --> 02:59:28,439
upon us is what you're saying sorry it

4235
02:59:25,920 --> 02:59:30,318
was forced upon us really exactly it

4236
02:59:28,439 --> 02:59:32,040
showed up in my back door and little

4237
02:59:30,318 --> 02:59:34,519
pellets fell out and I put them in the

4238
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:37,040
ground I you know but but interestingly

4239
02:59:34,520 --> 02:59:39,359
enough I think a big narrative is that

4240
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:41,720
we went out into the world and brought

4241
02:59:39,359 --> 02:59:43,920
these seeds back but I think fewer

4242
02:59:41,719 --> 02:59:45,959
that's Sam and there's very few Sams in

4243
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:48,559
the world that actually went there and

4244
02:59:45,959 --> 02:59:50,839
got Seed where most of the ger PL came

4245
02:59:48,559 --> 02:59:53,920
in the form of flower or being shipped

4246
02:59:50,840 --> 02:59:57,478
to the US I I think there's more Sams

4247
02:59:53,920 --> 02:59:59,719
today than there was 30 40 years ago

4248
02:59:57,478 --> 03:00:02,879
because uh there's a lot of people out

4249
02:59:59,719 --> 03:00:05,799
there going and collecting land races

4250
03:00:02,879 --> 03:00:07,920
and trying to profit from them you know

4251
03:00:05,799 --> 03:00:11,119
I I really like the philosophy of the of

4252
03:00:07,920 --> 03:00:12,398
the of upov and that is yes the things

4253
03:00:11,120 --> 03:00:14,560
that you can

4254
03:00:12,398 --> 03:00:17,119
develop you have the right to

4255
03:00:14,559 --> 03:00:19,359
commercially profit from them but if you

4256
03:00:17,120 --> 03:00:21,399
use the upov system and you do get a

4257
03:00:19,359 --> 03:00:24,040
registration for example you have to

4258
03:00:21,398 --> 03:00:25,719
make that variety available for home use

4259
03:00:24,040 --> 03:00:27,720
you have to make it available for other

4260
03:00:25,719 --> 03:00:29,000
breeders right they can't just knock it

4261
03:00:27,719 --> 03:00:31,000
off and sell the same thing that you

4262
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:34,359
created but they can use it in the

4263
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:38,318
development of future plant varieties

4264
03:00:34,359 --> 03:00:40,439
and the reason is that that plant

4265
03:00:38,318 --> 03:00:43,238
genetic resources

4266
03:00:40,439 --> 03:00:45,238
are or should be available to all of

4267
03:00:43,238 --> 03:00:47,079
humanity right like plant genetic

4268
03:00:45,238 --> 03:00:50,478
resources themselves should not be owned

4269
03:00:47,079 --> 03:00:52,719
by a corporation or an individual right

4270
03:00:50,478 --> 03:00:54,519
so yeah you can benefit for a period of

4271
03:00:52,719 --> 03:00:56,599
time from from the developments that you

4272
03:00:54,520 --> 03:00:58,920
make from those resources in some

4273
03:00:56,600 --> 03:01:02,318
countries you have to give the original

4274
03:00:58,920 --> 03:01:04,920
breeder of a variety that is used to

4275
03:01:02,318 --> 03:01:07,680
create subsequent varieties you have to

4276
03:01:04,920 --> 03:01:11,600
give them a portion of the

4277
03:01:07,680 --> 03:01:13,840
profits other in other countries uh it's

4278
03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:16,760
not allowed without the breeder's rights

4279
03:01:13,840 --> 03:01:19,439
and and the breeder can say you can't do

4280
03:01:16,760 --> 03:01:22,719
it so there's a lot of different uh

4281
03:01:19,439 --> 03:01:24,200
iterations of that yeah and that's

4282
03:01:22,719 --> 03:01:25,959
that's one of the real differences about

4283
03:01:24,200 --> 03:01:28,560
the patent is that when you actually

4284
03:01:25,959 --> 03:01:30,358
have the patent you don't have to make

4285
03:01:28,559 --> 03:01:32,278
that those plants available to other

4286
03:01:30,359 --> 03:01:34,399
people they are the corporate property

4287
03:01:32,279 --> 03:01:37,279
of whatever entity registered them or

4288
03:01:34,398 --> 03:01:40,639
holds the patent

4289
03:01:37,279 --> 03:01:42,439
right important what it's a very

4290
03:01:40,639 --> 03:01:46,079
different fruit of the system is what it

4291
03:01:42,439 --> 03:01:48,200
is right well it's yeah it is right but

4292
03:01:46,079 --> 03:01:50,840
there's other systems around us like the

4293
03:01:48,200 --> 03:01:52,520
music industry that live and die by that

4294
03:01:50,840 --> 03:01:54,318
like you can't sample an artist without

4295
03:01:52,520 --> 03:01:57,040
them saying okay and going through

4296
03:01:54,318 --> 03:01:59,478
either their state or them personally

4297
03:01:57,040 --> 03:02:03,319
and do it if you get

4298
03:01:59,478 --> 03:02:05,398
caught yeah but I mean it's really easy

4299
03:02:03,318 --> 03:02:07,079
to do it you know to you know or you

4300
03:02:05,398 --> 03:02:08,358
have I've you know for me I've sampled

4301
03:02:07,079 --> 03:02:11,398
people and then I have to go into the

4302
03:02:08,359 --> 03:02:15,279
session and basically mimic it right um

4303
03:02:11,398 --> 03:02:16,840
and recreate it um so it's it goes both

4304
03:02:15,279 --> 03:02:21,279
ways but I like that because it holds

4305
03:02:16,840 --> 03:02:22,359
people to a standard it and it keeps our

4306
03:02:21,279 --> 03:02:24,238
you know we were talking about earlier

4307
03:02:22,359 --> 03:02:25,640
in the conversation history intact like

4308
03:02:24,238 --> 03:02:28,199
there's a historical reference here

4309
03:02:25,639 --> 03:02:30,159
where this began and why and here's

4310
03:02:28,200 --> 03:02:33,359
where it's going and that person and

4311
03:02:30,159 --> 03:02:37,039
that that Legacy is along with it

4312
03:02:33,359 --> 03:02:38,920
so I'd love to see Sam get res you know

4313
03:02:37,040 --> 03:02:42,160
in this you know in the same light

4314
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:45,760
residuals right for no no I that's not

4315
03:02:42,159 --> 03:02:48,000
why I did it course not the reason I

4316
03:02:45,760 --> 03:02:51,120
produced millions and millions and

4317
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:54,639
millions of seeds was because I wanted

4318
03:02:51,120 --> 03:02:56,880
to change the world and to do that there

4319
03:02:54,639 --> 03:02:59,238
needed to be seeds there needed to be

4320
03:02:56,879 --> 03:03:01,478
clones there needed to be artificial

4321
03:02:59,238 --> 03:03:04,840
lights and now that the world has

4322
03:03:01,478 --> 03:03:07,760
changed uh let's finish the job and make

4323
03:03:04,840 --> 03:03:11,439
it so everybody anywhere can grow for

4324
03:03:07,760 --> 03:03:14,200
any reason and uh you know the hell with

4325
03:03:11,439 --> 03:03:16,398
h the Nay there's another little lesson

4326
03:03:14,200 --> 03:03:19,159
in there as well about plan IP when you

4327
03:03:16,398 --> 03:03:23,159
sell seeds you've given weigh the rights

4328
03:03:19,159 --> 03:03:24,920
yeah right you haven't so it's you know

4329
03:03:23,159 --> 03:03:26,520
if people are really truly concerned

4330
03:03:24,920 --> 03:03:28,520
about owning these things they shouldn't

4331
03:03:26,520 --> 03:03:30,479
be selling the seeds and just be aware

4332
03:03:28,520 --> 03:03:32,439
that if you are selling the seeds you

4333
03:03:30,478 --> 03:03:34,039
can kiss your rights goodbye because you

4334
03:03:32,439 --> 03:03:36,520
you sell those rights when you sell the

4335
03:03:34,040 --> 03:03:39,160
seeds yeah right so it's an important

4336
03:03:36,520 --> 03:03:40,920
distinction to understand and it's you

4337
03:03:39,159 --> 03:03:42,478
want to jump in there Davis you had your

4338
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:45,159
hand up for a while now I was just going

4339
03:03:42,478 --> 03:03:47,559
to comment on the idea about land races

4340
03:03:45,159 --> 03:03:49,559
again that like they were stolen I think

4341
03:03:47,559 --> 03:03:50,959
I I think there are situations where

4342
03:03:49,559 --> 03:03:53,000
people didn't have permission or

4343
03:03:50,959 --> 03:03:55,478
ultimately made you know through some

4344
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:58,000
nefarious means to get um the

4345
03:03:55,478 --> 03:04:00,318
opportunity to take them but I mean like

4346
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:02,000
I've got I've got five contacts three or

4347
03:04:00,318 --> 03:04:04,840
family friends of mine which is where

4348
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:07,840
I've sourced and developed my germ plasm

4349
03:04:04,840 --> 03:04:09,600
library and I can speak for my family

4350
03:04:07,840 --> 03:04:11,359
friends that are preservationists and

4351
03:04:09,600 --> 03:04:13,640
like very much into you know

4352
03:04:11,359 --> 03:04:17,318
preservation of culture history all of

4353
03:04:13,639 --> 03:04:19,278
that not just into cannabis that they

4354
03:04:17,318 --> 03:04:22,119
want to make sure that you know the

4355
03:04:19,279 --> 03:04:23,840
information from those regions the type

4356
03:04:22,120 --> 03:04:25,319
of culture gets recognized and

4357
03:04:23,840 --> 03:04:27,359
ultimately like the hardships and

4358
03:04:25,318 --> 03:04:29,559
everything that's associated because in

4359
03:04:27,359 --> 03:04:31,880
a lot of these regions that are isolated

4360
03:04:29,559 --> 03:04:33,760
that there still is you know cannabis

4361
03:04:31,879 --> 03:04:35,679
cultivation that hasn't been alterated

4362
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:37,159
adulterated and I want to State while

4363
03:04:35,680 --> 03:04:39,238
I'm saying that some of these areas

4364
03:04:37,159 --> 03:04:42,719
likely have had adulteration over

4365
03:04:39,238 --> 03:04:46,159
decades or even were those seeds from uh

4366
03:04:42,719 --> 03:04:48,238
imported into the United States or were

4367
03:04:46,159 --> 03:04:49,639
they coming from different countries

4368
03:04:48,238 --> 03:04:52,398
they're coming from different countries

4369
03:04:49,639 --> 03:04:55,599
originally and it was

4370
03:04:52,398 --> 03:04:57,799
illegal yeah I guess that's fair to say

4371
03:04:55,600 --> 03:05:01,760
I I more was just making the point that

4372
03:04:57,799 --> 03:05:05,318
the there's no if or buts about it uh if

4373
03:05:01,760 --> 03:05:08,439
you don't go through the UN treaty

4374
03:05:05,318 --> 03:05:10,920
biodiversity Nama treaties Etc and the

4375
03:05:08,439 --> 03:05:14,120
newer one it's

4376
03:05:10,920 --> 03:05:18,398
illegal okay

4377
03:05:14,120 --> 03:05:21,120
and that's the thing is that those those

4378
03:05:18,398 --> 03:05:22,920
reality that we have had We Exist under

4379
03:05:21,120 --> 03:05:25,720
and now it's going to be an interesting

4380
03:05:22,920 --> 03:05:28,000
fight currently that treaty the gro

4381
03:05:25,719 --> 03:05:32,079
treaty Michael I believe is being tested

4382
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:35,959
by neem and India India is going after

4383
03:05:32,079 --> 03:05:37,920
people who extracted and took neem and

4384
03:05:35,959 --> 03:05:41,358
this is going to be the first kind of

4385
03:05:37,920 --> 03:05:44,478
world test case um specifically under

4386
03:05:41,359 --> 03:05:46,680
the new treaty am I correct on that

4387
03:05:44,478 --> 03:05:49,639
Michael oh you're following that more

4388
03:05:46,680 --> 03:05:49,639
than I am so

4389
03:05:51,719 --> 03:05:56,398
yeah so it's a new frontier people and

4390
03:05:54,398 --> 03:05:58,760
that's that's the thing what what what

4391
03:05:56,398 --> 03:06:01,439
has existed and what does exist is is

4392
03:05:58,760 --> 03:06:03,439
down a new pathway and this is the a of

4393
03:06:01,439 --> 03:06:06,760
responsibility that we're talking about

4394
03:06:03,439 --> 03:06:09,880
that has been deflected for Generations

4395
03:06:06,760 --> 03:06:12,079
now has to come home to roost and you

4396
03:06:09,879 --> 03:06:14,000
know it's it's a new day and we're

4397
03:06:12,079 --> 03:06:16,799
looking forward to seeing what happens

4398
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:18,920
who Rises to the occasion and I stated

4399
03:06:16,799 --> 03:06:21,559
you know India's taking its first step

4400
03:06:18,920 --> 03:06:24,478
and it's around neem and neem is a type

4401
03:06:21,559 --> 03:06:26,600
of tree that you can express press the

4402
03:06:24,478 --> 03:06:30,760
oil out of the leaves and has been used

4403
03:06:26,600 --> 03:06:32,640
I know I have used it as a um you know a

4404
03:06:30,760 --> 03:06:35,318
natural disinfectant or cleaner of

4405
03:06:32,639 --> 03:06:38,000
plants in gardens so um it's going to be

4406
03:06:35,318 --> 03:06:40,000
interesting to see because no one's gone

4407
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:42,000
this way with cannabis yet but now there

4408
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:43,879
is precedence and somebody's gonna fly

4409
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:47,120
and run with that

4410
03:06:43,879 --> 03:06:50,199
flag with neem too it's been used for

4411
03:06:47,120 --> 03:06:54,000
thousands of years as a toothbrush in

4412
03:06:50,200 --> 03:06:56,479
India just the stems hey just to say if

4413
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:58,719
you're in if you're in Canada and those

4414
03:06:56,478 --> 03:07:02,679
seeds came into the Country Canada is

4415
03:06:58,719 --> 03:07:05,199
not a signatory to the ngoya protocol so

4416
03:07:02,680 --> 03:07:07,960
um again it comes down to enforcement

4417
03:07:05,200 --> 03:07:10,200
unless you were like advertising it

4418
03:07:07,959 --> 03:07:13,679
as directly

4419
03:07:10,200 --> 03:07:16,120
from uh you know a certain certain

4420
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:18,439
population down in South America there's

4421
03:07:16,120 --> 03:07:20,520
no enforcement action to go after you

4422
03:07:18,439 --> 03:07:22,800
because Canada is not part of a

4423
03:07:20,520 --> 03:07:26,000
signatory to the party right and even

4424
03:07:22,799 --> 03:07:29,039
even within the neoya protocol it's more

4425
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:30,879
about systems and less about enforcement

4426
03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:33,840
like there is no real enforcement arm to

4427
03:07:30,879 --> 03:07:37,039
the treaty so like if you violate the

4428
03:07:33,840 --> 03:07:39,960
rules there's nobody to come after you

4429
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:41,040
yeah right so it's like these again

4430
03:07:39,959 --> 03:07:43,318
that's what I was saying like these

4431
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:44,960
systems are kind of it to a degree

4432
03:07:43,318 --> 03:07:46,840
they're opt in now Holland is in a

4433
03:07:44,959 --> 03:07:50,119
different boat right because Holland is

4434
03:07:46,840 --> 03:07:51,520
a signator signatory to these treaties

4435
03:07:50,120 --> 03:07:54,560
yeah I think all the European nations

4436
03:07:51,520 --> 03:07:55,960
are so you know it sure maybe that could

4437
03:07:54,559 --> 03:07:59,799
affect

4438
03:07:55,959 --> 03:08:03,398
trade of of that Variety in Europe but

4439
03:07:59,799 --> 03:08:05,238
it won't in Canada yeah so you know

4440
03:08:03,398 --> 03:08:07,278
these things aren't so cut and dry just

4441
03:08:05,238 --> 03:08:08,478
because there's a treaty it doesn't mean

4442
03:08:07,279 --> 03:08:10,279
that people aren't going to still do

4443
03:08:08,478 --> 03:08:12,879
these things you know there's all sorts

4444
03:08:10,279 --> 03:08:15,159
Tre that North Americans and you know

4445
03:08:12,879 --> 03:08:17,159
principally Canada and the United States

4446
03:08:15,159 --> 03:08:19,639
which are really a lot of the offending

4447
03:08:17,159 --> 03:08:21,159
Nation in these cases the government

4448
03:08:19,639 --> 03:08:23,559
just said hell no we're not signing on

4449
03:08:21,159 --> 03:08:26,719
to that and and Holland's not so holy I

4450
03:08:23,559 --> 03:08:30,039
mean remember where the Tulip came from

4451
03:08:26,719 --> 03:08:33,119
it came from turkey or that general area

4452
03:08:30,040 --> 03:08:37,520
and uh Holland is the one who took Tulum

4453
03:08:33,120 --> 03:08:40,880
to its heights yeah I

4454
03:08:37,520 --> 03:08:43,800
have go ahead I I have a vision of

4455
03:08:40,879 --> 03:08:46,079
hopefully not too naive Vision that the

4456
03:08:43,799 --> 03:08:48,438
these large interests you know huge

4457
03:08:46,079 --> 03:08:52,000
corporate interests and individual you

4458
03:08:48,439 --> 03:08:53,760
know small societies of Growers uh uh

4459
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:57,238
indigenous peoples craft Growers

4460
03:08:53,760 --> 03:09:01,920
traditional medicine people Etc can not

4461
03:08:57,238 --> 03:09:05,000
just sort of exist coexist but actually

4462
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:07,840
really support each other um that I

4463
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:10,079
would contend colonialism took great

4464
03:09:07,840 --> 03:09:12,159
products and drove them into the ground

4465
03:09:10,079 --> 03:09:14,559
and if you want to have sustainability

4466
03:09:12,159 --> 03:09:18,600
you need to maintain that conduit

4467
03:09:14,559 --> 03:09:21,398
between the source and the and product

4468
03:09:18,600 --> 03:09:23,318
um big corporations that have tried to

4469
03:09:21,398 --> 03:09:26,799
get away from that and create their own

4470
03:09:23,318 --> 03:09:29,039
Universe have really blisteringly failed

4471
03:09:26,799 --> 03:09:31,759
you know the Monsanto model is is not

4472
03:09:29,040 --> 03:09:33,920
doing too well in our Modern Age so no

4473
03:09:31,760 --> 03:09:37,318
it's more like do

4474
03:09:33,920 --> 03:09:39,639
fruit yeah it's funny because Europe has

4475
03:09:37,318 --> 03:09:42,439
all these rules about you're not allowed

4476
03:09:39,639 --> 03:09:44,000
to import plant products like products

4477
03:09:42,439 --> 03:09:46,079
of plant varieties that aren't

4478
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:48,000
registered right but when it comes to

4479
03:09:46,079 --> 03:09:50,200
cannabis they're importing all sorts of

4480
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:51,680
unregistered varieties and right nobody

4481
03:09:50,200 --> 03:09:53,920
even says anything about it so it's

4482
03:09:51,680 --> 03:09:56,079
really I don't know like it's that

4483
03:09:53,920 --> 03:09:57,799
should change hopefully that that's ATN

4484
03:09:56,079 --> 03:09:59,920
is saying hopefully that that's the new

4485
03:09:57,799 --> 03:10:01,639
frontier you know it's hard to say who

4486
03:09:59,920 --> 03:10:04,840
will put their first toe on that line

4487
03:10:01,639 --> 03:10:07,079
but the the emergence of international

4488
03:10:04,840 --> 03:10:09,520
regulated medicinal cannabis markets and

4489
03:10:07,079 --> 03:10:12,079
sales is a good first

4490
03:10:09,520 --> 03:10:14,439
step and there's and it's like the

4491
03:10:12,079 --> 03:10:17,439
United States it's like trying to tie a

4492
03:10:14,439 --> 03:10:20,120
tie together all these Patchwork rules

4493
03:10:17,439 --> 03:10:23,279
that are so different it becomes a quilt

4494
03:10:20,120 --> 03:10:27,359
right like if any seeds are found in the

4495
03:10:23,279 --> 03:10:32,800
legally imported International cannabis

4496
03:10:27,359 --> 03:10:35,720
uh The Growers here in America will use

4497
03:10:32,799 --> 03:10:38,079
them yeah I'm not sure it's legal but

4498
03:10:35,719 --> 03:10:39,719
they'll use them and I was just going to

4499
03:10:38,079 --> 03:10:41,520
say there's no guarantee that even if

4500
03:10:39,719 --> 03:10:43,438
you go through the legal pathway that

4501
03:10:41,520 --> 03:10:45,600
you're bringing the most benefit to the

4502
03:10:43,439 --> 03:10:48,359
people who should be getting that

4503
03:10:45,600 --> 03:10:51,120
benefit so so like right now you've got

4504
03:10:48,359 --> 03:10:53,600
all these companies which are you know

4505
03:10:51,120 --> 03:10:57,760
operating in a gray area in this land

4506
03:10:53,600 --> 03:10:59,439
race Pakistan Afghanistan Nepal India

4507
03:10:57,760 --> 03:11:01,398
seed exchange world that's happening

4508
03:10:59,439 --> 03:11:03,279
right now and it's really big it's great

4509
03:11:01,398 --> 03:11:05,639
and some of them are working with local

4510
03:11:03,279 --> 03:11:07,640
people to you know share the profit and

4511
03:11:05,639 --> 03:11:10,599
to help tell the story and you know it's

4512
03:11:07,639 --> 03:11:13,719
kind of a it's a part a social Equity

4513
03:11:10,600 --> 03:11:15,479
play it enrolled in there but so so is

4514
03:11:13,719 --> 03:11:17,959
that better you know to do it on the

4515
03:11:15,478 --> 03:11:21,278
Grassroots level working with the tribe

4516
03:11:17,959 --> 03:11:24,438
in the Amazon directly versus working

4517
03:11:21,279 --> 03:11:26,960
through all the proper channels you know

4518
03:11:24,439 --> 03:11:28,000
it it gets filtered out and and I think

4519
03:11:26,959 --> 03:11:29,358
that's a challenge and I I'm just

4520
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:31,000
bringing that up because some of the

4521
03:11:29,359 --> 03:11:33,040
people that are doing this I feel are

4522
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:34,120
ethical you know and they're going there

4523
03:11:33,040 --> 03:11:36,279
they're going like look I'm going to go

4524
03:11:34,120 --> 03:11:37,760
to Nepal I'm going to sour seeds I'm

4525
03:11:36,279 --> 03:11:40,200
going to sell them in the US I'm going

4526
03:11:37,760 --> 03:11:42,079
to give share profit with the people in

4527
03:11:40,200 --> 03:11:44,479
Nepal I'm going to tell their story and

4528
03:11:42,079 --> 03:11:45,959
GNA you know but they're doing it

4529
03:11:44,478 --> 03:11:48,760
they're totally violating the plant

4530
03:11:45,959 --> 03:11:50,238
protection act right you know so like

4531
03:11:48,760 --> 03:11:52,040
it's like which which rules are we

4532
03:11:50,238 --> 03:11:54,520
obeying okay so we we go by the ethical

4533
03:11:52,040 --> 03:11:56,239
rules of what we decide is right for the

4534
03:11:54,520 --> 03:11:58,920
the original peoples and we totally

4535
03:11:56,238 --> 03:12:00,359
ignore the cosmic brother law yeah we

4536
03:11:58,920 --> 03:12:02,079
totally ignore the rules of the

4537
03:12:00,359 --> 03:12:05,040
government you know that puts these laws

4538
03:12:02,079 --> 03:12:06,238
in place for for like protection of the

4539
03:12:05,040 --> 03:12:08,560
indust you know protection of the

4540
03:12:06,238 --> 03:12:12,199
industry I was saying this like in 2017

4541
03:12:08,559 --> 03:12:13,959
in Canada we were importing stuff um

4542
03:12:12,200 --> 03:12:15,840
into the Canadian system and everything

4543
03:12:13,959 --> 03:12:17,919
that we brought in had to go through

4544
03:12:15,840 --> 03:12:19,079
phytosanitary and then get these Cowboys

4545
03:12:17,920 --> 03:12:21,879
that are bringing stuff up from the

4546
03:12:19,079 --> 03:12:23,680
United States um because it's got It's a

4547
03:12:21,879 --> 03:12:26,879
clone with a hot name and by the way it

4548
03:12:23,680 --> 03:12:29,200
also has like Cam and Russen mites and

4549
03:12:26,879 --> 03:12:31,398
uh hop L and vroid right and all of a

4550
03:12:29,200 --> 03:12:33,000
sudden hop L and V viroids running like

4551
03:12:31,398 --> 03:12:35,358
a hot fire going through everybody's

4552
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:37,398
grow room like what do you think that

4553
03:12:35,359 --> 03:12:40,520
cost right what do you think that cost

4554
03:12:37,398 --> 03:12:43,920
the industry um it's still costing the

4555
03:12:40,520 --> 03:12:46,840
industry cost in the industry today yeah

4556
03:12:43,920 --> 03:12:49,840
so unable the number what has been lost

4557
03:12:46,840 --> 03:12:51,799
due to that right yeah yeah so I'm not

4558
03:12:49,840 --> 03:12:53,760
saying that like you know all government

4559
03:12:51,799 --> 03:12:56,959
reg regulations should be followed to a

4560
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:59,559
te but like they're they're put in for a

4561
03:12:56,959 --> 03:13:01,438
reason right and when we operate outside

4562
03:12:59,559 --> 03:13:04,559
of those systems there's

4563
03:13:01,439 --> 03:13:06,880
consequences so yeah you know these are

4564
03:13:04,559 --> 03:13:09,000
these are really complex discussions

4565
03:13:06,879 --> 03:13:11,199
with so many things to take into account

4566
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:13,840
and it almost feels like we had these

4567
03:13:11,200 --> 03:13:15,159
discussions turn into oh it's a big

4568
03:13:13,840 --> 03:13:17,760
complicated thing let's just keep doing

4569
03:13:15,159 --> 03:13:19,318
what we're doing right

4570
03:13:17,760 --> 03:13:20,639
it's a it's a it's there's too much

4571
03:13:19,318 --> 03:13:22,799
friction there let's just keep going

4572
03:13:20,639 --> 03:13:24,358
along with the status quo and I think we

4573
03:13:22,799 --> 03:13:26,079
also can recognize that it's also not

4574
03:13:24,359 --> 03:13:27,960
the way to go you know we have to evolve

4575
03:13:26,079 --> 03:13:31,238
we have to be willing to

4576
03:13:27,959 --> 03:13:33,759
evolve we have to you know yeah it's a

4577
03:13:31,238 --> 03:13:36,680
complicated one I think I think it I

4578
03:13:33,760 --> 03:13:39,318
think this pivots very well into uh

4579
03:13:36,680 --> 03:13:41,880
Brian's conversation today which is this

4580
03:13:39,318 --> 03:13:43,478
blight uh and it kind of talks to the

4581
03:13:41,879 --> 03:13:45,398
other side of breeding right when you're

4582
03:13:43,478 --> 03:13:47,519
putting plants together like maybe make

4583
03:13:45,398 --> 03:13:50,719
a point on getting rid of some of these

4584
03:13:47,520 --> 03:13:52,720
things that are susceptible to viroids

4585
03:13:50,719 --> 03:13:55,879
and diseases and back you know all of

4586
03:13:52,719 --> 03:13:57,879
these things so Brian ever so patient my

4587
03:13:55,879 --> 03:14:00,679
friend you are definitely patient three

4588
03:13:57,879 --> 03:14:02,519
hours 12 minutes but you're up I'm

4589
03:14:00,680 --> 03:14:04,238
thankful there's so much information at

4590
03:14:02,520 --> 03:14:06,920
hand I'm taking notes over here just

4591
03:14:04,238 --> 03:14:09,318
listening kind of trying to saturate and

4592
03:14:06,920 --> 03:14:12,079
you know it's really a lot and it all so

4593
03:14:09,318 --> 03:14:14,359
much applies to like what we all do and

4594
03:14:12,079 --> 03:14:18,760
definitely what I'm doing here on the

4595
03:14:14,359 --> 03:14:20,120
field in Maine inside and out and and uh

4596
03:14:18,760 --> 03:14:22,079
follows along well with the other

4597
03:14:20,120 --> 03:14:24,560
episodes kind of chaining into this one

4598
03:14:22,079 --> 03:14:27,719
here too a good Rhythm but I was even

4599
03:14:24,559 --> 03:14:29,760
taking some notes of my own just kind of

4600
03:14:27,719 --> 03:14:31,879
mentioning for here in Maine like with

4601
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:34,120
my breeding outside I've been breeding

4602
03:14:31,879 --> 03:14:37,920
outside for years now and kind of

4603
03:14:34,120 --> 03:14:39,800
sticking it to that realm so in Maine in

4604
03:14:37,920 --> 03:14:41,840
typical fashion I've usually paid

4605
03:14:39,799 --> 03:14:44,318
attention to like smell up front when

4606
03:14:41,840 --> 03:14:46,318
I'm breeding for for the turp showing

4607
03:14:44,318 --> 03:14:48,879
early so I'll go for what I call two we

4608
03:14:46,318 --> 03:14:51,799
turs but I've also followed it with like

4609
03:14:48,879 --> 03:14:54,079
a taste to effect and I'd look at the

4610
03:14:51,799 --> 03:14:57,079
look thereafter even and just more go

4611
03:14:54,079 --> 03:14:59,439
for smell up front really good taste

4612
03:14:57,079 --> 03:15:02,719
into the effect and then leaning into

4613
03:14:59,439 --> 03:15:04,318
other you know areas too but for outside

4614
03:15:02,719 --> 03:15:06,000
why I breed outside is because of the

4615
03:15:04,318 --> 03:15:08,318
health and resistance factor and I'm

4616
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:11,559
looking for overall health in the past

4617
03:15:08,318 --> 03:15:13,879
years this year and then I'd say for I

4618
03:15:11,559 --> 03:15:16,119
guess about the past four years we've

4619
03:15:13,879 --> 03:15:18,920
had this septoria challenge is what I've

4620
03:15:16,120 --> 03:15:23,000
heard it's called I know Colin has ideas

4621
03:15:18,920 --> 03:15:25,520
or uh some information and I can kind of

4622
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:28,799
report from the field so I'm seeing

4623
03:15:25,520 --> 03:15:32,120
results as far as like types that will

4624
03:15:28,799 --> 03:15:34,840
make it types that definitely aren't and

4625
03:15:32,120 --> 03:15:37,120
I have a list going I definitely have a

4626
03:15:34,840 --> 03:15:40,359
library uh happening I'm seeing about a

4627
03:15:37,120 --> 03:15:43,920
10% carry so from like my clones in the

4628
03:15:40,359 --> 03:15:46,040
library at 10% hold on what makes it and

4629
03:15:43,920 --> 03:15:48,600
continued resistance year to year as

4630
03:15:46,040 --> 03:15:51,080
well but I'm definitely seeing a lot of

4631
03:15:48,600 --> 03:15:53,199
damage and I'm seeing some new types

4632
03:15:51,079 --> 03:15:55,478
that are showing faces I'm even you know

4633
03:15:53,199 --> 03:15:59,079
for the the defense I've seen some stuff

4634
03:15:55,478 --> 03:16:01,159
kick into defense later on now like as

4635
03:15:59,079 --> 03:16:03,039
it switches to fungal in the root Zone

4636
03:16:01,159 --> 03:16:06,199
from the vegetative and it seems to

4637
03:16:03,040 --> 03:16:08,680
carry on uh a health fight a resistance

4638
03:16:06,199 --> 03:16:09,800
but I've also I'm learning a lot about I

4639
03:16:08,680 --> 03:16:11,439
don't know much about it but I'm

4640
03:16:09,799 --> 03:16:12,679
learning from the field about septoria

4641
03:16:11,439 --> 03:16:14,318
at least here in the Mana I'm hearing

4642
03:16:12,680 --> 03:16:17,318
it's hitting other areas like you know

4643
03:16:14,318 --> 03:16:20,198
New York Michigan I think it's not being

4644
03:16:17,318 --> 03:16:22,359
talked about yet enough and much so it's

4645
03:16:20,199 --> 03:16:24,159
kind of elephant in the room and this

4646
03:16:22,359 --> 03:16:26,520
stuff's a wipe out quicker damage and

4647
03:16:24,159 --> 03:16:29,079
I've seen anything um I've seen

4648
03:16:26,520 --> 03:16:31,359
different forms of it I'm talking to so

4649
03:16:29,079 --> 03:16:34,760
SC you know like not scientists but soil

4650
03:16:31,359 --> 03:16:36,960
Pros here and we're just discussing it

4651
03:16:34,760 --> 03:16:40,159
there's chats going on today locally

4652
03:16:36,959 --> 03:16:41,639
even and it's you it's pulling off a

4653
03:16:40,159 --> 03:16:44,279
good enough product at the end is

4654
03:16:41,639 --> 03:16:45,760
definitely affecting yield the hash is

4655
03:16:44,279 --> 03:16:47,640
coming out still really good even

4656
03:16:45,760 --> 03:16:50,040
through some of the like rip it off get

4657
03:16:47,639 --> 03:16:52,519
it right down to Bear the flower seems

4658
03:16:50,040 --> 03:16:54,439
to be kind of for some reason into the

4659
03:16:52,520 --> 03:16:56,560
the portion you know into flowering it

4660
03:16:54,439 --> 03:16:59,279
seems to fade off or not have as much of

4661
03:16:56,559 --> 03:17:01,000
a of a hold but it wants to kill the

4662
03:16:59,279 --> 03:17:02,640
plant leaf off and live again and I've

4663
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:05,159
definitely seen it this year go for like

4664
03:17:02,639 --> 03:17:08,439
a drive down to the soil to a systemic

4665
03:17:05,159 --> 03:17:10,920
carry which seems to behave like a like

4666
03:17:08,439 --> 03:17:14,159
a micro risal or a form of fungal that

4667
03:17:10,920 --> 03:17:15,639
follows rout in the rizosphere so I

4668
03:17:14,159 --> 03:17:17,398
think this is where it would maybe open

4669
03:17:15,639 --> 03:17:18,840
up to some conversation

4670
03:17:17,398 --> 03:17:21,760
I have heard that

4671
03:17:18,840 --> 03:17:23,960
traderma is being applied to several

4672
03:17:21,760 --> 03:17:26,478
forms out of some people in New York

4673
03:17:23,959 --> 03:17:28,238
actually and I haven't dug into it but I

4674
03:17:26,478 --> 03:17:30,719
I mean it makes sense to me but I want

4675
03:17:28,238 --> 03:17:32,959
to kind of open it up to see what people

4676
03:17:30,719 --> 03:17:36,000
think in my opinion it's kind of looking

4677
03:17:32,959 --> 03:17:38,398
for perhaps like a fighter or an

4678
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:40,279
isolated strain or strains of fungal

4679
03:17:38,398 --> 03:17:43,599
that are still beneficial or non-harming

4680
03:17:40,279 --> 03:17:45,720
to the plant that would actually perhaps

4681
03:17:43,600 --> 03:17:47,960
be able to inoculate into the compost

4682
03:17:45,719 --> 03:17:50,278
inoculate around but just to share it

4683
03:17:47,959 --> 03:17:53,238
from the field reporting back the I'm

4684
03:17:50,279 --> 03:17:55,199
definitely walking the woods and I see

4685
03:17:53,238 --> 03:17:57,238
this stuff changing our landscape it's

4686
03:17:55,199 --> 03:17:59,479
taking trees down in the wood certain

4687
03:17:57,238 --> 03:18:02,600
type you know like quick growing Alder

4688
03:17:59,478 --> 03:18:04,318
popler there's Maples or Oaks affected

4689
03:18:02,600 --> 03:18:05,880
and it's changing the landscape and I

4690
03:18:04,318 --> 03:18:08,000
just haven't heard that much about this

4691
03:18:05,879 --> 03:18:10,119
getting opened up yet so would hope to

4692
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:12,238
open it up to some some people here for

4693
03:18:10,120 --> 03:18:15,840
knowledge or information sharing you

4694
03:18:12,238 --> 03:18:18,279
know um so yeah you I so on the East

4695
03:18:15,840 --> 03:18:20,559
Coast I've noticed on Oak on native tree

4696
03:18:18,279 --> 03:18:22,560
native plants all over the place and I

4697
03:18:20,559 --> 03:18:25,318
never saw that we you know you and I

4698
03:18:22,559 --> 03:18:27,398
both grew up on the east coast and gr

4699
03:18:25,318 --> 03:18:31,799
cannabis for close to 30 years out here

4700
03:18:27,398 --> 03:18:36,439
now and it's yeah septoria has been a

4701
03:18:31,799 --> 03:18:38,358
big issue um that is is just devastated

4702
03:18:36,439 --> 03:18:39,800
New York hemp farmers and I think a lot

4703
03:18:38,359 --> 03:18:42,680
of the people that I've spoken to at

4704
03:18:39,799 --> 03:18:44,759
scale were hemp farming first and

4705
03:18:42,680 --> 03:18:46,920
transitioned into drug cultivars and

4706
03:18:44,760 --> 03:18:50,719
then planting in those same fields

4707
03:18:46,920 --> 03:18:52,680
season after season um and not taking

4708
03:18:50,719 --> 03:18:55,799
the right precautions to amend their

4709
03:18:52,680 --> 03:18:58,279
soils and create a healthy um solo

4710
03:18:55,799 --> 03:19:00,278
Network for themselves so it's it's been

4711
03:18:58,279 --> 03:19:02,479
devastating on the East Coast but um

4712
03:19:00,279 --> 03:19:05,560
it's the biggest reason why New York's

4713
03:19:02,478 --> 03:19:08,079
Market um has so much terrible herb is

4714
03:19:05,559 --> 03:19:09,879
because those the the soil that these

4715
03:19:08,079 --> 03:19:12,398
individuals are growing in most not

4716
03:19:09,879 --> 03:19:14,879
everyone but a lot of them are um

4717
03:19:12,398 --> 03:19:16,478
contaminated so they have these viroids

4718
03:19:14,879 --> 03:19:19,000
and they're not testing or Fielding for

4719
03:19:16,478 --> 03:19:22,760
them and that's where

4720
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:26,238
iics does come through and and help

4721
03:19:22,760 --> 03:19:28,680
better Insight is a plant uptaking the

4722
03:19:26,238 --> 03:19:32,039
this via the soil and that's how it's

4723
03:19:28,680 --> 03:19:33,760
becoming infected well I I calling me no

4724
03:19:32,040 --> 03:19:36,040
more but I heard at first the theory

4725
03:19:33,760 --> 03:19:39,000
being is that it's a splashback from the

4726
03:19:36,040 --> 03:19:41,080
top surface and when I had Disturbed the

4727
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:43,719
top soil just through simple hand

4728
03:19:41,079 --> 03:19:45,398
cultivation of the soil I did some I've

4729
03:19:43,719 --> 03:19:47,799
been doing some trying some like more

4730
03:19:45,398 --> 03:19:50,358
simple and organic application or even

4731
03:19:47,799 --> 03:19:53,159
natural you know like disturb top soil

4732
03:19:50,359 --> 03:19:55,159
seems to break up a fungal web that

4733
03:19:53,159 --> 03:19:57,799
exists that lasts for about two weeks

4734
03:19:55,159 --> 03:20:00,559
and then it kicks up again fresh good

4735
03:19:57,799 --> 03:20:02,438
fungal Rich compost on top fights too

4736
03:20:00,559 --> 03:20:05,478
but I mean at this year at this point

4737
03:20:02,439 --> 03:20:07,398
year four I'm we're we're throwing

4738
03:20:05,478 --> 03:20:10,039
several different types of compos from

4739
03:20:07,398 --> 03:20:13,639
professionals our own that's beautiful

4740
03:20:10,040 --> 03:20:15,479
and you know different uh natural sulfur

4741
03:20:13,639 --> 03:20:17,039
being applied several times there's

4742
03:20:15,478 --> 03:20:19,719
other

4743
03:20:17,040 --> 03:20:21,160
oil to to a pH balance citric

4744
03:20:19,719 --> 03:20:23,278
application for spray that doesn't seem

4745
03:20:21,159 --> 03:20:25,119
to touch a kelp doesn't seem to do much

4746
03:20:23,279 --> 03:20:27,000
so I don't know if this is answer any of

4747
03:20:25,120 --> 03:20:29,399
your question but it's back to this

4748
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:31,439
maybe Colin knows but U um it's kind of

4749
03:20:29,398 --> 03:20:33,079
like throwing all the natural form at it

4750
03:20:31,439 --> 03:20:35,639
seems to be driven kind of deep

4751
03:20:33,079 --> 03:20:39,439
systemically down into the soil at this

4752
03:20:35,639 --> 03:20:43,439
point um and also you know pythium is a

4753
03:20:39,439 --> 03:20:45,840
huge problem um and lettuce closis vroid

4754
03:20:43,439 --> 03:20:48,439
is is starting to become prevalent which

4755
03:20:45,840 --> 03:20:51,159
is not I think we can all agree has not

4756
03:20:48,439 --> 03:20:54,960
been a major

4757
03:20:51,159 --> 03:20:57,719
threat um but yeah I mean we've used um

4758
03:20:54,959 --> 03:21:01,839
you know micro risal top dressings to

4759
03:20:57,719 --> 03:21:05,079
help combat it we seem to think that um

4760
03:21:01,840 --> 03:21:07,318
you know disrupting the soil to like you

4761
03:21:05,079 --> 03:21:09,680
said to not allow those that Network to

4762
03:21:07,318 --> 03:21:11,760
to develop is is has really helped but

4763
03:21:09,680 --> 03:21:14,479
the honestly we just call the plants

4764
03:21:11,760 --> 03:21:16,318
like immediately when we see it um and

4765
03:21:14,478 --> 03:21:18,840
then we start soil testing send that to

4766
03:21:16,318 --> 03:21:21,119
new testing Labs look at the what's

4767
03:21:18,840 --> 03:21:23,318
going on what does it visually look like

4768
03:21:21,120 --> 03:21:25,520
so if somebody is watching do you have a

4769
03:21:23,318 --> 03:21:28,359
visual representation about what this

4770
03:21:25,520 --> 03:21:30,199
looks like potentially I don't have one

4771
03:21:28,359 --> 03:21:32,760
right off hand to show I should have

4772
03:21:30,199 --> 03:21:36,680
I'll try to get some together but got

4773
03:21:32,760 --> 03:21:38,840
brown spots yes it looks like rust right

4774
03:21:36,680 --> 03:21:43,000
Sam knows is it on the leaf or on the

4775
03:21:38,840 --> 03:21:45,439
stem is it on the leaves that I remember

4776
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:48,120
on new old leaves or old leaves not on

4777
03:21:45,439 --> 03:21:50,000
new leaves it was on older and it's

4778
03:21:48,120 --> 03:21:51,840
actually hitting up high on the plant on

4779
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:53,199
new leaves it's it's behaving

4780
03:21:51,840 --> 03:21:55,880
differently through the years it even

4781
03:21:53,199 --> 03:21:57,680
has different form which seems to me

4782
03:21:55,879 --> 03:22:00,559
just again from the field seems like

4783
03:21:57,680 --> 03:22:02,199
different species of that one type of

4784
03:22:00,559 --> 03:22:05,159
fungus I've kind of heard a little word

4785
03:22:02,199 --> 03:22:07,920
about that uh from a soil friend and

4786
03:22:05,159 --> 03:22:10,680
I've definitely seen like tight yellow

4787
03:22:07,920 --> 03:22:12,398
spotting that's really dense spotting on

4788
03:22:10,680 --> 03:22:14,079
the lower leaves seems to be where that

4789
03:22:12,398 --> 03:22:16,760
one lives and then you're going to see

4790
03:22:14,079 --> 03:22:18,359
some you know holes in the actual ual

4791
03:22:16,760 --> 03:22:20,000
Leaf you almost look like something's

4792
03:22:18,359 --> 03:22:23,399
eating it away seems like a different

4793
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:28,159
form I mean this stuff sounds nasty

4794
03:22:23,398 --> 03:22:31,079
what's are spread by by insects but

4795
03:22:28,159 --> 03:22:33,799
they're also spread by soil so if you're

4796
03:22:31,079 --> 03:22:36,959
moving clones around or if you're

4797
03:22:33,799 --> 03:22:39,840
moving it's the problem is is it's

4798
03:22:36,959 --> 03:22:42,039
wiping out trees in nature I've got 78

4799
03:22:39,840 --> 03:22:44,478
plus acres and I'm walking the back 40

4800
03:22:42,040 --> 03:22:46,800
down for Miles back here driving by

4801
03:22:44,478 --> 03:22:48,879
where my parents live in the Hills I'm

4802
03:22:46,799 --> 03:22:50,759
hearing from friends in Midwest

4803
03:22:48,879 --> 03:22:53,198
different states and not denying that it

4804
03:22:50,760 --> 03:22:55,120
does carry the soil but I you know one

4805
03:22:53,199 --> 03:22:57,159
of the things I pride myself in is some

4806
03:22:55,120 --> 03:22:59,600
of the most beautiful living soil my

4807
03:22:57,159 --> 03:23:02,478
compost is so rich that it's actually

4808
03:22:59,600 --> 03:23:05,318
the newer compost is growing blight free

4809
03:23:02,478 --> 03:23:07,238
you know squash plants that don't seem

4810
03:23:05,318 --> 03:23:09,000
to get hit in the pure compost and

4811
03:23:07,238 --> 03:23:10,840
they're thriving but I'm also kind of

4812
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:12,600
like what chance do they have as soon as

4813
03:23:10,840 --> 03:23:15,680
they take a little bit of a yellow off

4814
03:23:12,600 --> 03:23:17,520
they go to this quickly and the trees

4815
03:23:15,680 --> 03:23:19,600
out in nature literally some of them

4816
03:23:17,520 --> 03:23:21,439
I've seen last year even some 20 foot

4817
03:23:19,600 --> 03:23:24,840
trees that are younger falling right

4818
03:23:21,439 --> 03:23:26,960
they're they're gone you know so seems

4819
03:23:24,840 --> 03:23:29,520
to be really even if I could isolate

4820
03:23:26,959 --> 03:23:32,358
here change over soil diff I've tried

4821
03:23:29,520 --> 03:23:35,159
different strains and different parts of

4822
03:23:32,359 --> 03:23:37,800
the farm of the yard on about a 10 12

4823
03:23:35,159 --> 03:23:40,318
acre cleanout here in the middle and I'm

4824
03:23:37,799 --> 03:23:42,519
seeing it still pop different areas but

4825
03:23:40,318 --> 03:23:46,600
I'm also seeing the resistant type or

4826
03:23:42,520 --> 03:23:51,640
two or a few that do the best my gas Mas

4827
03:23:46,600 --> 03:23:54,640
I I I I'm afraid I can't quite remember

4828
03:23:51,639 --> 03:23:58,639
uh as well as I used to but uh is a

4829
03:23:54,639 --> 03:24:00,238
tricoderma uh valuable to fight this

4830
03:23:58,639 --> 03:24:04,198
that's what I've heard I I haven't

4831
03:24:00,238 --> 03:24:07,318
applied it yet I kind of I that's what

4832
03:24:04,199 --> 03:24:09,120
I've used in the past wonderful to hear

4833
03:24:07,318 --> 03:24:11,439
that that's that's what's coming in the

4834
03:24:09,120 --> 03:24:12,960
mail there's three different strains

4835
03:24:11,439 --> 03:24:15,159
that are being toyed with out of New

4836
03:24:12,959 --> 03:24:17,438
York and I'll connect with you on that

4837
03:24:15,159 --> 03:24:20,559
call in a bit after too talk about it

4838
03:24:17,439 --> 03:24:22,479
it's probably nearby with you yeah man

4839
03:24:20,559 --> 03:24:25,318
it makesense

4840
03:24:22,478 --> 03:24:28,719
so yeah it's it's a big problem we we

4841
03:24:25,318 --> 03:24:30,359
saw it even indoors um to be honest and

4842
03:24:28,719 --> 03:24:32,599
we uh we had to do a lot of soul

4843
03:24:30,359 --> 03:24:36,000
searching in the the facility um to

4844
03:24:32,600 --> 03:24:38,040
figure out what was going on and we um

4845
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:41,680
you know for whatever reason because the

4846
03:24:38,040 --> 03:24:44,160
facility was near the coast um the water

4847
03:24:41,680 --> 03:24:45,960
had this weird film even when it was run

4848
03:24:44,159 --> 03:24:48,680
through our it was just the weirdest

4849
03:24:45,959 --> 03:24:51,159
thing we seen I haven't seen it inside

4850
03:24:48,680 --> 03:24:53,880
here it hasn't carried over for myself

4851
03:24:51,159 --> 03:24:55,879
or friends in the area yeah we we nipped

4852
03:24:53,879 --> 03:24:58,159
it in the bud but you know there's also

4853
03:24:55,879 --> 03:25:01,599
you know a little bit of um you know

4854
03:24:58,159 --> 03:25:03,039
good old Clorox bleach in in the res to

4855
03:25:01,600 --> 03:25:05,840
you know to kill

4856
03:25:03,040 --> 03:25:08,520
anything at the right rates what does

4857
03:25:05,840 --> 03:25:10,799
this do to the roots so what is this

4858
03:25:08,520 --> 03:25:12,199
brown so part the plant could be

4859
03:25:10,799 --> 03:25:14,318
completely healthy and then there's like

4860
03:25:12,199 --> 03:25:15,720
a huge Branch that's just like dead

4861
03:25:14,318 --> 03:25:17,719
you're like huh that's the weirdest

4862
03:25:15,719 --> 03:25:20,478
thing why is that whole Branch just

4863
03:25:17,719 --> 03:25:22,719
dying um and then there's signifiers

4864
03:25:20,478 --> 03:25:24,318
like Spight and spots that can happen as

4865
03:25:22,719 --> 03:25:25,719
well but that's further it seems like

4866
03:25:24,318 --> 03:25:28,398
that's further and then the leaves get

4867
03:25:25,719 --> 03:25:30,879
crispy and kind of acor and kind of like

4868
03:25:28,398 --> 03:25:33,159
the plants are almost you know deep into

4869
03:25:30,879 --> 03:25:37,119
fall you know finishing itself off with

4870
03:25:33,159 --> 03:25:39,760
lots of ethylene around NE I

4871
03:25:37,120 --> 03:25:42,120
think say that one more time is that a

4872
03:25:39,760 --> 03:25:44,680
leaf necrosis would it be called it does

4873
03:25:42,120 --> 03:25:46,800
like a a die off like you just said yeah

4874
03:25:44,680 --> 03:25:48,760
it like creates it it feels like the

4875
03:25:46,799 --> 03:25:51,238
plant wants to produce ethylene and it

4876
03:25:48,760 --> 03:25:52,760
just like signifies it all to do it and

4877
03:25:51,238 --> 03:25:54,439
then it affects the other if you have

4878
03:25:52,760 --> 03:25:56,880
like other plants in the room it starts

4879
03:25:54,439 --> 03:25:58,960
to affect them because of the ethylene

4880
03:25:56,879 --> 03:26:02,278
levels and it's really fascinating

4881
03:25:58,959 --> 03:26:03,639
seeing it happen um but uh I you know we

4882
03:26:02,279 --> 03:26:05,600
found again it's just like you have to

4883
03:26:03,639 --> 03:26:07,959
be really diligent about cleaning

4884
03:26:05,600 --> 03:26:10,079
everything yeah um you gota be really

4885
03:26:07,959 --> 03:26:11,438
tight on you on everything and just make

4886
03:26:10,079 --> 03:26:14,279
sure you're double backing on all your

4887
03:26:11,439 --> 03:26:16,000
Sops and cleaning and yeah I could share

4888
03:26:14,279 --> 03:26:19,120
a little info from the field on that

4889
03:26:16,000 --> 03:26:21,840
note which seems to help out actually is

4890
03:26:19,120 --> 03:26:24,000
like we're using hay local hay Mulch and

4891
03:26:21,840 --> 03:26:26,199
a thick cover local hay Mulch on the

4892
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:29,398
bottom that's kept with a fresh change

4893
03:26:26,199 --> 03:26:32,359
over so like the 4x4 Square on the rais

4894
03:26:29,398 --> 03:26:35,000
bed gets where it actually almost acts

4895
03:26:32,359 --> 03:26:36,840
like a catch for the for the leaf fall

4896
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:39,760
because what I've seen this this uh

4897
03:26:36,840 --> 03:26:41,719
blight work like it seems to it's it's

4898
03:26:39,760 --> 03:26:43,680
intelligence at least in its life cycle

4899
03:26:41,719 --> 03:26:45,599
seems to want to do a leaf kill off on

4900
03:26:43,680 --> 03:26:49,279
the plants just tracking it wise to let

4901
03:26:45,600 --> 03:26:51,279
them go back B to see it it does a drop

4902
03:26:49,279 --> 03:26:53,479
down of the leaves right to the base of

4903
03:26:51,279 --> 03:26:55,760
the plant and from what I've seen or

4904
03:26:53,478 --> 03:26:58,238
heard those are asexual reproduction

4905
03:26:55,760 --> 03:27:01,079
sites that look like rust spots on the

4906
03:26:58,238 --> 03:27:03,119
leaf when it dies those spots Sam was

4907
03:27:01,079 --> 03:27:05,600
talking about gray spots and it fluffs

4908
03:27:03,120 --> 03:27:07,239
off the Spore and it definitely seems

4909
03:27:05,600 --> 03:27:09,159
like it wants to kill those leaves right

4910
03:27:07,238 --> 03:27:10,920
off and behave where it wants to catch

4911
03:27:09,159 --> 03:27:13,398
water live right there and spread from

4912
03:27:10,920 --> 03:27:16,840
there to go systemic so like a fresh

4913
03:27:13,398 --> 03:27:18,439
turnover of of mulch under the plant

4914
03:27:16,840 --> 03:27:21,478
where you can actually you know keep the

4915
03:27:18,439 --> 03:27:23,559
plants as clean as you can um honestly

4916
03:27:21,478 --> 03:27:25,438
This lends so far into at least in Maine

4917
03:27:23,559 --> 03:27:28,719
where it's a more small batch type of

4918
03:27:25,439 --> 03:27:31,000
feel anyway and by numbers by medical

4919
03:27:28,719 --> 03:27:33,679
allowance and such truthfully it's

4920
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:35,680
creating like a tendar plants better

4921
03:27:33,680 --> 03:27:37,800
thing when I when I kind of listen to

4922
03:27:35,680 --> 03:27:40,159
the plants they're going kick up the

4923
03:27:37,799 --> 03:27:42,759
stewardship you know don't have us like

4924
03:27:40,159 --> 03:27:45,279
con said take us out change it don't new

4925
03:27:42,760 --> 03:27:47,520
soil new area or don't do this so it's

4926
03:27:45,279 --> 03:27:49,920
becoming like less is more and that's

4927
03:27:47,520 --> 03:27:51,560
what we can handle it definitely seems

4928
03:27:49,920 --> 03:27:55,559
like healthy fungal

4929
03:27:51,559 --> 03:27:57,559
population um a good constant nutrient

4930
03:27:55,559 --> 03:27:59,760
availability to it whether organic or

4931
03:27:57,559 --> 03:28:02,238
not and not letting them you know go

4932
03:27:59,760 --> 03:28:04,680
without and be overboard over the

4933
03:28:02,238 --> 03:28:07,600
threshold so it's really kind of maybe

4934
03:28:04,680 --> 03:28:09,559
testing the the farmer and it seems to

4935
03:28:07,600 --> 03:28:12,520
me with just so many plants out there in

4936
03:28:09,559 --> 03:28:14,478
general of all types with colors and you

4937
03:28:12,520 --> 03:28:16,560
know these different rules to it in all

4938
03:28:14,478 --> 03:28:18,438
Realms it seems like this is just kind

4939
03:28:16,559 --> 03:28:21,000
of a almost natural thing no matter

4940
03:28:18,439 --> 03:28:23,000
where it comes from you know for this to

4941
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:25,318
kind of call like you said call call the

4942
03:28:23,000 --> 03:28:27,040
plant and it's going to seemingly call

4943
03:28:25,318 --> 03:28:29,398
down the breeding at least to bring up

4944
03:28:27,040 --> 03:28:32,359
this conversation it's not just going to

4945
03:28:29,398 --> 03:28:34,358
be breeding gone wild and F1 H poly

4946
03:28:32,359 --> 03:28:36,640
hybrids everywhere you know selling his

4947
03:28:34,359 --> 03:28:38,920
hot cakes because this is like year five

4948
03:28:36,639 --> 03:28:40,799
in Maine that this stuff is taking a

4949
03:28:38,920 --> 03:28:42,960
serious hold and this year being a good

4950
03:28:40,799 --> 03:28:45,478
grow year but a high humid one you saw

4951
03:28:42,959 --> 03:28:47,358
good growth early start off for health

4952
03:28:45,478 --> 03:28:49,519
in places with people that that were

4953
03:28:47,359 --> 03:28:51,960
bragging you know raving about it and

4954
03:28:49,520 --> 03:28:53,399
then they quiet fall off and it's like

4955
03:28:51,959 --> 03:28:55,919
detriment to the point of having a

4956
03:28:53,398 --> 03:28:58,000
meeting over it you know and it's really

4957
03:28:55,920 --> 03:29:00,318
if you don't have it it seems like at

4958
03:28:58,000 --> 03:29:03,079
least East I don't know probably east

4959
03:29:00,318 --> 03:29:04,600
east coast it's G to come around it's

4960
03:29:03,079 --> 03:29:06,318
it's just one of those things cycling

4961
03:29:04,600 --> 03:29:08,640
it's eventually going to come and at

4962
03:29:06,318 --> 03:29:11,079
this point it's a more of how do we

4963
03:29:08,639 --> 03:29:13,680
resist this in my opinion and seeing

4964
03:29:11,079 --> 03:29:16,559
like the 10% hold from new faces from

4965
03:29:13,680 --> 03:29:18,199
breeding and from the library hold of

4966
03:29:16,559 --> 03:29:20,840
genetics at least where I'm hearing

4967
03:29:18,199 --> 03:29:23,199
small batch application not field trials

4968
03:29:20,840 --> 03:29:25,960
for thousands or Millions thousands of

4969
03:29:23,199 --> 03:29:28,040
plants I'm able to see that hold and

4970
03:29:25,959 --> 03:29:30,519
then try it out different zones through

4971
03:29:28,040 --> 03:29:33,040
the years and then protect my genetics

4972
03:29:30,520 --> 03:29:34,720
well hold it you know as close as I can

4973
03:29:33,040 --> 03:29:37,800
because it be it works well for here but

4974
03:29:34,719 --> 03:29:39,879
it's also kind of tear stripping away

4975
03:29:37,799 --> 03:29:43,238
like the candy shop approach of turpy

4976
03:29:39,879 --> 03:29:45,679
and exploration or you know of just into

4977
03:29:43,238 --> 03:29:46,799
hashing it washes it's becoming one of

4978
03:29:45,680 --> 03:29:48,680
those where where it's actually going to

4979
03:29:46,799 --> 03:29:51,759
have more boxes to check when it comes

4980
03:29:48,680 --> 03:29:54,600
to Sun grown out here you know where

4981
03:29:51,760 --> 03:29:57,199
whether it's personal grow or whether it

4982
03:29:54,600 --> 03:29:58,720
would be a production grow I feel

4983
03:29:57,199 --> 03:30:00,880
because you know both angles are

4984
03:29:58,719 --> 03:30:03,119
affected the H grower that that has this

4985
03:30:00,879 --> 03:30:05,719
blight run wild thing going on too you

4986
03:30:03,120 --> 03:30:08,840
know very crazy is going to have a

4987
03:30:05,719 --> 03:30:10,920
difficult time so I guess going back to

4988
03:30:08,840 --> 03:30:13,279
trying to find the plants at least from

4989
03:30:10,920 --> 03:30:16,079
the breeding from the field and simple

4990
03:30:13,279 --> 03:30:18,640
understanding perspective hold them well

4991
03:30:16,079 --> 03:30:21,520
then I'm obviously like working into the

4992
03:30:18,639 --> 03:30:24,519
year here with my breeding to be like

4993
03:30:21,520 --> 03:30:27,159
resistant males that show you know the

4994
03:30:24,520 --> 03:30:30,079
traits even a a kickback later for

4995
03:30:27,159 --> 03:30:32,439
health one up front I'm tracking them

4996
03:30:30,079 --> 03:30:35,279
and then coming back to the The Proven

4997
03:30:32,439 --> 03:30:37,559
females that either over the years you

4998
03:30:35,279 --> 03:30:39,319
know or a new type that's showing its

4999
03:30:37,559 --> 03:30:42,840
face to be the healthiest new girl and

5000
03:30:39,318 --> 03:30:45,039
the new lady in the yard is a strawberry

5001
03:30:42,840 --> 03:30:47,478
smoothie band that I'm calling it so

5002
03:30:45,040 --> 03:30:49,840
strawberry headband on a citrus smothie

5003
03:30:47,478 --> 03:30:52,000
and it just looks I mean it sticks out

5004
03:30:49,840 --> 03:30:55,439
even among some of the plants you know

5005
03:30:52,000 --> 03:30:58,879
and and any who that's kind of like from

5006
03:30:55,439 --> 03:31:00,920
the so somebody sorry I just wanted to

5007
03:30:58,879 --> 03:31:02,839
mention one thing at that Wade had his

5008
03:31:00,920 --> 03:31:05,238
hand up but he has turned his camera off

5009
03:31:02,840 --> 03:31:07,159
now so oh okay awesome yeah I don't know

5010
03:31:05,238 --> 03:31:09,079
if he's there now but uh when he comes

5011
03:31:07,159 --> 03:31:10,159
back and turns his camera on we'll uh

5012
03:31:09,079 --> 03:31:13,478
give him the

5013
03:31:10,159 --> 03:31:16,719
floor there he is oh

5014
03:31:13,478 --> 03:31:22,119
wonderful yeah I had to take a leak

5015
03:31:16,719 --> 03:31:25,398
um what to do huh um I got to jump in

5016
03:31:22,120 --> 03:31:26,399
here and rant for a minute I I'm loving

5017
03:31:25,398 --> 03:31:28,840
this

5018
03:31:26,398 --> 03:31:33,000
conversation but I keep thinking about

5019
03:31:28,840 --> 03:31:38,478
what Mojave brought up about

5020
03:31:33,000 --> 03:31:41,359
flavor and how he was really pointing to

5021
03:31:38,478 --> 03:31:44,478
what I think is kind of a central

5022
03:31:41,359 --> 03:31:46,760
problem in the whole cannabis space

5023
03:31:44,478 --> 03:31:49,920
where the very ious

5024
03:31:46,760 --> 03:31:52,079
operators try and provide product

5025
03:31:49,920 --> 03:31:54,840
ethical operators try and provide

5026
03:31:52,079 --> 03:31:58,799
product that the consumer wants because

5027
03:31:54,840 --> 03:32:02,600
the consumer has been educated if you

5028
03:31:58,799 --> 03:32:04,318
will um to call out for this specific

5029
03:32:02,600 --> 03:32:08,079
version of

5030
03:32:04,318 --> 03:32:10,198
cannabis and as a patient I got to keep

5031
03:32:08,079 --> 03:32:13,559
coming back to that as a

5032
03:32:10,199 --> 03:32:16,359
patient uh historically we we followed

5033
03:32:13,559 --> 03:32:19,478
flavor and smell and morphology

5034
03:32:16,359 --> 03:32:21,840
as a guide to the chemistry that we were

5035
03:32:19,478 --> 03:32:26,278
seeking and now we have analytical

5036
03:32:21,840 --> 03:32:28,760
chemistry and um that's a wonderful gift

5037
03:32:26,279 --> 03:32:31,079
to uh our our

5038
03:32:28,760 --> 03:32:34,238
search um but

5039
03:32:31,079 --> 03:32:36,719
I part of what I wanted to rant about is

5040
03:32:34,238 --> 03:32:39,478
we also talked about hemp and some of

5041
03:32:36,719 --> 03:32:41,719
the consequences of shall we say

5042
03:32:39,478 --> 03:32:44,719
unskillful legislation that has happened

5043
03:32:41,719 --> 03:32:46,358
in the United States around the cannabis

5044
03:32:44,719 --> 03:32:50,719
plant

5045
03:32:46,359 --> 03:32:52,359
and um on the one hand hemp has had the

5046
03:32:50,719 --> 03:32:54,358
effect of normalizing cannabis all

5047
03:32:52,359 --> 03:32:56,680
across the country people are used to it

5048
03:32:54,359 --> 03:32:59,439
now and that is a good

5049
03:32:56,680 --> 03:33:01,120
thing the the other side of it and to me

5050
03:32:59,439 --> 03:33:02,159
the biggest problem again as a patient

5051
03:33:01,120 --> 03:33:04,520
and as a

5052
03:33:02,159 --> 03:33:06,000
consumer uh there's no protections for

5053
03:33:04,520 --> 03:33:07,800
consumers

5054
03:33:06,000 --> 03:33:10,318
and

5055
03:33:07,799 --> 03:33:13,438
um I guess part of what I'm trying to do

5056
03:33:10,318 --> 03:33:15,198
here is I'm asking you all of you on

5057
03:33:13,439 --> 03:33:16,600
this panel and anyone who's listening to

5058
03:33:15,199 --> 03:33:19,000
this recording

5059
03:33:16,600 --> 03:33:21,079
to recognize that if you are if you view

5060
03:33:19,000 --> 03:33:23,398
yourself as an ethical

5061
03:33:21,079 --> 03:33:24,680
operator it's important to create

5062
03:33:23,398 --> 03:33:27,680
product

5063
03:33:24,680 --> 03:33:27,680
that

5064
03:33:28,520 --> 03:33:34,079
um satisfies the

5065
03:33:31,120 --> 03:33:37,000
consumer while ideally

5066
03:33:34,079 --> 03:33:39,959
preserving The Beneficial effects of

5067
03:33:37,000 --> 03:33:44,719
cannabis other

5068
03:33:39,959 --> 03:33:47,959
than the drug high and I as a drug user

5069
03:33:44,719 --> 03:33:52,079
myself I I love the high but I've also

5070
03:33:47,959 --> 03:33:54,759
become a fairly uh passionate user of

5071
03:33:52,079 --> 03:33:58,318
cannabis uh for its medicinal

5072
03:33:54,760 --> 03:33:59,960
benefits and to me the whole thing of

5073
03:33:58,318 --> 03:34:02,478
legalization we wouldn't have we

5074
03:33:59,959 --> 03:34:03,919
wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the

5075
03:34:02,478 --> 03:34:06,559
medicinal

5076
03:34:03,920 --> 03:34:08,639
benefit and yes flavor guided us for

5077
03:34:06,559 --> 03:34:12,079
many years to that medicinal benefit

5078
03:34:08,639 --> 03:34:14,398
that we were seeking but I'm calling on

5079
03:34:12,079 --> 03:34:17,039
again those of us who are ethical

5080
03:34:14,398 --> 03:34:19,719
operators to to preserve the the

5081
03:34:17,040 --> 03:34:21,479
genetics that you have to call out the

5082
03:34:19,719 --> 03:34:25,679
thing because that's been the other big

5083
03:34:21,478 --> 03:34:28,840
topic is these various pathogens that

5084
03:34:25,680 --> 03:34:30,840
threaten this plant and we all know the

5085
03:34:28,840 --> 03:34:32,359
global plant isn't really threatened

5086
03:34:30,840 --> 03:34:33,639
we're really talking about the

5087
03:34:32,359 --> 03:34:36,640
commercial

5088
03:34:33,639 --> 03:34:36,639
Market

5089
03:34:36,879 --> 03:34:41,799
um

5090
03:34:38,478 --> 03:34:44,519
anyway I'm going to stop there I just I

5091
03:34:41,799 --> 03:34:46,840
I feel it really strongly that if you

5092
03:34:44,520 --> 03:34:50,120
know what you're doing with this plant

5093
03:34:46,840 --> 03:34:53,279
do it with your heart and your

5094
03:34:50,120 --> 03:34:55,040
Consciousness at the Forefront and I'll

5095
03:34:53,279 --> 03:34:58,840
stop there thank

5096
03:34:55,040 --> 03:35:02,279
you awesome man who says little but when

5097
03:34:58,840 --> 03:35:05,199
he says things it

5098
03:35:02,279 --> 03:35:08,760
sticks Alex Hardy in the chat was also

5099
03:35:05,199 --> 03:35:11,720
suggesting kombucha and airflow for

5100
03:35:08,760 --> 03:35:13,920
septoria arborist who's in there so that

5101
03:35:11,719 --> 03:35:17,000
was his suggestion so thank you for that

5102
03:35:13,920 --> 03:35:18,719
Mr hardy air flow sure that's a new one

5103
03:35:17,000 --> 03:35:22,159
kombucha makes sense

5104
03:35:18,719 --> 03:35:22,159
though trying it

5105
03:35:23,799 --> 03:35:29,679
out yeah I had a I had a gentleman reach

5106
03:35:26,439 --> 03:35:31,318
out to me recently from Estonia uh and

5107
03:35:29,680 --> 03:35:35,279
he had a couple of interesting things to

5108
03:35:31,318 --> 03:35:38,079
share um the one is just another new

5109
03:35:35,279 --> 03:35:39,560
method of isolating Tricom heads I'm

5110
03:35:38,079 --> 03:35:41,520
sure we'll be speaking about it in the

5111
03:35:39,559 --> 03:35:44,439
very near future but the other one was

5112
03:35:41,520 --> 03:35:45,920
he had this product um I won't say the

5113
03:35:44,439 --> 03:35:48,159
name yet but we'll let you you know in

5114
03:35:45,920 --> 03:35:50,079
the near future here but he was talking

5115
03:35:48,159 --> 03:35:52,639
about uh maybe coming and visiting

5116
03:35:50,079 --> 03:35:55,199
Canada and the US and maybe getting some

5117
03:35:52,639 --> 03:35:57,318
of this product to people who had uh

5118
03:35:55,199 --> 03:35:58,880
hlvd uh and I was just talking to him

5119
03:35:57,318 --> 03:36:00,559
while we've had this conversation and he

5120
03:35:58,879 --> 03:36:02,799
was like oh septoria yeah if it's

5121
03:36:00,559 --> 03:36:05,318
bacteria and fungal problems it's it's

5122
03:36:02,799 --> 03:36:08,398
much easier to prevent and cure and so I

5123
03:36:05,318 --> 03:36:10,039
sent you that email uh Brian and uh

5124
03:36:08,398 --> 03:36:13,879
maybe we'll make it so you can get some

5125
03:36:10,040 --> 03:36:16,720
of that that uh product to see if you

5126
03:36:13,879 --> 03:36:20,198
can't uh combat that

5127
03:36:16,719 --> 03:36:22,318
wonderful trying some out thank you

5128
03:36:20,199 --> 03:36:24,079
awesome well we got 26 minutes left

5129
03:36:22,318 --> 03:36:26,278
before we hit the 4 Hour Mark what a

5130
03:36:24,079 --> 03:36:29,478
great conversation today I'm definitely

5131
03:36:26,279 --> 03:36:31,680
down to Freestyle for another 206

5132
03:36:29,478 --> 03:36:33,719

being our fifth week people like

5141
03:36:50,760 --> 03:36:55,719
consistency gives them sort of uh I

5142
03:36:54,000 --> 03:36:58,000
don't know just makes you feel good it's

5143
03:36:55,719 --> 03:37:01,278
warm and fuzzy it's like uh comfort food

5144
03:36:58,000 --> 03:37:03,199
in the fall be consistent and let's go

03:37:09,079 --> 03:37:14,478
and you know it's I love coming here I

5149
03:37:12,040 --> 03:37:17,120
love learning I love hearing I mean

5150
03:37:14,478 --> 03:37:20,278
opening up with E and Ethan Russo and

5151
03:37:17,120 --> 03:37:22,239
Sam I mean I just makes my heart singing

5152
03:37:20,279 --> 03:37:25,600
happiness for cannabis because there's

5153
03:37:22,238 --> 03:37:28,920
just nothing like these discussions to

5154
03:37:25,600 --> 03:37:31,559
have Growers Farmers producers providers

5155
03:37:28,920 --> 03:37:34,799
from different countries all talking all

5156
03:37:31,559 --> 03:37:38,119
things cannabis in a very intelligent

5157
03:37:34,799 --> 03:37:40,238
logical uh yet passioned uh way that you

5158
03:37:38,120 --> 03:37:43,399
know is backed in a root of science

5159
03:37:40,238 --> 03:37:46,478
which I think is is most important and I

5160
03:37:43,398 --> 03:37:48,159
I celebrate all of you and thank you for

5161
03:37:46,478 --> 03:37:51,079
just being a small part of

5162
03:37:48,159 --> 03:37:52,639
this absolutely and I think uh you know

5163
03:37:51,079 --> 03:37:54,920
part of the important fact is listen

5164
03:37:52,639 --> 03:37:56,879
we're just we're spitball and always we

5165
03:37:54,920 --> 03:37:58,398
we try to be as accurate as we can of

5166
03:37:56,879 --> 03:38:00,719
course we make mistakes and get things

5167
03:37:58,398 --> 03:38:02,599
wrong uh sometimes as well I think to be

5168
03:38:00,719 --> 03:38:04,159
a thinking human being and share your

5169
03:38:02,600 --> 03:38:06,199
perspective you have to take the chance

5170
03:38:04,159 --> 03:38:08,039
that you might make a mistake and you

5171
03:38:06,199 --> 03:38:10,000
might even offend someone along the way

5172
03:38:08,040 --> 03:38:11,640
as well but uh I like that we're doing

5173
03:38:10,000 --> 03:38:13,639
it I like that for the most part you

5174
03:38:11,639 --> 03:38:15,719
guys are quite conscious really I felt

5175
03:38:13,639 --> 03:38:18,119
like when Wade said what he said about

5176
03:38:15,719 --> 03:38:20,278
you know leading with your heart I feel

5177
03:38:18,120 --> 03:38:22,640
that about most all of you you know

5178
03:38:20,279 --> 03:38:25,040
almost I I would say all of you really I

5179
03:38:22,639 --> 03:38:27,599
know all of you personally and you lead

5180
03:38:25,040 --> 03:38:29,720
with your heart and I think that's uh I

5181
03:38:27,600 --> 03:38:32,238
think authenticity has an important

5182
03:38:29,719 --> 03:38:34,000
place in all of this people appreciate

5183
03:38:32,238 --> 03:38:36,000
authenticity and that's what I feel a

5184
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:37,879
lot of when uh I get together with you

5185
03:38:36,000 --> 03:38:39,000
guys on Sunday morning in chat go ahead

5186
03:38:37,879 --> 03:38:42,920
Sam

5187
03:38:39,000 --> 03:38:45,439
unfortunately the industry as a

5188
03:38:42,920 --> 03:38:47,079
whole I don't think I think there

5189
03:38:45,439 --> 03:38:49,479
there's a lot of blackhearted

5190
03:38:47,079 --> 03:38:53,398
individuals you know a lot of people

5191
03:38:49,478 --> 03:38:56,278
their focus is monetary return I've met

5192
03:38:53,398 --> 03:38:59,119
them you're not

5193
03:38:56,279 --> 03:39:00,680
wrong they're everywhere but you know

5194
03:38:59,120 --> 03:39:04,359
that's

5195
03:39:00,680 --> 03:39:06,960
why uh you know being patients and

5196
03:39:04,359 --> 03:39:09,279
providers has been important for all of

5197
03:39:06,959 --> 03:39:11,278
us because we're able to share our

5198
03:39:09,279 --> 03:39:14,279
experiences with others and this gives

5199
03:39:11,279 --> 03:39:17,120
us an area and a way to do so you know

5200
03:39:14,279 --> 03:39:19,960
you're a provider you you provide bubble

5201
03:39:17,120 --> 03:39:22,199
man you know to Canadian providers and

5202
03:39:19,959 --> 03:39:25,000
we have various scientists on here who

5203
03:39:22,199 --> 03:39:28,279
are actively doing in the science that

5204
03:39:25,000 --> 03:39:32,840
has been you know definitely neglected

5205
03:39:28,279 --> 03:39:35,439
for decades on end and we're at a unique

5206
03:39:32,840 --> 03:39:37,639
precipice in time yeah there's an

5207
03:39:35,439 --> 03:39:39,600
industry and it's all full of sharks but

5208
03:39:37,639 --> 03:39:41,559
you know the it's the sharks have always

5209
03:39:39,600 --> 03:39:43,720
been there they're just more prevalent

5210
03:39:41,559 --> 03:39:46,000
we can see them in the water now but

5211
03:39:43,719 --> 03:39:48,039
it's not going to stop the people who

5212
03:39:46,000 --> 03:39:50,478
were doing it for the right reasons for

5213
03:39:48,040 --> 03:39:54,080
doing it the only way to get rid of the

5214
03:39:50,478 --> 03:39:55,000
Sharks is probably to take the money out

5215
03:39:54,079 --> 03:39:57,318
of

5216
03:39:55,000 --> 03:40:00,199
cannabis yeah but the sharks are in the

5217
03:39:57,318 --> 03:40:02,639
ocean and uh they're not taking over the

5218
03:40:00,199 --> 03:40:03,920
ocean the ocean is flourishing just got

5219
03:40:02,639 --> 03:40:07,920
to figure out a way to

5220
03:40:03,920 --> 03:40:10,520
flourish but if the reason the sharks

5221
03:40:07,920 --> 03:40:13,199
are interested in cannabis is because

5222
03:40:10,520 --> 03:40:15,399
they see it as an income generator of

5223
03:40:13,199 --> 03:40:17,000
course listen that's the reason a lot of

5224
03:40:15,398 --> 03:40:19,039
of people were interested in cannabis

5225
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:21,238
for a very long time and i'llbe it I'll

5226
03:40:19,040 --> 03:40:22,880
even say that some people who have a

5227
03:40:21,238 --> 03:40:26,079
much more leading with their heart

5228
03:40:22,879 --> 03:40:27,839
perspective today would admit that when

5229
03:40:26,079 --> 03:40:29,719
they got into cannabis it was to like

5230
03:40:27,840 --> 03:40:31,760
pay for their mortgage and and some

5231
03:40:29,719 --> 03:40:34,238
other things you know which is fine in

5232
03:40:31,760 --> 03:40:37,520
my opinion whatever way cannabis can

5233
03:40:34,238 --> 03:40:39,600
infect our souls and minds and get in

5234
03:40:37,520 --> 03:40:43,680
there and bore in there and get us

5235
03:40:39,600 --> 03:40:45,920
growing it I support it all and and to

5236
03:40:43,680 --> 03:40:50,680
be honest I'd rather

5237
03:40:45,920 --> 03:40:53,799
see for example people like ex judges ex

5238
03:40:50,680 --> 03:40:56,040
police officers ex prison officers I

5239
03:40:53,799 --> 03:40:59,559
rather see them being greedy and working

5240
03:40:56,040 --> 03:41:03,279
with cannabis than being what they were

5241
03:40:59,559 --> 03:41:06,680
and locking cannabis people up yeah yeah

5242
03:41:03,279 --> 03:41:09,120
Amen to that dude that's uh that's the

5243
03:41:06,680 --> 03:41:12,359
sermon of the day I I kind of want to

5244
03:41:09,120 --> 03:41:14,560
know uh what are Chimera and stunk man

5245
03:41:12,359 --> 03:41:16,559
Sam smoking on and what is everybody

5246
03:41:14,559 --> 03:41:18,840
else smoking on in chat let's I haven't

5247
03:41:16,559 --> 03:41:20,000
seen that in a while what are you else

5248
03:41:18,840 --> 03:41:23,600
smoking on

5249
03:41:20,000 --> 03:41:28,040
Chimera what it what we're smoking on is

5250
03:41:23,600 --> 03:41:32,559
white albino Rosen it's grown uh on

5251
03:41:28,040 --> 03:41:32,560
alligator feces in the sewers of New

5252
03:41:33,799 --> 03:41:38,278
York it's actually a pretty nice little

5253
03:41:36,040 --> 03:41:40,279
rosin I actually went down and meet

5254
03:41:38,279 --> 03:41:43,158
someone at a coffee shop today so I had

5255
03:41:40,279 --> 03:41:45,279
a uh a joint of the grin spoon or what

5256
03:41:43,158 --> 03:41:46,959
are they what used to be called the quaz

5257
03:41:45,279 --> 03:41:49,520
you know the one I'm talking about with

5258
03:41:46,959 --> 03:41:52,398
all the cix's and not real bud structure

5259
03:41:49,520 --> 03:41:55,359
oh yeah but man I I I I'm not a big

5260
03:41:52,398 --> 03:41:56,959
cannabis burner so it was weird sitting

5261
03:41:55,359 --> 03:41:59,158
there smoking this joint that kept going

5262
03:41:56,959 --> 03:42:00,409
out but I was reminded myself that I was

5263
03:41:59,158 --> 03:42:02,318
in

5264
03:42:00,409 --> 03:42:04,600
[Laughter]

5265
03:42:02,318 --> 03:42:07,119
Holland um you know speaking of I had a

5266
03:42:04,600 --> 03:42:09,279
thought earlier in the show when um when

5267
03:42:07,120 --> 03:42:10,960
someone put up the the medicine bottle

5268
03:42:09,279 --> 03:42:13,199
the old medicine bottle I guess that was

5269
03:42:10,959 --> 03:42:15,000
Michael and it had it listed the

5270
03:42:13,199 --> 03:42:17,800
ingredients and it was you know cannabis

5271
03:42:15,000 --> 03:42:19,398
with all these other things in it right

5272
03:42:17,799 --> 03:42:23,318
and it it made me think when we started

5273
03:42:19,398 --> 03:42:25,039
talking about these botanically derived

5274
03:42:23,318 --> 03:42:27,799
tpin that we have a little bit of

5275
03:42:25,040 --> 03:42:29,439
cannabis and a lot of other stuff in it

5276
03:42:27,799 --> 03:42:31,519
and it seems we keep doing that

5277
03:42:29,439 --> 03:42:33,960
different versions of that same thing

5278
03:42:31,520 --> 03:42:36,479
and uh you know I I can't help but

5279
03:42:33,959 --> 03:42:38,278
wonder if a good regulation would be

5280
03:42:36,478 --> 03:42:39,959
that the only thing allowed inside a

5281
03:42:38,279 --> 03:42:41,479
cannabis product was something derived

5282
03:42:39,959 --> 03:42:44,719
from the Cannabis

5283
03:42:41,478 --> 03:42:45,799
itself right yeah well when it comes to

5284
03:42:44,719 --> 03:42:48,639
in

5285
03:42:45,799 --> 03:42:50,559
right like obvious when you're talking

5286
03:42:48,639 --> 03:42:53,079
inhalables

5287
03:42:50,559 --> 03:42:56,799
well what they'll do is they'll take

5288
03:42:53,079 --> 03:42:59,120
cannabis products and with synthesis

5289
03:42:56,799 --> 03:43:02,599
convert them into different cannabis

5290
03:42:59,120 --> 03:43:05,040
products which I'm not so sure I mean as

5291
03:43:02,600 --> 03:43:07,439
long as they're safe for consumers but

5292
03:43:05,040 --> 03:43:09,239
that's not proven safe well and you know

5293
03:43:07,439 --> 03:43:10,680
Mark shelone like I mean he's developed

5294
03:43:09,238 --> 03:43:13,158
some some of these things that are

5295
03:43:10,680 --> 03:43:14,479
synthesis products with using cannabis

5296
03:43:13,158 --> 03:43:15,799
and I I don't think anything's wrong

5297
03:43:14,478 --> 03:43:17,278
with that but I think think that if

5298
03:43:15,799 --> 03:43:19,158
we're developing new things that stuff

5299
03:43:17,279 --> 03:43:23,079
should end up down the regulatory path

5300
03:43:19,158 --> 03:43:24,719
of you know having to show safety right

5301
03:43:23,079 --> 03:43:26,600
cannabis shouldn't just be some where

5302
03:43:24,719 --> 03:43:28,158
you can take and modify and start

5303
03:43:26,600 --> 03:43:30,359
developing new products with unknown

5304
03:43:28,158 --> 03:43:31,680
Health consequences and giving them to

5305
03:43:30,359 --> 03:43:32,960
people you know the reason we know that

5306
03:43:31,680 --> 03:43:35,720
cannabis is safe is because there's

5307
03:43:32,959 --> 03:43:37,879
thousands of years of us using it but

5308
03:43:35,719 --> 03:43:40,198
you know when we start totally whacking

5309
03:43:37,879 --> 03:43:42,358
out the ratios between those compounds

5310
03:43:40,199 --> 03:43:45,560
and the plant and adjusting it in

5311
03:43:42,359 --> 03:43:47,800
different ways and new forms so does

5312
03:43:45,559 --> 03:43:50,559
does pure dry sift and bubble has maybe

5313
03:43:47,799 --> 03:43:51,959
not fit into that category Ryan I guess

5314
03:43:50,559 --> 03:43:54,238
really I mean that's the most the

5315
03:43:51,959 --> 03:43:56,478
highest percentage of volatile organic

5316
03:43:54,238 --> 03:44:00,318
compounds we we've ever inhaled have

5317
03:43:56,478 --> 03:44:04,119
been in the last 25 to 30 years so I was

5318
03:44:00,318 --> 03:44:05,680
G and rosin you know well again I the

5319
03:44:04,120 --> 03:44:06,800
way I see it with a natural product is

5320
03:44:05,680 --> 03:44:08,760
how are you going to stop people from

5321
03:44:06,799 --> 03:44:11,000
doing it how are you going to remove

5322
03:44:08,760 --> 03:44:14,318
that right of them to use the plant as

5323
03:44:11,000 --> 03:44:15,840
they will right and I and that's why I

5324
03:44:14,318 --> 03:44:17,278
kind of you know like like I was going

5325
03:44:15,840 --> 03:44:19,719
down that road when we talked about it

5326
03:44:17,279 --> 03:44:22,359
earlier I'm right into like plants that

5327
03:44:19,719 --> 03:44:24,478
are 15%

5328
03:44:22,359 --> 03:44:26,640
THC because maybe when you make them

5329
03:44:24,478 --> 03:44:28,799
into a hash they have a different ratio

5330
03:44:26,639 --> 03:44:31,439
of the terpenoids to you know say you

5331
03:44:28,799 --> 03:44:34,238
take a high turp line like say we're

5332
03:44:31,439 --> 03:44:36,520
talking about that 6% tpine line that we

5333
03:44:34,238 --> 03:44:39,719
developed right you've got essentially

5334
03:44:36,520 --> 03:44:42,319
twice as much or more

5335
03:44:39,719 --> 03:44:43,799
terpenoids in ratio to cannabinoids and

5336
03:44:42,318 --> 03:44:47,119
so when you concentrate that down

5337
03:44:43,799 --> 03:44:48,920
naturally you have a different ratio

5338
03:44:47,120 --> 03:44:51,239
right and so I think that there's like

5339
03:44:48,920 --> 03:44:53,680
when you talk about headp

5340
03:44:51,238 --> 03:44:55,600
space and you know and how your head

5341
03:44:53,680 --> 03:44:58,720
actually feels after consuming these

5342
03:44:55,600 --> 03:45:01,238
products like I really am a believer

5343
03:44:58,719 --> 03:45:04,719
in not you know not everything has to be

5344
03:45:01,238 --> 03:45:07,840
30% plus THC in the flower right like I

5345
03:45:04,719 --> 03:45:09,198
I get the novelty of it um but it

5346
03:45:07,840 --> 03:45:12,318
doesn't mean that you have to make all

5347
03:45:09,199 --> 03:45:13,840
products out of that stuff right and I

5348
03:45:12,318 --> 03:45:16,559
kind of feel like with the way that the

5349
03:45:13,840 --> 03:45:18,238
regulations go and the the Distributors

5350
03:45:16,559 --> 03:45:19,760
like the Distributors want high THC

5351
03:45:18,238 --> 03:45:23,439
products because they know that in the

5352
03:45:19,760 --> 03:45:25,040
past those high THC products have sold

5353
03:45:23,439 --> 03:45:26,600
right and so they know that they can put

5354
03:45:25,040 --> 03:45:28,760
their money into a whole bunch of stock

5355
03:45:26,600 --> 03:45:32,559
on that and they're not going to lose

5356
03:45:28,760 --> 03:45:33,960
money um it's also you go we also I

5357
03:45:32,559 --> 03:45:35,398
think we also got to recognize I mean

5358
03:45:33,959 --> 03:45:38,000
maybe this isn't the same in the States

5359
03:45:35,398 --> 03:45:39,719
but definitely in Canada the flower

5360
03:45:38,000 --> 03:45:42,318
market is kind of going away and more

5361
03:45:39,719 --> 03:45:45,318
people are moving to pre-rolls right and

5362
03:45:42,318 --> 03:45:47,158
so when you're in a pre-roll environment

5363
03:45:45,318 --> 03:45:49,198
those consumers aren't interacting with

5364
03:45:47,158 --> 03:45:51,760
the flower in the same way that we

5365
03:45:49,199 --> 03:45:54,399
do right and so is that a generational

5366
03:45:51,760 --> 03:45:56,398
thing maybe change maybe it might take a

5367
03:45:54,398 --> 03:46:00,158
dry head off of it yeah but it's not the

5368
03:45:56,398 --> 03:46:03,318
same as rolling it smelling it

5369
03:46:00,158 --> 03:46:06,359
exactly transforming it from a from a

5370
03:46:03,318 --> 03:46:08,318
bud into a joint that whole experience

5371
03:46:06,359 --> 03:46:10,199
of getting it in your fingers more than

5372
03:46:08,318 --> 03:46:11,519
you would yeah it's wild that's

5373
03:46:10,199 --> 03:46:14,199
definitely a way of looking at it and

5374
03:46:11,520 --> 03:46:16,520
you're not wrong I go to my daughter's

5375
03:46:14,199 --> 03:46:18,840
uh the dispensary that she works at is

5376
03:46:16,520 --> 03:46:21,520
Happy Isle in Horseshoe Bay not too far

5377
03:46:18,840 --> 03:46:23,079
from my house and I'll just go visit her

5378
03:46:21,520 --> 03:46:25,640
sometimes and hang out for you know 10

5379
03:46:23,079 --> 03:46:27,799
or 15 minutes and every single person

5380
03:46:25,639 --> 03:46:30,398
comes in and they're like do you what do

5381
03:46:27,799 --> 03:46:33,519
you got for like uh the cheapest Indica

5382
03:46:30,398 --> 03:46:36,920
pre-roll one gram you know 20% like it's

5383
03:46:33,520 --> 03:46:38,680
very funny how they're ordering cannabis

5384
03:46:36,920 --> 03:46:40,879
uh and obviously this is what we fought

5385
03:46:38,680 --> 03:46:43,920
for right you know we you you just want

5386
03:46:40,879 --> 03:46:46,438
it to make it available and I suspect

5387
03:46:43,920 --> 03:46:48,238
that as much as we want and I think it's

5388
03:46:46,439 --> 03:46:50,760
important what we're doing stewarding

5389
03:46:48,238 --> 03:46:52,879
these volatile organic compound profiles

5390
03:46:50,760 --> 03:46:55,238
and all of the breeding work that guys

5391
03:46:52,879 --> 03:46:57,398
like Ryan and and skunkman Sam and many

5392
03:46:55,238 --> 03:46:59,478
other people have done these are super

5393
03:46:57,398 --> 03:47:01,039
important factors we're preserving

5394
03:46:59,478 --> 03:47:04,039
different aspects but that'll never

5395
03:47:01,040 --> 03:47:07,239
change the fact that 85% or more of the

5396
03:47:04,040 --> 03:47:09,880
industry gives like zero [ __ ] about any

5397
03:47:07,238 --> 03:47:11,879
of it they're happy with floor sweepings

5398
03:47:09,879 --> 03:47:15,119
with some distillate and Botanical turp

5399
03:47:11,879 --> 03:47:17,198
sprayed on it and they just love it and

5400
03:47:15,120 --> 03:47:19,760
I don't know uh if you could ever fight

5401
03:47:17,199 --> 03:47:21,840
that well and you know Marcus I mean

5402
03:47:19,760 --> 03:47:24,238
like you know you're such a purist and

5403
03:47:21,840 --> 03:47:26,000
you know David myself are also like that

5404
03:47:24,238 --> 03:47:28,039
I think a lot of people on the panel are

5405
03:47:26,000 --> 03:47:30,719
we're such purists that we want that

5406
03:47:28,040 --> 03:47:33,080
absolutely finest part of the market or

5407
03:47:30,719 --> 03:47:35,000
not part of the market part of the plant

5408
03:47:33,079 --> 03:47:37,079
and to deliver that to the market with

5409
03:47:35,000 --> 03:47:38,719
pride and say like hey this is something

5410
03:47:37,079 --> 03:47:41,639
that I love you should check it out

5411
03:47:38,719 --> 03:47:44,198
we're we are like an anomaly right like

5412
03:47:41,639 --> 03:47:46,039
most people don't want that stuff yeah

5413
03:47:44,199 --> 03:47:47,520
and even worse in Canada the people who

5414
03:47:46,040 --> 03:47:50,199
do want that

5415
03:47:47,520 --> 03:47:51,800
stuff like hate anything to do with

5416
03:47:50,199 --> 03:47:53,399
government weed any of the people that

5417
03:47:51,799 --> 03:47:55,198
have learned how to grow their own weed

5418
03:47:53,398 --> 03:47:56,879
and make their own hash they're like the

5419
03:47:55,199 --> 03:47:58,880
one group of people that might support

5420
03:47:56,879 --> 03:48:01,519
you and keep you from going bankrupt in

5421
03:47:58,879 --> 03:48:04,599
that Venture of trying to bring that to

5422
03:48:01,520 --> 03:48:08,199
Market are like specifically won't buy

5423
03:48:04,600 --> 03:48:10,318
weed from the legal government

5424
03:48:08,199 --> 03:48:12,600
stores like I don't know I've noticed

5425
03:48:10,318 --> 03:48:14,959
like the needs of the consumers because

5426
03:48:12,600 --> 03:48:16,520
Generations socially are different I

5427
03:48:14,959 --> 03:48:17,879
mean they interact differently they're

5428
03:48:16,520 --> 03:48:19,720
on their phone they're buying things

5429
03:48:17,879 --> 03:48:21,639
quickly they're you know they're looking

5430
03:48:19,719 --> 03:48:23,478
to put their cart together before they

5431
03:48:21,639 --> 03:48:26,198
even go to the dispensary and they pick

5432
03:48:23,478 --> 03:48:28,478
the thing up rather than even shop and I

5433
03:48:26,199 --> 03:48:31,479
think it's it's a lot of that you know

5434
03:48:28,478 --> 03:48:33,158
like so to Marcus's Point like that

5435
03:48:31,478 --> 03:48:34,799
drives a lot of the choices some of

5436
03:48:33,158 --> 03:48:36,920
these larger operators are making

5437
03:48:34,799 --> 03:48:38,278
because that's all their feedback is and

5438
03:48:36,920 --> 03:48:39,600
that's the narrative they're they're

5439
03:48:38,279 --> 03:48:41,120
okay with that narrative they're like

5440
03:48:39,600 --> 03:48:42,960
yeah whatever if that's what sells

5441
03:48:41,120 --> 03:48:44,359
that's what we're selling these guys are

5442
03:48:42,959 --> 03:48:47,478
just business they're just figuring out

5443
03:48:44,359 --> 03:48:49,158
how to sell product it's like you know I

5444
03:48:47,478 --> 03:48:51,879
I just I know that we some of us have

5445
03:48:49,158 --> 03:48:53,559
been doing this so long like for example

5446
03:48:51,879 --> 03:48:55,519
I was I think back with Marcus and

5447
03:48:53,559 --> 03:48:56,920
having these incredibly strong hashes

5448
03:48:55,520 --> 03:48:59,760
not that they were strong but incredibly

5449
03:48:56,920 --> 03:49:03,079
pure hashes and seeing people react to

5450
03:48:59,760 --> 03:49:05,279
those medicines through Hills dispensary

5451
03:49:03,079 --> 03:49:06,719
right and and you know the government

5452
03:49:05,279 --> 03:49:09,439
looks at us and we say hey we got this

5453
03:49:06,719 --> 03:49:12,119
product that's like 50 60 70%

5454
03:49:09,439 --> 03:49:14,158
TC they don't understand that we have

5455
03:49:12,120 --> 03:49:16,640
just refined the best parts of the plant

5456
03:49:14,158 --> 03:49:18,600
and removed the you know we've washed

5457
03:49:16,639 --> 03:49:20,158
away the green parts of the plant and

5458
03:49:18,600 --> 03:49:22,318
kept the important medicine part of the

5459
03:49:20,158 --> 03:49:24,600
plant right and when you give that to

5460
03:49:22,318 --> 03:49:27,359
people in real need they don't have to

5461
03:49:24,600 --> 03:49:29,520
consume all this Burning plant material

5462
03:49:27,359 --> 03:49:32,040
right and so you can do one lungful and

5463
03:49:29,520 --> 03:49:33,720
get a real dose and you know people like

5464
03:49:32,040 --> 03:49:36,120
ATN and everybody else on this panel

5465
03:49:33,719 --> 03:49:38,079
that's worked with people and that need

5466
03:49:36,120 --> 03:49:38,840
cannabis it's like the pure the stronger

5467
03:49:38,079 --> 03:49:42,680
the

5468
03:49:38,840 --> 03:49:44,199
medicine the more complete right like

5469
03:49:42,680 --> 03:49:47,238
you know when I talk like I'm talking

5470
03:49:44,199 --> 03:49:49,640
like P really nice hash rosin or super

5471
03:49:47,238 --> 03:49:52,760
refined bubble they can use a lot less

5472
03:49:49,639 --> 03:49:53,920
of it and it's less harmful to them yeah

5473
03:49:52,760 --> 03:49:56,359
and so the government comes along and

5474
03:49:53,920 --> 03:49:58,279
slaps an extra 20% tax on that and makes

5475
03:49:56,359 --> 03:49:59,600
it less competitive in the marketplace

5476
03:49:58,279 --> 03:50:01,279
right like it's just the whole way that

5477
03:49:59,600 --> 03:50:03,600
we've done this thing is completely

5478
03:50:01,279 --> 03:50:05,040
backwards and a lot of these lessons and

5479
03:50:03,600 --> 03:50:08,479
these beautiful things that we found out

5480
03:50:05,040 --> 03:50:10,159
about the plant I you know I it's it's

5481
03:50:08,478 --> 03:50:12,158
just you see the way that it's playing

5482
03:50:10,158 --> 03:50:14,879
out like Marcus said 80% of the people

5483
03:50:12,158 --> 03:50:17,478
are coming in looking for cheap potent

5484
03:50:14,879 --> 03:50:19,519
rolls it's bizarre yeah we're also

5485
03:50:17,478 --> 03:50:21,959
trying to mimic other industry which is

5486
03:50:19,520 --> 03:50:23,720
sad because we aren't those Industries

5487
03:50:21,959 --> 03:50:25,559
you know and I keep saying that to

5488
03:50:23,719 --> 03:50:27,398
everyone it's just like just because

5489
03:50:25,559 --> 03:50:29,119
there's a strawberry ferone product that

5490
03:50:27,398 --> 03:50:31,719
could say strawberry cough and you could

5491
03:50:29,120 --> 03:50:34,040
use 4% of that and it cost you 30 cents

5492
03:50:31,719 --> 03:50:35,519
to grab and put in your vape and you can

5493
03:50:34,040 --> 03:50:37,760
now call it Strawberry Cough doesn't

5494
03:50:35,520 --> 03:50:39,399
mean you should you know and then on the

5495
03:50:37,760 --> 03:50:41,960
flip side of that because you struck a

5496
03:50:39,398 --> 03:50:44,439
coin with me earlier on the The Vape

5497
03:50:41,959 --> 03:50:46,559
side like what I learned is from a talk

5498
03:50:44,439 --> 03:50:48,559
point point of view like there's tons of

5499
03:50:46,559 --> 03:50:51,238
turps like pones of just blow hanging

5500
03:50:48,559 --> 03:50:53,799
fruit like pgon really toxic like and

5501
03:50:51,238 --> 03:50:56,198
that can show up in you know very toxic

5502
03:50:53,799 --> 03:50:58,358
levels in certain cultivars and we have

5503
03:50:56,199 --> 03:50:59,960
to be very cognitive of that of that to

5504
03:50:58,359 --> 03:51:02,520
your point you know as we move forward

5505
03:50:59,959 --> 03:51:07,198
because there's more to is it a monot

5506
03:51:02,520 --> 03:51:10,640
turpine or is it a sesa turpine uh I

5507
03:51:07,199 --> 03:51:14,760
believe it's a sesa turp monot turpenoid

5508
03:51:10,639 --> 03:51:18,639
monot turpenoid yeah it's oxidized right

5509
03:51:14,760 --> 03:51:22,398
but then it'll go way quicker if you do

5510
03:51:18,639 --> 03:51:24,559
it yeah so we concentrations we learned

5511
03:51:22,398 --> 03:51:26,920
in the medical and medicinal end is

5512
03:51:24,559 --> 03:51:28,760
definitely all about harm reduction and

5513
03:51:26,920 --> 03:51:30,559
uh believe it or not one of the work

5514
03:51:28,760 --> 03:51:33,639
that you know we we've been doing at the

5515
03:51:30,559 --> 03:51:38,799
UN we just got harm reduction put into

5516
03:51:33,639 --> 03:51:42,238
the UN after 24 years it took 24 years

5517
03:51:38,799 --> 03:51:44,799
just to get two words inserted into a

5518
03:51:42,238 --> 03:51:47,158
goddamn treaty so just so you know how

5519
03:51:44,799 --> 03:51:48,599
long it takes some time to make change

5520
03:51:47,158 --> 03:51:51,799
but yes it's

5521
03:51:48,600 --> 03:51:53,920
key I just had another comment about the

5522
03:51:51,799 --> 03:51:55,478
um again I'm probably like a broken

5523
03:51:53,920 --> 03:51:57,238
record on this but when we were talking

5524
03:51:55,478 --> 03:52:00,760
about people going into stores and

5525
03:51:57,238 --> 03:52:02,039
asking for the stronger product again I

5526
03:52:00,760 --> 03:52:04,359
think it just comes down to the

5527
03:52:02,040 --> 03:52:06,560
information that's accessible I think

5528
03:52:04,359 --> 03:52:09,399
that and just like Ryan you're pointing

5529
03:52:06,559 --> 03:52:11,039
out about the lower THC varieties that

5530
03:52:09,398 --> 03:52:13,318
would be higher in tpin or higher in

5531
03:52:11,040 --> 03:52:15,319
other compounds I think as we progress

5532
03:52:13,318 --> 03:52:17,719
as an industry ultimately people will

5533
03:52:15,318 --> 03:52:20,278
understand that and go for it I think

5534
03:52:17,719 --> 03:52:21,679
it's just you know we're we're really

5535
03:52:20,279 --> 03:52:23,840
even though the industry's been around

5536
03:52:21,680 --> 03:52:25,720
for a while now like we still really are

5537
03:52:23,840 --> 03:52:28,079
in the juvenile stages of it all the

5538
03:52:25,719 --> 03:52:29,879
juvenile understanding of it it's just

5539
03:52:28,079 --> 03:52:32,279
going to take proper education and more

5540
03:52:29,879 --> 03:52:33,679
people understanding it to to get to

5541
03:52:32,279 --> 03:52:35,840
that length to get those kind of

5542
03:52:33,680 --> 03:52:37,760
products out there because yeah like

5543
03:52:35,840 --> 03:52:39,158
there's also as much as people might be

5544
03:52:37,760 --> 03:52:41,318
demanding it there's also a lot of

5545
03:52:39,158 --> 03:52:43,559
people around me that are saying how

5546
03:52:41,318 --> 03:52:45,278
strong it is and in terms of that being

5547
03:52:43,559 --> 03:52:47,359
kind of like a

5548
03:52:45,279 --> 03:52:49,238
undesirable thing for it just to have

5549
03:52:47,359 --> 03:52:50,960
that high potency but also again it

5550
03:52:49,238 --> 03:52:53,398
comes down to the price conscious idea

5551
03:52:50,959 --> 03:52:53,398
of what you're

5552
03:52:53,520 --> 03:52:59,120
buying well it's a proverbial race to

5553
03:52:56,719 --> 03:53:02,000
the bottom folks and when pre-rolls

5554
03:52:59,120 --> 03:53:05,079
become the number one thing the cheapest

5555
03:53:02,000 --> 03:53:08,398
way to make pre-rolls is to take hemp at

5556
03:53:05,079 --> 03:53:11,238
probably A1 or $200 a pound and spray it

5557
03:53:08,398 --> 03:53:14,760
with THC that's been synthesized because

5558
03:53:11,238 --> 03:53:17,398
you could synthesize THC 10 times

5559
03:53:14,760 --> 03:53:19,040
cheaper than you can growing it so I

5560
03:53:17,398 --> 03:53:22,039
mean that's just the reality that we

5561
03:53:19,040 --> 03:53:25,640
live in is that you know a lot of that

5562
03:53:22,040 --> 03:53:29,479
stuff that's at the smoke shops and even

5563
03:53:25,639 --> 03:53:32,039
in all the Bas in Manhattan you know a

5564
03:53:29,478 --> 03:53:35,519
lot of that stuff is just the cheapest

5565
03:53:32,040 --> 03:53:39,720
[ __ ] you could possibly find because you

5566
03:53:35,520 --> 03:53:42,479
know again why you know um I would just

5567
03:53:39,719 --> 03:53:45,760
say that you know like if you have if

5568
03:53:42,478 --> 03:53:47,438
you have high quality flour

5569
03:53:45,760 --> 03:53:50,359
and you're trying to get fair value for

5570
03:53:47,439 --> 03:53:52,840
that high quality flow certainly putting

5571
03:53:50,359 --> 03:53:55,158
it into pre-rolls is not is not the way

5572
03:53:52,840 --> 03:53:58,238
to go right because just you know the

5573
03:53:55,158 --> 03:54:00,920
overall value chain and where the grower

5574
03:53:58,238 --> 03:54:04,318
exists in that value chain is if you

5575
03:54:00,920 --> 03:54:06,398
look at where the margins are everyone

5576
03:54:04,318 --> 03:54:08,959
is pressured at the front end of that

5577
03:54:06,398 --> 03:54:12,318
value chain including the grower and the

5578
03:54:08,959 --> 03:54:14,879
processor and the people who really own

5579
03:54:12,318 --> 03:54:17,278
the distribution networks and the folks

5580
03:54:14,879 --> 03:54:20,478
who basically are able to

5581
03:54:17,279 --> 03:54:22,120
populate dispensary shelves with product

5582
03:54:20,478 --> 03:54:25,238
are able to take a little bit more

5583
03:54:22,120 --> 03:54:28,560
margin because the guys at the other end

5584
03:54:25,238 --> 03:54:33,719
you know again look at go to olc in

5585
03:54:28,559 --> 03:54:36,879
Oregon has got a uh a a daily tracker on

5586
03:54:33,719 --> 03:54:38,478
what usable marijuana goes for and right

5587
03:54:36,879 --> 03:54:41,639
now I mean that number always floats

5588
03:54:38,478 --> 03:54:44,760
around somewhere around uh it used to be

5589
03:54:41,639 --> 03:54:48,119
around 1100 1200 then it starts thinking

5590
03:54:44,760 --> 03:54:52,359
around covid below $ 800 now it's around

5591
03:54:48,120 --> 03:54:54,279
$600 a pound so I mean it is really

5592
03:54:52,359 --> 03:54:59,158
difficult to turn on the lights at you

5593
03:54:54,279 --> 03:55:02,000
grow for $600 a pound so everyone along

5594
03:54:59,158 --> 03:55:04,520
the way is trying to extract out as much

5595
03:55:02,000 --> 03:55:06,318
value as they possibly can and

5596
03:55:04,520 --> 03:55:09,120
unfortunately again we're in that

5597
03:55:06,318 --> 03:55:13,519
proverbial race to the bottom where the

5598
03:55:09,120 --> 03:55:16,439
people who can produce a quality product

5599
03:55:13,520 --> 03:55:19,960
at the lowest cost is going to win it's

5600
03:55:16,439 --> 03:55:22,359
a commodity market right that's that's

5601
03:55:19,959 --> 03:55:24,000
that's how we are with everything we do

5602
03:55:22,359 --> 03:55:27,520
food the same way you know there's

5603
03:55:24,000 --> 03:55:29,680
30,000 McDonald's but there's a very few

5604
03:55:27,520 --> 03:55:32,359
like actually incredible amazing

5605
03:55:29,680 --> 03:55:35,199
restaurants in comparison of any one

5606
03:55:32,359 --> 03:55:37,079
brand maybe even just a one or a two and

5607
03:55:35,199 --> 03:55:39,079
so it's done like that with beer and

5608
03:55:37,079 --> 03:55:41,359
they have the IPA group so we just have

5609
03:55:39,079 --> 03:55:44,318
to recognize that we're in a smaller

5610
03:55:41,359 --> 03:55:46,079
portion of the market much smaller but

5611
03:55:44,318 --> 03:55:48,719
even if it's well listen I'm in a super

5612
03:55:46,079 --> 03:55:49,680
small portion cuz I'm in like the 1% I'm

5613
03:55:48,719 --> 03:55:52,799
a

5614
03:55:49,680 --> 03:55:54,000
1center um but you know like there's

5615
03:55:52,799 --> 03:55:56,278
there's there's all these other

5616
03:55:54,000 --> 03:55:58,318
different markets that you can fit into

5617
03:55:56,279 --> 03:56:01,040
I mean I'm thinking thatth you know the

5618
03:55:58,318 --> 03:56:02,920
company that does some of uh Ryan's

5619
03:56:01,040 --> 03:56:04,760
cultivars here and I always mess up

5620
03:56:02,920 --> 03:56:06,920
their company name it's our friend Kips

5621
03:56:04,760 --> 03:56:07,960
a part of it what's the company name

5622
03:56:06,920 --> 03:56:11,079
again

5623
03:56:07,959 --> 03:56:12,959
Ryan Victoria cannabis company Victoria

5624
03:56:11,079 --> 03:56:14,840
cannabis company they're doing exactly

5625
03:56:12,959 --> 03:56:17,438
that like taking dank buds and rolling

5626
03:56:14,840 --> 03:56:20,639
them into pre-roll joints and so it's a

5627
03:56:17,439 --> 03:56:22,920
smaller um Market but it doesn't mean

5628
03:56:20,639 --> 03:56:25,478
they won't do well with it so when you

5629
03:56:22,920 --> 03:56:27,719
hear us talking and we sound like uh you

5630
03:56:25,478 --> 03:56:29,358
know we're upset and and in a negative

5631
03:56:27,719 --> 03:56:31,679
mindset about this you know all the

5632
03:56:29,359 --> 03:56:34,238
people who are watching realize that we

5633
03:56:31,680 --> 03:56:37,840
prefer the much much much smaller

5634
03:56:34,238 --> 03:56:40,398
percentage of the market that when it's

5635
03:56:37,840 --> 03:56:43,680
worldwide is actually still a pretty

5636
03:56:40,398 --> 03:56:46,599
substantial Market I mean if a billion

5637
03:56:43,680 --> 03:56:48,199
people were using cannabis and you were

5638
03:56:46,600 --> 03:56:51,120
a part of the the

5639
03:56:48,199 --> 03:56:53,960
1% that is still substantial that is

5640
03:56:51,120 --> 03:56:56,279
still a lot and uh I just kind of wanted

5641
03:56:53,959 --> 03:57:00,278
to add that we got five minutes left you

5642
03:56:56,279 --> 03:57:02,439
know Walmart Walmart is a big is like a

5643
03:57:00,279 --> 03:57:04,720
big retail in fact I think they're the

5644
03:57:02,439 --> 03:57:09,079
largest company on planet Earth today I

5645
03:57:04,719 --> 03:57:11,158
think maybe next to Jeff bezos's uh

5646
03:57:09,079 --> 03:57:13,359
Amazon and yeah if you think about it

5647
03:57:11,158 --> 03:57:15,039
Marcus you're absolutely right but like

5648
03:57:13,359 --> 03:57:17,800
I'm thinking about like those customers

5649
03:57:15,040 --> 03:57:20,520
that walked in to your uh daughter's

5650
03:57:17,799 --> 03:57:23,959
dispensary you know at some point isn't

5651
03:57:20,520 --> 03:57:26,079
it like again it's useful to think about

5652
03:57:23,959 --> 03:57:30,198
I guess maybe like the micro brew beer

5653
03:57:26,079 --> 03:57:33,398
model so like those of us who love Petty

5654
03:57:30,199 --> 03:57:37,439
hash yeah we're like the micro brw but

5655
03:57:33,398 --> 03:57:40,760
the majority of the market drinks swill

5656
03:57:37,439 --> 03:57:44,238
Budweiser and Bud Light and Miller Light

5657
03:57:40,760 --> 03:57:45,719
and so yeah so like wmart let me throw

5658
03:57:44,238 --> 03:57:47,198
something out you here Mark I'm as you

5659
03:57:45,719 --> 03:57:50,158
know I'm over in Europe here staying

5660
03:57:47,199 --> 03:57:51,399
with Sam and you know I'm walking the

5661
03:57:50,158 --> 03:57:53,359
streets around the neighborhood and I

5662
03:57:51,398 --> 03:57:55,158
know that you guys have both been here

5663
03:57:53,359 --> 03:57:57,439
there's all these little cheese shops

5664
03:57:55,158 --> 03:57:59,199
and there's all these little bakeries

5665
03:57:57,439 --> 03:58:01,199
and these little butchers and fruit

5666
03:57:59,199 --> 03:58:02,319
shops and vegetable shops that are

5667
03:58:01,199 --> 03:58:05,560
selling

5668
03:58:02,318 --> 03:58:07,238
high-end really special cultivars and

5669
03:58:05,559 --> 03:58:11,039
meat types and cheese types and

5670
03:58:07,238 --> 03:58:12,920
vegetable types it's a cultural thing

5671
03:58:11,040 --> 03:58:16,120
right like there there is this cultural

5672
03:58:12,920 --> 03:58:17,398
thing where you know North America and

5673
03:58:16,120 --> 03:58:19,479
it's I think it's probably

5674
03:58:17,398 --> 03:58:22,559
populationbased but there really is this

5675
03:58:19,478 --> 03:58:25,039
thing where North America has a lot of

5676
03:58:22,559 --> 03:58:27,559
industrial production and that kind of

5677
03:58:25,040 --> 03:58:31,040
stuff just doesn't fly over here right I

5678
03:58:27,559 --> 03:58:33,478
mean sure you have those products but

5679
03:58:31,040 --> 03:58:34,880
it's there's much it's much more normal

5680
03:58:33,478 --> 03:58:38,599
to

5681
03:58:34,879 --> 03:58:39,839
have really nice nice food and and you

5682
03:58:38,600 --> 03:58:42,399
know that kind of thing and I think that

5683
03:58:39,840 --> 03:58:47,799
cannabis will develop along those lines

5684
03:58:42,398 --> 03:58:49,278
here Wonder connoisseur level yeah and

5685
03:58:47,799 --> 03:58:51,920
but it's that The Connoisseur level is

5686
03:58:49,279 --> 03:58:54,079
more appreciated by the everyday person

5687
03:58:51,920 --> 03:58:55,879
yeah I think Brian's saying is is what

5688
03:58:54,079 --> 03:58:57,920
how I view New York is like I have a

5689
03:58:55,879 --> 03:58:59,398
very particular lens on New York that's

5690
03:58:57,920 --> 03:59:01,199
because I've lived there for so long and

5691
03:58:59,398 --> 03:59:02,959
I see a culture there that's unlike

5692
03:59:01,199 --> 03:59:05,079
anywhere in the world it's much like

5693
03:59:02,959 --> 03:59:06,679
Europe where sure there's a bunch of

5694
03:59:05,079 --> 03:59:07,879
crap that's going to be sold and it's

5695
03:59:06,680 --> 03:59:09,199
their bit egas and they're going to get

5696
03:59:07,879 --> 03:59:11,438
their coffee and their pre-roll but

5697
03:59:09,199 --> 03:59:12,920
there is a world where they do want

5698
03:59:11,439 --> 03:59:16,279
really high-end stuff and they're going

5699
03:59:12,920 --> 03:59:19,359
to want it every day day and it density

5700
03:59:16,279 --> 03:59:21,399
it's when it's when a town or a a city

5701
03:59:19,359 --> 03:59:23,238
gets to a certain size that that a

5702
03:59:21,398 --> 03:59:26,238
business like that can be supported by

5703
03:59:23,238 --> 03:59:27,680
the 1% right because very often the 1%

5704
03:59:26,238 --> 03:59:30,198
isn't big enough to keep a business like

5705
03:59:27,680 --> 03:59:33,960
that alive especially cannabis regulated

5706
03:59:30,199 --> 03:59:35,960
business it's a lot right so yeah it's a

5707
03:59:33,959 --> 03:59:37,959
challeng you bring that up so you're

5708
03:59:35,959 --> 03:59:39,799
saying so you're saying so right now

5709
03:59:37,959 --> 03:59:42,639
there's like there's there's varietals

5710
03:59:39,799 --> 03:59:45,478
that these shops are selling like along

5711
03:59:42,639 --> 03:59:47,119
with their oh for example if you go to

5712
03:59:45,478 --> 03:59:49,039
like you know we went grocery shopping

5713
03:59:47,120 --> 03:59:51,600
the other day and they have all these

5714
03:59:49,040 --> 03:59:53,319
fruit varieties are more like they have

5715
03:59:51,600 --> 03:59:56,279
these blackberries they're you know the

5716
03:59:53,318 --> 03:59:57,719
size of your thumb right all these

5717
03:59:56,279 --> 04:00:00,520
products that are the result of

5718
03:59:57,719 --> 04:00:02,639
specialty breeding that that would never

5719
04:00:00,520 --> 04:00:05,079
make it into the industrial supply chain

5720
04:00:02,639 --> 04:00:06,639
in North America right whereas where you

5721
04:00:05,079 --> 04:00:08,840
live in an area where there's enough

5722
04:00:06,639 --> 04:00:11,719
people that want a really high-end

5723
04:00:08,840 --> 04:00:14,398

you're if you're developing those

5733
04:00:32,398 --> 04:00:36,358
specialty cannabis businesses you know

5734
