00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:14,259
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:16,059
just a quick little short message I

4
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:19,269
wanted to share with you guys today I

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,009
had one of my employees call me today

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,469
and asked me in regards to a video that

7
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:26,230
did some explaining about the

8
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:27,698
endocannabinoid system pointing people

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,660
in the right directions how they can

10
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:31,269
learn a little bit about the

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,850
endocannabinoids system so I thought as

12
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:36,460
I was driving home from downtown today

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,018
on my way up to the bay I would stop

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,750
here where I used to live at beautiful

15
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:43,600
sunset marina right between Horseshoe

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,460
Bay and Squamish beautiful waterfront

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,838
properties here about eight of them and

18
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,189
I thought what better place to give you

19
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:51,250
guys a little bit of a low-down on the

20
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:53,018
endocannabinoid system so the

21
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,719
endocannabinoid system is basically a

22
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:58,268
signaling system that allows the body to

23
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,429
regulate biological function through

24
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:02,500
homeostasis of the immune system and the

25
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:06,188
central nervous system now it does this

26
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:09,299
through signals that are basically run

27
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:10,959
on the fuel that is cannabinoids now

28
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,079
cannabinoids can be produced

29
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,789
endogenously in the body through the

30
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,679
consumption of essential amino acids

31
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,359
this is why they are considered to be

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,610
the building blocks of life because

33
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,920
though they build cannabinoids and dajin

34
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:25,840
is ones inside your body plant

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,799
cannabinoids also known as phyto

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,920
cannabinoids

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,620
can also be obtained by the consumption

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,150
either orally vaporization smoking of

39
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:39,130
cannabis and they have a similar they

40
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,750
also regulate biological functions and

41
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:42,629
how you can know this without really

42
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,459
doing too much deep research is that

43
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:47,829
smoking cannabis increases appetite they

44
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:49,689
call it the munchies it Redden's and

45
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:52,179
puffs up the eyes this is actually the

46
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:53,530
release of ocular pressure extremely

47
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,780
important to someone who is suffering

48
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,790
from glaucoma and potentially going to

49
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,590
lose their sight the release of the

50
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,469
ocular pressure in an instant of

51
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,060
inhaling cannabinoids can save one's

52
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:07,120
eyesight so that's a pretty serious

53
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,618
thing as is the increase of appetite in

54
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,479
someone that's dying of wasting syndrome

55
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:12,759
producing an appetite in someone that

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,340
has no appetite whatsoever is is

57
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:17,949
miraculous it's why it seems like a

58
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,959
miracle when you give a small child once

59
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:23,259
drop of this oil and it can eliminate

60
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:26,259
hundreds of seizures daily down to one

61
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:28,568
seizure a month it's not a miracle what

62
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:30,669
it is is it is a very important part of

63
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:32,379
our bodies it is a very important part

64
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:34,750
of how we regulate and how we stay

65
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:38,229
healthy and it has been deemed illegal

66
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:41,680
for the last 40 to 50 to 60 to 70 plus

67
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:43,840
years and so now we're learning now

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,060
we're learning that you know not just

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,860
the smoking aspect of it but the really

70
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,189
important aspect of it has become the

71
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,230
oral if you're suffering really if you

72
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:56,009
want to prevent disease you should be

73
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:58,298
consuming phyto cannabinoids orally I

74
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,729
myself prefer to do that through a

75
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:03,010
coconut oil extract but there is a huge

76
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:04,889
variety of ways that you can learn to

77
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:07,479
extract the resins you can learn about

78
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:09,039
decarboxylation which is a it sounds

79
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,738
more complex than it is it's simply

80
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:16,209
heating up the resin to the point where

81
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:17,830
the acids of the rent of the THC CBD CBN

82
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,680
all of the cannabinoids that are in

83
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,989
Assen form they decarboxylate through

84
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,790
the heat and a carboxylic acid ring is

85
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,219
removed and what that does is it

86
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:30,429
activates the cannabinoids it activates

87
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:33,069
THC it activates CBD CBN so they become

88
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,420
activated once you heat it you never had

89
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:36,009
to think about this before because you

90
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:38,199
were smoking it and of course when you

91
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:41,530
heat it decarboxylation occurs

92
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:43,988
instantaneously when you're baking or

93
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,449
cooking or creating an oral extract like

94
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,219
a coconut oil extract we're going to be

95
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:50,199
using temperatures for certain amounts

96
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:52,359
of times and I have videos on this very

97
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,429
thing if you want to google coconut oil

98
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:56,769
hash extraction I did a really nice

99
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,719
youtube video that shows you how much to

100
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:02,709
use per cup of coconut how long to leave

101
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:05,109
the crock-pot on for how long and how

102
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,539
long to leave the crock-pot on for how

103
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:08,950
long and all of those things sort of

104
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:11,650
taken care of in that way and if you

105
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:14,349
want to check that video you feel free

106
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,918
to I would also urge you to check out my

107
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:19,389
facebook group the endocannabinoids

108
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,049
system there is some incredible

109
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:25,600
compilation of people in there putting

110
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,949
stories and clips and videos and all

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,350
sorts of really inspirational

112
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,810
information on

113
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,340
the endocannabinoid system on the

114
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,769
success story of people shrinking their

115
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,569
cancers eliminating cancers or at least

116
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:38,039
shutting cancers off to the point where

117
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:40,379
they're no longer detrimental and

118
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,350
life-threatening so that's a huge thing

119
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:45,839
so I tell people on the regular feed

120
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,580
your endocannabinoid system that's not

121
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,129
to say that if you're dabbing up a storm

122
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,959
that that's gonna take care of business

123
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:53,909
know it well to a certain degree if you

124
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,739
have glaucoma and you're smoking or

125
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,939
vaporizing you're definitely going to

126
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:02,370
see an immediate relief an immediate you

127
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:04,860
know medicinal benefit but if you've got

128
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:09,720
something more along the lines of

129
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:12,509
massive tumors you know tremors of other

130
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,850
things that might require a deeper you

131
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,039
know saturation of the endocannabinoid

132
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,020
system and it's one of the reasons I've

133
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,629
been so impressed with United cannabis

134
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,579
and with Blue River is they're acting

135
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,920
out program the activated cannabinoid

136
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,449
therapy program which really sheds light

137
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,530
and what it does is it creates a

138
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:34,860
landscape for a person to see a phyto

139
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:37,769
cannabinoid medicinal and preventive

140
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,170
aspect landscape that allows one to see

141
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:42,599
the importance of the subtleties of

142
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,350
actually stacking cannabinoids and not

143
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,400
just you know taking one plant

144
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,650
extracting it and using that as your

145
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,459
medicine but but extracting many strains

146
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:55,560
many plants and then stacking those into

147
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:58,019
these really beautiful prana products

148
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,430
that you can is producing and we're

149
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:01,409
hopefully going to be producing in

150
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,990
Jamaica with our Jamaica project here in

151
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,790
the next couple of months we're just

152
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,560
waiting to get our clinical trials going

153
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,650
our animal studies so that we can make

154
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,089
sure we know how safe it is but you know

155
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:13,409
these guys have a way of doing things

156
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:15,599
that you got to follow if you want to

157
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:19,230
play their game so that's what we're

158
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,379
gonna do so now I think it's time to

159
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:26,030
feed my endocannabinoids system I got

160
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:30,209
some beautiful seven star from Horacio

161
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:31,679
really nice nice sift and it's grape

162
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:35,779
crush and I'm hitting it out of the

163
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,680
fabric a egg with the DC glass banger so

164
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:38,679
I think it's cooled off enough

165
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,569
Rock carb

166
00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:02,000
Rockstone was my pillow is the Bob

167
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:06,790
