Marcus Richardson aka the bubble man you

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,679
know I've been into the Cannabis

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,518
industry since I was about 15 or 16

9
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:25,518
years old I was deeply involved with the

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:28,079
hemp growing legally for the first time

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:31,320
in my province of Manitoba back in the

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,719
mid90s I moved to British Columbia in 96

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,399
and became an integral part of the BC

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,800
Compassion Club through growing and

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,239
providing and procuring cannabis for

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,799
them uh and it was around 1998 that I

17
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,000
ended up getting into a little bit of

18
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:51,000
trouble uh and that trouble funny enough

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,600
led me into the wonderful world of

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,558
[Music]

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,399
bubblehash and then really most

22
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,878
excitingly are these Bubble Man brand

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,198
deals that I've been doing recently the

24
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,839
key factor for me is finding an

25
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,599
incredible hash maker and with Michigan

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,520
it was no different I was reached out to

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:13,879
by a gentleman by the name of Papa sift

28
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:16,438
uh AKA Ryan wall and he just checked all

29
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:19,399
the boxes a true bubble Ambassador a

30
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:22,359
true lover of the art form of hash

31
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,040
making and uh he reached out to me and

32
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,000
he connected me uh with this amazing

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,280
group of gentlemen of Growers from

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,200
Michigan called

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,280
ranic uh and really it just everything

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,280
fit like a beautiful

37
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:40,158
glove hey everyone it's Papa here

38
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,280
Welcome to our lab come check out where

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,560
we make all the BC Bubble Man products

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,560
here in

41
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:51,718
Michigan I've been doing solvent list

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,599
for like since 2009 I'd say and I've

43
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:57,239
been doing it at scale for since like

44
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,000
2017 so I think I just had a strong

45
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:02,798
grasp of running a lab I also had

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,359
experience running a BH Lab at a

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,759
different facility in Jackson Michigan

48
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,959
so it's kind of all translated and was

49
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,878
able to pull together and run a small

50
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,080
crew over

51
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:18,239
here we decided to go to Jamaica

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,519
Cannabis Cup in 2015 I think it was the

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,039
first International Cannabis Cup down

54
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,640
there and uh a mutual friend linked us

55
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,598
up and it was cool to go meet him and

56
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,518
pick his brain but I wanted to just go

57
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:33,119
there to meet people like Marcus and you

58
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,759
know people that I wanted to just

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,000
network with and see if I could uh

60
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,158
figure out how to get into the industry

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,400
it's been fun kind of managing that and

62
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:46,479
uh trying to break

63
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,560
through Papa sift is really second to

64
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,439
none and for the bubble man brand to

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,680
survive and to succeed that is a major

66
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,318
important factor in in moving forward

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,000
and so I got to give a huge shout out to

68
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:02,919
Papa sift uh following the bubble man

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,120
Sops incorporating his own Sops that he

70
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:08,518
learned over the years from me we've

71
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,840
done many many many FaceTime um hash

72
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,439
making sessions with our Osprey with our

73
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,560
hashte with our Ros and presses uh from

74
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,598
decarboxylating materials using the

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,878
sample automation rosin reactor all of

76
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,878
it we've done uh closely together and so

77
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,719
I just got to give a huge shout out and

78
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,438
a thank you to papa for sort of putting

79
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,598
all of this together with the bubble man

80
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:32,598
brand and

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,799
oranic BC bubbleman has been the brains

82
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,359
of the operation and I'm the hands

83
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,360
carrying it

84
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:51,438
out he he does have very precise Sops to

85
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,640
follow so um when we're trying to do

86
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:56,759
certain higher end SKS it has to be

87
00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:00,000
pretty specific on how he wants things

88
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:02,759
followed so depending on the skew um

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,759
we'll do three to six washes and we'll

90
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:10,039
start off with very gentle agitation and

91
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,120
uh slowly ramp up agitation just to make

92
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:15,400
sure that we're getting everything off

93
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,400
and not leaving any meat on the

94
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:21,319
bones I would be remiss as well if I

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,560
didn't mention the live hash Vapes that

96
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:24,839
we're going to be releasing with the

97
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,600
Kung Fu Vapes in the Michigan Market

98
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,758
really excited about these I've been

99
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,160
testing a whole variety of Vape Hardware

100
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,520
really like the Kung Fu disposable units

101
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,439
that's going to be live hash rosin these

102
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,599
products always of course take you got

103
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,439
to grow exceptional Canabis you got to

104
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,120
do it with Consciousness you got to do

105
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,600
it hopefully regeneratively and

106
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,360
sustainably so you can keep doing it and

107
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
then of course a really important factor

108
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,360
as well is making sure that you have the

109
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,360
right hash maker for the

110
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:59,360
brand we just got the Kung Fu Vapes has

111
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,520
a nice airflow it preheats every time

112
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,400
you turn it on and off so it never gets

113
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,879
like stuck it's a pretty smooth

114
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:09,599
experience I'd

115
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:11,560
say so we did the 7390 and 120u of the

116
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,400
strawberry lemonade that I'm washing

117
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,079
right now so you'll get uh different

118
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:20,839
flavor profiles from each bag I noticed

119
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,359
uh more of a creamier one for the higher

120
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,478
Micron bags and more of a fruity flavor

121
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,160
for the

122
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:30,599
73 the BC Bubble Man products are going

123
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,080
to be something new to the market and

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,800
we're really excited to bring them

125
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,000
here so these hash hits are dryft from

126
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,360
BC Bubble Man techniques they're

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,478
disposable five come in a pack they're

128
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,520
02 each so each pack has a gram of hash

129
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,639
technically by like volume for white one

130
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:52,719
of these is equivalent to a joint these

131
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,240
are our first batch here in Michigan so

132
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm pretty excited to get these on the

133
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,120
market we just got the test results back

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,639
this is our first drop and the strain is

135
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,639
soap

136
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,280
the ranic crew is incredible and amazing

137
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,719
they've been the perfect Partners

138
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:12,918
growing 17 Acres of incredibly organic

139
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,000
beautiful sustainable cannabis flowers

140
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:16,918
really paying attention to the Sops in

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,639
regards to how they harvest how they

142
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,359
maintain fresh frozen from literally the

143
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,680
time that the plant is cut down right up

144
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,759
until the time that we're processing uh

145
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,519
the material so they've been incredible

146
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,240
in that sense I couldn't imagine a

147
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,519
better partnership and we're really

148
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,360
looking for the same thing in regards to

149
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,318
dispensaries we're looking for conscious

150
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,598
owners people that want to get their um

151
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,520
customers you know sort of the best that

152
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:45,079
they can depending on where they fit

153
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,159
into the SKS because when I say the best

154
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:49,439
you know the best could be a hash hit

155
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,840
for one guy it could be full melt dry

156
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,038
sift for another guy so it's not really

157
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,038
speaking about the quality as much as

158
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:59,120
what is the best fit for the customer in

159
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:03,000
regards to price point uh THC percentage

160
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,280
and atile organic um compound so if you

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,959
feel that that might be you guys and

162
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,598
that's one of you know what what's sort

163
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,439
