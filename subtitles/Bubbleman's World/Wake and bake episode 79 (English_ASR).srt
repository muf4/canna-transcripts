dosa we met like we didn't eat like

48
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,500

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,060

hey dude what's up I was like hey bro

51
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,469
what's up so it was it was kind of the

52
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,140
weirdness of Instagram

53
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:16,599
and social media where you just feel

54
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:19,959
like you know someone meeting dosa truly

55
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:24,250
was like meeting a friend that you've

56
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,900
known for years it wasn't you know we it

57
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,370
was I don't think I've ever met anyone

58
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,140
like that in fact that it was just so

59
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,210

60
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:34,959

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,920
glassblower gave me I wish I had it on

64
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,690
me actually I left it upstairs gave me a

65
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,609
really beautiful little Marini I

66
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:49,419
photographed some of them and put it up

67
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:51,670
on the post yesterday on Facebook let us

68
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,250
wake the bake I think that's a good idea

69
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:56,199
oh why wasn't it working for me just a

70
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,289
moment ago grandma call him well why not

71
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,629
it why not go through this a third time

72
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:03,400
what happens is I guess when you run

73
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:04,959
your computer and you do live chats

74
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,000
through the computer through Google

75
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,390
right it's through Google Chat and then

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,639
it forces itself through YouTube when

77
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:14,619
you do it on the phone it actually works

78
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:18,879
a little bit differently and so the

79
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:22,420
phone is a little bit jacked if you will

80
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,849
and so when I go to go live okay often

81
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:26,469
it'll just it'll go it'll like three two

82
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:28,060
one and then my phone goes black now

83
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:30,370
when this happens oh don't worry about

84
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,530
it dude it's you missed out and I want

85
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,969
you to hear what the answer so and it's

86
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,909
not your bad at all don't worry about it

87
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:38,439
so when that happens I have to start it

88
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:40,090
over well what's been happening is a

89
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,930
glitch lately that when I started over

90
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:46,030
and I go to resume the chat its vertical

91
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,250
and I'm OCD I can't have a wake-and-bake

92
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,500
video where it's where it's like that so

93
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,900
what I have to do is I have to stop that

94
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,539
one go in and restart a whole new one

95
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,980
and sometimes I have to do two three

96
00:03:55,539 --> 00:04:01,120
four per per day per morning and so

97
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:02,349
usually it's easier if I go back and I

98
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,069
find the ones that were already there

99
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:07,840
and delete those ones but just making it

100
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:09,699
easier for people to find the actual

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,830
chat that we're in because if I start

102
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,869
three or four sometimes people are in

103
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,870
one that aren't that are not actually

104
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:20,530
moving so that is the answer the answer

105
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,379
is is that the there's a bit of a glitch

106
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,049
and that's because there

107
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:26,939
streaming and encoders that are needed

108
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,259
when you go through google it does

109
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:29,279
everything for you but when you go

110
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,349
through your phone

111
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,169
I guess it's using just the YouTube app

112
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,930
and the encoder for the YouTube app is a

113
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,270
little bit glitchy you know what I tried

114
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,180
putting a little tussin on it rubbing a

115
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:44,939
little tussin on my phone there but you

116
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,579
know so far it hasn't worked might have

117
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:52,199
to get that super tussin we'll see what

118
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:54,599
happens all the this the the crystal

119
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,759
should have been tied to taped to the

120
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,790
Hat yeah I would have taped it like

121
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,800
right here so not sure a few people said

122
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,990
they didn't get their crystal that's

123
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,660
weird I want everyone to get their

124
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,900
crystal I also want to have a big bong

125
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:16,800

dizzle swiss perc love me a swiss perc

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,910
let's do it up

128
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:41,790
yeah I met in the tussin I don't know

129
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:55,079
this bong could almost be 10 years old I

130
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:57,870
don't it's very likely actually I'm

131
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:05,430
hitting sipped maybe that's why the ribs

132

look bigger I did gram I did see the

133

138
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,099
was Darren's if the one that I just hit

139
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,959
the next one I hit is going to be Sun

140
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,730
rises a little bit of a different color

141
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:47,449
on the two Darren's is a little bit

142
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:47,450
darker quite a bit darker actually so

143
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,920
awesome plans for today well I have a

144
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,360
good call that I have to make in regards

145
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,699
to Jamaica and we get to find out what's

146
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,080
going on there and get an update for

147
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:02,610
everyone and then I'm also going to try

148
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,879
and edit the video that I filmed

149
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,800
yesterday I got a hope that I filmed all

150
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,329
the parts and get to fit it in I don't

151
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,319
know if it's gonna be a 15-minute video

152
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:14,819
or a 30-minute video I did film a lot

153
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,490
but I didn't really interview the the

154
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,589
glassblowers them being Japanese and not

155
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,970
speaking the best of English Yoshi I

156
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:22,439
probably could have done an interview

157
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,240
with but I didn't want to bother them

158
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,949
and they were in crush mode and I didn't

159
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,590
want to pull them out I felt actually

160
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:30,870
bad just standing behind them trying to

161
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:33,269
film because the work that they're doing

162
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,379
is so intricate in so detailed that the

163
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:36,889
last thing I want to do is be

164
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:40,610
responsible for causing any

165
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:43,610
sets in the in the process so I filmed

166
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,819
all three of the Japanese glass blowers

167
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:50,360
I filmed dosa I interviewed John Green

168
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:54,139
and I guess I took a couple of puffs out

169
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:58,278
of the Kevin nail so that video will go

170
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:59,658
up I'm hoping today yeah exactly Tyler

171
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,459
that's kind of what I was hoping for I

172
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:03,498
mean of course we'd love to see them all

173
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:04,878
yeah Ron said yes to the greenhouse

174
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:05,960
project we're just in the middle of

175
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,960
waiting to hear from the greenhouse

176
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,299
companies yeah Japanese glass for the

177
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,649
wind these guys are unbelievable

178
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,300
watching them do their thing was really

179
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:15,560
impressive I look forward to going back

180
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,319
in the next five days when they're

181
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,490
finishing they're making a cup and you

182
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,169
know it's gonna be the entire two weeks

183
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,389
that they're at the house that this is

184
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:28,068
gonna happen yesterday they crushed a

185
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:31,278
dual sided pendant just absolutely

186
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:32,810
unbelievable in how much detail these

187
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:37,208
guys are able to put into their glass

188
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:41,119
and the process of watching them do it

189
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:42,468
absolutely blew me blew my mind you know

190
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,259
there was a big cannabis culture in

191
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:47,690
Japan John was telling me who lives

192
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:49,610
there and helps facilitate the Japanese

193
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,529
glass blowers here in Canada bring them

194
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,259
here he speaks Japanese and he can sort

195
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:57,049
of you know get them what they need and

196
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:58,549
keep them comfortable he says that there

197
00:08:57,049 --> 00:08:59,870
is he says that they were selling glass

198
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:01,069
and they're selling one-hitters and

199
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,720
there's head shops and this that the

200
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,490
other thing at the same time he says the

201
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,949
cops can stop you anytime they want and

202
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,810
they can search you it's very harsh the

203
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:10,879
the government is definitely against JA

204
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:14,448
herbs that are not using cannabis

205
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,740
medically to promote you know the

206
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:18,679
endocannabinoids system

207
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:23,060
herb is illegal and expensive like maybe

208
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:24,889
30 40 dollars a gram and so yeah he was

209
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:26,838
saying the other days I call I miss my

210
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:28,309
wakin bakes cuz he's just loves waking

211
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,910
up and getting high and he can't do that

212
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:33,439
in Japan so yeah of course Ron said yes

213
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:34,789
we're working it out there's logistics

214
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,320
we got to find a place you know we got

215
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:38,028
to get rid of Ron's house we got to get

216
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,620
him moved over here we got to find Ron a

217
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:41,480
new house we got to buy a green house we

218
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,310
got to build a green house we got a it's

219
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,720
gonna take us some time give us a couple

220
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:47,319
of months to get this project going

221
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:53,230
because let's be honest it's just one of

222
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:54,790
it is not the main project yeah I bet

223
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,740
Chuck Liddell said the same thing most

224
00:09:54,789 --> 00:10:00,730
anyone that's traveled to Japan will say

225
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:03,669
the same thing beautiful country and

226
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:06,789
beautiful people and culture and love

227
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:09,129
the food and but the anti herb sentiment

228
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:10,809
when I got my record my lawyer basically

229
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:15,189
told me the two countries you shouldn't

230
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:16,778
go to our America and oh glad you

231
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,480
received the bubble bags illegal

232
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:20,740
cannabis Farmers of Canada and Japan he

233
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,839
said those two places will be your

234
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,659
biggest problems with the felony record

235
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,639
of cannabis possession so best to just

236
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:32,409
avoid those two countries which sucks

237
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:33,879
you know I don't want to avoid any no he

238
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:36,129
does not want to live in the Cootes he

239
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:39,220
lives in the coots and he's leaving the

240
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:40,480
coots but thank you I don't think so you

241
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,129
know he's gonna figure out his own thing

242
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,339
it's probably gonna be personal what he

243
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:46,809
figures out so I might not be sharing

244
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:48,940
exactly what he's done with his house

245
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:50,828
but he's gonna figure something out with

246
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,839
it and you know get it taken care of

247
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:54,969
sell it I don't know but he's gonna get

248
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,589
up here we're gonna find him another

249
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,839
house and then we're gonna start this

250
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,699
greenhouse project so I pray that it

251
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,470
starts sooner than later I would have

252
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:05,379
loved to have been starting it in you

253
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:09,600
know March to get it all going by April

254
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:12,179
May but instead it'll be the way it is

255
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,528
we'll see what happens

256
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,479
exactly Jan I live in one of the most

257
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:18,100
beautiful places I've ever seen as well

258
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,069
and I've traveled all over the world - I

259
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,649
don't know 25 or 26 countries not that

260
00:11:21,068 --> 00:11:26,708
that's that many considering there's 218

261
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,149
or 220 oh I won't be telling you exactly

262
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:32,349
where Ron lives but you're welcome to

263
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:34,389
keep guessing oh that's okay stoner

264
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,519
Smurf listen always ask questions never

265
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:38,549
feel bad the worst thing is is it might

266
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:42,009
not be answered or you might hear a

267
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:43,179
reply that you're not expecting that

268
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:45,068
doesn't mean you shouldn't have asked

269
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,448
your question when you hear a reply that

270
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:48,159
you're kind of oh that's not what I

271
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:50,559
wanted to hear in return sometimes

272
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,509
people get a little uh-oh sorry don't be

273
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,268
sorry you asked a question that's cool

274
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:56,470
we should all be allowed to answer

275
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:59,679
questions just like we should all be

276
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,610
allowed to answer questions in the way

277
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,269
that we see fit

278
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:06,879
so would you live in Jamaica or Spain

279
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:08,889
yeah yeah I could do Barcelona I could

280
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,379

281
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:13,928
I've spent a lot of time in Jamaica you

282
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:16,389
know like really a lot of time over the

283
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:20,230
course of the last 20 years I may have

284
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:22,178
spent a year of my life in Jamaica so I

285
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:26,019
used to go there for six seven weeks at

286
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:29,678
a time and that was really nice getting

287
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:31,149
those trips in mr. melts you know

288

00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:37,328
Jamaica right now that I love the idea

290
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,889
of I have no idea if that's true you'd

291
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:40,688
have to look it up and regards to a

292
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:44,079
Spanish person that might know the

293
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:46,838
Spanish laws the product in Jamaica is

294
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,578
like anywhere it's hard to find but it's

295
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,949
great if you can find it the majority of

296
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:53,289
the stuff is not great and it's not

297
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:55,599
exciting and it's not you know just like

298
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:57,969
anywhere to go into a dispensary or if

299
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,980
you go into you know buy herbs anywhere

300
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,259
it's - always the same like most is not

301
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,199
that exciting and a little bit is super

302
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:07,928
exciting and it's uh that's the way it

303
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:09,818
always is I'm not sure if I'll be trying

304
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:12,488
to get into the USA anytime I thought

305
00:13:09,818 --> 00:13:14,349
about it I won't lie I thought about it

306
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:19,509
oh geez who was I supposed to shout out

307

309
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:27,068
email from a woman yesterday who said

310
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:29,230
her husband was kind of bummed out and a

311
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:30,998
little down and out and if I could just

312
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,220
give him a call it would cheer him up

313
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:34,449
and I thought wow what and I just said

314
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,220
that morning you know if you can make

315
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:38,789
someone's day better by giving them a

316
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,709
smile or helping them in some small way

317
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:43,748
wouldn't it be a good thing to do and so

318
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:46,088

347
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,910
[ __ ] is this world come to that we can't

348
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,649
share our time with one another that

349
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:59,049
people have to feel like it's a special

350
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:01,329
occasion if someone who has a bunch of

351
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:04,750
followers on Instagram gives them time

352
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:07,570
it's just [ __ ] up so yeah it made me

353
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:11,350
feel as good as it made him feel I won't

354
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:12,790
lie really did and I felt like I was

355
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,259
able to give him some inspirational

356
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:16,539
words you know he felt like he was in

357
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:18,909
this obstacle zone and losing his job

358
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:21,189
and being sick and I was just like bro

359
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:23,799
those are your opportunities that's the

360
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,450
energy that is feeling so intense that

361
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:28,479
if you go down into it you're gonna be

362
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:30,480
super bummed out but if you can kind of

363
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,310
flip it around you're gonna have this

364
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,769
incredible rocket launcher boost of

365
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:38,289
power that can set you off on the next

366
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,879
vision that clearly you manifested in

367
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:42,579
the first place because you didn't want

368
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:45,509
to work as a construction worker anymore

369
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,950
and you couldn't quit so you ended up

370
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:50,860
manifesting subconsciously this other

371
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:53,050
experience that took you away from your

372
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,940
career so I want to give a big shout-out

373
00:15:53,049 --> 00:16:00,309
to Katie and SSS what a nice person what

374
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,650
great people I didn't talk to her for

375
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:05,409
very long I just heard her voice in the

376
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:07,840
background but I'll tell you the guy was

377
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:09,990
the real deal just a nice person and

378
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,190
maybe having a little bit of problem

379
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,289
problems in his life and feeling a

380
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,390
little down man it made me feel good to

381
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:19,149
be able to lift him up a little bit and

382
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,799
I hope you listen to SSS I hope you got

383
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:22,019
you're having

384
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,849
better day today and I'll tell you that

385
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:26,009
you made my day a better day yesterday

386
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,470
by being a part of it so thank you

387
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:30,689
brother in the meantime I think it's

388
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,610
time for feeding our endocannabinoid

389
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:35,790
systems have you fed your

390
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:40,079
endocannabinoids system today I know I

391
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:44,069
have alright actually we're gonna go for

392
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:46,679
the other stuff well it's the right

393
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:50,610
thing to do and it's nice and it just

394
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:53,578
feels good and in the end well okay

395
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,139
here's another cool story survivor who

396
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:57,299
came in the other day and I decided to

397
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,429
give him the the bottle of DC glass

398
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:01,828
cleaner he sent me a really cool email

399
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:03,958
says he's super good friends with vital

400
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:05,970
garden supply guys and says if you want

401
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,578
I'll help get them on hash Church and in

402
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,549
like three emails back and forth and

403
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:14,159
he's got buddy from vital garden supply

404
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:15,659
who Tony has talked about and supported

405
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,209
in the past and who I've only heard

406
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,308
great things about he's gonna come talk

407
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:24,058
about soil on hash Church you know all

408
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:26,099
because of that experience of that just

409
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:27,928
sort of stepping outside of the box if

410
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:30,959
we're looking for things to be different

411
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:33,059
in our lives why don't we change them

412
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,308
step outside of the box do something you

413
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:39,599
might not have done do something that's

414
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:43,339
a little bit you know not the everyday

415
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,269
step out of your norm and so for me

416
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:47,789
stepping out of my norm the other day

417
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:50,190
and deciding that the guy who said hey

418
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:52,889
did I miss the giveaway am i late you

419
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,289
know I got to give him that thing and in

420
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,200
turn he gave back this beautiful energy

421
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:59,970
and and because of it you are all gonna

422
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,380
benefit because now Brian from vital

423
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,269
garden supply is gonna come and he's

424
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,070
gonna school us on soil and he's gonna

425
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:09,119
we're gonna have a great conversation so

426
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:12,359
and then you know sss was the same thing

427
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,639
he just he just made me the everyone in

428
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,740
this world has something to offer and

429
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,559
you it more importantly have something

430
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,410
to offer them and i think that i often

431
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,690
think that fame is how they hijack it

432
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,880
they try to make certain people famous

433
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,490
so that everyone's focused on those

434
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,480
people while missing the true people

435
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,640
that they've manifest

436
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,919
into their life through whatever form of

437
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,540
energy or what-have-you

438
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,759
those are the people you're supposed to

439
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:41,129
be meeting and they might not look like

440
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:43,230
you know the movie star or the rock star

441
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,540
they might just be an everyday person

442
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,569
and don't miss that opportunity because

443
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:50,490
you yourself manifested that person into

444
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:53,279
your life what a horrible hell to be

445
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,599
trapped in to subconsciously manifesting

446
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,759
the energies and the people that you

447
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,798
need in your life and constantly blowing

448
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,519
them off and missing them missing the

449
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:04,889
mark how [ __ ] up is that

450
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,629
I'll tell ya hey thanks Christian much

451
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:11,190
appreciated with the kind words

452
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:12,750
much appreciated yeah you know you know

453
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,700
I mean don't get me wrong some people

454
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,940
rub me the wrong way and I have I have

455
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,798
this crazy energy with and but for the

456
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,539
most part I try to understand that all

457
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,000
the people that come across my path I

458
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:26,308
myself have manifested them into my life

459
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,720
and you know I learned that through

460
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:29,609
getting busted in thinking getting

461
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,440
busted was the worst thing ever and then

462
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:33,779
sort of transferring that energy into

463
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,220
starting bubble bags which was like the

464
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:40,589
best thing ever for me and my family

465
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,289
it's just been a wonderful great thing

466
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:46,289
and it all came through this all through

467
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:48,269
this obstacle that everyone I can assure

468
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:50,759
you was all on the same page saying this

469
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:53,009
was bad very very bad and that's how we

470
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,230
feel you know we feel that and I'll tell

471
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:57,480
you when I told SSS yesterday listen bro

472
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,669
you probably manifested losing your job

473
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,289
but because you were so stubborn in your

474
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:02,880
life you would have just held on to that

475
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:04,889
job for the next 50 years

476
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,540
I said now you're going to be able to

477
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,730
create a reality for yourself where

478
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,339
you're not just doing something that you

479
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,558
have to do or that you're good at but

480
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:16,079
something that you want to do and that's

481
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:17,579
you know the law of attraction there it

482
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,259
is the first time I ever saw that Law of

483
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:22,829
Attraction my wife and I we were

484
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:24,029
laughing about it because my wife is

485
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:24,599
like that's what you've been doing since

486
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:29,609
I've known you

487
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:31,349
I'm like hell yeah oh yeah I fully

488
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:33,089
believe in manifesting your reality well

489
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:34,439
there's no doubt about it it's all done

490
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:36,240
through the choices that you make but

491
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,340
more importantly through the thoughts

492
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,870
that you think through the words that

493
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:42,029
you project and through the

494
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:44,069
actions that you display through those

495
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:46,129
three combinations and they are like a

496
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:49,019
ladder one step comes before the other

497
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:51,930
they lead into these manifestations and

498
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:55,680
I just you know it's it's hard to

499
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:57,450
understand sometimes but even you know I

500
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,009
guess what it is is it's kind of like

501
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,009
outside of good and bad

502
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:04,859

503
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,330

00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:08,879

00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:20,009
one of the things is I would love to

510
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:22,859
find the quality material obviously we

511
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:24,900
have access to some but this is an

512
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:26,849
opportunity for everyone to be a part of

513
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,660

514

around but if I have my choice I'm going

703
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:43,339
to go with my sapphire or my quartz

704
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,840

722

I don't enjoy smoking cannabis any more

723
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:35,940

today

739
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,740
it's kind of a big responsibility to

740
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:16,809
always drop this intense information

741
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,370
sometimes it's facilitated out of me by

742
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,409
the particular conversations we're

743
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:22,359
having and other times it just doesn't
