kneading to the it's really kind of like

188
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,120
art like you just created your canvas

189
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,240
and then you painted it and then you

190
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:24,679

200
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,759
our view on cannabis use I've always

201
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,519
dreamed of a day where alcohol and

202
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,958
tobacco weren't the main focuses of a

203
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,839
Food Industries right like come on like

204
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,838

205
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,839
me

too commercial you know what I mean like

208
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,759
well I think McDonald's I think there an

209
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,799
aspect of it will but as long as they

210
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,198
allow us to have our our other levels

211
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,198
then I won't have a problem with their

212
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:20,399
commercialism commercialism will always

213
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:23,120
feed the masses yeah and the masses need

214
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,919
to be fed too right so but for those

215
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,120

allergic to pharmaceutical painkillers

276

marijuana allows him to function one p

is of all Beads it's like this pain is

278
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:31,198
like Bam Bam Bam with cannabis and then

279
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:36,240
something this

280
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:38,519
like still there it's just not as hard

281
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,240
he's created his own particular strains

282

perfected for his particular pain coming

283
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,440
revers new federal regulations will

284
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,919
limit Le the production to a handful of

285
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,560
industrialized Growers they'll only be

286
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,559
producing a limited number of strains no

287
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,559
Edibles oils or creams at a price that's

288
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,799
four or five times higher for me it's

289
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:59,359
all about finding exactly what it takes

290

for you to function and

[Music]

514
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:12,038
properties what a unique

515
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:17,398
taste particularly with both of these

516
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:19,398
desserts on my palette as well I'm

517
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:23,038
curious with that

518
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:25,678
that's dessert hash for

519
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:28,038
dessert

520
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,000
right it could be argued that there are

521
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:34,440
are that are hashes to smoke during a

522
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,759
meal as opposed to the desserts I find a

523
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,038
cush a deep heavy hash to be more of a

524
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:41,679
meal and sometimes this one in

525
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:44,720
particular it's just so tasty and got

526
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,840
such a good head to it it's almost like

527
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,278
it's a dessert we said that quite a

528
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:49,278
while ago

529
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:58,720

there's no water in the Mother Ship

543
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,679
we've been puffing out of it for the

544
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:37,759
last hour and a half and I literally

545
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,880
just notice now when I went over to the

546
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:44,119
sink to dump the water and none came out

547
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,880
that there was none in in in the pipe

548
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:47,439
the whole time probably you guys have

549
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,840
noticed when we were puffing that you

550
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,159
were probably wondering why are those

551
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:54,000
guys why didn't they put water in the

552
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:56,960
pipe anyway that's a testament to the

553
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,690
power of Mothership anyway peace out for

554
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:09,858
