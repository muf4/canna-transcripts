1
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:08,798
okay

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,200
hello to the whole team adam bark today

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,119
we are going to go through the anatomy

4
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,800
of a concentrate rig

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,719
talk a little bit about dabbing talk a

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,439
little bit about the different types of

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,118
um materials that we'll be dabbing off

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,719
of the different types of pipes that are

9
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,399
available

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,559
and really kind of going over a whole

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,640
broad stroke of the entire process so

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,320
when i was originally asked to do this

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,840
uh it was told to me that some of the

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,600
people in the company had been telling

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,520
people about the different products that

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,760
we were making

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,079
in particular full melt hash and maybe

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,359
the question had arisen um how do you

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,000
consume it

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,679
so today after today's little 101 on

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,679
dabbing we should all be able to

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,320
understand uh the anatomy of the

23
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,878
concentrate rig the types of rigs um you

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,480
know concentrate rig water pipe uh the

25
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:00,558
types of nails which are titanium quartz

26
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,319
uh there are glass nails but that's

27
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,719
really the cheapest you can go there are

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,478
ceramic nails there are electric nails

29
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,478
all of which i have here in fact i also

30
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,519
have sapphire nails here on the table

31
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,560
today i'm going to be going through a

32
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,079
little bit

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,760
we can talk a little bit about the dome

34
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,519
vapor slide people aren't using those

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,600
too much uh anymore and then of course

36
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,000
the essential dab tools which i have all

37
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:23,839
here on the table which is the rig

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,359
the nails the torch uh the dabber tools

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,118
uh and of course the concentrate

40
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,719
containers that are holding the hash

41
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,719
that we'll be dabbing here today for

42
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,319
this 101 we'll go through proper use

43
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,599
safe consumption and how to clean and

44
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,118
maintain these these rigs and of course

45
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,280
you guys should have this document as

46
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,879
well so you can kind of follow along so

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,159
to start i want to talk about a few of

48
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,560
the different rigs that i have here on

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,560
the table

50
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,719
both of the pipes are from a company

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,000
called mothership

52
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,840
um of course you don't need to have a

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,399
mothership pipe this is called a faberge

54
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,159
egg this one is called a klein

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,879
and this is in regards to the type of

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,880
filter that he's blown inside of it so

57
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,519
there's all sorts of different there's

58
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,280
tauruses and klein's and faberge eggs

59
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,599
this is a hollow pipe you can see with

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,080
your finger in there only the walls have

61
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,479
thickness and that's where the water is

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,239
so both of these are water pipes

63
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,119
both of these can be used either with a

64
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,200
torch

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,878
or with an electric nail or even with

66
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,799
the beam that i have over here which

67
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,799
i'll talk about in a little bit

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
i've got full melt uh bubble hash as

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,319
well as a little bit of rosin i've got

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,000
some five star bubble hash and some six

71
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,280
star bubble hash meaning when i put it

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,439
on the rig

73
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
it's going to boil and liquefy and

74
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,120
vaporize in a way that leaves very

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,719
little chafe we will talk about what

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
happens when you hit too hot but there

77
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,280
are reasons why we have all these

78
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,199
different units

79
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,000
uh so i guess we'll talk about first

80
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,238
starters these are our titanium dabbers

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,639
you will need a dab tool because um this

82
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
material is very greasy

83
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,079
and you'll need to sort of take stick

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,360
your dab tool in there uh to get a dab

85
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,480
out so i'm gonna come on over

86
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,040
and do it right to the camera

87
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,479
so we can see there we go let's see if i

88
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,878
can get

89
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,280
there we go

90
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,399
so let's see if that looks good so we're

91
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,080
basically going to stick our little

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,920
dabber in here

93
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,840
and just get a nice little dab out we

94
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,119
don't need too much

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,840
especially because i'm probably going to

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,759
have to take more than one

97
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,000
and generally one is more than enough

98
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,959
for me so we'll just do small ones i got

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,959
a little dab right there

100
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,400
we're gonna be using the climb

101
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,280
over here and we're gonna be using the

102
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,039
peli nail so the pelican nail has a

103
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,878
quartz

104
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,639
banger this banger is pretty unique in

105
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,158
the sense that it has a stub coming out

106
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,878
the bottom with a tiny little pin that

107
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,798
fits through and holds this electric

108
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,719
coil in place

109
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,840
the only really thing you need on top of

110
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:52,560
this rig your pipe and the pelican nail

111
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
which comes with the whip and the coil

112
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,360
the banger

113
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,400
and

114
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,480
a

115
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,480
carb cap so these are the

116
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,518
the things that you need you've got your

117
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,000
dabber

118
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,799
you've got your carb cap and the simply

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,239
put

120
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,519
we know our temperature is

121
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,599
430 degrees

122
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,719
fahrenheit which is a nice low vape

123
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,798
temperature

124
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,358
it's certainly not going to burst the

125
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,000
material into flames and cause my throat

126
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,599
soreness i like low temp dabs you can

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,439
always turn it up if you want to get a

128
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,439
smokier hit if you want to be coughing

129
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,800
if you want to really feel that grab and

130
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,560
there is a reason that some people want

131
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,360
to do that sometimes if you suffer from

132
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,000
pain or massive inflammation which is

133
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,240
causing your pain a really hot dab can

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,560
really reduce some of that so we're

135
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,639
going to go for a connoisseur hit here

136
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,519
take the pipe in hand bring it up to

137
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,960
your lips and let go put put your dabber

138
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,439
right in there and rub it up against the

139
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,918
walls until it all melts down into the

140
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,759
pipe and once it's done that which it's

141
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,758
doing right now

142
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,520
you want to get it all off

143
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,080
put your carb cap on

144
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,079
and pull

145
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,160
beautiful

146
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,400
so we put our carb cap back down

147
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,600
now part of maintenance this part of

148
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,758
maintenance we're going to be doing

149
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,160
involves some q-tips

150
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,680
i was sent some silicon reusable q-tips

151
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,000
recently which i think is great because

152
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,240
this is wasteful and we can do better

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,319
and then there's oh

154
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,560
edit that out so i do hope we can do

155
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,918
better with the reusable q-tips in the

156
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
future

157
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,918
and we've got the dc glass crystal this

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
is dark crystal glass nature's cleaning

159
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,879
solution uh this stuff is made out of

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,439
water caranja oil coconut extract kelp

161
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,639
extract extract of sugar cane completely

162
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,038
non-toxic

163
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,280
and when you drop it into the quartz

164
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,599
dabber it really only works with the

165
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,719
heat but when you drop it into the top

166
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,360
of the of the bong of the banger sorry

167
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,840
it sizzles and as it's sizzling

168
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,800
it just boils and cleans the inside of

169
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,799
the banger to near perfection so we do

170
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,319
this after every dab

171
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,360
and that way the next person that comes

172
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,360
along isn't going to get a dab that is

173
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,759
not enjoyable so this is called dabbing

174
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,759
etiquette it is quite important

175
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,360
you don't want to just a take a dab with

176
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,199
someone's pipe and then not really have

177
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,600
the understanding on how to simply clean

178
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,360
it afterwards which is um

179
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,879
i'm sure most people would be kind

180
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,240
enough to do it for you the first couple

181
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,519
of times but eventually it's something

182
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,120
that

183
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,439
you want to learn yourself

184
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,199
so i was unfortunately unable to find

185
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,160
the battery to this all of this really

186
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,680
is is it's a laser thermometer it sits

187
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,039
under the pipe i'm going to put this

188
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,319
over here because i'm almost well i've

189
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,399
knocked it down once and that was a

190
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,160
second almost knock it down so you can

191
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,399
put it right under your pipe it doesn't

192
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,599
have to be this close by any means it

193
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,839
can be like three or four inches away

194
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,519
if it was on it would be reading the

195
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,359
temperature of the banger so i could hit

196
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,120
the banger with the torch the banger

197
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,360
being this bowl right here i could heat

198
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,959
it all up with the torch

199
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,439
get it to the point where i put it under

200
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,839
here wait for that 430 degree

201
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,680
temperature that i like oh so much

202
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,000
and then that's when i could hit it now

203
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,280
this isn't working and it's great

204
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,519
because i don't have a battery for it

205
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,119
it's one of those square nine volts um i

206
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,359
can show you how we did it before this

207
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,199
technology existed so this is a fairly

208
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,360
large quartz banger so i won't be

209
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,120
heating it up for too long but generally

210
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,038
we used to do it with a timer we would

211
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,240
heat it up for 20 seconds we would cool

212
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,680
it down for 50 to 55 seconds and then we

213
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,199
would take our hit

214
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,519
and then you know the first time you hit

215
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,199
a new banger you can kind of extend the

216
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,120
cool down period or decrease the

217
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,520
cooldown period to find that sweet spot

218
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,399
if it's too hot you want to you want to

219
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,639
extend the cooldown period uh past 55

220
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,000
seconds if it's not hot enough

221
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,038
you would want to maybe start hitting it

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,478
at 45 seconds or even 40 seconds so

223
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,318
we're gonna have a hit like that we've

224
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,478
got our blow torch here i've already

225
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,439
filled it up with the butane gas over

226
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,000
here

227
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,000
uh and so i will do

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,319
the two methods i will do the timer

229
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,319
method but i will also show you a method

230
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,240
that people have been using even before

231
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,000
the timer came out

232
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,079
and it's quite convenient as well this

233
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,879
is the um basically the same way you

234
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,639
would test a baby's bottle you hold your

235
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,639
wrist right over the banger if it's

236
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,240
really hot i tell people when they say

237
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
well how do i know when it's ready i

238
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,759
tell them well how it feels on your

239
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,399
wrist is how it's going to feel on your

240
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,959
lungs so wait until it's cooled down

241
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,479
and feels good on your on your lungs so

242
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,478
we'll get our timer started here

243
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,680
start that up

244
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,680
we'll do 20 seconds

245
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,640
you can see i like to keep my pipes as

246
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,039
clean as possible it's not always

247
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:00,480
possible but i'll go over how easy that

248
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:03,039
is at the end of this video

249
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,440
all right so there's 20 seconds

250
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,360
we will reset and start that over and we

251
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,080
will go for a

252
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,560
45 to 50 second cooldown

253
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,560
oops make sure we're not spilling hash

254
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,319
we're gonna hit the uh

255
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,599
wedding cake is what we're hitting this

256
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,640
time first hit was the strawberry banana

257
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,959
i'll use uh a different carb cap this

258
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,958
time

259
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,799
and so you can kind of put your wrist up

260
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,639
there

261
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,719
it's not too hot at all actually i'm

262
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,949
gonna go now we're outside so it's

263
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,999
cooling it down

264
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,999
[Music]

265
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,519
perfect temperature no cough no strain

266
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,159
no heat

267
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,560
just a really great taste

268
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,480
and that for me is really my favorite

269
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,319
aspect of dabbing now understand dabbing

270
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,000
is multi-dimensional and it's more than

271
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,720
what i'm just doing some people really

272
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,399
like hitting hot dabs and coughing and

273
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,920
just like anything people will judge

274
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,839
people that do things differently than

275
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,278
how they deal with them but i implore

276
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,079
you not to do that if people are

277
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,600
enjoying dabs let them be it is our one

278
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,000
of our company's missions to make

279
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,399
product that's uh at the top of the

280
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,200
chain so people that are also doing this

281
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,799
can enjoy it uh you know as as

282
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,480
as much as the medical patients can

283
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,799
enjoy it as much as the recreational

284
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,039
patients i really just want us to be

285
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,000
able to have an exceptional quality of

286
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,480
hash

287
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,559
so people can do this very experience

288
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:46,519
perhaps in settings like these and just

289
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,518
really get into a great headspace

290
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,199
all right so we're going to clean this

291
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,799
up with a little q-tip

292
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,800
we'll get our dc glass cleaner

293
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,159
there he is hiding over here and the you

294
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,320
know the reason you want to keep these

295
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,799
um bangers clean is first of all they're

296
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,879
very expensive um they sell for two and

297
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,000
three and four hundred uh dollars a

298
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,200
piece

299
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
um quartz being a lot harder to to work

300
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,519
with than borosilicate

301
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,600
glass

302
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,600
but yeah it's nice to keep your your

303
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,719
bangers as clean as possible now here's

304
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,039
a little terminology for you when you

305
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,519
heat the banger up way too hot like

306
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,199
heating it up for 40 50 60 seconds and

307
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,078
then only letting it cool down for 10

308
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,560
seconds uh when you put the dab on top

309
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,958
of that it's going to almost burn and

310
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,479
sear to the glass immediately and that

311
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,759
terminology

312
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,519
we call chasing so chasing the banger is

313
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,759
a pretty big no-no in the world of

314
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,159
dabbing etiquette uh much like not

315
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,799
cleaning your your your bowl out is but

316
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,958
really chasing it is a real bummer it

317
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,278
also shows you how powerful the little

318
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,359
dark crystal glass cleaner is because

319
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,278
sometimes the worst chas and what i mean

320
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,039
by that you can kind of see it on this

321
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:07,600
one if i bring it forward

322
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:09,759
this is a fairly old unit and it's been

323
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,000
smoked out of quite a bit and so you can

324
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,600
see it's cloudy uh it's a little bit

325
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,679
chased on the bottom here as well so

326
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,839
every time it gets like this and the dc

327
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,759
glass cleaner can't pick it up you need

328
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,200
to fire it with a torch the torch breaks

329
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,120
it down the little bit of dust kind of

330
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,200
gets into the porous course

331
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,159
and you end up with this smoky looking

332
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,440
quartz which is just not as nice

333
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,919
as

334
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,040
the clean

335
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:37,439
nice big quartz shining in the sun you

336
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,759
know you can really appreciate

337
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,880
appreciate that right there compared to

338
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,120
the chas

339
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,399
so these were both gifts for me but

340
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,919
between the two of them i think they

341
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,000
were uh or they're worth about five or

342
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,439
six hundred us uh and you know when

343
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,278
someone's paying that money they really

344
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,920
want to learn the proper way to use

345
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,200
these bangers and make sure that they're

346
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,559
not doing something that's so

347
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,480
detrimental that they're going to

348
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,559
shorten the life cycle

349
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,759
by a large amount

350
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,199
so

351
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,039
we have a bunch of different types of

352
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,278
dabs here we can talk a little bit about

353
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,599
this is some water hash bubble hash the

354
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,600
cultivar is called wedding cake

355
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,839
we would call it six star as it pretty

356
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,639
much boils away and disappears to almost

357
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,839
nothing very little material left on the

358
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,680
q-tips when you clean the banger

359
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,200
we got some grateful heads here this is

360
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,159
the the jagger

361
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,079
rosin it's very nice it's like honey it

362
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,039
just pours you could pour it out like

363
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,359
honey

364
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,559
it's quite an incredible consistency

365
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,639
very different from these two

366
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,000
consistencies this is more like a butter

367
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,639
on the left here

368
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,639
this one over here is more like a i

369
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,720
wouldn't well shatter really when it's

370
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,680
hot it's super pulley and taffy but when

371
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,440
it gets cold it's like a shatter

372
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,599
the next one is almost like a distillate

373
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,600
it's very saucy and liquidy

374
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,040
it stays like that always it doesn't

375
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,440
change no matter if you don't keep it

376
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,519
cold or you heat it up

377
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,440
this one is some five star bubble hash

378
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,360
it looks like kind of like standard hash

379
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,360
but with a nice orangey

380
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,440
amber outside i'll try to show a

381
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,560
close-up to these each time this is lost

382
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,079
gardens

383
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,719
and then a couple of more

384
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:13,278
bubble hashes that have been whipped

385
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,120
and almost made to look like rosin also

386
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,198
done by grateful heads

387
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,600
and then we have our carb caps that

388
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,359
we've kind of gone over already quite of

389
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,120
a variety this one's got a little bit of

390
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,519
a tilt to the end of it so when you spin

391
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,600
it on top of the banger

392
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,240
it creates directional flow and it'll

393
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,759
move the rosin or the bubble hash or the

394
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,600
you know solvent dabs that you're

395
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,759
hitting if that's what you're hitting uh

396
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,159
it'll move it around evenly around the

397
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,759
base and the sides of the quartz banger

398
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,679
you'll get a better hit that way you

399
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,519
won't cool down certain spots and leave

400
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,599
other spots warm

401
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,759
there's also a titanium one here we

402
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,040
don't really hit on titanium anymore

403
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:54,240
this is a combination titanium base with

404
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,679
a quartz bowl that screws into the top

405
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,120
i haven't really hit with that one in

406
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,039
quite a while either

407
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,480
over here i have a d-nail this one's

408
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,240
quite special because this one's

409
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,879
silicone carbide

410
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,759
this is also plugged into a titanium

411
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,639
base but the top itself can be either

412
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,120
quartz

413
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,360
a quartz piece like this

414
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,919
a sapphire piece like this which is

415
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,240
really the top notch in my opinion and

416
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,000
i'll tell you why i think so in a second

417
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,039
and then silicone carbide which is great

418
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,679
for traveling it's extremely extremely

419
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,879
uh tough it's not going to break

420
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,120
and then the

421
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,958
whip on this one and the coil is quite a

422
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,679
bit different you won't see it wrapping

423
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,319
around the banger on this one it's

424
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:39,198
actually flat and it's a circle like a

425
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,199
like an element and the post goes right

426
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,599
through and the top screws on top of

427
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:46,399
that so it's all along the bottom of

428
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,959
this almost like a stovetop element

429
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,639
so love that this is the carb cap that

430
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:55,119
goes with that it fits really quite nice

431
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,519
it's also got a directional um

432
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,679
piece uh drilled in here just a tiny

433
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,198
little hole drilled in at an angle

434
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,039
the reason that is actually and the

435
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,599
reason all of these are directional is

436
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,039
not just to move the oil itself around

437
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,199
and the one thing i don't have on the

438
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,519
table that i'm going to talk about today

439
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,958
are these little orbs or spheres and

440
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,240
they make them out of ruby and they make

441
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,838
them out of sapphire and they make them

442
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,440
out of quartz and i'm pretty sure they

443
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,320
make them out of silicone carbide and

444
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,320
probably they even make them out of

445
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,879
sapphire uh maybe i said that one

446
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,120
already that's a lot to remember anyway

447
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,679
they're little orbs little tiny balls

448
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,000
you put one inside your banger and now

449
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,239
that acts as a mechanism that when you

450
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,320
get that wind going and you start moving

451
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,120
anything or everything around that hot

452
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,120
little orb also peels the resin and

453
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,720
moves it around the base of the banger

454
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,159
at this point in time you're probably

455
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,480
asking yourself are these people

456
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,319
seriously into this this much that he

457
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,360
actually knows about this particular

458
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,199
subject right now and yes we are and i

459
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,879
do and it's something you're going to

460
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,198
want to familiarize yourself with this

461
00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:00,240
is our industry uh this is one of the

462
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,559
main ways that we are um

463
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,400
consuming uh products that we are going

464
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,599
to that we have produced out of our lab

465
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,679
and that we are going to continue to

466
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,159
produce out of our lab uh it is a big

467
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,160
part of the culture that already exists

468
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,360
and i think that it would be great uh

469
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,038
for you guys to have a really good

470
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,719
understanding of all of this and any

471
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,959
questions you have whatsoever please

472
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,880
reach out we can send them off in an

473
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,880
email chain and we can get them all sort

474
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,000
of answered i think i went over

475
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,000
everything

476
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,679
pretty well

477
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,119
we spoke very little about this unit

478
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,200
because i didn't bring the power source

479
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,959
out but it's really quite simple you

480
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,640
know it conducts heat by sitting on the

481
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,720
quartz where there's a heater underneath

482
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,799
the quartz this little bit of metal

483
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,960
conducts heat enough to get the banger

484
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:43,679
up to temperature where you can pull it

485
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,759
away from and not have any connection

486
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,240
but not having used the torch so it's a

487
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,160
very innovative way it's done by a quite

488
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,160
a young guy down in washington him and

489
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,759
his partner are engineers and they're

490
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,960
just thinking outside of the box and i

491
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,319
like that they're thinking outside of

492
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,519
the box and in fact the company is

493
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:02,159
called mr hotbox so they are just

494
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,440
selling these right now um it hasn't

495
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,440
really caught on i think i'm one of the

496
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,440
first people to really use it

497
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,840
we can go over a whole variety of ways

498
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,360
in the future on how you can dab without

499
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,319
these particular units because there's

500
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:17,199
an entire industry that involves the the

501
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,439
switch and the puffco peak and a whole

502
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,000
variety of other units that are not

503
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,480
glass pipes with bangers like this but

504
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,160
have created a unique aspect of almost

505
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,759
like the electric pen

506
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,640
turned into the electric bomb so for now

507
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,440
i will leave you all possibly with one

508
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,679
last uh bong rip i think it makes sense

509
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,798
to hit the coffee which is the lowest

510
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,038
gardens uh organically regeneratively

511
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,720
sustainably grown

512
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,440
outdoors in

513
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,440
ontario which i also love that hash of

514
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,279
this quality was produced

515
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,400
outdoors in ontario

516
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:57,200
and i bid you all good evening may the

517
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,400
full melt bless your dab rig sooner than

518
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,400
later peace out everybody

519
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,679
so

520
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,880
so

521
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,038
you
