2
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:27,028
all right welcome to both man's world

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,380
I'm here in my somewhat pre-spring clean

4
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:34,429
up garage and I have received a most

5
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:38,070
incredible package in the mail I have

6
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:40,340
received my peer pressure my I guess

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,789
they have a particular name on this one

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:48,450
this one is called I saw it on about

9
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:51,539
along the long peak so check this out

10
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,949
this is one of the peer pressure rosin

11
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,050
presses that of course if you watch the

12
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:57,299
rosin episode of hash Church 2.0 I

13
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:59,038
believe it was Eric who came on or maybe

14
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,078
it was Josh one of the other maybe both

15
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,359
they came on to talk about their unit

16
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,948
they've got the little unit that amps up

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,200
the pressure on the side they've got the

18
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:09,118
recipes that you can program in it's

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
really quite a nicely advanced unit you

20
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,469
can tell it it's a rosin press not

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,000
started by cannabis aficionados not

22
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,400
started by welders but started by

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,530
engineers maybe a combination of the

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,740
three in fact so what we're going to do

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,349
is we're gonna do a little unboxing here

26
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:27,719
so why don't you guys stay tuned for the

27
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:30,118
uncrating first of all great-looking

28
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,769
crate when I spend as much money as I

29
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,790
spent on this unit they retail for about

30
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:37,859
8,000 US you want to see it show up in a

31
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,240
proper package you don't want to be

32
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:41,700
worried about the integrity of the

33
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:44,688
shipping so it looks like so far that

34
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,689
they've really done a good job

35
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,730
Booya

36
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,100
nice that the screws come right out it's

37
00:01:52,609 --> 00:02:02,239
not like a difficult battle to get them

38
00:01:55,099 --> 00:02:06,978
out spoke too soon actually I spoke too

39
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:08,840
soon again so really excited to get

40
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:10,368
pressing with this unit and try it out

41
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,840
of course I love for those of you

42
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:14,330
they're gonna ask right away what about

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,509
your sasquatch I love my Sasquatch unit

44
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,219
I use them all the time but one of the

45
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:23,689
things that this unit really sold me on

46
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:26,090
was the fact that you could program you

47
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:28,639
know your your batches into the unit

48
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,890
which is a big deal if you're if you've

49
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,719
got a person who you're paying to really

50
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:34,159
know this stuff but maybe they don't

51
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,739
have the time to do all the pressing and

52
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,000
they need to retrain some people a human

53
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:42,620
like this is wonderful because you can

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,150
retrain with with the programs you know

55
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,739
you've got up to 30 programs that this

56
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,870
thing will take and they've all got

57
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:50,750
numbers and you could you know program

58
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,900
for moisture content for press time for

59
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:57,199
different factors in the melt or in the

60
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,700
resin in the amount of time that you

61
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,768
press for the heat that you press for

62
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:03,828
all of these things are going to be

63
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:06,019
fairly important and they're the subtle

64
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:08,390
nuances well look at this right off the

65
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,799
bat this looks great I'm gonna bring the

66
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:19,179
camera over and show you guys what I'm

67
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:24,890
looking at here okay

68
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:28,370
so here we go right off the bat you got

69
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:31,759
some plates we got some pressure some

70
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:35,930
screens a giant oil slick make a nice

71
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:41,840
job packaging it up it's pretty pretty

72
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:43,879
heavy for sure got some scoops well they

73
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,439
even threw a little butter cutter in

74
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,879
which is quite nice I don't know if you

75
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,030
guys have seen these units but they are

76
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,219
very nice they come in handy got all

77
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,810
sorts of different brackets dual

78
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:55,340
pressure tubing so I guess there's a

79
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,189
little bit of pudding putting things

80
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:02,090
together man they even sent a really

81
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:05,000
nice skillet tool I'm picking up the

82
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,789
resins so I guess what we'll do is we

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,400
pull this stuff out and we'll pack it

84
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:24,909
over to the left here and then we'll

85
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:30,879
gain access to what what's inside okay

86
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,880
there we go all right

87
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:57,889
makes it nice and easy packing it

88
00:04:47,930 --> 00:05:02,540
exactly how it was here oh it's a

89
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:06,590
different size peer pressure rosin press

90
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:22,220
rosin bag accessory alright the quick

91
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:23,929
flip interesting alright ok one more

92
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,789
level has been opened and I of course

93
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:35,870
want to show you guys what's going on in

94
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:39,829
here looks like we got t-shirts t-shirts

95
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,930
and of course how rosin is pressed well

96
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:47,359
they got a nice amount of literature

97
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:48,949
here peer pressure Pikes Peak and the

98
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,400
long speech so we have the long peak

99
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:54,860
here I believe this is the long peak the

100
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,810
unit that we're looking at ten by three

101

00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:45,829
forward to getting in here i'm gonna put

124
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:50,049
the camera back on the tripod and we're

125
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:50,050
gonna further open up the package here

126
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:54,329
[Applause]

127
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:15,228
love the professional mists of the

128
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:19,210
packaging on this unit he's absolutely

129
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:30,860
stellar she's really well

130
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:34,878
well done here diggin Anna beefing but

131
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:37,520
guess what I'm not gonna look I'm not

132
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,780
gonna luck all right let me open this up

133
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:44,620
a little bit more because for some

134
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:51,008
reason I'm Way cut off ah there we go

135
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:51,009
there we go there we go

136
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:12,949
all right so okay well I suspect

137
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:35,200
[Music]

138
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,679
[Music]

139
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:56,639
all right here's our unit let's open it

140
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,090
[Applause]

141
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:07,759
all right sucker

142
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:07,759
well she is packaged so beautifully

143
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:21,300
blown away the product a even made it in

144
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,769
the first place but just it someone

145
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:28,449
would sell such a nice product and not

146
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:35,808
packaged it up the best to take

147
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:35,809
[Music]

148
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,918
[Music]

149
00:10:41,990 --> 00:11:21,539
all right so I think what we're gonna do

150
00:10:44,610 --> 00:11:26,100
is lay it down on these all right add

151
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:27,439
the unit that goes on the side of it not

152
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,670
too much to deal with

153
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,710
looks like I've already even already got

154
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:34,639
plates that they sent me they're just

155
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,639
merely extra

156
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:08,949
all right so we got our long peaks

157
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:33,950
pressure gauge that goes in on the side

158
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:41,060
guessing these are pretty good there's

159
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:43,910
one there's two okay we're gonna get the

160
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:47,989
allen key out for this little guy we'll

161
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:49,069
make it happen here in a few minutes all

162
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,720
right I also wanted to show you guys

163
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,610
this I ordered some parchment from these

164
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,009
guys and check out the professionalism

165
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,750
on these parchments labs this is awesome

166
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:02,750
there's literally like a thousand pieces

167
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,940
of parchment in here pre-cut perfectly

168
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:09,679
to fit into the press and so we're gonna

169
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:11,450
get that ready right now hey guys

170
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:15,289
welcome to bubble man's world I'm here

171
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:17,030
with Cory or from from ACCA alternative

172
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:18,230
cannabis consumption awareness boom I

173
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,740
don't know if you guys saw but we did a

174
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,539
little thing about six months ago yeah

175
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,310
in around six months so yeah right well

176
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:26,839
we did a little demo it was live I was

177
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:29,539
kind of on a google chat skype type

178
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,280
thing and Cory ran the process in front

179
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:33,620
of a group of people all those safe

180
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,179
extraction methods and rosin pressing is

181
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,370
definitely one of the top things on our

182
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:39,620
list for safe extraction exactly so this

183
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,940
is the peer pressure that the long peaks

184
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,710
long's peak press from peer pressure and

185
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,270
man we just did a little test run I know

186
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,379
it's dark but we really wanted to share

187
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:50,509
this with you we didn't want to wait

188
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:52,730
till tomorrow so we got the unit set up

189
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:54,139
we got the beautiful touch screen right

190
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,139
here we've got the plate seating up to

191
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:58,879
210 top and bottom and I'm gonna show

192
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:01,340
you what the camera up close actually

193
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,058
why don't I do it right now show you

194
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:08,969
right this second what we got

195
00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:13,918
going on here what they've got in this

196
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:16,199
this press fraud the computer yeah it's

197
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:17,639
really cool really well done alright so

198
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:19,889
here's the screen that we're dealing

199
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,839
with and so you can heat up your plates

200
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:24,959
by simply clicking on that and going

201
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,879
save and that will save save your plate

202
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,768
at the temperature that you're putting

203
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,849
in I made a little mistake there so I'm

204
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:34,408
just gonna fix it get it back to 210

205
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:36,809
we've got a recipe that we're running

206
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:39,119
here we're gonna put that on and we're

207
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:43,228
gonna put that on we're gonna run recipe

208
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:47,479
number five yeah here it is you can see

209
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:51,179
flour 10 grams on the two by nine bags

210
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:53,459
115 microns medium pressure medium speed

211
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:56,208
sorry with 16% humidity or moisture

212
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:58,408
content you can see our air pressure is

213
00:14:56,208 --> 00:15:00,718
kinda low over here but we haven't

214
00:14:58,408 --> 00:15:02,188
turned it on and then also I want to

215
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:05,519
show you another part of this press

216
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:09,058
that's really cool which is on their

217
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,739
website as well they've got the safety

218
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:12,418
emergency stop right here that you can

219
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:14,429
just hammer down and that stops the

220
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:16,978
whole process and then they've got the

221
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:18,869
dual buttons one on the left and one on

222
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:20,639
the right and this allows you you hold

223
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:23,038
these down for five seconds and that

224
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,619
engages the press it doesn't move the

225
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:27,778
plates parcei but what it does is it

226
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:29,788
engages the press and then this

227
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:31,619
particular one also has plate speeds how

228
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:33,239
fast and how slow they're gonna move and

229
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:35,699
then this is the real doozy right here

230
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:37,709
this is the dual unit this is the amping

231
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:41,188
up of the pressure we're coming in at

232
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:43,018
about 25 to 30 psi on the Left we're

233
00:15:41,188 --> 00:15:44,998
coming in at about a hundred on the

234
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,859
right and you can probably hear a tiny

235
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:48,449
little bit of a leak i didn't have the

236
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,739
teflon tape but this is something you're

237
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,598
gonna want to do if you're setting this

238
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:53,399
up I can feel it leaking right there

239
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:55,619
just a tiny little bit should be okay

240
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:59,009
and this is the little toggle shift that

241
00:15:55,619 --> 00:16:00,719
allows us to go back from a over to B so

242
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:02,099
this is where most of the pressure is so

243
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:03,719
we're gonna you'll see us using the

244
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:08,249
toggle to the right more often than the

245
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:11,729
left and I guess Jay is over here

246
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:12,850
preparing the flowers and what we are

247
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:15,790
using is

248
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:18,899
some beautiful beautiful where is my

249
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:26,230
bike so you guys know this one very well

250
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:29,078
the solid solid solid fielder right is

251
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,879
so nice is the unique European profile

252
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:32,948
with a good yield right we flipped the

253
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,240
bag inside out already yeah beautiful so

254
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:36,219
we I didn't have the tool I was gonna

255
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,198
show you guys this really cool tool that

256
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,540
these guys came out with flip a bag

257
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:42,909
another bag for them so they've got this

258
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:44,620
very simple simple tool that I'm sure

259
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:47,528
anyone can do I'm gonna shut that door

260
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:51,818
there sits inside out well it's you got

261
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:57,448
the seam on you put your tube in push

262
00:16:51,818 --> 00:16:59,860
your other tube in the bottom perfect

263
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:01,299
and then that just flips the bag just

264
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,579
like that and you want to use that tool

265
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:05,769
to press out the corners to make sure

266
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:07,240
that they're coming out and then you

267
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:08,918
won't get any product caught in that

268
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,259
seam that's really beautiful

269
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:13,360
then on top of that they have these cool

270
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:15,158
little funnels that fit right into their

271
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,558
bags and I'm telling you this might look

272
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,600
simple and not that impressive I was

273
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:28,869
stoked when I watched the 10 grams of

274
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:30,279
powdery bud just flow right into no

275
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:32,739
problem we're gonna get back to this

276
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:36,058
here in a second this peer-pressure unit

277
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:39,190
is just beautiful super stoked on it

278
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:42,009
long Peaks for those of you interested

279
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:45,490
in finding out more you can check it out

280
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:48,038
at peer pressure comm and this is the I

281
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,940
love it when you go through and you can

282
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:54,519
see the watery view through the place

283
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:57,159
that is great you got a little parchment

284
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:59,798
holder here that you can use if you

285
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,630
decide to we didn't use it the first

286
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:04,990
time we just had a couple of magnets

287
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:07,210
that we used but yeah very very cool

288
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,339
little unit of course this unit has

289
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,100
these feet on the end of it but it also

290
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:14,829
has some other ones that go on and put

291
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:17,349
feet here as well as screwing into the

292
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:21,069
back feet so you can move this whole

293
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:23,889
unit down to lay down on its side to use

294
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:24,908
as the elysian research and the gorilla

295
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:29,620
press

296
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:31,630
using the gravity aid as as an extra

297
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:33,778
added bonus so this press does both

298
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:37,990
we're gonna be using it this way today

299
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:41,349
the press is heated and ready to go and

300
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:45,669
I guess well why don't I set up the

301
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:50,638
tripod right on the plates yeah let's

302
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:50,639
see see what we get you there
