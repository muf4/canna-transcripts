00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,519
we're going to make some bubble it's the

6
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,719
first time for me I've made a lot of

7
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:23,759
bubble over the years and I've done it

8
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,759
all over the world but I've never made

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,840
bubble on a boat I've made it on a bus

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,240
with DJ Short and Mark Emory driving

11
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,238
around the city of Vancouver that was

12
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,679
fun at the 2004 tokers Bowl uh I've made

13
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,439
it on the side of mountains I've made it

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,200
in jungles I've made it really all over

15
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,640
the place but we've never done it on the

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,840
water we've been talking about this for

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,439
a while we got the beautiful Sunshine

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,359
Coast behind us where uh pot TV was

19
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,959
based out of in its earlier days um we

20
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,640
got Whistler up north Anvil Island

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,198
behind us along with Gambier and the

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,359
Elfin Stone Mountain behind that really

23
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,119
just a beautiful day we figured let's

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,920
make a little YouTube video and maybe

25
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,158
get some tips out there to the people

26
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,799
that uh haven't really learned the

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,478
proper methods I I don't want to say

28
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,080
techniques because everyone wants to

29
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:11,200
make it their own technique but really

30
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:12,798
it's a simple instruction for doing this

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,840
process and if you follow those simple

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,920
instructions and you use exceptional

33
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,520
material like uh what John has brought

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,159
us here today woo jeez what do we got

35
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,560
here John that's a medy Kush medy Kush

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,640
you know my Str tell us a little bit

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,719
about the medic Kush medic Kush medic

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,439
Kush is a strain that works very well

39
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:34,078
for me at uh came to me back in 2006

40
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:36,438
after I had an accident and it worked

41
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:39,919
very well for medicine for me and it was

42
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:41,319
uh from seed and uh over the years uh

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,079
named it medic Kush it works so well for

44
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,599
a medicine then I uh entered into a

45
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,559
Cannabis Cup in 2011 at Ty treating

46
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,158
yourself and I won first place for ex um

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,719
growing medical cannabis for the medical

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,280
cannabis cup so that was kind of cool

49
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:55,718
really good for pain and spasms I'm

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,000
going to guess huge High TC high CBD

51
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:59,280
very low CBN and as you know the

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,519
triclone development which we've done

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,920
with dry in the past is amazing right

54
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,599
we've been talking about making bubble

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,640
for how long it's been too long too long

56
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,679
and here we are it's probably November

57
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,598
since the Cannabis C oh so of course I

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,318
brought the finest and this is not uh

59
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,878
this isn't this is so you know just to

60
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,280
go back a little bit when John says he's

61
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,598
growing his own medicine John had a

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,598
pretty terrible accident back in 2005

63
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:25,439
2005 right so John I mean I I'll let him

64
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,439

clip of what happened to him so you

66
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,959
understand that when he says he's

67
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,719
growing his medicine he's not talking

68
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,560

00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:05,120
you go um this is the 220 Micron bag all

164
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,478
of our uh cannabis uh and ice is going

165
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,280
to go inside here then we're going to

166
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,199
fill this up with water top it up fill

167
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,279
this up with like packet full of ice and

168
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,720
then we'll we'll mix it for about well

169
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,879
maybe 5 10

170
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,360
minutes by no means will we throw the

171
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,839
herb away afterwards there'll still be

172
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,720
resin left on it but I'm pretty

173
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,799
efficient in my extraction ratio so most

174
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,479
likely he'll be able to just soak it in

175
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,319
a uh a coconut oil and make some nice

176
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,879
metaal with uh what's left over right so

177
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,039
that'll be perfect we'll make that

178
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:37,639
happen with the 220 in

179
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,439
here beautiful evening for doing making

180
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,439
bubble I got to say oh you know what

181
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,839
it's we've been kind of trying to get it

182
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,800
done all day and the whole day just not

183
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,719
happened as days happen push back push

184
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,560
back push back but now perfect look at

185
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,120
this yeah I'm pretty excited about this

186
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,038
this timeline that we've got going on so

187
00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:01,319
I guess what I'll do

188
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:04,399
is get John to put his medic Cush

189
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,840
there and that's about I don't know 150

190
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:09,198
g or so I think a beautiful popcorn nug

191
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,399
I don't know if they want to show them

192
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,319
if maybe I'll get a little closer here

193
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,359
I'm we'll just show you guys you know

194
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,598
what kind of material we're working with

195
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,479
I don't I know the camera's not going to

196
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,120
sort of fix itself but uh I can throw

197
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:24,478
that in there yeah let's see if we can't

198
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,840
get that in there we'll get

199
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,719
that I don't like to you know be too

200
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,159
rough with it because uh you want to

201
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,879
make sure yeah I what you're saying I

202
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,160
want to make sure that uh it doesn't

203
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,199
start falling the resin doesn't start

204
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,439
falling out of the 220 M screen really

205
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,960
so we're going to close this we're going

206
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,120
to move actually there you go hit it

207
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,120
right

208
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,360
there all right

209
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,120
so I would usually make my own ice but

210
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,120
today it was kind of a do what you can

211
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,639
sort of day and uh we ended up buying

212
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,478
ice just from the local uh one of the

213
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,990
local

214
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:08,199
marinas that we were nearby

215
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,199
[Music]

216
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,478
so H that's interesting stereo just

217
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,759
started making sounds let's turn that

218
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:19,000
off all right there we go oh man like

219
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,720
all of a sudden I heard like weird news

220
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,918
and then I heard some bringing me down

221
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,039
we haven't I'd still put more ice in

222
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,000
this many would kind of think I'm insane

223
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:32,718
but po ice can the more ice that you can

224
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,759
yeah it's you know not the best ice so

225
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,560
apparently I'd like to crack this on

226
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,639
something that's not the boat oh there's

227
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,639
a

228
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,639
perfect

229
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,120
whoa

230
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,359
excellent still a good chunk right here

231
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,278
so you fill it right up to the top with

232
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,919
ice is what you're saying I like to fill

233
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,200
it up to the top of I oh you know what

234
00:08:54,919 --> 00:09:00,439
you are uh you're guy so I think uh what

235
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,560
are you saying is fill it up to the top

236
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,240
yeah I mean you might as well fill it

237
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,919
right up you can't get enough of that

238
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,120
ice in there really we want as much ice

239
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,919
in there as possible so that's good

240
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,839
we'll get this zipped up there we go and

241
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:13,919
then uh we have ties that go through the

242
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,240
zipper well that's a smart thing well

243
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:21,360
you know the zipper has been known to

244
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:24,919
open up in the uh mixing motion so we

245
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,240
just close it up I designed this bag as

246
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:29,799
a barrel-shaped bag so it would kind of

247
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,240
fit nice into the uh machine once we get

248
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,838
the water in here you'll see the ice

249
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,320
will melt it'll make a bunch of room for

250
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,320
that herb to start moving

251
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,320
around

252
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:50,278
nice yeah good fun good

253
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,278
fun walking down to the dog coming in

254
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,159
with a cooler everybody's you can smell

255
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:55,360
it was funny oh my God you could smell

256
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,439
it you can smell it on the other side of

257
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,759
this island right now what are you

258
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,160
talking

259
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,720
about open up the back of the truck and

260
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,159
everybody looked yeah so here we go

261
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,800
we're going to get this kind of mixed up

262
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:11,000
mixed in we got beautiful clear water in

263
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,799
here now we did test this a little bit

264
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,639
earlier and we're not going to get the

265
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:18,120
full power that we're expecting so

266
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:22,679
basically I'll I would turn this on

267
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,399
generally for maybe 3 to 6 minutes um

268
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,519
you can always run it for as long as you

269
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,799
want afterwards if you want to do it

270
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,879
another mix if you want to beat it

271
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:31,719
harder whatever but but I'll do like a

272
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,600
6-minute

273
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,720
mix we'll turn that up to 6 minutes and

274
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,159
we'll see if it's going to have the

275
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,160
power to actually spin it I don't think

276
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:43,039
it is which is no problem cuz we're

277
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:46,000
going to spin it we're going to help it

278
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,639
we've got a little hey so bubble man

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,839
here we uh we had a little bit of a of a

280
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,560
problem the inverter wasn't working for

281
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,200
us so here come some waves crashing

282
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,719
around here what we're doing is we're

283
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,040
we're doing the old school redneck

284
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:04,320
method we got the uh the

285
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:05,759
ore and uh we're mixing the medicine up

286
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,480
here we

287
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,958
go if you can see how what color is that

288
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,399
water right now oh God it's like golden

289
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:19,159
beige golden or is that like a dark kind

290
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,519
of it's nice man I kind want to drink

291
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,838
all right well we've done our mixing

292
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,078
we've got a beautiful color water here

293
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,120
in the bubble now we've got the 8ag 5

294
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,399
gallon bubble bag kit sitting in this uh

295
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,240
nice little uh cubed uh container

296
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,159
usually use a bucket but this is kind of

297
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,399
cool I'm digging it so I like cuz we can

298
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,439
see the C and everything you want to

299
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,360
drain that in there Johnny bubble now

300
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,480
has a nice gravity feed drain you just

301
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,360
lift it up off the top dump it into the

302
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,480
bags and uh look at the color that yeah

303
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,240
I wish you could see the color of this

304
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,839
boy that's nice that's cool all right so

305
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,440
common misconception is that you have to

306
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,880
have the water all the way to the top of

307
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,360
the bags not true uh the water's not

308
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:01,039
even a third in here right now it's

309
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,440
because there was so much ice and

310
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,799
material in here which we're just going

311
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,760
to leave in there and bring up to the

312
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,240
house uh later for another run cuz uh

313
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,720
well I didn't get it I didn't have the

314
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,159
bubble now I like it to turn on and and

315
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,240
actually work and because we didn't have

316
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,480
the inverter and it wasn't able to work

317
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,120
I had to hand mix it I'm sure we're

318
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,759
going to get top quality but I bet you

319
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,799
there's a little bit of resin left in

320
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,679
those in those nuggets so we'll be

321
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:27,319
running that again later those nuggets

322
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,399
are full of resin so um at this point um

323
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,399
one thing I I I suggest to people is to

324
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,120
leave the water and the resin combined

325
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,639
for longer than you need to it's easy to

326
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,839
um just kind of get rid of the things

327
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,639
you don't

328
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:45,399
need and get those bags out of the water

329
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,278
so I'm going to lift up this is a 220

330
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,240
bag so it's not really something that I

331
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,720
would normally collect what I would call

332
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,039
a smokable product out of but uh it's a

333
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,079
big enough bag that it's going to catch

334
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,799
something for certain and uh especially

335
00:12:57,078 --> 00:12:59,879
when you're using uh you know nuggets

336
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,679
like that

337
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,639
we can slide this over right to here

338
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,078
then I don't have to I can actually put

339
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,879
it up here for if you want oh this is

340
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:09,599
perfect yeah this is great so there's a

341
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,039
little I don't know maybe a half a gram

342
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,399
of some type of what I would call mostly

343
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,838
contaminant but what I would never tell

344
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,519
a customer to throw away you can use it

345
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,639
for baking it's all usable there's

346
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,679
always medicine available there's going

347
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,240
to be some little headies in there not

348
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,120
not many but

349
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,959
some all right so there's

350
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,959
that

351
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,799
um at this

352
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:37,239
point I do I have to bring this forward

353
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,240
a little bit

354
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,120
more this is just a nice clean water

355
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,639
that I can flip the bags inside out

356
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,919
on and get them clean of all the resin

357
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,240
that's on them immediately this is a

358
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:53,399
pretty important thing to do with your

359
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,919
bags if you want them to last if you

360
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,440
don't care that if they don't last for

361
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:59,958
10 years then you don't have to do this

362
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,880
and they'll just work less and less

363
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:04,799
properly for you and uh yeah I usually

364
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:07,838
just do that and then hang the bag we'll

365
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,120
get that up here for now to be on a boat

366
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,199
so we can just hang that right there so

367
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:16,679
that was the 220 bag next up we have the

368
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:18,240
green bag which is the 190 also really a

369
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,039
bag that I

370
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,879
use to separate out contaminant from the

371
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,480
rest of the bubble but uh lo and behold

372
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:26,600
not surprised this looks pretty darn

373
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,440
blonde and

374
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,879
delicious not a huge amount there but

375
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,639
definitely a nice little

376
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:38,000
ball drop that right on

377
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,919
there oh yeah that's

378
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,039
sugary I'm getting excited if now well

379
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,719
look at that wow not a ton but look at

380
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,958
the color yeah look at the color and the

381
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,680
Purity will be what I would say is 99%

382
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:55,719
hits so normally I don't take the 190

383
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:57,519
and wash the dirty spoon into the 160

384
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,879
however this is exceptional looking

385
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,679
resin so I'll clean that in there

386
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:05,399
and I will do the same thing with the

387
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:08,239
bottom screen from one screen to the

388
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,799
next so we don't have to lose that resin

389
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,799
now because this is resin soaked water

390
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,838
I'll still make my way over to my fresh

391
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:21,278
water and rinse that bag really

392
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:23,639
nicely and that's uh I think those we'll

393
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:27,958
actually take this uh bucket of water

394
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:34,360
and run it later through the

395
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:34,359
um through the bags so no resin is

396
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:43,278
lost all right 220 190 next up the red

397
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,279
bag the

398
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,239
160 it's a little

399
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:53,759
bumpy a little bit bigger maybe twice

400
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,519
the size of the last one maybe not quite

401
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,600
twice the size I'm never overly uh

402
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,440
excited to see large amounts in these

403
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,600
bags so this you know a yield like that

404
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,199
doesn't disappoint

405
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,639
me for too man look at that getting BL

406
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:10,159
and bler of course it will look exactly

407
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,318
what look at the three different colors

408
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,399
they're like that's there's going to be

409
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,879
seven all right so we washed our spoon

410
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,958
in our 120 and then we're going to do

411
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,159
the same with our 160 bag flip it inside

412
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,838
out the best you can without getting

413
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,679
resin all over the actual material do a

414
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,920
quick shaky

415
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:32,719
rinse just real quick

416
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:35,519
and then back over to our freshh water

417
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,399
that we can really clean off these bags

418
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,679
will last you 10 plus years if you just

419
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,480
take care of them and it's it's really

420
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,879
sad to see how many people don't take

421
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,879
care of their

422
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,759
bags all right here we go inside out and

423
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,120
ready to

424
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,720
hang next upop now we're getting into

425
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,480
the good bags John I know now we got a

426
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,278
120 a 90 73 a 40 and a 25 left so I like

427
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,919
the 73 you like the 73 I do for some

428
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:09,160
reason it's Wally I think I'm partial

429
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,038
from the 120 all the way down to the 73

430
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,919
so this is much slower yes of course it

431
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:17,119
is we're going to get a much nicer uh

432
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,559
little blonde color on this one I don't

433
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,479
know what it'll be like for a mount but

434
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:23,879
this the Purity on this is going to be

435
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,400
beautiful and we'll uh make a point on

436
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:31,280
taking some uh some nice

437
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,280
photos so we can

438
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:37,240
uh that's like look at that I I know

439
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:40,319
it's I got to take wow it's darn near

440
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:44,919
Perfection that is a um it's just and

441
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:47,000
that's 120 so camera's probably not

442
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,679
autofocusing for you people at home

443
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,400
which is fine I'll be able to take this

444
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:53,160
home and get a few

445
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,280
pictures that's exciting that's twice as

446
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,360
much as last time now maybe three times

447
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,839
color that's yeah bubble's real

448
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,639
deceiving you know sometimes you think

449
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,720
oh I got so little but uh but when we

450
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,480
did the the dry SI thing on it we know

451
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,159
that

452
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:11,200
was I suspect we'll get a

453
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:14,320
nice return cuz it was such nice

454
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,759
material so continuing to wash each bag

455
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,200
very

456
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:21,200
important rinse them turn them inside

457
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,720
out stop every once in a while for a

458
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,720
Trippy Stick

459
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:32,120
H that that ttin we were floating around

460
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,880
in there yeah well now that the seal is

461
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,439
dry see the bone dryness of it yeah that

462
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,280
is some bone dry herb oh look at the

463
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,600
slow water on that one slow water is

464
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,359
always a good

465
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:45,519
sign means there's something blocking

466
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,519
the

467
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,080
screen oh my goodness that is this is uh

468
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:55,359
this is your favorite actually on your

469
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:58,319
face you just see you had a nice

470
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,759
little it's uh not quite as much as the

471
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:04,839
one 20 but how about that for a

472
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,400
color look how trying to get there go

473
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:09,399
look at how suy that is yeah it's like

474
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,880
Silk it's going to be really

475
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,080
exceptionally I wasn't expecting to get

476
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:18,640
a big one out of that anyways I

477
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:21,379
was go there's more falling off the

478
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,720
leg there we go there we

479
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,000
[Music]

480
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,319
[ __ ] push them back a little bit might

481
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,079
need another SC so they're not touching

482
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:32,678
well I like to have them all together

483
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,720
to show everyone oh that's and then

484
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,240
we'll go right back into this

485
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,079
one yeah we're going to wash it and the

486
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,519
into the 73 we'll just get that washed

487
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,960
washed away

488
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:50,400
clean I like that I've never done that

489
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:53,360
before we're saving monster Hits

490
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,038
just res is just too valuable not to be

491
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,199
saving it on all

492
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:02,079
levels I think this plant's way too

493
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:05,440
valuable be sitting well exactly right

494
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,439
all right Johnny's favorite coming

495
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:12,038
out flowing down flowing down lots of

496
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:12,038
water in this oh I can

497
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:19,919
nice yeah yeah it's in there I

498
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,839
don't I'm I'm watching it from this

499
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,240
side just creamy oh it's going to be

500
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,240
cream

501
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
creamy

502
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,240
it's getting blunder and blunder and

503
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,200
blunder yeah oh yeah very good very good

504
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,918
very

505
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,519
good back into the

506
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,880
45 what's your take on the 45 you like

507
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,119
the 45 well you know what a lot of

508
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,760
people have a lot of different things to

509
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:02,038
say about the 45 the 45 is a funny thing

510
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:03,960
yeah if you let hash snobs know I'll

511
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,359
tell you they don't like it okay when I

512
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,679
tell them the 45 is the 73 or the 90

513
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,479
they love it there's no doubt about it

514
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,120
that it's potent it's not just immature

515
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,599
head there's something going on in in

516
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:17,359
the 45 it's extremely

517
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:21,639
oily so there's a high tpine content in

518
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:23,759
the 45 okay almost always it's really

519
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,600
almost the most accurate generalization

520
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,558
about bubble bags and water extraction

521
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,879
that you can

522
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,639
make and uh yeah I mean it's it's always

523
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,120
a good pull it'll probably be the

524
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,240
biggest pull right now when we pull this

525
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:39,119
45 yeah look at it it's just covered the

526
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,120
whole look at that oh yeah it's actually

527
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,278
on the side there too oh yeah now this

528
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:47,959
will be nice little

529
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:50,640
pull oh my God is it creamy and really

530
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,640
really nice

531
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,519
looking I love how it's all foamy in

532
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:00,719
there and stuff oh yeah fo

533
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:03,839
yeah but I've actually never made bubble

534
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,919
from many Crush before so I I've

535
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:10,399
never how bad that's

536
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:13,919
um now I'm just going to make sure that

537
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,600
we have all the proper room that we

538
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,919
need bubbles such high quality that

539
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:21,599
there's absolutely no problem in just

540
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,120
this like's already drying we sure don't

541
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,798
want to let it sit here for much longer

542
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,798
I'll tell you that

543
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,839
much

544
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:35,119
WoW that's a beautiful 45 that's even

545
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:37,599
Gander yep going to the 25

546
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,359
and5 I was I it was nice that you

547
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,959
explained the 45 bony I never really

548
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,639
thought about it that way

549
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,440
you I just gave some to a friend as a as

550
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,600
a gift a small amount and he at first

551
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,120
just thought oh he's just giving me

552
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:53,158
stuff he doesn't like and he went home

553
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,199
and he had a little little smoke on it

554
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,880
and basically couldn't believe it he was

555
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,759
just like wo what was that that you gave

556
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,600
me thought it was 45

557
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:05,480
yeah there's nothing wrong with 45 it's

558
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:07,199
not like you're giving you know the 190

559
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,159
away or the 220 there that looks like

560
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,038
just absolute pure now here's a bag that

561
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,799
causes a lot of people problems because

562
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:16,158
of the screen is so tight it holds the

563
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:18,240
majority of the water a real easy

564
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,400
process for draining this bag is the

565
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,558
quick lift and then release lift and

566
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,159
release lift and release that's lifting

567
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:28,480
the resin up off of the bottom of the

568
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:31,278
screen that's allowing the water to wash

569
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,360
through the screen so a lot of people if

570
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:36,119
you let this bag just drip it'll

571
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,119
eventually almost

572
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:41,439
stop I've had people leave it on their

573
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,798
you know the bathroom door knob and 32

574
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,120
hours later it's still dripping into the

575
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:50,759
uh into the bucket so definitely a good

576
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:53,959
idea to help this one along take a wh of

577
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:55,720
that Wow Fresh I've never really stuck

578
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,038
my head in there before Oh man it's

579
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,720
awesome cuz it's cold and fresh and nice

580
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:03,200
yeah M really nice ni be careful so now

581
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,798
I'll put this down in the towel this

582
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,960
towel is going to uh absorb a lot of

583
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:10,519
that water it's in it's still in there

584
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,480
want to WRA that towel around

585
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:16,960
me yeah it drips absorbs right I mean

586
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:21,919
it's going toor through my skin

587
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,919
so M look at that very nice very

588
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:35,599
nice all just really really nice looking

589
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:41,720
resin no complaints on that and you know

590
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:46,398
what wow that's um that's

591
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:49,798
impressive 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 four six eight

592
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:52,558
different colors yep blly you can see

593
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,398
such the difference too love the like

594
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,200
the bubbles in it that's like the it

595
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:58,599
looks like the moon huh yeah exactly

596
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,038
when people see that that don't really

597
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:03,639
know they often mistake that for the

598
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,038
honeycomb oil that you know basically

599
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,120
has been purged out and then creates

600
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:13,679
those Honeycombs this is uh just

601
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:16,479
water purging out and uh turning into a

602
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,679
nice honey combed bubble of course we're

603
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,798
not going to leave this this is

604
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,919
extremely wet bubble and we're uh we're

605
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:24,918
still going to break this bubble up

606
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,278
we're not going to be doing it on the

607
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:29,159
boat we decided we'll uh when we get

608
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:34,038
back to the house we'll show you how we

609
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:37,679
uh process the final bit of resin into a

610
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:39,679
powder and how we get it dry after that

611
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,159
cuz that is a specific process it's very

612
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,480
important process and it's once again

613
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,480
something that a lot of people get

614
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,158
wrong all right and a little bit of

615
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,599
bubble as you can see goes a long long

616
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,320
way Che my

617
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,798
brother well we just made a batch of uh

618
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:00,240
bubble I don't know how much is there

619
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:00,240
maybe 10 grams or something hard to say

620
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,640
I think there was easily 10% that was

621
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,359
able to return we should have probably

622
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,799
gotten 15 G so if there is only 10 G

623
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,798
there or eight or whatever it just means

624
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:15,278
that there's eight more sitting in the

625
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:18,278

that's that's really

649
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:25,918
tasty just wait till we smoke the hash

650
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:28,798
John just wait until we smoke the

651
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,480
hash this before I end all right so

652
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:31,679
we're done with that water we've had a

653
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,120
couple of sips and we're just going to

654
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,480
give it back to Mother Nature there's no

655
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,479
more resin in it we've run it all

656
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,599
through the screen so yeah let's get rid

657
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,599
of

658
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:50,119
it look the fish coming on up those fish

659

679
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,399
out hey bubble man here we're just uh we

680
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,440
finished making that batch out on the

681
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,239
boat it was a little bit too windy to

682
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,558
think of breaking the bubble up so what

683
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,159
we did was we uh very lightly dabbed it

684
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,440
in the uh pressing screens which come in

685
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:02,559
the bubble bag kit you get three in a 5

686
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:06,640
gallon uh in a 5 gallon kit and this is

687
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:08,759
basically um to gently uh when we take

688
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,440
the the bubble out of the out of the

689
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:12,038
bags we place it inside the pressing

690
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,480
screen I usually like to do it in a nice

691
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:16,440
row so I can see all my conss and then I

692
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,159
merely have towel underneath and towel

693
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,399
over top and I I gently dab the water

694
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:24,240
out now depending on the quality of the

695
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:27,199
bubble you'll want to leave more water

696
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,558
present for um a quality of resin that

697
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,440
is extremely hot

698
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,599
that resin will self press and bond and

699
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,038
trap moisture in the resin and I think

700
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:36,678
it's why a lot of the uh people are

701
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:39,519
using this microplaning technique I find

702
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,600
that um if you've over pressed or over

703
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,359
dabbed or allowed the resin to self

704
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,678
press in any way which we obviously did

705
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:48,199
because we were out on the boat we had

706
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,000
to leave it in uh in the moist Patty and

707
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,278
then we brought it up and I just froze

708
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,240
it um that resin is at this point not

709
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,880
going to work through the strainer I

710
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,640
usually use a little bit larger of a

711
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,200
strainer than this with even larger

712
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,200
holes and with a spoon I place the Patty

713
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,600
in there and I gently uh push it through

714
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,679
and it basically falls out as a perfect

715
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,398
powder as long as I let it fall very

716
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,399
thinly spread on the

717
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:14,839
cardboard cuz let's keep in mind this

718
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:17,158
there's a lot of moisture in this resin

719
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:19,199
it's completely soak and wet and the

720
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,720
real plan is to get it out in the best

721
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,240
way possible without affecting the resin

722
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,480
so there's a variety of uh schools of

723
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,599
thought on this process uh I'm one of

724
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,558
the old schoolers that just break it up

725
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,359
into powder through the strainer uh

726
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,240
there's no grinding involved so the

727
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:36,158
heads are completely intact not that I

728
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,159
can't say that the heads aren't intact

729
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,039
when you grind Frozen resin but uh um

730
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,240
well we'll photograph this resin once

731
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,720
we've uh once we've dried it out I'll

732
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,359
photograph it with my macro lens and

733
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,480
I'll see if there's any difference than

734
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,398
the resin I look at that's through here

735
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,640
nonetheless they both work they both do

736
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:53,398
the job what they're doing is they're

737
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,600
breaking up the bubble into a really

738
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:58,439
nice spread thin surface area which then

739
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:00,519
allow

740
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,200
the bubble to properly dry now maybe

741
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,759
down in California and Arizona you can

742
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,399
dry bubble properly like that on on wax

743
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:08,480
paper or on parchment paper that they're

744
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,479
using but I prefer for the rest of the

745
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,440
world uh especially places where the

746
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,599
moisture content is high in the air uh

747
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,759
that you use a desicant and I just use a

748
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,839
cardboard this is no special cardboard

749
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,919
it's just a double thick corrugated

750
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:26,918
cardboard um food grade so that it's not

751
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,000
you know soaked in chemicals and

752
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,278
basically

753
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,599
this is the cardboard I use and the

754
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:34,638
cardboard acts as a desicant uh it pulls

755
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,839
the moisture out of the wet bubble

756
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:39,278
rather than thinking that it can air dry

757
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:41,079
I just for years uh dried my bubble

758
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,759
improperly and and couldn't believe how

759
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,038
actually difficult it was to get bubble

760
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:46,200
to properly dry so I'm not saying one's

761
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:47,839
better than the other if you use the

762
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,798
micr planer and and you're getting your

763
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,319
bubble dry and it's you know you're a

764
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:53,558
connoisseur and you know the quality

765
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:55,759
then that's great and uh otherwise the

766
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:58,000
strainer works really good as well and

767
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,038
in fact I have the fresh Bubble from uh

768
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,038
yesterday that we ran on the

769
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:03,038
boat

770
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:12,240
and so let's see for instance here's the

771
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,919
uh here's the 190 quality just run that

772
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,359
real quick through the through the

773
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,120
microplane and

774
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:21,319
it'll fall on the cardboard as a nice

775
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:24,000
powder definitely working good but it

776
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:26,158
definitely feels like it's grinding up

777
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,679
I'm used to just pushing it through so

778
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,000
this bubbles nice and Frozen I've got it

779
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,679
in cooler here and uh it's amazing that

780
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,720
this 190 actually

781
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:40,720
looks uh to be a decent quality because

782
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,759
um it well it just never is and by

783
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,519
decent I say absolute crap for a

784
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,278
connoisseur but still something that's

785
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:50,000
actually smokable by by most

786
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:53,119
people so that broke it up into a nice

787
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,679
powder I would say that normally because

788
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,959
I'm just doing filming here alone I

789
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:58,559
would normally use much more cardboard

790
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,038
uh even for a small amount of bubble

791
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,079
like this I would usually probably

792
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:04,278
spread it throughout this whole section

793
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,038
but I'm going to want to show you uh the

794
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:08,798
grinding of all the different

795
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:11,398
grades the microplaning and so I figured

796
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:13,879
uh that's a real nice White Rock that's

797
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:13,879
the

798
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:21,480
160 we'll just run that through there

799
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,480
really nice color pretty much

800
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,320
white there we

801
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:32,158
go

802
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,039
micr pler cleans quite nice I think the

803
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,399
fact that the resin is Frozen is

804
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:40,599
key because um yeah it cleans off real

805
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,479
nice even for a high quality resin you

806
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:46,558
give it one good whack and it's almost

807
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,120
90% clear of of any uh of any resin left

808
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:52,079
on there so we'll just make sure this

809
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:54,759
190 is far away from our

810
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:57,319
120 so what we got

811
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:59,839
190 160 that's actually a mistake that

812
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:01,038
first one was from the 220 bag that's

813
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,439
what happened

814
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:06,000
220

815
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,358
190 and then we'll put the 160 right

816
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,960
here the 160 looks even better than the

817
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:15,199
190 did really nice White Rock of bubble

818
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,760
and that of course is due to the fact

819
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,439
that we froze it almost immediately and

820
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,480
when you freeze it

821
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,918
uh well you're not getting any more

822
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,440
degradation you're not getting any

823
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:28,838
oxidization you're not getting any light

824
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,800
put it in there in a nice dark

825
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:34,799
container and this is

826
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,800
absolutely

827
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:45,279
blonde bubble is very

828
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:45,279
Frozen very

829
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:56,078
Frozen all right so that's a real nice

830
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,119
color can't wait to get that under the

831
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,200
lens because there's moisture content in

832
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,480
the bubble and it's so sticky that even

833
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,719
with a little bit of wind that I'm

834
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,960
getting back here right now I'm not

835
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,598
overly worried about it we've had a

836
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,960
couple of good wind gusts and uh once

837
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,519
the resin hits the cardboard it's

838
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,838
basically uh it's not going to come off

839
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:17,960
until it's dry now and because we broken

840
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:19,440
it up into a nice powder um it will come

841
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,800
off the cardboard nicely I'll show you

842
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,358
when it's dried as long as I don't put

843
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,839
it in some heated space uh it should

844
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:28,440
come off the cardboard just beautifully

845
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:31,400
so now we've got the 120 with not a lot

846
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,480
of room to dry it we're probably going

847
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:38,358
to end up taking some of the 90 space up

848
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,358
cuz this 120 is really

849
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,800
nice just white in

850
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,079
color now I might uh make be making some

851
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:59,559
of you laugh out there I don't know I'm

852
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:01,039
not micr planer I've never really uh I

853
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:03,480
mean I've done this a handful of times

854
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,880
obviously but not to the point where

855
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,280
I've gotten comfortable and come up with

856
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,559
my own techniques with it I'm pretty

857
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,720
comfortable with the

858
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:15,318
strainer that's how I like to do

859
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:17,919
it all right so that one 120

860
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:19,679
literally took up the

861
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,119
rest

862
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:24,960
of the cardboard so we'll just scratch

863
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,760
out the rest of

864
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,920
those and we'll move on to the next next

865
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,280
one I've got uh obviously the 90 the 73

866
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,119
the 45 and the 25 and I'll basically be

867
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,560
doing the same process over the

868
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,720
cardboard and uh I'll get photos of the

869
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:42,838
whole uh microscopic process of what's

870
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:44,759
going on the resin um definitely looks

871
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:48,358
as though it's been shredded to

872
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,119
me but uh we'll see with the macro lens

873
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:52,440
in just a little while here thanks for

874
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:52,440
joining

875
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,519
us give you a quick show of uh this

876
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,599
resin you you see the one in the bottom

877
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:03,159
corner there that's the actual 220 we

878
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:05,240
used a 220 bag in the bubble now but a

879
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:06,719
little bit of contaminant got through

880
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:08,439
and the tiniest little bit of resin is

881
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,399
actually in there and then the rest of

882
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,240
it is basically almost so blonde that

883
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:18,318
you can't even see it on the cardboard

884
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:18,318
but I assure you there's a a fair bit

885
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:26,519
there all right so this is the

886
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:28,799
last one the 25 this one's the

887
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:32,119
45 grab that out of

888
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,240
there and a quick little microp plane

889
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:38,240
later this bubble is really nice

890
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:38,239
color

891
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,680
blonde definitely not on my microplane

892
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:54,199
game here a little bit of little bit of

893
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,559
bumps always running out of cardboard as

894
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:59,439
almost every Bubblehead does when you're

895
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,440
using this method

896
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,559
all right that's some beautiful 25

897
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,519
micron

898
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:17,039
wow B on my

899
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:17,039
fingers it's just starting to get

900
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,759
sticky great looking bubble
