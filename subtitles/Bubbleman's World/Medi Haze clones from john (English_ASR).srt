37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm really doing is I'm cutting at an

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,000
angle about a

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:42,240
45Â° dipping it in Remo's cloning

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,200
gel and then inserting gently into the

41
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,718
puck and there you have it three nice

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
clones so I'm also going to cut the tips

43
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:53,478
of the

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,479
leaves just because they tend to

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,680
uh they tend to get in the

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,200
way

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,200
in the cloning

48
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,679
