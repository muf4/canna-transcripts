1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,278
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

2
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,920
and uh welcome to the house sound man

3
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:29,719
Sun is going down and it was so

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,480
beautiful I thought I want to share it

5
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:36,799
with uh with my YouTube uh family so up

6
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,519
goes the phone in goes the case I ran

7
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,038
around a little bit like a maniac trying

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,120
to catch it before the sun went down but

9
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,640
I thought what I would do is for those

10
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:45,359
of you that follow uh me on Facebook uh

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,558
at

12
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,359
bubbleman um you saw that I was cleaning

13
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:52,759
some dry sift today so I've got myself a

14
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,320
little bit of dry sift here three little

15
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:57,479
varieties there people were asking

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,518
what's what um these are two both from

17
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,839
the same I clean this contaminant out of

18
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,118
this this this is really nice and melty

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,320
um and it's a hash plant this one over

20
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:09,200
here was a little bit of Barb that I had

21
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,478
left not not the best Barb but a long uh

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,000
I think it was a a 1our spin so I

23
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:15,519
cleaned a tiny little bit about about

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,759
out of that as well and it's mostly pure

25
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,399
heads there might be a little bit of a

26
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,879
hair or some contaminant here and there

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,719
if I get under it with the scope but all

28
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,158
in

29
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,920
all quite happy with everything so once

30
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,400
again as I've shown many times on uh on

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,359
Bubble man's world you see this is my

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,399
dry SI

33
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:36,560
and you see that when I turn it upside

34
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:38,719
down that it's stable you see that that

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,719
is stable powder and I just put this on

36
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,599
here I don't know maybe a couple hours

37
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,118
ago and of course what's most impressive

38
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,438
is that you can see that it's just

39
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,640
powder as I scoop up a giant dab got the

40
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,559
egg right

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,000
here and uh well why don't you guys grab

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,840
a piece grab your rig and let's do a

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,840
little the Sun is setting

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
rip

45
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:34,238
oh hey had my my head turned over so you

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,280
couldn't see but closed both my eyes

47
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,480
that

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,120
rip really lovely

49
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,959
enjoyable such a great time to be out uh

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,759
in the house Sound area every time uh at

51
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,000
around this time as the sun's going down

52
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:51,039
it just seems like the water always

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,959
calms right down if it was a a Blustery

54
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,280
Day windy day um the the the the waves

55
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,439
kind of chill right out and you can see

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,640
out on the water that the waves are

57
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:03,919
quite calm right now

58
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,119
got a helicopter flying by here in a bit

59
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,158
maybe we better do a helicopter dab what

60
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,400
do you guys

61
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:12,120
say try some of that barb nice little

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,959
big dab of the

63
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,480
barbola M with the sun behind it that's

64
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,519
nice so we got quite a bit of helicopter

65
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,280
traffic up here as I am on the way up to

66
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,280
Whistler anyone that's flying to

67
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,360
Whistler in a helicopter goes right past

68
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,680
my house and then of course we have

69
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,720
search and rescue in the area seems to

70
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,920
be that yellow helicopter is out more

71
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:34,919
often than we would like to hear

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,680
it yeah unfortunately people get lost in

73
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,959
the mountains up here all too

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,959
often they go into the back country

75
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,239
without the proper gear uh they don't

76
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,360
let people know that they're going into

77
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,079
the back country and these are all

78
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,319
things that when you live in an area

79
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,640
like British Columbia but it's very

80
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,318
important that you do these simple

81
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,238
things that you leave a note or a phone

82
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:07,919
call or a message or tell someone

83
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,120
directly where you're where you're going

84
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,719
cuz you can get hypnotized by the Beauty

85
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,200
and the problem with getting hypnotized

86
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,519
by the beauty is it can get deadly

87
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,358
pretty darn fast so I wouldn't be

88
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,439
surprised if the way this helicopter is

89
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,959
flying that it's going to be the yellow

90
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:24,120
search and rescue

91
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,560
helicopter well fingers crossed we did

92
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,439
just have a girl on Whistler Mountain

93
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,038
gone for 3 days she went into the

94
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,639
backside of crystal chair down blackholm

95
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:36,000
ended up into the back country of the

96
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,360
singing past which is OBO cowboy and

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,839
eventually she ended up on Wedge

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,160
Mountain which was two whole mountain

99
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:44,198
ranges over uh up on the way to pton so

100
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,120
pretty scary very happy that she that

101
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,600
that story ended the way it did and the

102
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,759
reason that story ended the way it did

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,400
is because we haven't had a winter we

104
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,120
just have not been getting snow we've

105
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,560
been getting precipitation but we've got

106
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,240
such warm weather that it's uh it's just

107
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,000
affecting some of the winter fun as you

108
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,000
guys have probably seen my channel would

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
have a lot a lot more snowmobiling and a

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,680
lot more snowboarding and ski flying and

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,360
all these things if the snow was up

112
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,560
there for us to enjoy

113
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,800
