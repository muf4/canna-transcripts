2
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,778
hey guys bone man here a beautiful snowy

3
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,460
day here in British Columbia once again

4
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:31,079
thought I would do a little bit of a dry

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,058
set so pulled out the dry sift table the

6
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:37,019
great gardener Matt was here earlier he

7
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:39,269
dropped off some cannot spotted this big

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,190
bag of sift here it's pretty clean

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,559
actually no not not terrible terrible

10
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:46,500
quality but a little bit puffy when you

11
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,328
see the bag smoke like that when you get

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,799
the sift floating in the air there's a

13
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,530
lot of stuff in there that's light so

14
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,869
it's pretty soft too so we're going to

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,549
take this we're going to clean it up

16
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:58,589
because I'm using only the single clean

17
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,578
screen right now I've also got my little

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,989
field master it's about a 500 micron and

19
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:06,299
what I'm going to do with that isn't

20
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:08,908
going to drop a little bit of hash in

21
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,189
there and push it through with the card

22
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,020
so when it falls onto this screen it's

23
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:14,819
just nice and even for me and I can use

24
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:17,849
the card to sort of card back and forth

25
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,779
so snow is falling on my screen right

26
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:25,618
now so we're gonna have to figure this

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:29,750
out all right so hey I guess I'm gonna

28
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,750
go get my card and come in handy

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,170
okay welcome back guys

30
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:47,759
basically was unable to film in the

31
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,519
other situation the snow is literally

32
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,140
the line is right here and when the wind

33
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,399
picks up it comes in and it goes on the

34
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,129
screen so although I want to be outside

35
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,859
for you guys I have to pick my position

36
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,359
well so basically this is just another

37
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,099
quick little dry sifting video I know

38
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,329
you guys have seen me do this great

39
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,030
gardener came and dropped off some

40
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,939
catatonic it's probably about a couple

41
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,618
ounces here two or three ounces I've got

42
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:12,959
my single 70 micron screen that we're

43
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:15,090
going to be carting over and lately

44
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,569
instead of just dropping some of the

45
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,729
resin down what I've been doing is I've

46
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:23,429
been using my little field master which

47
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:26,068
is a 250 to 500 micron this particular

48
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,159
ones 500 and I just put a tiny little

49
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:30,689
bit of the catatonic in here you know I

50
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:35,459
don't want to be working too much at a

51
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:37,859
time right there I've also got a piece

52
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,539
of cardboard two pieces of cardboard the

53
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,370
big kind of silly one is just to keep

54
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,019
the one that I put down from getting wet

55
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,370
and then I've got an actual flat piece

56
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,629
of cardboard that fits my screen

57
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:50,489
perfectly so basically using the iTunes

58
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:53,819
card that mr. Darrin taught us about

59
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,500
we're just going to gently push this

60
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,969
through the 500 micron screen I can

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,280
already see a ton of hairs things

62
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:04,500
gathering on this screen that basically

63
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,019
should stay out of the hash quite

64
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,750
something actually let me see if I can

65
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:13,980
show you guys what we're left with there

66
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,299
hand side that little little guy so you

67
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:16,768
can really see there's still some heads

68
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:23,819
in there but the majority of it is

69
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:26,969
actually pistol hairs still a couple

70
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:30,810
more little blue balls of sift on here I

71
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:33,989
don't want to push the hairs through so

72
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:37,259
more gentle you are the batter and then

73
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:39,719
usually at the end I just bang it I put

74
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:43,679
it in this corner here that's sort of

75
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,150
like my somewhat contaminant it's almost

76
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,090
all hairs I've never actually seen that

77
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,760
this is quite a little effective tool

78
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,189
give it a little blow there's a lot of

79
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:56,568
red hairs in this product it's going to

80
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:59,848
definitely be something else to to fix

81
00:03:56,568 --> 00:04:03,238
so we're just going to card this resin

82
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:06,780
back and forth gently and with a nice

83
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,580
big card we're going to be pushing all

84
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,949
these little system repairs and pistol

85
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,600
hairs and stigmas and such we're going

86
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,599
to be pushing right through this screen

87
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:19,219
give you a little bit of a closer look

88
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:39,000
alright so a little bit of the closer

89
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:40,769
look so you can see here how how that

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,639
crumbled up like that we want to kind of

91
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:47,549
work these larger hairs out of our pile

92
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:49,918
get left something along these lines two

93
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,449
cards or resin back and forth and of

94
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:56,519
course when we're carding the resin back

95
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:58,680
and forth we're creating friction so try

96
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,918
to keep your card clean don't let it get

97
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,720
dirty and try to keep the pieces that

98
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,389
you clean out of your card over to the

99
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,950
side because any little any little

100
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,180
things that don't want to go through are

101
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:13,379
only going to interrupt and cause

102
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:16,530
problems so I'll be carding here for a

103
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:21,779
little while to come back when we can

104
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:23,959
show you what we've got left on the

105
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,959
screen

106
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:42,220
all right so we have quite a bit of red

107
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:45,250
hair in this stigmas pistol it's so what

108
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:49,599
I've done is I've put my 220 on top of

109
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:51,848
my 500 the 250 sorry and so what I'm

110
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:55,300
doing is just a real light sifting to

111
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:56,378
try and catch those hairs is there's

112
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,228
quite a few of them and they're making

113
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,250
it very hard carding so we've got the

114
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:04,389
two back together

115
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:10,689
this is a really gentle sorta you can

116
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:17,110
see it falling clean you can give it a

117
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:21,728
little one of these even card or gently

118
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:24,098
brush and so this is doing is its it's

119
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:25,750
leaving the red hairs on top of the

120
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:26,860
tighter screen most of them don't get me

121
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:32,069
wrong a lot are still going through

122
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,069
because I'm not being overly gentle here

123
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:39,520
you can see as I give it the wok you can

124
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:43,120
see that gold colour disappearing or

125
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:50,038
that red colour orangie colour of the

126
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,038
hairs appearing so nice light

127
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:02,890
a lot of contaminant a lot of stigmas

128
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:06,829
and pistol at hares and simple as just

129
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:09,139
being very gentle you know push those

130
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:13,689
heads through lovable balls or breaking

131
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:21,099
up as I do this gentle process whack

132
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:26,750
down and we'll see we're at about 90% of

133
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:30,680
stigmas let's see if we can't zoom in on

134
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,060
that and show you very contaminated as

135
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,540
opposed to this stuff here that we're

136
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:40,240
about to card and this here has been

137
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:44,000
already carted so we're making headway

138
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:48,079
all right so just doing the light to

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,550
screen gently brushing through the resin

140
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:54,829
night you can see I've clean I'm getting

141
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:57,590
a lot of the red hairs out and so as you

142
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:59,899
can see I've got a couple of clean piles

143
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:02,389
here all I've done is stack the 250 and

144
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:04,609
the 500 and I've just been gently

145
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:07,519
brushing the resin through this screen

146
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,830
I've piled up a bunch of red hairs here

147
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,099
which you can see there's quite a few of

148
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:15,680
them not sure how much cleaner I'm going

149
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,770
to try to get this it's it's producing a

150
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,780
lot of contaminants so it's making for

151
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:23,769
difficult cleaning to say the least I

152
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:25,849
think I'll just put all of this here

153
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,199
still quite a bit of glands and now

154
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:30,169
that's actually gone a little more gold

155
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,509
and now and then you can see on the

156
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:35,360
bottom of this screen it's about to

157
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:39,588
release the resin so I'm gonna get

158
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:47,720
carding these guys a little bit off here

159
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:50,680
and yeah a little those hairs out and

160
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:55,059
I'll start carding this and

161
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:57,669
we'll get back to you that's going

162
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:59,769
through real nice so you see once you

163
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:03,248
get once it goes through so nice and you

164
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:06,610
get this real nice color you can kind of

165
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:07,928
move that on up to this other work pile

166
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,999
here and I'm just going to keep doing

167
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:11,740
the same thing gently carting through

168
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:13,178
the contaminants and at the end I'll

169
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,519
lift the screen and I'll show you what's

170
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:17,698
on the cardboard so I'm gonna keep on it

171
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,698
here

172
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:41,278
[Music]

173
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:53,160
[Music]

174
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:34,870
just pushing the golden color through

175
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:40,029
and eventually getting left with mostly

176
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:43,090
just the red hairs stigmas bottom on the

177
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:48,730
brush a lot of them contaminating the

178
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:50,620
screen you want to keep this as clean as

179
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:55,470
we can and it's very difficult with

180
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,470
these little guys but nothing a little

181
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:11,430
nothing a little brush won't fix all

182
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,429
right so

183
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:24,820
[Music]

184
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,899
super important to keep your tools clean

185
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,990
when you're using tools you can use the

186
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,789
bubble box screens for this I mostly use

187
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,049
these because they're metal and it just

188
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:39,389
seemed to make sense today while I'm

189
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:41,849
doing this that hippie as cold as

190
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:44,330
possible and then there's the tray of

191
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:47,550
the nicely lightly sifted

192
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:54,180
we'll just get that card out and we will

193
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:56,250
once again carve the resin this is just

194
00:11:54,179 --> 00:12:03,389
kind of an extra thing I'm adding here

195
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:05,759
in order to remove these red hairs hey

196
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:11,069
guys just finishing up this can of tonic

197
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:13,679
I've managed to clean the hairs out and

198
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,710
I'm slowly cleaning I've got a couple of

199
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,029
piles of heads on top here I just sort

200
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,100
of did a better version on these ones

201
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,659
than those ones and then there's going

202
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,940
to be still I mean really these are

203
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,529
basically the same thing carded on top

204
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,210
of the screen under the screen is the

205
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:29,370
majority of what was in this bag and

206
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:33,350
here we go for the last of what was in

207
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,350
this bag just dump that right in there

208
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,379
you get resin on your hands leaned it

209
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,379
off gently

210
00:12:42,409 --> 00:13:03,089
[Music]

211
00:12:44,460 --> 00:13:05,600
I always clean it up all right do some

212
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:11,700
gentle gentle gentle

213
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:14,009
brushing isn't gentle and basically this

214
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,870
is a method I've been using to clean out

215
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:18,240
red hairs I don't use this method all

216
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,000
the time this particular batch for

217
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:27,500
whatever reason was just covered in in

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:34,259
the stigmas so we got to get rid of them

219
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:35,789
that's what I say we don't need them and

220
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:37,110
I'll try to clean this pile at the end

221
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:40,250
as well see if we can't run these

222
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,250
through the screens gently in

223
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:58,220
alright we got a little bit here to

224
00:13:48,620 --> 00:14:00,250
clean yes these hairs on the way even a

225
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:04,639
light little breath we'll take them away

226
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:08,028
so just nice and gentle parting this

227
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,579
resin back and forth when you can see

228
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:12,438
right away it pushes a lot through once

229
00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:14,208
you get it clean if you put it on too

230
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:16,250
dirty these little stigmas these little

231
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:18,489
hairs they're gonna keep it from

232
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,490
happening

233
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,889
so wouldn't take you too long this is

234
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:30,139
basically what I've been doing the whole

235
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:31,850
time going back and forth and I can

236
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:35,110
already see a nice color change on this

237
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,110
this color is already nice

238
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:48,810
all right I'm gonna continue on here and

239
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:51,330
we'll catch you guys in a little bit all

240
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:54,449
right so we've gotten ourselves a couple

241
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:56,759
of piles here these are my two carded

242
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,980
piles I carted this one the longest of

243
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,720
the nicest I usually like go with color

244
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,159
I have a little microscope as well that

245
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,620
I can use and get down right in there

246
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,208
and see this one was a pure wave here I

247
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,669
went with carding today I've been

248
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:12,239
working here for over an hour and a half

249
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:15,349
now so what I managed to get was a giant

250
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,350
pile of systole

251
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:22,679
some I'd say about 90% heads and then

252
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,629
some 95 plus percent heads so with

253
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:29,009
carding that's pretty darn good we can

254
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:32,100
lift up this little guy here go drop

255
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:35,100
them off gently right here keep him out

256
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,350
of the rain and whatnot we want to show

257
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,450
you what the majority of that material

258
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,430
was because it was a pretty big bag that

259
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,890
we had going on there I'm gonna show you

260
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:46,129
a little bit closer so you can really

261
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:49,799
see what we're working with here

262
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:53,939
contamination wise we got a decent

263
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:56,699
amount of it and this is definitely not

264
00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:00,029
for my pipe it's probably why there were

265
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:02,459
so few full-size heads in this catatonic

266
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:07,799
I suspect there's still a lot of heads

267
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:11,879
in here in the 45 to 50 micron range but

268
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:15,359
I managed to get out all the ones above

269
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:17,389
70 which is what you can do as well with

270
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,120
these screening techniques that I share

271
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:23,730
so if you have any questions you can

272
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,720
always reach me oh man double-bag calm

273
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:30,659
i'm also on you know kick @vc bubble man

274
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:34,889
I'm on my facebook page at bubble man

275
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:36,850
Freddie's and yeah we're easy to get in

276
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:39,399
touch with

277
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:55,090
for a bit rest of that back into the can

278
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:58,689
tonic bag I mean once again always comes

279
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:03,759
in handy if you got your little little

280
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:08,200
brush it's just that next level of

281
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,640
cleanliness really clean up this is

282
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,440
contaminant so it's not really as

283
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,780
important but sometimes when you're

284
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:18,850
picking up your pure headies it's nice

285
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:20,980
to know that you're getting them all so

286
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:22,839
I didn't weigh that at the beginning I

287
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,299
guess I could have but no worries

288
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:28,419
because I can weigh it now and basically

289
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:44,549
it's the exact same weight I'll separate

290
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:44,550
it into a few piles your head ease

291
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:55,529
almost pier head ease I don't think

292
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:55,529
there's a nice looking rip of fairness

293
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:08,710
a big old pile of crap we shoot red

294
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:15,339
hairs and crap now there is some heads

295
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:17,230
in here that will get one last run and

296
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:21,069
here we have complete and total talcum

297
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:24,190
powder get one it's a saline bottle

298
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:29,259
it's uh just contaminant let's bury the

299
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:33,309
lens st about a rough one

300
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:37,629
so I go give ocean sea breeze we got our

301
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:39,379
number one grade we call it first we got

302
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,699
our number two grade

303
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,699
[Music]

304
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:53,418
see if we can get the actual light on it

305
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:54,709
it's not that easy so that's a decent

306
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:58,340
quality right there

307
00:18:54,710 --> 00:19:01,038
pretty pretty clear with heads and that

308
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:02,778
is our second grade we have our third

309
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,628
right here which is the talcum powder

310
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:09,618
and then even worse than the talcum

311
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:11,388
powder we have called our fourth and

312
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:14,478
this was an extra process that I had to

313
00:19:11,388 --> 00:19:17,898
do just to clean this schwag out of the

314
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:21,889
hash so let's end your dry so people to

315
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:26,238
dry sips got the edge to it you got a

316
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:28,349
lot of work to do anyway so there's a

317
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:41,900
catatonic one two three and four

318
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:41,899
