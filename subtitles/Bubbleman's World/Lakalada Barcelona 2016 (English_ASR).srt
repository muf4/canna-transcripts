[Music]

10
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:49,399
beautiful yeah not cheap you you do

11
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:51,679
realize that you either have to change

12
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,198
the name or start paying a big

13
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:57,039
Buddha oh yeah that's

14
00:00:54,198 --> 00:01:00,280
right we're calling it The Jackie

15
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:08,759
emal I think 8 G or something like this

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:10,719
80 8 G 8 zero 8 8 G and from 2 kilo of

17
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:16,519
yeah that's

18
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:20,680
it so that's 4% yeah

19
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:22,399
right 4% less than 1% that makes sense

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,000
for the just what you want yeah that

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,799
makes sense for the

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,680
quality can I I've been doing this for

23
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:34,159
many many many many many years and uh I

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,280
never got more than about 1% sometimes

25
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,880
I'd get.

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,920
1% so but it didn't matter to me because

27
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,078
I I had hundreds of kilos of ganas

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,600

because the stronger they're so [ __ ]

50

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,040
on camera what how you started to do

55
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:57,479
this okay so the story of this brand so

56
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:00,199
is a Jo inventor between uh so Italian

57
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:04,318
guy and polish guy nice and so we decide

58
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:08,238
to create this brand he provide for us

59
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:11,518
OA Loa and Willy Wonka we put together

60
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,519
with the design and also the card

61
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,759
packaging and everything looks really

62
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:21,158
nice now we try to improve the brand and

63
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:22,959
uh so 75 Mig of THC damn dude this is

64
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:25,199
almost a gram right here this guy this

65
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,158
pure Mo this is not healthy this is

66
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:32,759
Magic the other one is so I like that

67
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:35,399
magic mu set is chocolate so we like we

68
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,239
now create also a new line with

69
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,959
CPD and we will like also create a vegan

70
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,319
chocolate vegan line but really really

71
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,959
healthy with inside only

72
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:49,878
pure product and that's it and so one of

73
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,799
the idea is also select different kind

74
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:54,560
of chocolate so the dark chocolate both

75
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:58,840
dark chocolate was made with

76
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,840
the the first one is uh Ivory cost from

77
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,360
Ivory cost the 72 one is from my coost

78
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,560
and the other one is the 58 is from

79
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,239
Guatemala so in the other one the white

80
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:15,000
one and the milk one is a good selection

81
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:18,918
of uh nice chocolate with so different

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
