2
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:23,699
all right so we're just pulling the 25

3
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,000
micron here you can see it right here

4
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,170
it's taking its time it's pretty soupy

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,250
if he moves it around with a spoon there

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,320
you see there's still quite a bit of

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,320
water so we're gonna try the vacuum here

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,289
Matt brought over the vacuum back

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,329
Rhoni and we're gonna stick it into the

10
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:42,420
bottom of the bucket here through this

11
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,509
little hole and we're going to see if we

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:50,510
can't suck the air bubbles in the extra

13
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:50,509
water out of this out of this house

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,969
but we have success people that was very

15
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:18,489
successful

16
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:20,650
it sucked show them that that is like I

17
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:24,489
mean it was almost too much almost

18
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:26,080
pulled it through we yeah okay so when

19
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:28,569
doing this you don't want to do it quite

20
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,030
that that hard right it's a little thing

21
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:33,069
we can use water and clean that so just

22
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,540
wipe off the initial amount with the

23
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:36,279
spoon and then we'll use a little bit of

24
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,080
water to pull it back into the middle

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,159
and Wow

26
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,599
so I guess we're gonna have to use a

27
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,269
little bit of horsepower there's not

28
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:46,149
quite efficient though at work right

29
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,949
there see you later all right

30
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:50,290
all right so we bought it we poured a

31
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:55,020
tiny little bit of water just to show

32
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,020
you that we didn't mock it up the

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,680
yeah we're gonna bring the vacuum back

34
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:10,000
over and we gonna suck this water out

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:12,810
for you don't seal it quite as well this

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,810
time we'll let you know

37
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,270
that's enough all right now to try to

38
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:25,969
get that out how that works pretty darn

39
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,850
well I mean if we used a sharper tool

40
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:43,189
that's almost perfect

41
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:43,189
